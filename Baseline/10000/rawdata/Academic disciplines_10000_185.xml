      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5392">The '''Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute''' (later the '''Göring Institute''') was founded in 1920 to further the science of [[psychoanalysis]] in [[Berlin]].  Its founding members included [[Karl Abraham]] and [[Max Eitingon]].  The scientists at the institute furthered [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work but also challenged many of his ideas.

==History==
The Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute grew from the Psychoanalytic Polyclinic (''psychoanalytische Poliklinik'') founded in February 1920. The Polyclinic allowed access to psychoanalysis by low-income patients. Only some 10% of its income came from patients' fees; the rest was provided personally by Max Eitingon. It introduced the three-column model or 'Eitingon model' for the training of analysts (theoretical courses, personal analysis, first patients under supervision) which was later adopted by most other training centers. In 1925, Eitingon became chair of the new International Training Committee of the [[International Psychoanalytic Association]]. The Eitingon model remains standard today.&lt;ref name="Rolnik"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |title=Freud in Zion |first=Eran J. |last=Rolnik |publisher=Karnak |location=London |year=2012 |isbn=978 1 78049 053 3 |page=73 |origyear=2007 in Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute itself was founded in 1923. [[Ernst Simmel]], [[Hanns Sachs]], [[Franz Alexander]], [[Sándor Radó (psychoanalyst)|Sándor Radó]], [[Karen Horney]], [[Siegfried Bernfeld]], [[Otto Fenichel]], [[Theodor Reik]], [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Melanie Klein]] were among the many psychoanalysts who worked at the Institute.

As a Jew, Eitingon's position became precarious after the [[Nazism|Nazi]] ascent to power in 1933. Freud's books were burned in Berlin. By then some members had already left Berlin for the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Rolnik (2012), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Eitingon resigned in August 1933; he later moved to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and founded the [[Palestine Psychoanalytic Association]] in 1934 in [[Jerusalem]]. The Palestine Association saw itself as the heir of the Berlin Institute; even the furniture from the Berlin Institute ended up in Jerusalem.

On 23 August 1933, [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote to [[Ernest Jones]], "Berlin is lost".&lt;ref&gt;Rolnik (2012), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edith Jacobson]] was arrested by the Nazis in 1935; one of her patients was a known Communist. {{Interlanguage link multi|Felix Boehm|de|3=Felix Boehm (Psychoanalytiker)}}, who with fellow non-Jew {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Müller-Braunschweig|de}} had taken control of the Institute after Eitingon's departure, refused to intervene on Jacobson's behalf, on the grounds that by associating herself with Communism she had endangered the Institute's survival. In 1936 the Institute was annexed to the "Deutsches Institut für psychologische Forschung und Psychotherapie e.v." (the so-called '''Göring Institute'''). Its director [[Matthias Göring]] was a cousin of Field Marshal [[Hermann Göring]]. Göring, Boehm and Müller-Braunschweig collaborated for a number of years; fourteen non-Jewish German psychoanalysts continued to operate within the new Institute. The one remaining copy of Freud's works was kept in a locked cupboard referred to as the "poison cabinet".&lt;ref&gt;Rolnik (2012), pp. 88-91&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Interlanguage link multi|John Rittmeister|de}}, a physician and psychoanalyst associated with the Institute, as well as [[German resistance to Nazism|resistance fighter against Nazism]], was sentenced to death and executed in May 1943.

'''Bibliometrics''' is [[statistical]] analysis of written publications, such as books or articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliometrics|url=http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=198|website=OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms|publisher=[[OECD]]|accessdate=5 January 2015|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bibliometric methods are frequently used in the field of [[library and information science]], including [[scientometrics]]. For instance, bibliometrics are used to provide [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] analysis of [[Academic publishing|academic literature]]&lt;ref name=bellis&gt;{{cite book|last=De Bellis|first=Nicola|title=Bibliometrics and citation analysis: from the Science citation index to cybermetrics|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-6713-3|pages=417|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ma4YjaKyM9cC}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for evaluating budgetary spending.&lt;ref&gt;D Coughlin, M Campbell, BJ Jansen (2016) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/jansen_library_web_analytics.pdf A Web Analytics Approach for Appraising Electronic Resources in Academic Libraries]. Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 67(3), pages 518-534.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citation analysis]] is a commonly used bibliometric method which is based on constructing the [[citation graph]], a network or graph representation of the citations between documents. Many research fields use bibliometric methods to explore the impact of their field,&lt;ref name="Pil09"&gt;[http://personal.rhul.ac.uk/uhtm/001/BibliometricsIndex.html Bibliometrics at Royal Holloway] 
led by Dr Alan Pilkington, Ver 9.08. Accessed 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of a set of researchers, the impact of a particular paper, or to identify particularly impactful papers within a specific field of research.&lt;ref&gt;Yeung AWK, Heinrich M, Atanasov AG. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29599720 Ethnopharmacology-A Bibliometric Analysis of a Field of Research Meandering Between Medicine and Food Science?] Front Pharmacol. 2018 Mar 15;9:215. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5862826/ doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00215].&lt;/ref&gt; Bibliometrics also has a wide range of other applications, such as in [[descriptive linguistics]], the development of [[thesauri]], and evaluation of reader usage.

==Usage==
Historically, bibliometric methods have been used to trace relationships amongst academic journal citations. Citation analysis, which involves examining an item's referring documents, is used in searching for materials and analyzing their merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schaer|first=Philipp|title=Applied Informetrics for Digital Libraries: An Overview of Foundations, Problems and Current Approaches|journal=Historical Social Research|year=2013|volume=38|issue=3|pages=267–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Citation index|Citation indices]], such as [[Institute for Scientific Information]]'s [[Web of Science]], allow users to search forward in time from a known article to more recent publications which cite the known item.

Data from citation indexes can be analyzed to determine the popularity and impact of specific articles, authors, and publications. Using citation analysis to gauge the importance of one's work, for example, is a significant part of the [[tenure]] review process.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Kolowich. ''Tenure-o-meter'' in [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/12/15/tenure Inside Higher Ed, December 15, 2009]. This article refers to the bibliometrics tool now known as [http://scholarometer.indiana.edu/ Scholarometer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hoang |first=D. |author2=Kaur, J. |author3=[[Filippo Menczer|Menczer, F.]] |year=2010 |title=Crowdsourcing Scholarly Data |journal=Proceedings of the WebSci10: Extending the Frontiers of Society On-Line, April 26-27th, 2010, Raleigh, NC: US |url=http://journal.webscience.org/321/ |access-date=2010-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417002430/http://journal.webscience.org/321/ |archive-date=2015-04-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information scientists also use citation analysis to quantitatively assess the core journal titles and watershed publications in particular disciplines; interrelationships between authors from different institutions and schools of thought; and related data about the sociology of academia. Some more pragmatic applications of this information includes the planning of retrospective bibliographies, "giving some indication both of the age of material used in a discipline, and of the extent to which more recent publications supersede the older ones"; indicating through high frequency of citation which documents should be archived; comparing the coverage of secondary services which can help publishers gauge their achievements and competition, and can aid librarians in evaluating "the effectiveness of their stock".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, David and Maureen Ritchie. ''Literature and Bibliometrics'' London: Clive Bingley: 1978. (12-28).&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some limitations to the value of citation data.  They are often incomplete or biased; data has been largely collected by hand (which is expensive), though citation indexes can also be used; incorrect citing of sources occurs continually; thus, further investigation is required to truly understand the rationale behind citing to allow it to be confidently applied.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, David and Maureen Ritchie. ''Literature and Bibliometrics'' London: Clive Bingley: 1978. (28-29).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliometrics are now used in quantitative research assessment exercises of academic output which is starting to threaten practice based research.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, M., Shurville, S. and Fernstrom, K. (2009). [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/10.1108/10650740910967348 ''The quantitative crunch: the impact of bibliometric research quality assessment exercises on academic development at small conferences''], Campus-Wide Information Systems, Vol 26, No. 3, pp. 149–167&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government has considered using bibliometrics as a possible auxiliary tool in its [[Research Excellence Framework]], a process which will assess the quality of the research output of UK universities and on the basis of the assessment results, allocate research funding.&lt;ref&gt;Higher Education Funding Council for England, http://www.hefce.ac.uk/Research/ref/. Accessed 20 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This has met with significant scepticism and, after a pilot study, looks unlikely to replace the current peer review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/news/newsarchive/2015/Name,104464,en.html|title=Metrics cannot replace peer review in the next REF|last=England|first=Higher Education Funding Council for|website=www.hefce.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bibliometrics applications include: creating thesauri; measuring term frequencies; as metrics in [[scientometrics|scientometric]] analysis, exploring [[grammar|grammatical]] and [[syntax|syntactical]] structures of texts; measuring usage by readers; quantifying value of online media of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.22936 |arxiv=1303.0766 |title=Bibliometrics for Internet media: Applying the h-index to YouTube |year=2013 |last1=Hovden |first1=R. |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume= 64|issue= 11|pages=2326–2331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term ''bibliométrie'' was first used by Paul Otlet in 1934&lt;ref name=Otlet&gt;{{cite | author=Otlet, P. | title=Traité De Documentation: Le Livre Sur Le Livre, Théorie Et Pratique | publisher=Editiones Mundaneum: Mons, Belgium | year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defined as "the measurement of all aspects related to the publication and reading of books and documents."&lt;ref name=Rousseau&gt;{{cite | author=Rousseau, Ronald | title=Library Science: Forgotten Founder of Bibliometrics. | journal=Nature | year=2014 | volume=510 | pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] version ''bibliometrics'' was first used by Alan Pritchard in a paper published in 1969, titled ''Statistical Bibliography or Bibliometrics?''&lt;ref name=Pritchard&gt;Pritchard, Alan, 'Statistical Bibliography or Bibliometrics?', Journal of Documentation, 25(4) Dec 1969, 348-349. https://www.academia.edu/598618/Statistical_bibliography_or_bibliometrics Accessed 6 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He defined the term as "the application of mathematics and statistical methods to books and other media of communication".

Citation analysis has a long history, the [[Science Citation Index]] began publication in 1961 and [[Derek J. de Solla Price]] discussed the citation graph describing the network of citations in his 1965 article "Networks of Scientific Papers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Derek J. de Solla Price | title=Networks of Scientific Papers | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=July 30, 1965 | volume=149 | issue=3683| pages=510&amp;ndash;515 | url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/pricenetworks1965.pdf | pmid=14325149 | doi=10.1126/science.149.3683.510|format=PDF| bibcode=1965Sci...149..510D}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this was done initially manually until large scale electronic databases and associated computer algorithms were able to cope with the vast numbers of documents in most bibliometric collections. The first such algorithm for automated citation extraction and indexing was by [[CiteSeer]]. Google's [[PageRank]] is based on the principle of  citation analysis. [[Patent]] citation maps are also based upon citation analysis (in this case, the citation of one patent by another).

The '''Center for International Forestry Research''' ('''CIFOR''') is a non-profit scientific research organization that conducts research on the use and management of [[forests]] with a focus on tropical forests in developing countries. CIFOR is the forestry research center of the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR), a network of 15 research centers around the world that focus on agricultural research for sustainable development, working closely with governments and other partners to help develop evidence-based solutions to problems related to sustainable agriculture and natural resource management.  

CIFOR’s research contributes to the three CGIAR System-Level Outcomes: reduced poverty, improved food and nutrition security, and improved natural resource systems and [[ecosystem services]]. It also contributes to the new United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goals]] and commitments made by countries in the [[Paris Agreement|Paris agreement]] and other accords related to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. 

== Overview ==
[[Image:Heaquarters bogor.jpg|thumb|left|CIFOR's headquarters in [[Bogor, Indonesia]]]]
CIFOR's research and expert analysis help policy makers and practitioners shape policy, improve the management of tropical forests and address the needs of people who depend on [[forests]] for their livelihoods. CIFOR's multidisciplinary approach considers the underlying drivers of [[deforestation]] and degradation, which often lie outside the forestry sector: forces such as [[agriculture]], infrastructure development, trade and [[Investment policy|investment policies]], and law enforcement.

CIFOR has its headquarters in [[Bogor, Indonesia]]. The current Director General is Robert Nasi. It has three regional offices: in [[Burkina Faso]] (West Africa), [[Cameroon]] (Central Africa) and [[Kenya]] (East and South Africa). It has project offices in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Zambia]] (Africa), [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] (Asia), and [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]] (Latin America). CIFOR is one of 15 centers within the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR).

In implementing its research, CIFOR collaborates with other centers within the CGIAR — the [[World Agroforestry Centre]], the [https://ciat.cgiar.org/ International Center for Tropical Agriculture] (CIAT) and [[Bioversity International]] — to conduct the CGIAR Consortium Research Programme ''Forests, Trees and Agroforestry'' (also known as CRP6). CRP6 objective is to enhance the management and use of forests, agroforestry and tree genetic resources across the landscape, from forests to farms.

== History ==
Although many link CIFOR’s creation to the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] because it came into existence the following year, the discussions that led to founding CIFOR predated the Earth Summit by several years. In 1991, the CGIAR appointed the [[Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research]] (ACIAR) as the implementing agency responsible for establishing CIFOR and setting up a Board of Trustees. CIFOR’s Establishment Agreement was signed by [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishment Agreement for the Center for International Forestry Research|url=https://www.ecolex.org/details/establishment-agreement-for-the-center-for-international-forestry-research-tre-001301/participants/?|website=www.ecolex.org|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Agreement was lodged with the [[United Nations]] and CIFOR's legal identity as an international organisation was consolidated with a Host Country Agreement between the new Board and the [[Government of Indonesia]] in May 1993.

Over time, CIFOR increased the focus of its research on forest policy rather than on technical forestry or [[tree breeding]], in order to complement the efforts of national and private-sector institutes. Instead of having laboratories, CIFOR would be a ‘center without walls’, marshaling interdisciplinary research teams in collaboration with partners to tackle forest policy changes.

== Partners ==

CIFOR works with government agencies and non-governmental organization in the countries where its scientists conduct research. Top partners include the CGIAR, European Union, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation ([[NORAD]]), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ([[Australian Aid]]), US Agency for International Development ([[USAID]]), BMZ/[[BMUB]], Global Environment Facility ([[Global_Environment_Facility|GEF]]), International Fund for Agricultural Development ([[IFAD]]), [[Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs]], [[Austrian Development Agency]], British Department for International Development ([[DFID]]), [[French Global Environment Facility]], and [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]].

== Strategy ==
CIFOR’s first strategy, set out in 1996, provided the foundations and direction for research that affected the understanding and practice of forest management throughout the tropics. But the world’s forests and the way they are perceived have changed dramatically since CIFOR was established.

Foremost among many changes is that forests are today centre-stage in the global debate on how to tackle climate change. Almost 20 per cent of global carbon emissions are caused by deforestation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kanninen, M |author2=Murdiyarso, D |author3=Seymour, F |author4=Angelsen, A |author5=Wunder, S  |author6=German, L|title=Do Trees Grow on Money? The implications of deforestation research for policies to promote REDD|journal=Infobrief|date=November 2008|issue=14|url=http://unfccc.int/files/methods_science/redd/application/pdf/do_trees_grow_on_money_infobrief.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so curbing forest loss is a way to reduce global warming. Also the promotion of biofuels by governments concerned about global warming is driving forest clearance in some areas.

To respond to these and other challenges, CIFOR devised a new strategy for a new era.&lt;ref name=strat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/Books/CIFORStrategy0801.pdf |title=CIFOR strategy 2010-2018 |publisher= CIFOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approved by the Board of Trustees in May 2008, the strategy will guide CIFOR’s work until 2018.

CIFOR is the leading center for the CGIAR Research Programme 'Forests, Trees and Agroforestry' (also known as CRP6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forests, Trees and Agroforestry|url=http://www.cifor.org/crp6/|publisher=CIFOR|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative brings together four Centers who specialise in their respective subjects — the [[World Agroforestry Centre]] (ICRAF), CIFOR, the [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]] (CIAT) and [[Bioversity International]]. The programme will convene expertise across the CGIAR system, and will partner with research and practitioner organisations around the world.
 
Within the consortium research program, the research focus is organised into five components with the clear objective of enhancing the management and use of forests, agroforestry and tree genetic resources across the landscape from forests to farms.

===Component 1: Smallholder production systems and markets===
[[File:Theme3-smallholder.jpg|thumb|CRP6 Component 1 focuses on the needs of smallholder producers]]

Component 1 focuses on the needs of smallholder producers, with an emphasis on enhancing the productivity of trees on farms (e.g. through domestication of wild species) and improving access for smallholders to markets for forest and tree products.

'''Research themes'''
*Enhancing management and production systems for smallholders (food security and nutrition)
*Increasing income generation and market integration for smallholders
*Improving policies and institutions to enhance social assets to secure rights in forest- and tree-dependent communities

=== Component 2: Management and conservation of forest and tree resources ===
Component 2 focuses on the needs of forest managers at the level of the forest management unit, with an emphasis on improved technical and governance approaches to conserving forest ecosystems and the genetic resources they contain.

'''Research themes'''
*Understanding threats to tree species and formulating genetic conservation strategies
*Conserving and characterising high-quality germplasm of tree crops and their wild relatives
*Developing improved silvicultural, monitoring and management practices for multiple use
*Developing tools and methods to resolve conflicts over distribution of benefits and resource rights

=== Component 3: Environmental services and landscape management ===
[[File:Theme4-conservation.jpg|thumb|CRP6 Component 3 has an emphasis on capturing the value of environmental services]]

Component 3 focuses on the needs of landscape-level planners and stakeholders, with an emphasis on mechanisms (such as payments for environmental services or PES) for capturing the value of environmental services and for negotiating trade-offs among competing conservation and development objectives.

'''Research themes'''
*Understanding drivers of forest transition
*Understanding the consequences of forest transition for environmental services and livelihoods
&lt;!--THIS HAS NO MEANING TO ME WHATEVER!!*Learning landscapes: dynamics of multi-functionality--&gt;

=== Component 4: Climate change adaptation and mitigation ===
Component 4 focuses on the needs of policymakers and land managers seeking to build forests, trees and agroforestry into climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.

'''Research themes'''
*Harnessing forests, trees and agroforestry for climate change mitigation
*Enhancing climate change adaptation
*Understanding synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation

=== Component 5: Impacts of trade and investment on forests and people ===
[[File:Theme5-trade.jpg|thumb|CRP6 Component 5 aims to manage the effect of trade and investment on forests and forest-dependent communities]]

Component 5 focuses on the needs of policymakers and land managers seeking to ensure that the effects of globalised trade and investment flows are beneficial to forests and the communities that depend on forests for their livelihoods.

'''Research themes'''
*Understanding the processes and effects of forest-related trade and investment

=== Global Comparative Study on REDD+&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestsclimatechange.org/global-comparative-study-on-redd.html |title=Global Comparative Study on REDD |publisher=Forestsclimatechange.org |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Over four years, CIFOR and its partner organisations are undertaking a major global comparative study on the implementation of pilot REDD+ ([[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation]]) projects.

The aim of the study is to compare how pilot REDD+ projects are working at national and subnational levels, and share lessons learned from these comparisons for the benefit of everyone involved in designing and implementing REDD+ projects. Essentially, by providing policy makers and communities with this information, the project aims to ensure implementation of REDD+ is as effective, cost-efficient and equitable as possible — and ultimately reduces carbon emissions, deforestation and forest degradation across the world, while producing benefits like poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning from REDD: a global comparative study|url=http://www.cifor.org/nc/online-library/browse/view-publication/publication/2953.html|publisher=CIFOR|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2009/08/25/17491830/website.redd-i.diluncurkan|title=Website REDD-I Diluncurkan|newspaper=Kompas|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research for the global comparative study is being undertaken in 11 countries — Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Nepal, Peru, Tanzania and Vietnam.

===Poverty and Environment Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CIFOR|url=http://www.cifor.org/pen |title=Poverty Environment Network |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

The Poverty and Environment Network (PEN) is an international research project and network launched by CIFOR in September 2004 and completed in 2010. PEN still exists as a database containing survey data on more than 8,000 households in more than 40 study sites in 25 developing countries.

It was the largest and most comprehensive global analysis of tropical forests and poverty, and aimed to put a systematic framework of knowledge around the role tropical forests play in poverty alleviation. The project aimed to provide data on the ways that poor people depend on forest resources, in order to both inform mainstream forest policy design and to contribute to the design of policies and projects to alleviate poverty, and thereby contribute to meeting the Millennium Development Goal of 50% poverty reduction by 2015.

In order for the socioeconomic data to be uniform and therefore comparable across countries and project sites, research partners (mainly PhD students) from a number of universities and research institutes collected quarterly data at the household and village level using standardised definitions, questionnaires and methods. The study sites were chosen to obtain representative coverage of geographical regions, forest types, forest tenure regimes, levels of poverty, infrastructure and market access, and population density.

Preliminary results from the study’s global database showed that among those surveyed, forest income – on average – constituted more than one fifth of total household income, while environmental income (forest and non-forest) made up more than one fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New global study shows high reliance on forests among rural poor|url=http://www.forestcarbonportal.com/news/new-global-study-shows-high-reliance-forests-among-rural-poor|publisher=Forest Carbon Portal|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communicating research ==
According to past Director General Frances Seymour, CIFOR considers bridging the gap between research, policy and practice through effective communications is one of its challenges as a research organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message from the Director General|url=http://www.cifor.org/about-us/message-from-the-director-general.html|publisher=cifor.org|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is committed to sharing its research and other information with others in the research community, and also with policymakers, indigenous and community groups, donor agencies, the media and the general public.

The different types of '''[[bladed weapons]]''' ([[Sword|swords]], [[Small sword|dress-swords]], [[Sabre|sabers]], [[Rapier|rapiers]], [[Foil (fencing)|foils]], [[Machete|machetes]], [[Dagger|daggers]], [[Knife|knives]], [[Arrowhead|arrowheads]], etc..) have been of great importance throughout history. In addition to its use for fighting, or in wars, the ''[[bladed weapons]]'' have been the object of special considerations forming part of funerary rituals, mythology and other ancestral traditions.

The manufacture of a [[Bladed weapons|''bladed weapon'']] of a certain quality (either of bronze or iron alloy) requires a certain degree of mastery in metallurgy: obtaining metals and alloys from the minerals of the mines, mastery on forging, casting or forming techniques and heat treatments; without forgetting the artistic aspects or the crafts related to the complements (pods, belts, shawls, knobs, decoration, etc...).

== Chronology details ==
The present [[chronology]] it's a compilation that includes diverse and relatively uneven documents about different families of ''[[bladed weapons]]'': [[Sword|swords]], [[Small sword|dress-swords]], [[Sabre|sabers]], [[Rapier|rapiers]], [[Foil (fencing)|foils]], [[Machete|machetes]], [[Dagger|daggers]], [[Knife|knives]], [[Arrowhead|arrowheads]], etc..., with the sword references being the most numerous but not the unique included among the other listed references of the rest of ''[[bladed weapons]]''. The reason to group them into a single list responds to a goal for simplification, instead of making a different [[chronology]] article for each type of bladed weapon.

== Chronology (until the Christian Era) ==

=== Bronze Swords ===
[[File:Nebra_Schwerter.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; [[Sword]]s found next to [[Nebra sky disk]] &lt;/Center&gt;]]
The first bronze swords with a length equal to or greater than 60&amp;nbsp;cm date from the 17th century BC in regions of the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]]. They emerged as an evolution of shorter weapons of the type of the daggers or daggers. To make a sword useful in combat, you must have a correct alloy, give it the right shape and apply the necessary thermal (and finishing) treatments. The longer a sword, the stresses (bending and buckling) are more important. What is needed is a weapon that is hard enough (to cut), fairly flexible (without being fragile) and quite tenacious enough to withstand the blows in the fights.

The manufacturing process is summarized as follows: The bronze swords were cast into moulds, heated to a certain temperature and allowed to cool slowly. Finally they cold hammered (hitting them with a hammer on a type of anvil) to increase its hardness.

'''''The Communities Directory, A Comprehensive Guide to Intentional Community''''' provides listing of [[intentional communities]] primarily from North America but also from around the world. The ''Communities Directory'' has both an ([http://directory.ic.org online])&lt;ref name=onlineDirectory&gt; {{cite web |url=http://directory.ic.org/ |title=Intentional Communities Directory – ecovillages communes cohousing |publisher=[[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] |location=Rutledge, MO |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |format=Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;and a print edition,&lt;ref name=printDirectory&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Communities Directory |publisher=[[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] |location=Rutledge, MO |issn=1088-8349 |oclc=32605029 |url=http://directory.ic.org/book.php  |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |format=Print }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is published based on data from the website.

==History==
The first version of the ''Communities Directory'' appeared in issue #1 of [[Communities magazine|''Communities'']] magazine&lt;ref name=CommunitiesMagazine&gt;{{cite journal |author=Communities (magazine) |authorlink=Communities (magazine) |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Roth |journal=Communities |publisher=[[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] |location=Rutledge, MO |issn=0199-9346 |oclc=3130385 |url=http://communities.ic.org/ |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |quote=Since 1972, Communities has been the primary resource for information, issues, and ideas about intentional communities in North America – from urban co-ops to cohousing groups to ecovillages to rural communes.

In all, ten versions were published in the magazine over the next 18 years. The [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]]&lt;ref name=FIC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.org/ |title=Intentional Communities – ecovillages, communes, cohousing, coops |author=FIC Web Weavers |authorlink=Fellowship for Intentional Community  |publisher=Fellowship for Intentional Community (FIC) |location=Rutledge, Missouri, USA |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |quote=Intentional Community is an inclusive term for ecovillages, cohousing communities, residential land trusts, communes, student co-ops, urban housing cooperatives, intentional living, alternative communities, cooperative living, and other projects where people strive together with a common vision. }}&lt;/ref&gt; became publisher of the magazine in 1989, and in 1990 released the first self-contained book-format edition of the directory (also distributed to magazine subscribers, counted as double issue #77/78). 

The ''Communities Directory'' is now in its 6th edition. Editions were published in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2007. The production cycle has been shortened due to the online collection of data. The 4th edition lists 600 communities in North America and another 130 worldwide. The 5th edition lists almost 1250 communities worldwide.

There is also a companion video ''Visions of Utopia: Experiments in Sustainable Culture'' that outlines the history of intentional shared living and profiles a diverse cross-section of contemporary groups (external link included below).

The Online ''Communities Directory'' database is shared by members of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041130221719/http://directory.ic.org/icdc.php Intentional Community Data Collective] which includes the [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] and [http://directory.cohousing.org Coho/US's Cohousing Directory].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5976">The '''Cybernetic Culture Research Unit''' ('''Ccru''') was a student-run interdisciplinary collective founded in 1995 out of the [[University of Warwick]]'s philosophy department.&lt;ref name="divus.cc"&gt;[http://divus.cc/london/en/article/nick-land-ein-experiment-im-inhumanismus Mackay, Robin. "Nick Land: An Experiment in Inhumanism." ''Divus''. 27 February 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was associated with the work of [[Sadie Plant]] and [[Nick Land]].

==History==
The collective's research was closely tied to the work of philosophers [[Sadie Plant]] (around whom it was founded), [[Nick Land]], and their colleagues throughout the 1990s, and in particular the emerging [[cyberfeminist]] thinking that would lead to the ''Virtual Futures'' conferences at Warwick in the middle of the decade.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Simon Reynolds, '[http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/renegade-academia-cybernetic-culture.html Reynolds, Simon. "Renegade Aacdemia"]', unpublished feature for Lingua Franca, 1999. Accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Plant would abandon her academic post and affiliation with the Ccru in 1997, during which time it came under the direction of Land. Under his leadership, the collective became increasingly experimental and unorthodox in its work, with its output (which included writing, performance events, and collaborative art) crossing [[post-structuralism]], [[cybernetics]], [[science-fiction]], [[rave culture]], and [[occult studies]].&lt;ref name="divus.cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2015, a collection of Ccru pieces entitled ''Ccru: Writings 1997-2003'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ccru-Writings-1997-2003-ebook/dp/B00X96VLF0/|title=Ccru: Writings 1997-2003|accessdate= September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members and affiliates==
Although it only existed in an official capacity for little over two years—following the departure of Plant, the University of Warwick would deny any relationship to the renegade collective—the Ccru's cultural impact has been significant.&lt;ref name="dazeddigital.com"&gt;[http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/10459/1/nick-land-mind-games Fisher, Mark. "Nick Land: Mind Games." ''Dazed and Confused''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Reynolds, '[http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/renegade-academia-cybernetic-culture.html Renegade Aacdemia]', unpublished feature for Lingua Franca, 1999. Accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were affiliated with the Ccru during and after its time as part of the University of Warwick Philosophy department include philosophers [[Iain Hamilton Grant]], [[Ray Brassier]] and [[Reza Negarestani]]; cultural theorists [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]] and [[Kodwo Eshun]]; publisher and philosopher Robin Mackay; digital media theorists Luciana Parisi and [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]]; electronic music artist and [[Hyperdub]] label head Steve Goodman, aka [[Kode9]]; writer and theorist Anna Greenspan; novelist [[Hari Kunzru]]; and artists [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], among others.&lt;ref name="divus.cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dazeddigital.com"/&gt; Land and the Ccru collaborated frequently with the experimental art collective 0[rphan&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;d[rift&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Maggie Roberts and Ranu Mukherjee),{{r|orphan}} notably on ''Syzygy'', a month-long multidisciplinary residency at Beaconsfield Contemporary Art gallery in South London, 1999, and on 0[rphan]d[rift&gt;]'s ''Cyberpositive'' (London: Cabinet, 1995), a schizoid work of cut-and-paste cyberphilosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orphandriftarchive.com/neofuture/ctm13-berlin.php|title=0rphan Drift :: Neo Future &gt; CTM13 Berlin|website=www.orphandriftarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The role played by Land, Plant, and the Ccru in the development of what has come to be known as [[accelerationism]] is profound, and its legacy is apparent in contemporary debates concerning the viability of the theory in its various guises.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Mackay and Armen Avanessian, '[http://www.urbanomic.com/Publications/Accelerate/Accelerate-Introduction.pdf Introduction]' to ''#Accelerate: The Accelerationist Reader'', (Falmouth: Urbanomic, 2014) pp.1-46&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that accelerationism as it was deployed by the Ccru should be distinguished from the term more frequently associated with [[Nick Srnicek]] and Alex Williams’ ‘Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics’.{{r|mani}}&lt;ref&gt;Nick Srnicek &amp; Alex Williams, ‘[http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/ #Accelerate: Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics],’ Dark Trajectories: Politics of the Outside, ed. Joshua Johnson (Hong Kong, NAME, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Land himself makes this distinction clear in his commentary on the manifesto.{{r|land}}

[[File:DabousGiraffe2.jpg|thumb|Smaller petroglyphs near the Dabous Giraffes]]
The '''Dabous Giraffes''' are a [[neolithic]] [[petroglyph]] by an unknown artist. Completed between 9000 BC and 5000 BC, the giraffe carvings were first documented by David Coulson in 1997 while on a photographic expedition at a site in [[Niger]], [[Africa]].

The carving is 20 feet in height and consists of two giraffes carved into the ''Dabous Rock'' with a great amount of detail. Dabous Rock is located on the sloping slope of a small rocky outcropping of sandstone in the first foothills of the Air Mountains. One of the giraffes is male, while the other, smaller, is female.

In the surroundings 828 images have been found engraved on the rocks, of which 704 are animals (bovidae, giraffes, ostriches, antelopes, lions, rincerontes and camels), 61 are human and 159 are indeterminate.

The Bradshaw Foundation is an organization dedicated to the protection and preservation of this petroglyph.

'''Dramatic structure''' is the structure of a [[drama]]tic work such as a [[Play (theater)|play]] or [[film]]. Many scholars have analyzed dramatic structure, beginning with [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE). This article looks at Aristotle's analysis of the Greek tragedy and on [[Gustav Freytag]]'s analysis of [[Theater of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] drama.

==History==
In his ''Poetics'', the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher Aristotle put forth the idea the play should imitate a single whole action. "A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end" (1450b27).&lt;ref name="fall2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1450b Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt; He split the play into two parts: complication and unravelling.

The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] drama critic [[Horace]] advocated a 5-act structure in his [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]: "Neue minor neu sit quinto productior actu fabula" (lines 189–190) ("A play should not be shorter or longer than five acts").

The fourth-century Roman grammarian [[Aelius Donatus]] defined the play as a three part structure, the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]).

In 1863, around the time that playwrights like [[Henrik Ibsen]] were abandoning the 5-act structure and experimenting with 3 and 4-act plays, the [[Germany|German]] playwright and novelist Gustav Freytag wrote ''Die Technik des Dramas'', a definitive study of the 5-act dramatic structure, in which he laid out what has come to be known as Freytag's pyramid.&lt;ref name="fall3"&gt;University of South Carolina (2006). [http://home.earthlink.net/~mr.kilgore/102/handouts/bigpicture_what.htm The Big Picture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023073242/http://home.earthlink.net/~mr.kilgore/102/handouts/bigpicture_what.htm |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Freytag's pyramid, the plot of a story consists of five parts: [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] (originally called introduction), [[rising action]] (rise), [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], [[falling action]] (return or fall), and [[dénouement]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[wikt:resolution|resolution]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[revelation]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]].&lt;ref name="fall4"&gt;University of Illinois: Department of English (2006). [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/lit_resources/english%20102/miscellaneous/freytag.htm Freytag’s Triangle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716152819/http://www.english.uiuc.edu/lit_resources/english%20102/miscellaneous/freytag.htm |date=July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotle's analysis==
Many structural principles still in use by modern storytellers were explained by Aristotle in his ''Poetics''. In the part that we still have, he mostly analyzed the tragedy. A part analyzing the comedy is believed to have existed but is now lost.

Aristotle stated that the tragedy should imitate a whole action, which means that the events follow each other by probability or necessity, and that the causal chain has a beginning and an end.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0009 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VII]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a knot, a central problem that the protagonist must face. The play has two parts:  complication and unravelling.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XVIII]&lt;/ref&gt; During complication, the protagonist finds trouble as the knot is revealed or tied; during unraveling, the knot is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section XVIII ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] are of special interest:  the reversal, which throws the action in a new direction, and the recognition, meaning the protagonist has an important revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0008 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VI]&lt;/ref&gt;  Reversals should happen as a necessary and probable cause of what happened before, which implies that turning points needs to be properly set up.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0013 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications should arise from a flaw in the protagonist. In the tragedy, this flaw will be his undoing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0015 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freytag's analysis&lt;!--'Dramatic arc' redirects here--&gt;==
[[File:Freytags pyramid.svg|thumb|250px|"Freytag's pyramid", symbolizing his theory of dramatic structure]]
According to Freytag, a drama is divided into five parts, or acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freytag|first=Gustav|title=Die Technik des Dramas|year=1863|url=http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|accessdate=2009-01-20|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116004731/http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|archivedate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some refer to as a '''{{visible anchor|dramatic arc}}'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and dénouement. Freytag's Pyramid can help writers organize their thoughts and ideas when describing the main problem of the drama, the rising action, the climax and the falling action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Freytag's analysis of dramatic structure is based on five-act plays, it can be applied (sometimes in a modified manner) to short stories and novels as well, making dramatic structure a [[literary element]]. Nonetheless, the pyramid is not always easy to use, especially in modern plays such as [[Alfred Uhry]]'s ''[[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|Driving Miss Daisy]]'' and  [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[The Crucible]]'', which is actually divided into 25 scenes without concrete acts.

===Exposition===
{{main article|Exposition (narrative)}}

The exposition is the portion of a story that introduces important background information to the audience; for example, information about the setting, events occurring before the main plot, characters' back stories, etc. Exposition can be conveyed through dialogues, flashbacks, characters' thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a back-story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=115-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising action===
In the rising action, a series of events build toward the point of greatest interest. The rising action of a story is the series of events that begin immediately after the exposition (introduction) of the story and builds up to the climax. These events are generally the most important parts of the story since the entire plot depends on them to set up the climax and ultimately the satisfactory resolution of the story itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=125-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climax===
{{main article|Climax (narrative)}}

The climax is the turning point, which changes the protagonist's fate. If the story is a comedy and things were going badly for the protagonist, the plot will begin to unfold in his or her favor, often requiring  the protagonist to draw on hidden inner strengths.  If the story is a tragedy, the opposite state of affairs will ensue, with things going from good to bad for the protagonist, often revealing the protagonist's hidden weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=128-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falling action===
During the falling action, the conflict between the [[protagonist]] and the [[antagonist]] unravels, with the protagonist winning or losing against the antagonist. The falling action may contain a moment of final suspense, in which the final outcome of the conflict is in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dénouement&lt;!--'Dénouement' redirects here--&gt;===
{{see also|Detective dénouement }}
The '''''dénouement'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|eɪ|ˈ|n|uː|m|ɒ̃|,_|d|ɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|d|eɪ|n|uː|ˈ|m|ɒ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/denouement?q=D%C3%A9nouement "dénouement"]. ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|denumɑ̃|lang}}) comprises events from the end of the falling action to the actual ending scene of the drama or narrative. [[Conflict (narrative)|Conflict]]s are resolved, creating normality for the characters and a sense of [[catharsis]], or release of tension and anxiety, for the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=137-140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the French word ''dénouement'' is derived from the word ''dénouer'', "to untie", from ''nodus'', Latin for "knot." It is the unraveling or untying of the complexities of a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The comedy ends with a ''dénouement'' (a conclusion), in which the protagonist is better off than at the story's outset. The tragedy ends with a catastrophe, in which the protagonist is worse off than at the beginning of the narrative. Exemplary of a comic ''dénouement'' is the final scene of [[Shakespeare]]’s comedy ''[[As You Like It]]'', in which couples marry, an evildoer repents, two disguised characters are revealed for all to see, and a ruler is restored to power. In Shakespeare's tragedies, the ''dénouement'' is usually the death of one or more characters.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Criticism==

Freytag's analysis was intended to apply to ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama, not modern.

Contemporary dramas increasingly use the fall to increase the relative height of the climax and dramatic impact ([[melodrama]]). The protagonist reaches up but falls and succumbs to doubts, fears, and limitations. The negative climax occurs when the protagonist has an epiphany and encounters the greatest fear possible or loses something important, giving the protagonist the courage to take on another obstacle. This confrontation becomes the classic climax.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;Teruaki Georges Sumioka: The Grammar of Entertainment Film 2005, {{ISBN|978-4-8459-0574-4}}; [http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/sumioka-info/resouce/resouce.html lectures at Johannes-Gutenberg-University in German]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16465">'''Dream world''' (also called '''dream realm''' or '''illusory realm''') is a commonly used [[plot device]] in [[fiction]]al works, most notably in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy fiction]]. The use of a dream world creates a situation whereby a [[fictional character|character]] (or group of characters) is placed in a marvellous and unpredictable environment and must overcome several personal problems to leave it. The dream world also commonly serves to teach some [[moral]] or [[religious]] lessons to the character experiencing it – a lesson that the other characters will be unaware of, but one that will influence decisions made regarding them. When the character is reintroduced into the real world (usually when they wake up), the question arises as to what exactly constitutes [[reality]] due to the vivid recollection and experiences of the dream world.

According to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], dream worlds contrast with [[fantasy world]]s, in which the world has existence independent of the characters in it.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", p. 14, ''The Tolkien Reader'', [[Ballantine Books]], New York 1966&lt;/ref&gt; However, other authors have used the dreaming process as a way of accessing a world which, within the context of the fiction, holds as much consistency and continuity as physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;"Whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences...&lt;br&gt;
... Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon."
– H.P. Lovecraft, from "Beyond the Wall of Sleep", as reprinted in ''The Dream Cycle of H. P. Lovecraft: Dreams of Terror and Death'' (Del Rey, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "dream frames" to contain a fantasy world, and so explain away its marvels, has been criticized and has become much less prevalent.&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Dreams", p. 297 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional dream worlds==
{{Pop culture|date=February 2018}}
===Literature===
A similar motif, [[Locus amoenus]], is popular in medieval literature (esp. allegory and romance). A dream world is sometimes invoked in [[dream vision]]s such as ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' and ''[[Piers Plowman]]''.&lt;ref name="encyc"/&gt;

[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 24.png|right|225px|thumb|The Cheshire Cat vanishes in Wonderland.]]
One of the best-known dream worlds is [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]] from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', as well as [[Looking-Glass Land]] from its sequel, ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. Unlike many dream worlds, Carroll's logic is like that of actual dreams, with transitions and causality flexible. [[James Branch Cabell]]'s ''[[Smirt]]'' and its two sequels taken together form an extended dream and most of their action takes place in a dream world.

The action of ''[[The Bridge (novel)|The Bridge]]'' by [[Iain M. Banks]] and ''[[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever]]'' by [[Stephen R. Donaldson]] take place in dream worlds. Other fictional dream worlds include the [[Dreamlands]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[Dream Cycle]]''  and ''[[The Neverending Story]]''{{'}}s world of Fantasia, which includes places like the Desert of Lost Dreams, the Sea of Possibilities and the Swamps of Sadness. Dreamworlds, shared hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of works by [[Philip K. Dick]], such as ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' and ''[[Ubik]]''. Similar themes were explored by  [[Jorge Luis Borges]], for instance in ''[[The Circular Ruins]]''.

In ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' book series, [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] is a dream world that exists in close proximity to the real world. Objects and physical locations that do not frequently change in the real world have parallels in [[Tel'aran'rhiod]]. Ordinary people can occasionally slip into [[Tel'aran'rhiod]], and events that occur within this dream world have physical consequences. A person that dies in [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] will never wake up again, and in several cases it is shown that physical injuries gained there persist to the waking world. [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] can be controlled similar to a [[lucid dream]], and several characters in the series can enter and manipulate [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] at will.

''[[Paprika (novel)|Paprika]]'' (1993) by [[Yasutaka Tsutsui]] is a [[science fiction]] novel that involves entering dream worlds using technology. In the book, dream monitoring and intervention as a means of treating [[mental disorder]]s is a developing new form of [[psychotherapy]] in the near future. Unrest ensues when a new psychotherapy dream-analysis device is stolen, allowing the assailant to enter and manipulate people's dreams.

In the feminist science fiction novel ''[[The Kin of Ata Are Waiting for You]]'', the Kin of Ata maintain the real world through their dreaming, making the real world a form of  dream.

===Film===
In the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 movie]], [[Land of Oz|Oz]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' was altered from a fantasy world (in the novel) to a dream world of Dorothy's; characters who were independent inhabitants of Oz were transformed into dream parallels of introduced Kansas characters.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 96, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Matrix]]'', Neo and the rest of the humans live inside a dream world. Their brains are hooked up to a computer network that creates this dream world. However, some may argue that this is not a dream world, as it seems completely normal and indistinguishable from reality (aside from time differences). In the 1980s, the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' series]] of horror films introduced a dark dream realm inhabited by the supernatural serial killer [[Freddy Krueger]].

In the movie ''[[Sharkboy and Lavagirl]]'' the main characters enter a world dreamt up by a small boy in order to save the real world.
Down Town is the land of nightmares where all people who are in comas go in the movie ''[[Monkeybone]]''. Dreamworlds also appear in ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' and ''[[Vanilla Sky]]''.

''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]'' (2006) is an [[anime]] film adaptation of the 1993 novel of the same name, which involves entering and manipulating dream worlds using dream-analysis devices.

The film ''[[Waking Life]]'' takes place almost entirely in a dream realm.  In the 2010 film ''[[Inception]]'', main characters create artificial, vivid dream worlds and bring others into the dream worlds and perform various things with their brains, without them knowing. This may involve 'Extraction' (stealing memories and secrets), 'Inception' (planting an idea into the mind) and others.

===Comic books, graphic novels and animation===
[[File:Little Nemo 1906-07-22 last two panels.jpg|thumb|A panel from [[Little Nemo]] (1906).]]
One of the earliest newspaper comic strips, recounting [[Little Nemo]]'s adventures in [[Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland|Slumberland]], had a dream world theme.

Writer [[Neil Gaiman]] was tasked with re-imagining a Golden Age character, "[[Sandman (DC Comics)|The Sandman]]".  In his version, the Sandman becomes [[Dream (comics)|Dream]], the Lord of Dreams (also known, to various characters throughout the series, as [[Dream (comics)|Morpheus]], [[Oneiroi|Oneiros]], the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, Dream Cat, Murphy, Kai'ckul, and Lord L'Zoril), who is essentially the [[anthropomorphic]] personification of [[dream]]s. At the start of the series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence.

Dream worlds also  appear in ''[[Rozen Maiden]]'', in the Outback(s) of ''[[The Maxx]]''; in Dream Land, the main setting of many [[Kirby series|''Kirby'' games]], in the webcomic ''[[The Dreamland Chronicles]]'',  and the movie ''[[Sailor Moon SuperS movie|Sailor Moon Super S the Movie: Black Dream Hole]]'' also have dream realms in their universes.

The ''[[American Dragon Jake Long]]'' episode "Dreamscape" takes place mainly in a dream realm. Similarly, the ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' episode [[Dreamscape (Xiaolin Showdown)|of the same title]] also uses the dream world in its plotline.

In ''[[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]'' manga series such as ''[[X/1999]]'', ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]'', the dream world is very important to the events that occur within each story. It is later revealed in ''xxxHolic'' that the dream world itself is its own world, as part of the Clamp multiverse. Similarly, in the ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' graphic novel series by Jeff Smith, the primary plot device is a dream world called "The Dreaming." It exists independently from the real world, and it is described similarly to a river, being said to "flow" through people in "currents."

In ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' part 3 "[[Stardust Crusaders]]," Jotaro and his friends and grandpa are put in a dream world which takes the form of an amusement park by Mannish Boy and his Death 13 stand.

In the ''[[Jay Jay the Jet Plane]]'' cartoon series, adventures where air-breathing jet planes cannot go (underwater and in space) happen as dreams.

===TV===
The ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[Waking Moments]]" uses several dream realms and false awakenings. In the ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' episode "Ordeal," Foster's abduction and rescue is explained away as a dream. The whole of season 8 of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' was retroactively explained, at the start of Season 9, as a dream had by [[Bobby Ewing]]. In the [[Xena: Warrior Princess]] episode, "Dreamworker", [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]], god of dreams, abducts Gabrielle to take as his bride. But Xena follows them into his realm, the DreamScape, where she battles to stop the impending [[forced marriage]]. The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode, "[[Amy's Choice (Doctor Who)|Amy's Choice]]" also depicts multiple dream worlds, which were found out to have been induced by a parasitic seed. Dreamworlds are revisited in the ''Doctor Who'' Christmas special, "[[Last Christmas (Doctor Who)|Last Christmas]]," which depicts dreams within dreams caused by mind-leeching aliens.

===Video games===
The video games ''[[Link's Awakening]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' take place in a dream of the Wind Fish's (whom [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] must wake up) and [[Mario]]'s respectively.

''[[Alundra]]'' revolves around a dreamwalker who can enter people's dreams. It takes place on an island, where a village has locals suffering from recurring nightmares that sometimes cause death. With his dreamwalking ability, the titular protagonist Alundra attempts to help the locals by entering their dreams.

In the first two games of the [[EarthBound (series)|''EarthBound'']] series, the protagonist (Ninten in ''[[EarthBound Zero]]'' and Ness in ''[[EarthBound]]'') must travel to a dream world named Magicant. However, the two Magicants are different from each other. Ninten visits his Magicant, which is light pink and has seashell spires and clouds, multiple times during the story, until it is revealed to not be his own Magicant but instead just a collection of the memories of his great-grandmother, Maria. Ness's Magicant is a surreal, spacelike land in a purple sea that Ness only gains access to once he records the eight melodies into his Sound Stone, which he then must travel to the center of in order to overcome his weaknesses, characterized by a boss battle against his 'Nightmare' (with an appearance similar to the 'Mani-Mani Statue', a mysterious object encountered in another dreamworld called Moonside), and absorb the power of the Earth into his heart.

About a half of ''[[Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams]]'' takes place in the Dream World, home to the Staff of Dreams, which was later split by Pins and Needles, where Tak has a half of the staff and Pins and Needles have the Staff of Nightmares half. By the end of the game, Tak restored the staff.

In ''[[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie]]'', the game is split between two worlds initially known as the Real World and the Phantom World, named such because any being from the Real World is rendered unseen by the inhabitants of the Phantom World, like a phantom, and are only capable of becoming visible after drinking a special [[elixir]]. After a time, it is revealed that the Phantom World is in fact the true Real World, while the former Real World is called the Dream World, created from the dreams of the people of the Real World, in which each inhabitant has a Dream World counterpart. In addition, the main antagonist of the game, Deathtamoor, plots to try to merge both the Real World and Dream World with his own "Dark World" in an attempt for world domination.

In ''[[Dreamfall: The Longest Journey]]'' and ''[[Dreamfall Chapters]]'' the protagonist Zoë Castillo can travel to Marcuria by dreaming. There's a third world called 'Storytime' inspired by the Australian ''[[Dreamtime]]'' myths which is the place of the creation and where every story begins and ends. Also, the protagonist must stop a corporation called WATI-Corp which want to steal dreams and memories from people through their new entertainment device: the Dreamachine which allows people to make lucid dreams.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', the main group of protagonists sometimes experience the lives of three soldiers, [[Laguna Loire|Laguna]], [[Kiros Seagill|Kiros]], and [[Ward Zabac|Ward]] in what they call "the dream world" (which is actually the past) through a mysterious and gifted woman who is acquainted with both parties. The whole of [[Zanarkand]] in ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and its [[Final Fantasy X HD|HD remake]] was a dream, along with the main character, [[Tidus]].

In the video game ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', there is a short quest which takes place in a dream world. In the video game, ''[[Fallout 3]]'', a main storyline quest involves the main character going into a virtual reality simulator, referred to as "Tranquility Lane," a dream world simulation of a 1950s suburban neighborhood.   

Other dreamworlds are the Maginaryworld from ''[[Sonic Shuffle]]'', Dream Depot from ''[[Mario Party 5]]'', and in Nightopia and Nightmare (collectively known in a place called the "Night Dimension") from ''[[Nights into Dreams...]]'' and its sequel for the [[Wii]], ''[[Nights: Journey of Dreams]]''.

In the video game ''[[Driver: San Francisco]]'', main character John Tanner suffers a car accident that leaves him in a coma. The game take places in his dream, but the character himself doesn't realize he's dreaming. Instead, he thinks he had a lucky escape and with this, thinks that he got an ability to [[Spirit possession|possess]] other people. During the game, many billboards will turn black and show "wake up" messages.

In [[Pokémon Black and White|''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'']] and its following sequel, players can tuck in one of their Pokémon via a system known as Game Sync. As the tucked in Pokémon falls asleep, it will then be sent to special website, where the player can play with his/her Pokémon in an alternate world called the "Dream World".

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', the seventh installment in the game series ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', the two main protagonists are sent to worlds that are in slumber and that are dreaming in order to pass the Mark of mastery exam.

The Dream World is the main focus of ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team]]'' where [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] travel through a world full of Luigi's dreams.

''[[Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil]]'' takes place in Lunatea, a dream world.

The '''Marine Biology Station of [[Funchal]]'' ('''Estação de biologia marinha do Funchal'''), on the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] island of [[Madeira Island|Madeira]], is a research centre owned by the municipality of Funchal and dedicated to [[research]] and [[education]] on [[Oceanography|marine sciences]].  It was inaugurated on 28 September 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madeiranature.com/index/cms/page/-/page/institutions/articleId/258/articleTitle/marine-biology-station/lang/en Marine Biology Station - Institutions - Madeira Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;

The station is an observer member of the European Network of Marine Biology stations (MARS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsnetwork.org/ MARS Network]&lt;/ref&gt; which has around 60 laboratories in [[Europe]].  Also, the station is part of the Portuguese Institute of Marine Research (IMAR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imar.pt/ IMAR - Instituto do Mar - Institute of Marine Research]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these Institute’s members are [[List of higher education institutions in Portugal|Portuguese university]] research laboratories specialized in marine sciences.

==Objectives==
Its objectives are to develop the sciences and technologies of the sea, particularly, [[biology]] and [[ecology]] of coastal and deep sea waters.  The station is the base for the Marine Biology team of the Natural History Museum of Funchal and the Marine Biology and Oceanography Laboratory team of the Biology Department of the [[University of Madeira]].  These two teams participate in several research projects including the studies of deep sea [[hydrothermal vent]] fish, the fish and [[crustacean]] diversity of [[Macaronesia]]n deep waters and the biological migration of [[sea turtle]]s.

==Location==
The station occupies a six-floor building just off the promenade between the "Lido" area of Funchal and "O Clube Naval" (The Yacht Club).  It has several dry and wet labs, offices, refrigeration and freezing facilities, and other technical areas, including a scientific diving base.  The marine reference collections of the Natural History Museum of Funchal are stored at the station as well.  This amounts to 25,000 specimens from the Macaronesian waters in the Eastern Atlantic including several holotypes and paratypes.  To encourage cooperation and exchange of information among [[scientist]]s and [[researcher]]s the station has lodging available for 8 visiting scientists and lab space for them.

==The Professor Luiz Saldanha Library==
This library within the station holds a large, valuable collection including reference books and periodicals on marine sciences.  It is named after the Portuguese oceanographer who was the founder of the ‘Guia Marine Laboratory’ in [[Lisbon]].

==Visiting the station==
On the last Monday of every month at 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., the station is open to the general public. The station is open from Monday to Friday, from 9:00 to 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and from 2:00 to 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.. The centre is closed on Saturday, Sunday and Bank Holidays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="962">An '''extension agency''' is an organisation that practises [[Extension (semantics)|extension]], in the context of [[community development]]. An example is the ''[[Cooperative Extension Service]]'', which aims to assist individuals or groups in defining and achieving their goals in rural communities in the USA.
 
'''Extension agents''' are trained in the skills of extension, such as communication and group facilitation, and usually in technical areas of the sector they serve (for example agriculture, health, or safety). [[Agricultural extension]] agencies promote more profitable and sustainable farming, while '''health extension''' agencies promote improved health. 

Extension agents are represented by '''professional organisations''' such as the [http://www.apen.org.au/ Australasia-Pacific Extension Network] and publish in journals such as the [http://www.joe.org/ Journal of Extension].

'''An Foras Áiseanna Saothair''' ({{IPA-ga|ən̪ˠ ˈfˠɔrˠəsˠ ˈaːʃʲən̪ˠə ˈsˠiːhəɾʲ}}), referred to in English as the '''Training and Employment Authority''' and commonly known as '''FÁS''' ({{IPA-ga|faːs}}), was a [[Public service bodies of the Republic of Ireland|state agency]] in Ireland with responsibility for assisting those [[Job hunting|seeking employment]]. It was established in January 1988 under the ''Labour Services Act, 1987'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20050830142014/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987_15.html] and was run by a board appointed by the [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]], composed of employer and trade union representatives.

==Overview==
The authority, whose [[Irish language]] name literally translates as "the Labour Facilities Foundation", was the successor to An Chomhairle Oiliúna ("the training council", commonly referred to as AnCO), the National Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency. The Irish word ''fás'' formed by the acronym means "growth", and the authority was created in [[1980s Ireland]] during the long economic downturn of the time.

The authority ran a number of ''JobCentres'' in Ireland to facilitate those seeking employment, however it had occasionally been criticised, not least for the perception that it is simply a scheme to remove people from unemployment statistics{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} – it had also been criticised for the expense of running it at almost €1 billion per annum.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The authority ran training courses in various fields, through regional centres, although some of this work was transferred to [[Regional Technical College|institutes of technology]] – including the [[apprenticeship]]s in various fields that it regulated.

==Apprenticeships==
Apprenticeships regulated by FÁS include:

==Geoghegan controversy==
By tradition, the Director General of FÁS is a board member of [[Forfás]]. Brian Geoghegan (spouse of [[Mary Harney]], [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health and Children]]) retired as Chairman of FÁS at the end of 2005 and was replaced by Peter McLoone. There had been some controversy regarding Geoghegan's position when it emerged he was also a board member of IBEC, the employer's union of Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} IBEC have been critical of FÁS at times claiming, at various intervals, that some FÁS courses and schemes are a waste of money, taking potential employees off the live register who could otherwise be employed in mainstream positions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The fact that Geoghegan is married to Minister Mary Harney, who was formerly the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, led to some claims he had a conflict of interest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Expenses scandal==
{{main|FÁS expenses scandal}}
In September 2008, the [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment]] [[Mary Coughlan (politician)|Mary Coughlan]] announced that the Comptroller and Auditor General would undertake an investigation of FÁS expenditure in light of what she saw as the evident public disquiet on the issue. The annual budget for FÁS at the time was around €1 billion. In November 2008, The [[Dáil]] Public Accounts Committee (PAC) also began an investigation. However, it was information obtained under the [[Freedom of information legislation#Ireland|Freedom of Information Act]] by journalist and Senator [[Shane Ross]] which he published in the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' that brought the [[FÁS expenses scandal]] to a head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/in-the-spotlight-how-spending-saga-unfolded-1552805.html In the spotlight: How spending saga unfolded]&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents obtained by Senator Ross showed that some €643,000 had been spent over the course of four years on transatlantic travel promoting the agency's Science Challenge Programme. The expenses included items such as first class air fares, business class air fares and fares paid for by FÁS for spouses, rounds of golf as well as nail and beauty treatment. It also revealed that three Government ministers and two junior ministers had attended in that time for inconsequential reasons .

This revelation caused major controversy and pressure was brought to bear on FÁS Director General Roddy Molloy to resign, although [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]] spoke in support of Molloy both publicly and in the Dáil. Molloy went so far as to appear on the [[Pat Kenny]] Show on [[RTÉ Radio 1]] to defend the expenses incurred.

However, under ever increasing pressure, Molloy resigned as Director General on 25 November 2008.

In September 2009 the board announced it would resign and the Irish Times announced that legislation to restructure the organisation was expected in the following four weeks.&lt;ref&gt;

The report into the breakdown of internal controls in FÁS by the Comptroller and Auditor General was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audgen.gov.ie/documents/vfmreports/73_Internal__Control_in_FAS1.pdf Special Report 73: Internal Control and Governance in FÁS, January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution==
In July 2011 the Minister for Education and Skills announced that FÁS would be replaced by a new agency, named SOLAS, that would have responsibility for all public funding of further education and training. The training function of FÁS was absorbed into the restructured local [[Vocational Education Committee]]s which were retitled [[Education and Training Board]]s in July 2013.

'''''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule''''' (''Foreign Languages and University'') is a triannual [[academic journal]] published by the [[German Association of University Language Centers]].

==History==
The journal was created in 1968 under the title ''AKS-Rundbrief'' (= AKS-Circular) by the German Association of University Language Centers. Being a practice-oriented journal in the first phase of its existence, it has developed into an academic, at times empirical, journal throughout the years.

==Content and scope==
''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule'' covers [[second language acquisition]], [[language education]], and [[applied linguistics]], with [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[German language|German]] as foreign languages being the potential target languages. Intercultural analyses represent an important part as well. Publication languages are German as well as any of the languages mentioned above.

==Publication and editors==
''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule'' is published triannually by the German Association of Language Centers, which is a sub-organization of the [[European Association of Language Centers]]. There are three editors, with manuscripts requiring two positive votes.

==Article types==
In addition to academic [[Article (publishing)|articles]], [[book review]]s on relevant publications, including newly published [[textbook]]s, are also included. In addition, the journal publishes [[call for papers|calls for papers]] and [[academic conference]] announcements. The journal also serves as an information and publication platform for [[UNIcert]] - the international education and certification system for foreign languages taught at universities, which was founded in [[Germany]] and whose headquarters are located there.

{{History of art sidebar}}

The '''history of painting''' reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic humans, and spans all cultures. It represents a continuous, though periodically disrupted, tradition from Antiquity. Across cultures, and spanning continents and millennia, the history of painting is an ongoing river of creativity, that continues into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ColeGealt1991"&gt;{{cite book| author = Bruce Cole|author2=Adelheid M.

Developments in Eastern painting historically parallel those in [[Western painting]], in general, a few centuries earlier.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Meeting of Eastern and Western Art'', Revised and Expanded edition (Hardcover) by [[Michael Sullivan (art historian)|Michael Sullivan]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[African art]], [[Jewish art]], [[Islamic art]], [[Indian art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EED91E3CF933A25754C0A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |title=Art View; Eastern Art Through Western Eyes |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=30 November 2010 |date=10 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese art]], and [[Japanese art]]&lt;ref name="Publisher 1999"&gt;{{cite book| last = Wichmann| first = Siegfried| title = Japonisme: The Japanese Influence on Western Art Since 1858| year = 1999| isbn = 978-0-500-28163-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; each had significant influence on Western art, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Western Art 1989"&gt;{{cite book| last = Sullivan| first = Michael| title = The Meeting of Eastern and Western Art| year = 1989| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-05902-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially serving utilitarian purpose, followed by imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Eastern and Western painting later found audiences in the [[aristocracy]] and the middle class. From the Modern era, the [[Middle Ages]] through the [[Renaissance]] painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rr17bb/patronage.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:52:16 Discussion of the role of patrons in the Renaissance].

==Pre-history==
{{Main|Prehistoric art|Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Art of the Middle Paleolithic|List of Stone Age art}}

The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old. José Luis Sanchidrián at the [[University of Córdoba (Spain)|University of Cordoba]], Spain, believes the paintings are more likely to have been painted by [[Neanderthals]] than early modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21458-first-neanderthal-cave-paintings-discovered-in-spain.html|title=First Neanderthal cave paintings discovered in Spain |author=Fergal MacErlean|date=10 February 2012|accessdate=10 February 2012|work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18449711 Jonathan Amos, ''Red dot becomes oldest cave art'', BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5883082/this-is-the-first-painting-humanity-ever-made Gizmodo, ''These Are the Earliest Human Paintings Ever'']&lt;/ref&gt; Images at the [[Chauvet cave]] in France are thought to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc.

Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the people that made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily or the paintings may represent an [[animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]]. They may be the result of a basic need of expression that is [[innate]] to human beings, or they could have been for the transmission of practical information.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Paleolithic]] times, the representation of humans in cave paintings was rare. Mostly, animals were painted, not only animals that were used as food but also animals that represented strength like the [[rhinoceros]] or large [[Felidae]], as in the Chauvet Cave. Signs like dots were sometimes drawn. Rare human representations include handprints and stencils, and figures depicting [[therianthrope|human / animal]] hybrids. The Chauvet Cave in the [[Ardèche]] [[Departments of France]] contains the most important preserved cave paintings of the Paleolithic era, painted around 31,000 BC. The [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]] cave paintings in Spain were done 14,000 to 12,000 BC and show, among others, [[bison]]s. The hall of bulls in [[Lascaux]], Dordogne, France, is one of the best known cave paintings and dates to about 15,000 to 10,000 BC.

If there is meaning to the paintings, it remains unknown. The caves were not in an inhabited area, so they may have been used for seasonal rituals. The animals are accompanied by signs which suggest a possible magic use. Arrow-like symbols in Lascaux are sometimes interpreted as being used as [[calendar]]s or [[almanac]]s, but the evidence remains inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hoover, "Art of the Paleolithic and Neolithic Eras", from ''Art History Survey 1'', San Antonio College (July 2001; accessed 11 June 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The most important work of the [[Mesolithic]] era were the ''marching warriors'', a rock painting at Cingle de la Mola, [[Province of Castellón|Castellón]], Spain dated to about 7000 to 4000 BC. The technique used was probably spitting or blowing the pigments onto the rock. The paintings are quite naturalistic, though stylized. The figures are not three-dimensional, even though they overlap

The earliest known Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings. The colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

[[Chinese painting]] is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world. The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals. It was only during the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 B.C.) that artists began to represent the world around them. [[Japanese painting]] is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. The history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

China, Japan and Korea have a strong tradition in painting which is also highly attached to the art of [[calligraphy]] and [[printmaking]] (so much that it is commonly seen as painting). Far east traditional painting is characterized by water based techniques, less realism, "elegant" and stylized subjects, graphical approach to depiction, the importance of [[white space (visual arts)|white space]] (or [[negative space]]) and a preference for [[landscape]] (instead of the human figure) as a subject. Beyond ink and color on silk or paper scrolls, gold on [[lacquer]] was also a common medium in painted East Asian artwork. Although silk was a somewhat expensive medium to paint upon in the past, the invention of paper during the 1st century AD by the Han court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] provided not only a cheap and widespread medium for writing, but also a cheap and widespread medium for painting (making it more accessible to the public).

The ideologies of [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], and [[Buddhism]] played important roles in East Asian art. Medieval [[Song dynasty]] painters such as [[Lin Tinggui]] and his ''Luohan Laundering''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|title=Open F-S: Sketch after Cecil Lawson's Swan and Iris|website=Freer - Sackler|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611100744/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|archivedate=11 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (housed in the [[Smithsonian]] [[Freer Gallery of Art]]) of the 12th century are excellent examples of Buddhist ideas fused into classical Chinese artwork. In the latter painting on silk (image and description provided in the link), bald-headed Buddhist [[Arhat|Luohan]] are depicted in a practical setting of washing clothes by a river. However, the painting itself is visually stunning, with the Luohan portrayed in rich detail and bright, opaque colors in contrast to a hazy, brown, and bland wooded environment. Also, the tree tops are shrouded in swirling fog, providing the common "negative space" mentioned above in East Asian Art.

[[Image:Ch'iu Ying 001.jpg|left|thumb|''Spring Morning in the Han Palace'', by Ming-era artist [[Qiu Ying]] (1494–1552 AD)]]

The earliest surviving examples of Chinese painted artwork date to the [[Warring States]] Period (481 – 221 BC), with paintings on silk or tomb murals on rock, brick, or stone. They were often in simplistic stylized format and in more-or-less rudimentary geometric patterns. They often depicted mythological creatures, domestic scenes, labor scenes, or palatial scenes filled with officials at court. Artwork during this period and the subsequent [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 – 207 BC) and [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD) was made not as a means in and of itself or for higher personal expression; rather artwork was created to symbolize and honor funerary rites, representations of mythological deities or spirits of ancestors, etc. Paintings on silk of court officials and domestic scenes could be found during the Han Dynasty, along with scenes of men hunting on horseback or partaking in military parade. There was also painting on three dimensional works of art like figurines and statues, such as the original-painted colors covering the soldier and horse statues of the [[Terracotta Army]]. During the social and cultural climate of the ancient [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] (316 – 420 AD) based at Nanjing in the south, painting became one of the official pastimes of [[Confucian]]-taught bureaucratic officials and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] (along with music played by the [[guqin]] zither, writing fanciful [[calligraphy]], and writing and reciting of poetry). Painting became a common form of artistic self-expression, and during this period painters at court or amongst elite social circuits were judged and ranked by their peers.

The establishment of classical Chinese landscape painting is accredited largely to the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] artist [[Gu Kaizhi]] (344 – 406 AD), one of the most famous artists of Chinese history. Like the elongated scroll scenes of Kaizhi, [[Tang dynasty]] (618 – 907 AD) Chinese artists like [[Wu Daozi]] painted vivid and highly detailed artwork on long horizontal handscrolls (which were very popular during the Tang), such as his ''Eighty Seven Celestial People''. Painted artwork during the Tang period pertained the effects of an idealized landscape environment, with sparse numbers of objects, persons, or amount of activity, as well as monochromatic in nature (example: the murals of Price Yide's tomb in the Qianling Mausoleum). There were also figures such as early Tang-era painter [[Zhan Ziqian]], who painted superb landscape paintings that were well ahead of his day in portrayal of realism. However, landscape art did not reach greater level of maturity and realism in general until the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period (907 – 960 AD). During this time, there were exceptional landscape painters like [[Dong Yuan]] (refer to this article for an example of his artwork), and those who painted more vivid and realistic depictions of domestic scenes, like [[Gu Hongzhong]] and his ''Night Revels of Han Xizai''.
[[Image:Loquats and Mountain Bird.jpg|thumb|left|''Loquats and Mountain Bird'', anonymous artist of the [[Southern Song dynasty]]; paintings in leaf album style such as this were popular in the Southern Song (1127–1279).]]

During the Chinese [[Song dynasty]] (960 – 1279 AD), not only landscape art was improved upon, but portrait painting became more standardized and sophisticated than before (for example, refer to [[Emperor Huizong of Song]]), and reached its classical age maturity during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368 – 1644 AD). During the late 13th century and first half of the 14th century, Chinese under the [[Mongol]]-controlled [[Yuan Dynasty]] were not allowed to enter higher posts of government (reserved for Mongols or other ethnic groups from Central Asia), and the [[Imperial examination]] was ceased for the time being. Many Confucian-educated Chinese who now lacked profession turned to the arts of painting and theatre instead, as the Yuan period became one of the most vibrant and abundant eras for Chinese artwork. An example of such would be [[Qian Xuan]] (1235–1305 AD), who was an official of the Song dynasty, but out of patriotism, refused to serve the Yuan court and dedicated himself to painting. Examples of superb art from this period include the rich and detailed painted murals of the Yongle Palace ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405094841/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |archivedate=5 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=245&amp;c=55|title=Chinastudies - bacheloropleiding - Geesteswetenschappen - Humanities - Universiteit Leiden|website=www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Dachunyang Longevity Palace", of 1262 AD, a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage site. Within the palace, paintings cover an area of more than 1000 square meters, and hold mostly Daoist themes. It was during the Song dynasty that painters would also gather in social clubs or meetings to discuss their art or others' artwork, the praising of which often led to persuasions to trade and sell precious works of art. However, there were also many harsh critics of others art as well, showing the difference in style and taste amongst different painters. In 1088 AD, the polymath scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] once wrote of the artwork of one [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], who he criticized as follows:

{{quote|
...Then there was Li Cheng, who when he depicted [[pavilion]]s and lodges amidst mountains, storeyed buildings, [[pagoda]]s and the like, always used to paint the [[eave]]s as seen from below. His idea was that 'one should look upwards from underneath, just as a man standing on level ground and looking up at the eaves of a pagoda can see its rafters and its cantilever eave rafters'. This is all wrong. In general the proper way of painting a landscape is to see the small from the viewpoint of the large...just as one looks at artificial mountains in gardens (as one walks about). If one applies (Li's method) to the painting of real mountains, looking up at them from below, one can only see one profile at a time, and not the wealth of their multitudinous slopes and profiles, to say nothing of all that is going on in the valleys and [[canyon]]s, and in the lanes and [[courtyard]]s with their dwellings and houses. If we stand to the east of a mountain its western parts would be on the vanishing boundary of far-off distance, and vice versa. Surely this could not be called a successful painting? Mr. Li did not understand the principle of 'seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large'. He was certainly marvelous at diminishing accurately heights and distances, but should one attach such importance to the angles and corners of buildings?&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986).

Although high level of stylization, mystical appeal, and surreal elegance were often preferred over realism (such as in [[shan shui]] style), beginning with the medieval Song dynasty there were many Chinese painters then and afterwards who depicted scenes of nature that were vividly real. Later Ming Dynasty artists would take after this Song dynasty emphasis for intricate detail and realism on objects in nature, especially in depictions of animals (such as ducks, swans, sparrows, tigers, etc.) amongst patches of brightly colored flowers and thickets of brush and wood (a good example would be the anonymous Ming Dynasty painting ''Birds and Plum Blossoms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704090030/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-07-04|title=Request Rejected|website=www.asia.si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; housed in the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.). There were many renowned Ming Dynasty artists; [[Qiu Ying]] is an excellent example of a paramount Ming era painter (famous even in his own day), utilizing in his artwork domestic scenes, bustling palatial scenes, and nature scenes of river valleys and steeped mountains shrouded in mist and swirling clouds. During the Ming Dynasty there were also different and rivaling schools of art associated with painting, such as the [[Wu School]] and the [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]].

Classical Chinese painting continued on into the early modern [[Qing Dynasty]], with highly realistic portrait paintings like seen in the late Ming Dynasty of the early 17th century. The portraits of [[Kangxi Emperor]], [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and [[Qianlong Emperor]] are excellent examples of realistic Chinese portrait painting. During the Qianlong reign period and the continuing 19th century, European [[Baroque]] styles of painting had noticeable influence on Chinese portrait paintings, especially with painted visual effects of lighting and shading. Likewise, East Asian paintings and other works of art (such as [[porcelain]] and lacquerware) were highly prized in Europe since initial contact in the 16th century.

====Japanese ====
{{main|Japanese painting|Japonism}}

Japanese painting (絵画) is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the Japanese arts, encompassing a wide variety of genres and styles. As with Japanese arts in general, Japanese painting developed through a long history of synthesis and competition between native Japanese [[aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. [[Ukiyo-e]], or "pictures of the floating world," is a genre of Japanese [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] (or "[[woodcut]]s") and paintings produced between the 17th and 20th centuries, featuring motifs of landscapes, theater, and courtesan districts. It is the main artistic genre of [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock printing]]. Japanese printmaking, especially from the [[Edo period]], exerted enormous influence on [[French painting]] over the 19th century.

====Korean ====
{{main|Korean painting}}

Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy. It wasn't until the [[Joseon dynasty]] that Confucian themes began to take root in Korean paintings, used in harmony with indigenous aspects.

The history of Korean painting has been characterized by the use monochromatic works of black brushwork, often on mulberry paper or silk. This style is evident in "Min-Hwa", or colorful folk art, tomb paintings, and ritual and festival arts, both of which incorporated an extensive use of colour.

{{main|Indian painting|Mughal painting}}
Indian paintings historically revolved around the religious deities and kings. Indian art is a collective term for several different schools of art that existed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The paintings varied from large frescoes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] to the intricate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniature paintings to the metal embellished works from the [[Tanjore]] school. The paintings from the [[Gandhar(city/kingdom)|Gandhar]]–[[Taxila]] are influenced by the [[Persian art|Persian]] works in the west. The eastern style of painting was mostly developed around the [[Nalanda]] school of art. The works are mostly inspired by various scenes from [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]].

====History====
[[Image:Bhimbetka.JPG|thumb|[[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], [[rock painting]], [[Stone Age]], India]]

The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

[[Ajanta Caves]] in Maharashtra, India are [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] cave monuments dating back to the 2nd century [[BCE]] and containing paintings and sculpture considered to be masterpieces of both Buddhist religious art&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site.

;Madhubani painting
[[Madhubani painting]] is a style of Indian painting, practiced in the Mithila region of Bihar state, India. The origins of Madhubani painting are shrouded in antiquity.

=====Rajput =====
[[Rajput painting]], a style of [[Indian painting]], evolved and flourished, during the 18th century, in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]], India. Each Rajput kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans. Miniatures were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but several manuscripts also contain Rajput paintings, and paintings were even done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelies, particularly, the havelis of Shekhawait.

The colors extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones, gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colors was a lengthy process, sometimes taking weeks. Brushes used were very fine.

=====Mughal =====
[[File:Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India (Mughal school), ca. 1640–1650]]
[[Mughal painting]] is a particular style of [[Indian painting]], generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the [[Mughal Empire]] 16th −19th centuries.

=====Tanjore =====
[[Tanjore painting]] is an important form of classical [[South India]]n painting native to the town of [[Tanjore]] in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colors, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.

The process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or [[zinc oxide]] is mixed with water-soluble [[adhesive]] and applied on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild [[abrasive]] is sometimes used. After the drawing is made, decoration of the jewellery and the apparels in the image is done with semi-precious stones. Laces or threads are also used to decorate the jewellery. On top of this, the gold foils are pasted. Finally, [[dyes]] are used to add colors to the figures in the paintings.

=====Madras School=====
During British rule in India, the crown found that Madras had some of the most talented and intellectual artistic minds in the world. As the British had also established a huge settlement in and around Madras, Georgetown was chosen to establish an institute that would cater to the artistic expectations of the royal family in London. This has come to be known as the [[Madras School]]. At first traditional artists were employed to produce exquisite varieties of furniture, metal work, and curios and their work was sent to the royal palaces of the Queen.

Unlike the Bengal School where 'copying' is the norm of teaching, the Madras School flourishes on 'creating' new styles, arguments and trends.

=====Bengal School=====
{{main|Bengal school of art}}

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The [[Bengal school of art]] was an influential style of art that flourished in [[British India|India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators.

The Bengal School arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by [[Indian artist]]s such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianist]] model of art.

The Bengal School's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. In the post-independence period, Indian artists showed more adaptability as they borrowed freely from european styles and amalgamated them freely with the Indian motifs to new forms of art. While artists like [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[Tyeb Mehta]] were more western in their approach, there were others like [[Ganesh Pyne]] and [[Maqbool Fida Husain]] who developed thoroughly indigenous styles of work. Today after the process of liberalization of market in India, the artists are experiencing more exposure to the international art-scene which is helping them in emerging with newer forms of art which were hitherto not seen in India. [[Jitish Kallat]] had shot to fame in the late 1990s with his paintings which were both modern and beyond the scope of generic definition. However, while artists in India in the new century are trying out new styles, themes and metaphors, it would not have been possible to get such quick recognition without the aid of the business houses which are now entering the art field like they had never before.

=====Modern Indian =====
{{main|Modern Indian painting}}
[[Amrita Sher-Gil]] was an Indian painter, sometimes known as India's [[Frida Kahlo]],&lt;ref name="AmritaMaps"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/who-is-who/art-culture/amrita-sher-gill.html |title=Amrita Sher-Gill |publisher= mapsofindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today considered an important woman painter of 20th-century India, whose legacy stands at par with that of the Masters of [[Bengal Renaissance]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19991017/iex17018.html |title=First Lady of the Modern Canvas |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |date=17 October 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305222544/http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19991017/iex17018.html |archivedate=5 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indiawomenpainters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.21stcenturyindianart.com/women.htm |title=Women painters |publisher=21stcenturyindianart.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220174924/http://www.21stcenturyindianart.com/women.htm |archivedate=20 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; she is also the 'most expensive' woman painter of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.rediff.com/money/2007/dec/29art.htm |title=Most expensive Indian artists |publisher=us.rediff.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, she is amongst ''Nine Masters'', whose work was declared as ''art treasures'' by The [[Archaeological Survey of India]], in 1976 and 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chdmuseum.nic.in/art_gallery/nine_masters.html |title=Nine Masters |publisher=[[Government Museum and Art Gallery, Chandigarh]] Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204055532/http://chdmuseum.nic.in/art_gallery/nine_masters.html |archivedate=4 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 100 of her paintings are now displayed at [[National Gallery of Modern Art]], New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-amrita.asp |title= Showcase: Amrita Sher-Gil |publisher=National Gallery of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial era, Western influences started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like [[Jamini Roy]], consciously drew inspiration from folk art.

By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.

The [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists – [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza|F. N. Souza]], though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], and [[Akbar Padamsee]]. Other famous painters like [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Prokash Karmakar, [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], Narayanan Ramachandran, and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icons of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Geeta Vadhera has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.

Indian art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. In post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the abstract painter [[Natvar Bhavsar]], figurative artist [[Devajyoti Ray]] and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks.

Filipino painting as a whole can be seen as an amalgamation of many cultural influences, though it tends to be more Western in its current form with Eastern roots.

Early Filipino painting can be found in red slip (clay mixed with water) designs embellished on the ritual pottery of the Philippines such as the acclaimed [[Manunggul Jar]]. Evidence of Philippine pottery-making dated as early as 6000{{nbsp}}BC has been found in Sanga-sanga Cave, Sulu and Laurente Cave, Cagayan. It has been proven that by 5000{{nbsp}}BC, the making of pottery was practiced throughout the country. Early Filipinos started making pottery before their Cambodian neighbors and at about the same time as the Thais as part of what appears to be a widespread Ice Age development of pottery technology. Further evidences of painting are manifested in the [[History of tattooing#Philippines|tattoo tradition]] of early Filipinos, whom the Portuguese explorer referred to as ''Pintados'' or the 'Painted People' of the Visayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |title=Islas de los Pintados: The Visayan Islands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927161432/http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various designs referencing flora and fauna with heavenly bodies decorate their bodies in various colored pigmentation. Perhaps, some of the most elaborate painting done by early Filipinos that survive to the present day can be manifested among the arts and architecture of the [[Maranao]] who are well known for the [[Nāga]] Dragons and the [[Sarimanok]] carved and painted in the beautiful Panolong of their Torogan or King's House.

Filipinos began creating paintings in the European tradition during the 17th-century Spanish period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filipinocultured.blogspot.com/2007/09/best-of-filipino-art-part-1.html |title=Filipino Cultured: The Best of Filipino Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest of these paintings were Church frescoes, religious imagery from Biblical sources, as well as engravings, sculptures and lithographs featuring Christian icons and European nobility. Most of the paintings and sculptures between the 19th, and 20th century produced a mixture of religious, political, and landscape art works, with qualities of sweetness, dark, and light. Early [[modern art|modernist]] painters such as [[Damián Domingo]] was associated with religious and secular paintings. The art of [[Juan Luna]] and [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo|Félix Hidalgo]] showed a trend for political statement. Artist such as [[Fernando Amorsolo]] used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated Philippine culture, nature, and harmony. While other artists such as [[Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo|Fernando Zóbel]] used realities and [[abstract art|abstract]] on his work.

[[File:Hellenistic terracotta funerary wall painting.jpg|thumb|[[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic Greek]] [[terracotta]] funerary [[mural|wall painting]], 3rd century BC]]
[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with very strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colours) also had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s. Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language – called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today. Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the deceased to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] centered on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to that of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style. [[Mycenaean Greece]], beginning around 1600 BC, produced similar art to that of Minoan Crete. [[Ancient Greek art]] during the [[Greek Dark Age]] became far less complex, but the renewal of Greek civilization [[Colonies in antiquity|throughout the Mediterranean]] during [[Archaic Greece]] brought about new forms of Greek art with the [[Orientalizing period|Orientalizing style]].

[[File:Hades and Persephone, Vergina.jpg|thumb|400px|A fresco showing [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]] riding in a [[chariot]], from the tomb of Queen [[Eurydice I of Macedon]] at [[Vergina]], Greece, 4th century BC]]
[[Ancient Greece]] had skilled painters, sculptors (though both endeavours were regarded as mere manual labour at the time), and architects. The [[Parthenon]] is an example of their architecture that has lasted to modern days. Greek marble sculpture is often described as the highest form of [[classicism|Classical]] art. Painting on [[pottery of Ancient Greece]] and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in Ancient Greece functioned. [[Black-figure vase painting]] and [[Red-figure vase painting]] gives many surviving examples of what Greek painting was. Some famous Greek painters on wooden panels who are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], however no examples of Ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans. Zeuxis lived in 5–6{{nbsp}}BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes. Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the Ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.

In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as International style and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gained importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, heralded the study of classical sources, as well as advances in science which profoundly influenced European intellectual and artistic life. In the [[Low Countries]], especially in modern day [[Flanders]], a new way of painting was established in the beginning of the 15th century. In the footsteps of the developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430-437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose invention was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]], but painters like Jan van Eyck and [[Robert Campin]] brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism they were aiming for. With this new medium the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of Ancient Greece and Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism). The most important artist of this time was [[Jan van Eyck]], whose work ranks among the finest made by artists who are now known as [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painters]] or [[Flemish Primitives]] (since most artists were active in cities in modern day Flanders). The first painter of this period was [[the Master of Flémalle]], nowadays identified as [[Robert Campin]], whose work follows the art of the [[International Gothic]]. Another important painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists from this period are [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].

In Italy, the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. Artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Masaccio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the Renaissance such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] represent a different approach from their Italian colleagues, one that is more realistic and less idealized. [[Genre painting]] became a popular idiom amongst the Northern painters like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]].

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]]. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. During the period beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century, painting is characterized as Baroque. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Caravaggio]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], and [[Johannes Vermeer]]. Caravaggio is an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.
Baroque painting often dramatizes scenes using light effects; this can be seen in works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, [[Le Nain]], [[Georges de La Tour|La Tour]], and [[Jusepe de Ribera]].

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Jewish Bride'', ca.&amp;nbsp;1665–1669]]
In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky. A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].
This movement turned its attention toward landscape and nature as well as the human figure and the supremacy of natural order above mankind's will. There is a [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophy (see [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]) within this conception that opposes [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals by seeing mankind's destiny in a more tragic or pessimistic light. The idea that human beings are not above the forces of [[Nature]] is in contradiction to [[Ancient Greek]] and Renaissance ideals where mankind was above all things and owned his fate. This thinking led romantic artists to depict the [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublime]], ruined churches, shipwrecks, massacres and madness.

By the mid-19th-century painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. The idea "art for art's sake" began to find expression in the work of painters like Francisco de Goya, John Constable, and J.M.W. Turner. Romantic painters saw [[landscape painting]] as an important genre to express the vanity of mankind in opposition to the grandeur of nature. Until then, landscape painting wasn't considered the most important genre for painters (like portraiture or history painting). But painters like J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich managed to elevate landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[John Constable]]. [[Francisco de Goya]]'s late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, while the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James McNeill Whistler]] evoke both sophistication and [[decadent movement|decadence]]. In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708024742/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |last=Novack |first=Barbara |title=American Sublime Artforum |year=2002 |accessdate=30 October 2008 |work=ArtForum }}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the [[Hudson River School]].

[[Image:Mary Cassatt Young Mother Sewing.jpg|thumb|left|''Young Mother Sewing'', [[Mary Cassatt]]]]The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]] painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as does the paintings of [[Eugène Boudin]] who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors. Boudin was also an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[Plein air]] painting. A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]]. In the latter third of the century Impressionists like [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic pallette. Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].
[[Image:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Pissarro adopted some of the experiments of [[Post-Impressionism]]. Slightly younger Post-Impressionists like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges Seurat]], along with [[Paul Cézanne]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]; for Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism; Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like
compositions; Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.
The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]; and in Australia where painters of the [[Heidelberg School]] such as [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Charles Conder]] painted ''[[en plein air]]'' and were particularly interested in the Australian landscape and light. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms. The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], and [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustave Klimt]] amongst others including the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] like [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Delvaille| first = Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Delvaille| title = La poésie symboliste: [anthologie]| year = 1971| isbn = 978-2-221-50161-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century modern and contemporary===
{{main|Modern Art|Modernism|Contemporary art}}
The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]].

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Henri Matisse]]'s second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] 1907, Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[analytic Cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'', from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

Les Fauves (French for ''The Wild Beasts'') were early-20th-century painters, experimenting with freedom of expression through color. The name was given, humorously and not as a compliment, to the group by art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]]. [[Fauvism]] was a short-lived and loose grouping of early-20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. Fauvists made the subject of the painting easy to read, exaggerated perspectives and an interesting prescient prediction of the Fauves was expressed in 1888 by [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Paul Sérusier]],

''"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."''

The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] — friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John Elderfield|author2=Stephen Andrew Roberts| title = European Co-operation on Social Science Information and Documentation (ECSSID) Technical Meeting, University of Kent at Canterbury, 25th-26th March 1991: Report to British Library Research &amp; Development Department| year = 1991| isbn = 978-0-87070-638-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fauvism, as a movement, had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907, they only had three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse ''The Green Line'', (above), caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight; art as a decoration was his purpose and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], [[André Derain]] went to London and produced a series of paintings like ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' (above) in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]]. Masters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement throughout the 20th century.

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, soon it was replaced by [[Cubism]] on the critics' radar screen as the latest new development in [[Contemporary Art]] of the time.
In 1907 [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in La Falange, said, "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Stanley Rubin |author2=Judith Cousins |author3=Museum of Modern Art New York| title = Picasso and Braque: pioneering cubism| year = 1989| isbn = 0-87070-676-4| page = 348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Analytic cubism]]  was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

During the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio De Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade a member of the jury at the Salon d'Automne, where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and Salon d'Automne, his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. During the first half of the 20th century in Europe masters like [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], and [[Giorgio De Chirico]] continued painting independent of any movement.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after [[Cubism]], several other important movements emerged; [[futurism (art)|futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]), [[Der Blaue Reiter]]), [[Bauhaus]], ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) and ([[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]], [[Jean Arp|Arp]]) and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio De Chirico|De Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]], [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to advertising art and fashion. Van Gogh's painting exerted great influence upon 20th-century [[Expressionism]], as can be seen in the work of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Die Brücke]] (a group led by German painter [[Ernst Kirchner]]), and the Expressionism of [[Edvard Munch]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and others..

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] a Russian painter, [[printmaker]] and art theorist, one of the most famous 20th-century artists is generally considered the first important painter of [[Modern Art|modern]] abstract art. As an early Modernist, in search of new modes of visual expression, and spiritual expression, he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the (above gallery) ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art.'' [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His later works were more abstract, reminiscent of [[Paul Klee]]. His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color, and a clear love of experimentation of both depth and tone. At the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay and his wife the artist [[Sonia Delaunay]], joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of abstract artists, in 1911, and his art took a turn to the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 |title=Der Blaue Reiter |publisher= Tate Glossary |accessdate=10 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], who after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and after pressure from the [[Stalinist]] regime in 1924 returned to painting imagery and ''Peasants and Workers in the field'', and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]] whose masterful color experiments made him an important pioneer of [[abstract painting]] at the [[Bauhaus]]. Still other important pioneers of abstract painting include the Swedish artist [[Hilma af Klint]], Czech painter [[František Kupka]] as well as American artists [[Stanton MacDonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]] who, in 1912, founded [[Synchromism]], an art movement that closely resembles [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several important and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the avant-garde art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist artists are related to both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters.

Artists as interesting and diverse as [[Marc Chagall]], whose painting ''[[I and the Village]]'', (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Käthe Schmidt Kollwitz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and some of the Americans abroad like [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as an intense [[Surrealist]] sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Piet Mondrian]]'s art was also related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908 he became interested in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] movement launched by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge.

[[De Stijl]] also known as [[neoplasticism]], was a Dutch artistic movement founded in 1917. The term ''[[De Stijl]]'' is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=82|title=De Stijl|accessdate=31 July 2006|work=Tate Glossary|publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book| last = Curl| first = James Stevens| title = A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture| type = Paperback| edition = Second| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 0-19-860678-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''De Stijl'' is also the name of a journal that was published by the Dutch painter, designer, writer, and critic [[Theo van Doesburg]] propagating the group's theories. Next to van Doesburg, the group's principal members were the painters [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Vilmos Huszár]], and [[Bart van der Leck]], and the architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff]], and [[J. J. P. Oud]]. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as ''neoplasticism'' — the new plastic art (or ''Nieuwe Beelding'' in Dutch).

Proponents of De Stijl sought to express a new [[utopia]]n ideal of spiritual harmony and order. They advocated pure [[abstract art|abstraction]] and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to the vertical and horizontal directions, and used only [[primary colors]] along with black and white. Indeed, according to the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online article on neoplasticism, Mondrian himself sets forth these delimitations in his essay "Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art". He writes, "...&amp;nbsp;this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour." The Tate article further summarizes that this art allows "only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=191 |title=Neo-Plasticism |publisher=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article on De Stijl summarizes these traits in similar terms: "It [De Stijl] was posited on the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |title=The style; Holland, 1917 |publisher=guggenheimcollection.org |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821042905/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Stijl movement was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about "ideal" geometric forms (such as the "perfect straight line") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of [[mathematician]] [[M. H. J. Schoenmaekers]]. The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an "ism" (Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.

[[Marcel Duchamp]], came to international prominence in the wake of his notorious success at the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913, (soon after he denounced artmaking for [[chess]]). After Duchamp's [[Nude Descending a Staircase]] became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''[[Large Glass]]'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zurich]], Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several [[Dadaists]] are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]].'' The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the [[Dada]] movement through 1919 in [[Zurich]] and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. [[Joan Miró]]'s ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' of 1923–1924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Miró's first Surrealist masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved on 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Miró's ''The Tilled Field'' also contains several parallels to Bosch's ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights|Garden of Earthly Delights]]'': similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Miró saw as a young painter in [[The Prado]]. The more abstract [[Joan Miró]], [[Jean Arp]], [[André Masson]], and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.
Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works.

Dalí and [[René Magritte|Magritte]] created some of the most widely recognized images of the movement. The 1928/1929 painting ''This Is Not A Pipe'', by [[René Magritte|Magritte]] is the subject of a [[Michel Foucault]] 1973 book, ''This is not a Pipe'' (English edition, 1991), that discusses the painting and its [[paradox]]. Dalí joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.

Surrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth by stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, in order to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, and perception, sometimes evoking empathy from the viewer, sometimes laughter and sometimes outrage and bewilderment.

1931 marked a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: in one example, liquid shapes become the trademark of Dalí, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they are melting. Evocations of time and its compelling mystery and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79018 |title=The Persistence of Memory |publisher=MoMA Online Collection }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this style – a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological – came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[Modernism|modernist]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be "made whole with one's individuality."
[[File:Murdering Airplane.jpg|thumb|[[Max Ernst]], 1920, early [[Surrealism]]]]
Max Ernst whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'', studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=Max Ernst (1891–1976).

During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was enormously influential in helping the newly arrived in Paris and young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in the new [[Surrealist]] painting. Miró acknowledged in letters to his dealer [[Pierre Matisse]] the importance of Masson as an example to him in his early years in Paris.

Long after personal, political and professional tensions have fragmented the Surrealist group into thin air and ether, Magritte, Miró, Dalí and the other Surrealists continue to define a visual program in the arts. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]] among others.

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with [[Die Brücke]] which was founded the previous decade in 1905 and was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members of Die Brücke were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]], [[Otto Mueller]] and others. The group was one of the seminal ones, which in due course had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="bruckemuseumbrucke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm |title=The Artists' Association Brücke |publisher=Brücke Museum |accessdate=7 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'', 1909 is in the gallery above, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved.
[[File:Patrick Henry Bruce Stilleben.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[American modernism]], 1924]]

The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. It is also claimed that the name could have derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.

In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. Artists like [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], created reputations abroad. In New York City, [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock|Ralph Blakelock]] were influential and important figures in advanced American painting between 1900 and 1920. During the 1920s photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] exhibited [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[John Marin]] and other artists including European Masters [[Henri Matisse]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], at his gallery ''[[the 291]].''

[[File:Grant Wood - American Gothic - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Grant Wood]], 1930, [[social realism]]]]
During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, German Expressionism, Expressionism, and [[modernist]] and masterful color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] characterized the European art scene. In Germany [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II. While in America [[American Scene painting]] and the [[social realism]] and [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. In Latin America besides the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]] began a renaissance of the arts for the region, with a use of color and historic, and political messages. [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by [[Grant Wood]] from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting, like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. The film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' includes a dramatization of the controversy. [[Frida Kahlo]] (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are [[Self portrait|self-portraits]], which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition—which were often bloody and violent—with [[surrealist]] renderings. While her paintings are not overtly Christian – she was, after all, an avowed communist – they certainly contain elements of the macabre Mexican Christian style of religious paintings.

Political activism was an important piece of [[David Siqueiros]]' life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the [[Mexican Revolution]], a violent and chaotic period in Mexican history in which various social and political factions fought for recognition and power. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. He briefly gave up painting to focus on organizing miners in Jalisco.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to [[Surrealism]], including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was the scene of the "[[Bombing of Gernika]]" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. The town was devastated, though the Biscayan assembly and the Oak of Gernika survived. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.
[[Image:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]] [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]] 1937, protest against Fascism]]
In its final form, ''Guernica'' is an immense black and white, {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall and {{convert|7.8|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white contrasts with the intensity of the scene depicted and invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/cubism/Pablo-Picasso.html|title=Pablo Picasso – Biography, Quotes &amp; Paintings |publisher=arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Picasso painted the mural sized painting called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' in protest of the bombing. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then [[Scandinavia]], then London in 1938 and finally in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. The painting went on a tour of museums throughout the USA until its final return to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City where it was exhibited for nearly thirty years. Finally in accord with [[Pablo Picasso]]'s wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, through the years of World War II American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]] in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The scene was inspired by a [[diner]] (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's home neighborhood in [[Manhattan]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

The Dynamic for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazi's power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with [[Modernism]] and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] that many left for the Americas. ''[[Degenerate art]]'' was a term adopted by the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany for virtually all [[modern art]]. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevist]] in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely.

''Degenerate Art'' was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in [[Munich]] in 1937, consisting of modernist artworks chaotically hung and accompanied by text labels deriding the art. Designed to inflame public opinion against modernism, the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria. German artist [[Max Beckmann]] and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting Modernist painters led by [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], and others were just beginning to come of age.

[[Arshile Gorky]]'s portrait of someone who might be [[Willem de Kooning]] (above) is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

====Towards mid-century====
[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Edward Hopper]] 1942, [[American Scene painting]]]]
The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], Surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], Cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors. The figurative work of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Andrew Wyeth]] and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism.

Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]]. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[futurism (art)|futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]] and synthetic cubism. Abstract expressionism, [[action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

====Abstract expressionism====
{{main|Abstract expressionism|Action painting|Color Field painting|Lyrical Abstraction}}
[[File:Blue Poles (Jackson Pollock painting).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[Blue Poles]],'' 1952, [[National Gallery of Australia]]]]
Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. As seen above in the gallery ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]]'', [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV'', [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 |title=Willem De Kooning: Woman V 1952–53 |publisher= [[National Gallery of Australia]] |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'', 1950 as with [[Jackson Pollock]] and other Abstract Expressionists, was labelled an "action painter" because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color Field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] (gallery) can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color Field painting.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock.

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[Social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]] but also by the [[Socialist Realism|Social Realists]] of Mexico such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of those painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early 1940s at galleries in New York like ''[[The Art of This Century Gallery]]''. The late 1940s through the mid-1950s ushered in the [[McCarthy era]]. It was after World War II and a time of political conservatism and extreme artistic censorship in the United States. Some people have conjectured that since the subject matter was often totally abstract, Abstract expressionism became a safe strategy for artists to pursue this style. Abstract art could be seen as apolitical. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders. However, those theorists are in the minority. As the first truly original school of painting in America, Abstract expressionism demonstrated the vitality and creativity of the country in the post-war years, as well as its ability (or need) to develop an aesthetic sense that was not constrained by the European standards of beauty.

Although Abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of action painting, while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the Color Field painters. Many other artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[Nicolas Carone]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.  

During the 1950s Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s, ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]], – all moving in a new direction. Artists like Clyfford Still, [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In ''Mountains and Sea'', from 1952, a seminal work of [[Color Field]] painting by [[Helen Frankenthaler]] the artist used the stain technique for the first time.

In Europe there was the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to Abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Pierre Soulages]] among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.

Eventually abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism]] and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements, notably [[Pop art]].

====Pop art====

{{main|Pop art}}
Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Alloway| first = Lawrence| title = Topics in American art: since 1945| year = 1975| publisher = W.

[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s set the table for pop art in America. In New York City during the mid-1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works and the work of [[Larry Rivers]], were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion and the combining of mundane materials into their work. The innovations of Johns' specific use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the American flag; Rivers paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]], and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]] gave rise to a radical new movement in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as pop art.

American pop art is exemplified by artists: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein's most important work is arguably ''[[Whaam!]]'' (1963, [[Tate Modern]], London&lt;ref name="Tate_Whaam"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts a fighter aircraft firing a rocket into an enemy plane, with a red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is heightened by the use of the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] lettering ''"[[Whaam!]]"'' and the boxed caption ''"I pressed the fire control... and ahead of me rockets blazed through the sky..."''&lt;ref name=Tate_Whaam/&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'' the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. [[Sidney Janis]] mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in the fall of 1962 an historically important and ground-breaking ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' exhibition of pop art, curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] sent shock waves across the Western United States.

While in the downtown scene in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of [[Pop Art]]. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront and made painted objects, and the [[Green Gallery]] on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited other American artists including the bulk of the careers of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and his use of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and pop artists like [[Alex Katz]] (who became known for his parodies of portrait photography and suburban life), Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

While throughout the 20th century many painters continued to practice landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, like [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[David Hockney]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Vija Celmins]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

During the 1930s through the 1960s abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction, allowing figurative imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[still-life]] painter [[Giorgio Morandi]], [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], [[Elaine de Kooning]] and others. Along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]], and other 20th-century masters. In particular Milton Avery through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; ''Milton Avery &amp;ndash; Onrushing Waves'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, ''Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Head VI]]'', 1949 is a painting by the Irish born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Schmied| first = Wieland| title = Francis Bacon: commitment and conflict| year = 1996| publisher = Prestel Pub| isbn = 3-7913-1664-8| page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Peppiatt| first = Michael| title = เรื่องเก่าเล่าใหม่: รวมข้อคิดจากพงศาวดารและตํานานเก่า| year = 1998| publisher = Westview Press| isbn = 978-0-8133-3520-9| page = 147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p148&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian painter [[Giorgio Morandi]] was an important 20th-century early pioneer of Minimalism. Born in [[Bologna, Italy]] in 1890, throughout his career, Morandi concentrated almost exclusively on still lives and landscapes, except for a few self-portraits. With great sensitivity to tone, color, and compositional balance, he would depict the same familiar bottles and vases again and again in paintings notable for their simplicity of execution. Morandi executed 133 etchings, a significant body of work in its own right, and his drawings and watercolors often approach abstraction in their economy of means. Through his simple and repetitive motifs and economical use of color, value and surface, Morandi became a prescient and important forerunner of [[Minimalism]]. He died in Bologna in 1964.

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicholas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]] (who was always a figurative artist), and [[Nicolas de Staël|de Staël]], abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and he became one of the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël 's late work – in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. [[Nicolas de Staël]]'s bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop art of the 1960s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of [[Abstract expressionism]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[outsider art|art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L'Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] (in English: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[fluxus]], [[neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I, (Landscape No. 1),'' 1963, Oil on canvas, 60 1/4 x 50 1/2 inches, collection: [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]) and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The Bay Area Figurative Movement of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'', 1963 is a typical example were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Although throughout the 20th century painters continued to practice [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and use imagery, practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and others. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[John Baeder]] and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of writers, including [[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[James Schuyler]]. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on [[Great Spruce Head Island, Maine]].

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started 1n the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. Featuring the emergence of combined manufactured items, with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others were important pioneers of both abstraction and Pop Art; creating new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Color Field painting]] clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Color Field painting is related to [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[suprematism]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]].

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Color Field]] painting, his work can serve as a bridge between [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, and [[minimal art]]. Two influential teachers [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. [[Josef Albers]] is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both [[hard-edge painting]] and Op art.

[[Josef Albers]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Terry |last=Fenton |title=Online essay about Kenneth Noland, and acrylic paint |url=http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials |accessdate=30 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Al Held]] and some others like [[Mino Argento]],&lt;ref&gt;Noel, Frackman "Mino Argento create. These canvases in which geometric forms, squares, arcs, and lines", Arts Magazine p.19 December 1979&lt;/ref&gt; are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well.

In 1965, an exhibition called ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'', curated by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York City. The works shown were wide ranging, encompassing the [[Minimalism]] of [[Frank Stella]], the Op art of Larry Poons, the work of [[Alexander Liberman]], alongside the masters of the Op Art movement: [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], Bridget Riley and others. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use [[optical illusion]]s. Op art is also closely akin to [[geometric abstraction]] and [[hard-edge painting]]. Although sometimes the term used for it is perceptual abstraction.

Op art is a method of painting concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing.&lt;ref&gt;John Lancaster. ''Introducing Op Art'', London: BT Batsford Ltd, 1973, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Op art works are abstract, with many of the better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer looks at them, the impression is given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.

Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly [[abstract art|abstract]], formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Color Field]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against [[abstract expressionism]]s' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Another related movement of the late 1960s, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Conn. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyrical Abstraction]] in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[fluxus]] movement and [[postminimalism]] (a term first coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in the pages of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969)&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. [[Postminimalism]] often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"/&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[conceptual art]], [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], video, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], along with the continuation of fluxus, [[abstract expressionism]], [[Color Field]] painting, [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[op art]], [[pop art]], [[photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[contemporary art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. "The New Art: It's Way, Way Out", ''Newsweek'' 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.

Lyrical Abstraction shares similarities with color field painting and abstract expressionism, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] as exemplified by the 1968 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''For William Blake'', (above) especially in the freewheeling usage of paint – texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However, the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[abstract expressionism]] and [[action painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in Lyrical Abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.,&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], David Novros, Paul Mogenson, [[Charles Hinman]] are examples of artists associated with [[Minimalism]] and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and [[hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Minimalism]] and [[shaped canvas]] painting in New York City during the 1960s.

During the 1960s and 1970s artists such as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], Agnes Martin, [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like Brice Marden, [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web |title=Colorscope: Abstract Painting 1960–1979 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced a wide variety of paintings.

During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against abstract painting. Some critics viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the 'death of painting'. Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[video art]], [[installation art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]], [[body art]], [[fluxus]], [[happening]], [[mail art]], the [[situationists]] and [[conceptual art]] among others.

However still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[monochrome painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]] inspired by Ad Reinhardt, [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. Artists as diverse as Agnes Martin, Al Held, [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, [[minimal art]], hard-edge painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in [[abstract expressionism]], [[neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and postminimal painting.

====Neo Expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;

In the late 1960s the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery. His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' 1973, seen above in the gallery is an example of Guston's final and conclusive return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 1980s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]]. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. This type of art continues in popularity into the 21st century, even after the art crash of the late 1980s. [[Anselm Kiefer]] is a leading figure in European [[Neo-expressionism]] by the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and collective memory, but also [[occult]] [[symbol]]ism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]]. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.

During the late 1970s in the United States painters who began working with invigorated surfaces and who returned to imagery like [[Susan Rothenberg]] gained in popularity, especially as seen above in paintings like ''Horse 2'', 1979. During the 1980s American artists like [[Eric Fischl]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] (who began as a [[graffiti artist]]), [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], and Italian painters like [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], among others defined the idea of [[Neo-expressionism]] in America.

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with slightly younger artists like [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Keith Haring]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting.

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.

At the beginning of the 21st century Contemporary painting and Contemporary art in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on", and consequently "nothing going on" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently magnificent and important works of art continue to be made albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit.

[[Hard-edge painting]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[Hyperrealism (visual arts)|hyperrealism]], [[photorealism]], [[expressionism]], [[minimalism]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[pop art]], [[op art]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[Color Field]] painting, [[monochrome painting]], [[neo-expressionism]], [[collage]], [[intermedia]] painting, [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] painting, [[digital painting]], [[postmodern]] painting, [[neo-Dada]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting, environmental [[mural painting]], traditional [[Human physical appearance|figure]] painting, [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]], are a few continuing and current directions in painting at the beginning of the 21st century.

During the period before and after European exploration and settlement of the Americas, including North America, Central America, South America and the Islands of the Caribbean, the [[Antilles]], the [[Lesser Antilles]] and other island groups, indigenous native cultures produced creative works including architecture, [[pottery]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[weaving]], [[Wikt:carving|carving]], sculpture, painting and [[murals]] as well as other religious and utilitarian objects. Each continent of the Americas hosted societies that were unique and individually developed cultures; that produced totems, works of religious symbolism, and decorative and expressive painted works. African influence was especially strong in the art of the Caribbean and South America. The arts of the indigenous people of the Americas had an enormous impact and influence on [[European art]] and vice versa during and after the [[Age of Exploration]]. Spain, Portugal, France, The Netherlands, and England were all powerful and influential [[colonial power]]s in the Americas during and after the 15th century. By the 19th century cultural influence began to flow both ways across the Atlantic

The depiction of humans, animals or any other figurative subjects is forbidden within Islam to prevent believers from [[idolatry]] so there is no religiously motivated painting (or sculpture) tradition within Muslim culture. Pictorial activity was reduced to [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]], mainly [[Abstract art|abstract]], with [[geometrical]] configuration or floral and plant-like patterns. Strongly connected to architecture and [[calligraphy]], it can be widely seen as used for the painting of [[tile]]s in mosques or in illuminations around the text of the Koran and other books. In fact, abstract art is not an invention of modern art but it is present in [[pre-classical]], [[barbarian]] and non-western cultures many centuries before it and is essentially a decorative or [[applied art]]. Notable illustrator [[M. C. Escher]] was influenced by this geometrical and pattern-based art. [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Aubrey Beardsley]] and the architect [[Antonio Gaudí]]) re-introduced abstract floral patterns into western art.

Note that despite the taboo of figurative visualization, some Muslim countries did cultivate a rich tradition in painting, though not in its own right, but as a companion to the written word. Iranian or Persian art, widely known as Persian miniature, concentrates on the illustration of epic or romantic works of literature. Persian illustrators deliberately avoided the use of shading and perspective, though familiar with it in their pre-Islamic history, in order to abide by the rule of not creating any lifelike illusion of the real world. Their aim was not to depict the world as it is, but to create images of an ideal world of timeless beauty and perfect order.

In present days, painting by art students or professional artists in Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries follows the same tendencies of Western culture art.

===Iran===
{{main|Persian painting|Persian calligraphy|List of Persian painters|Iranian art}}
Oriental historian Basil Gray believes "Iran has offered a particularly unique {{sic}} art to the world which is excellent in its kind". Caves in Iran's Lorestan province exhibit painted imagery of animals and hunting scenes. Some such as those in Fars Province and Sialk are at least 5,000 years old. Painting in Iran is thought to have reached a climax during the Tamerlane era, when outstanding masters such as Kamaleddin Behzad gave birth to a new style of painting.

Paintings of the Qajar period are a combination of European influences and Safavid miniature schools of painting such as those introduced by [[Reza Abbasi]] and classical works by [[Mihr 'Ali]]. Masters such as [[Kamal-ol-molk]] further pushed forward the European influence in Iran. It was during the Qajar era when "Coffee House painting" emerged. Subjects of this style were often religious in nature depicting scenes from Shia epics and the like.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

African traditional culture and tribes do not seem to have great interest in two-dimensional representations in favour of sculpture and [[relief]]. However, decorative painting in African culture is often abstract and geometrical. Another pictorial manifestation is [[body painting]], and [[face painting]] present for example in [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Kĩkũyũ]] culture in their ceremony rituals. Ceremonial [[cave painting]] in certain villages can be found to be still in use. Note that [[Pablo Picasso]] and other modern artists were influenced by [[African sculpture]] and [[masks]] in their varied styles.
Contemporary African artists follow western art movements and their paintings have little difference from occidental art works.

The [[Kingdom of Kush]] in ancient [[Nubia]] (i.e. modern [[Sudan]]), bordering [[Ancient Egypt]], produced a wide variety of arts, including wall paintings and painted objects. At the Sudanese site of [[Kerma]], center of the [[Kerma culture]] that predated the [[History of Sudan|Kingdom of Kush]], a circa 1700 BC fragmentary painting from a royal tomb depicts a [[sailing ship]] and houses with ladders that are similar to scenes in reliefs from the reign of [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian queen]] [[Hatshepsut]] (c. 1479-1458 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Hatke, George (2013).

At the start of the 20th century, artists like [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] became aware of, and were inspired by, [[African art]].&lt;ref name="African Influences in Modern Art"&gt;Murrell, Denise. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aima/hd_aima.htm "African Influences in Modern Art"], ''[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'', April 2008. Retrieved on 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a situation where the established [[avant garde]] was straining against the constraints imposed by serving the world of appearances, African Art demonstrated the power of supremely well organised forms; produced not only by responding to the faculty of sight, but also and often primarily, the faculty of imagination, emotion and mystical and religious experience. These artists saw in African art a [[Formalism (art)|formal]] perfection and sophistication unified with phenomenal expressive power.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Theater of the Absurd''. 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J.

[[File:I modi raimondi.JPG|thumb|Surviving fragments of Raimondi's second edition of ''I Modi'' in the [[British Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1434793&amp;partid=1 British Museum collection database]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''''I Modi''''' (''The Ways''), also known as '''''The Sixteen Pleasures''''' or under the Latin title '''''De omnibus Veneris Schematibus''''', is a famous [[Erotic art|erotic]] book of the [[Italian Renaissance]] in which a series of sexual positions were explicitly depicted in engravings.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kendrick, ''The Secret Museum, Pornography in Modern Culture'' (1987:59)&lt;/ref&gt; While the original edition was apparently completely destroyed by the [[Catholic Church]], fragments of a later edition survived. The second edition was accompanied by sonnets written by [[Pietro Aretino]], which described the sexual acts depicted. The original illustrations were probably copied by [[Agostino Caracci]], whose version survives.

==Original edition==
{{See also|History of erotic depictions#Printing}}
The original edition was created by the engraver [[Marcantonio Raimondi]], basing his sixteen images of [[sexual position]]s on, according to the traditional view, a series of erotic paintings that [[Giulio Romano]] was doing as a commission for [[Frederick II, Duke of Mantua|Federico II Gonzaga]]’s new [[Palazzo Te]] in [[Mantua]].&lt;ref&gt;''I Modi: the sixteen pleasures. An erotic album of the Italian renaissance / Giulio Romano … [et al.]'' edited, translated from the Italian and with a commentary by Lynne Lawner. Northwestern University Press, 1988. {{ISBN|0-7206-0724-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raimondi had worked extensively with Romano's master [[Raphael]], who had died in 1520, producing prints to his design. The engravings were published by Raimondi in 1524, and led to his imprisonment by [[Pope Clement VII]] and the destruction of all copies of the illustrations. Romano did not become aware of the engravings until the poet [[Pietro Aretino]] came to see the original paintings while Romano was still working on them. Romano was not prosecuted since—unlike Raimondi—his images were not intended for public consumption. Aretino then composed sixteen explicit&lt;ref&gt;Sample quote: “both in your [[Vagina|pussy]] and your [[Anal sex|behind]], my [[Penis|cock]] will make me [[Male orgasm|happy]], and you happy and [[Female orgasm|blissful]]”&lt;/ref&gt; [[sonnet]]s to accompany the paintings/engravings, and secured Raimondi’s release from prison.

''I Modi'' were then published a second time in 1527, now with the poems that have given them the traditional English title ''Aretino's Postures'', making this the first time erotic text and images were combined, though the papacy once more seized all the copies it could find. Raimondi escaped prison on this occasion, but the suppression on both occasions was comprehensive. No original copies of this edition have survived, with the exception of a few fragments in the [[British Museum]], and two copies of posture 1. A, possibly infringing&lt;ref&gt;Max Sander, who discovered the volume, believes it to be the original 1527 edition; other scholars dispute this. vid. ''A History of Erotic Literature'', P.J. Kearney, Macmillan 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; copy with crude illustrations in [[woodcut]], printed in Venice in 1550,&lt;ref&gt;formerly owned by [[Toscanini]], now in a private collection; [http://www.eroti-cart.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=93_94 illustrations here]&lt;/ref&gt; and bound in with some contemporary texts was discovered in the 1920s, containing fifteen of the sixteen postures.&lt;ref&gt;The images in this edition appear in reverse next to the British Museum fragments, clear evidence that they are copied from a set of prints and not from the original paintings, since engravers and woodcutters of the period do not habitually re-reverse their images, and their quality is such that one might doubt that the artist would even have been capable of doing so.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Despite the seeming loss of Raimondi’s originals today, it seems certain that at least one full set survived, since both the 1550 woodcuts and the so-called Caracci suite of prints (see below) agree in every compositional and stylistic respect with those fragments that have survived. Certainly, unless the engraver of the Caracci edition had access to the British Museum’s fragments, and reconstructed his compositions from them, the similarities are too close to be accidental.&lt;ref&gt;The Caracci suite contains eighteen images plus frontispiece, however.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 17th century, certain Fellows of [[All Souls College, Oxford]], engaged in the surreptitious printing at the [[Oxford University Press|University Press]] of ''Aretino's Postures'', Aretino's ''De omnis Veneris schematibus'' and the indecent engravings after Giulio Romano. The Dean, Dr. [[John Fell (bishop)|John Fell]], impounded the copper plates and threatened those involved  with expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. W. Ketton-Cremer]], "Humphrey Prideaux", ''Norfolk Assembly'' (London: Faber &amp; Faber) 1957:65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the 19th century [[Jean Frederic Waldeck]] published a new edition of the work, claiming to be based on a set of tracings he made of the ''I Modi'' prints found in a convent near [[Palenque]] in [[Mexico]], but more likely a direct copy of a combination of the BM fragments and the Caracci edition, since no such convent exists, and it is hardly likely to have harboured such material in its library.&lt;/ref&gt; The text of Aretino’s sonnets, however, survives.
&lt;!---Unreferenced for now - Another traditional version of the story has it that Romano was working on frescoes in the Papal apartments at the new Vatican and, after a dispute about money painted the “I Modi” images on the wall before leaving Rome. These became a popular attraction and were seen by Aretino, who composed his suite of verses, which circulated around Rome and were seen by Raimondi. Thus, according to this version, the compositions which we attach to the “I Modi” verses were composed after Aretino’s poems, not the original Romano paintings.&lt;ref&gt;I am working on a reference for this.&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;

The Restoration closet drama ''[[Farce of Sodom]]'' is set in "an antechamber hung with Aretine's postures."

==Later edition==
[[Image:Carracci - Jupiter et Junon.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Annibale Carracci|Annibale’s]] ''Loves of the Gods'']]
A new series of graphic and explicit engravings of sexual positions was produced by [[Camillo Procaccini]]&lt;ref&gt;Francis Haskell, ''Taste and the Antique'', ({{ISBN|0-300-02641-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt; or more likely by [[Agostino Carracci]] for a later reprint of Aretino's poems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/er_in_art/14a.html Erotica in Art — Agostino Carracci in the “History of Art”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125113753/http://www.all-art.org/er_in_art/14a.html |date=2006-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ironie.free.fr/iro_84.html IRONIE, article on Carracci’s engravings (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their production was in spite of their artist’s working in a post-[[Council of Trent|Tridentine]] environment that encouraged religious art and restricted secular and public art. They are best known from the 1798 edition of the work printed in Paris as “L'Arétin d'Augustin Carrache ou Recueil de Postures Érotiques, d'Après les Gravures à l'Eau-Forte par cet Artiste Célèbre, Avec le Texte Explicatif des Sujets” (“The ‘Aretino’ of Agostino Carracci, or a collection of erotic poses, after Carracci’s engravings, by this famous artist, with the explicit texts on the subject”. "This famous artist" was [[Jacques Joseph Coiny]] (1761 - 1809).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venusem.net/Museum/Pietro_Aretino_Illustrations/E269D42/ Venus Erotic Art Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Agostino’s brother [[Annibale Carracci]] also completed the elaborate fresco of ''[[The Loves of the Gods (Carracci)|Loves of the Gods]]'' for the [[Palazzo Farnese]] in Rome (where the [[Farnese Hercules]] which influenced them both was housed). These images were drawn from Ovid’s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' and include nudes, but (in contrast to the sexual engravings) are not explicit, intimating rather than directly depicting the act of [[sexual intercourse|lovemaking]].

===Classical guise===
Several factors were used to cloak these engravings in classical scholarly respectability:
* The images nominally depicted famous pairings of lovers (e.g. Antony and Cleopatra) or husband-and-wife deities (e.g. [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]) from classical history and mythology engaged in sexual activity, and were entitled as such. Related to this were:
** Portraying them with their usual attributes, such as:
*** [[:Image:Carracci Antoine et Cleopatre.jpg|Cleopatra's banquets]], bottom left
*** [[:Image:Carracci Achille et Briseis.jpg|Achilles's]] [[Shield of Achilles|shield]] and helmet, bottom left
*** [[:Image:HerculeDejanire.jpg|Hercules in his lion-skin and club]]
*** [[:Image:MarsVenus.jpg|Mars with his cuirass]]
*** [[:Image:Paris et Oenone.jpg|Paris as a shepherd]]
*** [[:Image:BachusAriane.jpg|Bacchus with his vine-leaf crown and (bottom right) grapes]]
** Referring to the best known myths or historical events in which they appeared e.g.:
*** [[:Image:MarsVenus.jpg|Mars and Venus]] [[Aphrodite#Marriage with Hephaestus|under the net which her husband Vulcan has designed to catch them]]
*** '[[Aeneas]]' and '[[Dido]]' [[:Image:EneeDidon.jpg|in the cave in which their sexual intercourse is alluded]] in ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[s:Aeneid/Book IV|Book 4]]
*** [[Theseus]] [[:Image:BachusAriane.jpg|abandoning]] [[Ariadne#Naxos|Ariadne on Naxos]], where [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] finds and marries her.&lt;ref&gt;Theseus's departing ship is visible on the horizon, top right.&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[:Image:Carracci05.jpg|the wide adultery]] of [[Julia the Elder#Scandal|Julia]]
*** [[Messalina#Reputation|Messalina]]'s [[:Image:MessalineLisisca.jpg|participation in prostitution]], as criticised in Juvenal's [[Satire VI]].
** Referring to other Renaissance and classical [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] in the depiction of these people and deities, such as
*** [[:Image:MarsVenus.jpg|The contrast]] between Mars's dark hair and tanned skin and his partner Venus's untanned, fair skin and fair or even blond hair.&lt;ref&gt;This trope did not fully exist in classical art -
in [[:Image:Meister der Aldobrandinischen Hochzeit 001.jpg|frescoes]] and [[polychromy|polychromatic sculptures]], Venus was always fair-skinned, but her hair colour could vary from brown through to blond – but became fixed due to medieval and Renaissance art (e.g. [[:Image:Venus and Mars.jpg|Botticelli's ''Venus and Mars'']]).&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[:Image:Carracci Jupiter et Junoncrop.jpg|Jupiter's full beard]]&lt;ref&gt;A trope copied from [[:Image:Bust of Zeus.jpg|classical]] ''and'' [[:Image:Carracci - Jupiter et Junon.jpeg|Renaissance]] sources.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[:Image:Carracci Venus Genitrice.jpg|the frontispiece image]] is entitled [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Genetrix]],&lt;ref&gt;An attested epithet of the love/lust goddess Venus, although under that name she was more a mother goddess than a love/lust goddess.&lt;/ref&gt; and the goddess is nude and drawn in a chariot by doves, as in the classical sources.
* the bodies of those depicted show clear influences from classical statuary known at the time, such as:
** the over-muscled [[torso]]s and backs of the men&lt;ref&gt;Also, in [[:Image:MarsVenus.jpg|one]] or [[:Image:BachusAriane.jpg|two]] cases, the women's, though this has far less, if any, precedent in classical sculpture.&lt;/ref&gt;(drawn from sculptures such as the ''[[Laocoön and his Sons]]'', ''[[Belvedere Torso]]'', and ''Farnese Hercules'').&lt;ref&gt;See also the modern phenomenon of the [[beefcake]] in erotic art.&lt;/ref&gt;
** the women's clearly defined though small [[breast]]s (drawn from examples such as the [[Venus de' Medici]] and [[Aphrodite of Cnidus]])&lt;ref&gt;Though their [[:Image:PolyenosChrisis.jpg|thighs]] are often larger than in the examples from classical statuary.&lt;/ref&gt;
** the elaborate hairstyles of some of the women, such as his [[:Image:Carracci Venus Genitrice.jpg|Venus]], [[:Image:Carracci Jupiter et Junoncrop.jpg|Juno]] or [[:Image:Carracci Antoine et Cleopatre.jpg|Cleopatra]] (derived from Roman Imperial era busts such as [[:Image:Domitia.JPG|this one]]).
* Portraying the action in a classical 'stage set' such as [[:Image:PolyenosChrisis.jpg|an ancient Greek sanctuary]] or [[:Image:Carracci Achille et Briseis.jpg|temple]].
* The large [[phallus|erect penis]] on the statue of [[Priapus]] or [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] atop a [[puteal]] in [[:Image:CultePriape.jpg|'The Cult of Priapus']] is derived from examples in classical sculpture and painting (like [[:Image:Priapus Fresco.jpg|this fresco]]) which were beginning to be found archaeologically at this time.&lt;ref&gt;On the other hand, the posture in the engraving is not to be found in any known examples and is probably Caracci's own invention. Certainly archaeological examples usually ([[:Image:Mercury god.jpg|though not always]]) tend to show Priapus's erect and oversized penis hanging down, not standing up parallel with his chest as here, and give less importance to large or oversized [[testicle]]s than in this engraving.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences from antique art===
The work has various points of deviation from classical literature, erotica, mythology and art which suggest its classical learning is lightly worn, and make clear its actual modern setting:
* The male [[sexual partner]]s' large penises (though not Priapus's) are the artist's invention rather than a classical borrowing – the idealised penis in classical art was small, not large (large penises were seen as comic or fertility symbols, as for example on [[Priapus]], as discussed above).
* The title [[:Image:PolyenosChrisis.jpg|'Polyenus and Chryseis']] pairs the fictional Polyenus with the actual mythological character [[Chryseis]].
* The title [[:Image:AlcibiadeGlycere.jpg|'Alcibiades and Glycera']] pairs two historical figures from different periods – the 5th century BC [[Alcibiades]] and the 4th century BC [[Glycera (courtesan)|Glycera]]
* Female satyrs did not occur in classical mythology, yet they appear twice in this work (in [[:Image:SatyreFemme.jpg|'The Satyr and his wife']] and [[:Image:CultePriape.jpg|'The Cult of Priapus']]).&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Carracci Le Satyre et la Nymphe.jpg|Male satyrs]] having sex with [[nymph]]s, on the other hand, did appear in Greek myth – as has been taken up in [[:Image:Correggio 029.jpg|Renaissance art]] – , though this was more frequently [[rape]] in the myths rather than the apparent [[Informed consent#Sex|consensual sex]] in the engraving.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All the women and goddesses in this work (but most clearly [[:Image:Carracci Venus Genitrice.jpg|its Venus Genetrix]]) have a [[pubic hair|hairless]] groin (like classical statuary of nude females) but also a clearly apparent [[vulva]] (unlike classical statuary).&lt;ref&gt;The men's pubic hair in the engravings does not pose a problem, since pubic hair ''was'' depicted on ancient nudes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The modern furniture, e.g.
** The various stools and cushions used to support the participants or otherwise raise them into the right positions (e.g. [[:Image:AlcibiadeGlycere.jpg|here]])
** The other [[sex aid]]s (e.g. a [[:Image:PolyenosChrisis.jpg|whip]], bottom right)
** The 16th century beds, with ornate curtains, carvings, taselled cushions, bedposts, etc.

'''Iberulites''' are a particular type of [[microspherulite]]s that develop in the atmosphere ([[troposphere]]), finally falling to the earth's surface. The name comes from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] where they were discovered.&lt;ref name="vr1"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L. (2000).

''Estudios Geológicos'', '''56''': 153–161&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

An iberulite is a ''co-association'' {{#tag:ref|''Co-association'': heterogeneous mixture of reactive mineral phases. These complex associations are typically formed in nature and are characterized by high surface area, low abundance of metal oxyhydroxide phases, and organic materials that act as cementing agents or surface coatings of prominent mineral grains.&lt;ref&gt;Berstch P. M. y Seaman J. C. (1999). «[http://www.pnas.org/content/96/7/3350.full.pdf+html Characterization of complex mineral assemblages: implications for contaminant transport and environmental remediation]». ''Proceedings National Academy of Sciences USA'', '''96''': 3350–3357&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} with [[wikt:axial|axial]] geometry, consisting of well-defined mineral grains, together with non-crystalline compounds, structured around a [[Granularity|coarse-grained]] core with a [[Clay minerals|smectite]] rind, only one [[vortex]] and pinkish color, formed in the troposphere by complex [[aerosol]]-water-gas interactions.

== Formation ==

=== Shape ===

The aqueous interphase hypothesis has been suggested as the mechanism for tropospheric formation of iberulites:&lt;ref name="vr1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vr2"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L. y Párraga (2008) «[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V66-4SMF02R-2&amp;_user=4628667&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000063621&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=4628667&amp;md5=5843fd2d6d65e0463f855c71151fb906 The nature and tropospheric formation of iberulites: Pinkish mineral microspherulites]». ''Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta'', '''72''': 3883–3906&lt;/ref&gt; interactions between water droplets and Saharan aerosols create complex [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamic]] conditions &lt;ref name="vrs"&gt;Pruppacher H. R. y Klett J. D. (1997). ''Microphysics of clouds and precipitation'' (2ª ed.) Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers. 954 págs.&lt;/ref&gt; causing the possibility of collisions (wake capture and front capture) {{#tag:ref|''Wake capture'': This is a mode of aerodynamic capture of a drop falling in the atmosphere. A large drop settling through smaller drops will sweep out a volume and their hydrodynamic flow fields interfere collecting aerosols/droplets with some efficiency by the wake, depending on size of drops and size of aerosols, being most efficient for large and giant aerosols due to high terminal velocity and cross-sectional area.&lt;ref name="vrs"/&gt;|group=note}} that produce the "precursor water droplets" of the iberulites.&lt;ref name="vr1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vr2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrs"/&gt; The movement of this water drop to lower tropospheric levels implies either simultaneous or consecutive processes such as [[Coalescence (meteorology)|coalescence]], formation of vortex and [[downdraught]]. During this phase the iberulites acquire their spherical shape and internal structure (core and rind) although this shape can be distorted by adaptation to plant filaments.

=== Compositional attributes ===

The core is mainly formed by grains of [[quartz]], [[calcite]], [[dolomite]] and [[feldspar]]s. The rind shows [[clay minerals]], mainly [[Clay minerals|smectites]] (beidellite, [[montmorillonite]]) and [[illite]], [[sulfate]]s, chlorides and amorphous [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]. The latter group of minerals are mainly neoformed during the maturation process, that occurs in the atmosphere during the final stages of iberulite formation. Flight over areas with volcanic sulfur emissions (North Atlantic archipelagos) {{#tag:ref|''Volcanic sulfur emissions'': Sulfur and other gas emissions into the atmosphere from inside the earth occur near volcanic areas. These emissions can come from both clearly visible (explosive) eruptions and from diffuse (or quiescent) emissions, and there is not a real consensus about the relative importance of the latter. At present, submarine volcanic emissions occur in the [[mid-ocean ridge]]s, and also as [[Volcano|intraplate volcanism]] ([[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]); subaerial terrestrial volcanism is related with destructive plate margins [[Convergent boundary]], [[Plate tectonics]], ([[Island arc|volcanic arcs]] above [[subduction|subduction zones]]).|group=note}} probably incorporates [[sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] onto the iberulite surface and descent to the ''marine boundary layer'' (MBL)  {{#tag:ref|''Marine boundary layer'': This is defined as that part of the troposphere directly influenced by the presence of the ocean's surface. It reacts with little diurnal variability, is 1–2 km thick (3 km max), has a low [[Bowen ratio]] and a significant wave state. The marine boundary layer (MBL) over the earth's oceans plays a critical role in regulating surface energy and moisture fluxes and in controlling the convective transfer of energy and moisture to the free atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Kloesel, K. A. y Albrecht, B. A. (1989). «[http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0493/117/1/pdf/i1520-0493-117-1-87.pdf Low-level inversions over the tropical Pacific.

Finally they fall on the southern Iberian Peninsula, where they were found.
[[File:Saharan dusty event.jpg|thumb|Saharan dusty event occurring on August 15, 2005. Notice the change of direction of the plume towards the Cadiz Gulf.]]

=== Maturation ===

In detail, the atmospheric maturation process only occurs on the smectite rind, by means of [[Heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] and multiphase reactions {{#tag:ref|''Multiphase reactions'': These refer to reactions involving components in different phases, and are a combination of simultaneous phase change and conversion of some materials into others. A general multiphase reaction generates three classes of fluxes: component mass sources, interphase mass transfer, interphase energy transfer.|group=note}} producing sulfates as the result of [[Sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] attack on the minerals of the rind. This would lead to the rapid transformation of some primary minerals into products of atmospheric neoformation {{#tag:ref|''Neoformation'': This is the formation of new mineral species from previously existing ones through alteration of environmental conditions. The new minerals thus produced are therefore stable in the new conditions.|group=note}} secondary minerals): the sulfates (mainly the [[gypsum]]) would be the product of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; attack on the interlayer cations of the smectites, which would gradually destroy the octahedral and tetrahedral {{#tag:ref|''Tetrahedral, octahedral and interlayer sheets'': The basic structural feature of the phyllosilicates is the stack of three types of layers: the tetrahedral sheet is formed by SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra, and each tetrahedron shares three of its vertex oxygen atoms with other tetrahedra and in which the Al can substitute up to half the Si. The octahedral sheet is made up by the Al, Fe and Mg cations, in six-coordination with the O and OH anions. Depending on the composition of the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets, the layer will have no charge, or will have a net negative charge. If the layers are charged this charge is balanced by interlayer cations such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. In each case the interlayer can also contain water. The crystal structure is formed from a stack of layers interspaced with the interlayers.|group=note}} sheets of [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicates]] creating mixed sulfates.

The [[alunite]] - [[jarosite]] found in the smectite rind would have a similar origin. If acid attack progresses further, the phyllosilicate grains would be completely destroyed, producing amorphous silica and releasing [[Iron|Fe]]. Since [[biogenic]] exoskeletons have no signs of [[corrosion]], they must have been incorporated after the acid attack described above, probably simultaneously with the incorporation of sea salt.

=== Formation environment ===

Iberulites are linked to the evolution of high-dust air masses (plumes) which, originating in Saharan dust storms, are transported over the Iberian Peninsula and often across the eastern North Atlantic Ocean. These plumes occur in the warm season (May to September), as a result of anticyclonic activity affecting the Iberian Peninsula, and only sporadically in spring and autumn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1951">The '''Institute of Zoology''' (IoZ) is the research division of the [[Zoological Society of London]] (ZSL) in England. It is a government-funded research institute specialising in scientific issues relevant to the conservation of animal species and their habitats. The Institute is based alongside [[London Zoo]] at ZSL's [[Regent's Park]] site in the [[City of Westminster]].

The Institute has around 25 full-time research staff, plus [[postdoctoral research]] assistants, technicians and [[Ph.D.]] students. The Institute is supported by the Higher Education Funding Council for England in partnership with the [[University of Cambridge]], and receives additional research funding from UK research councils ([[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]], [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council|BBSRC]], [[Economic and Social Research Council|ESRC]]) and research charities (the [[Wellcome Trust]] and the [[Leverhulme Trust]]). Research covers many fundamental aspects of biological sciences which have relevance to the conservation of animal species and their habitats.

The Institute offers research training through [[Ph.D.]] [[studentship]]s, and hosts Undergraduate and Masters level research projects conducted as part of its own [[Master's degree|M.Sc.]] courses and courses at other institutions. Undergraduate projects are available at [[London Zoo]] and [[Whipsnade Zoo]].

'''Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann''' ({{IPA-de|ˈlaxman|lang}}; 4 March 1793 – 13 March 1851) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philologist]] and [[critic]]. He is particularly noted for his foundational contributions to the field of [[textual criticism]].

==Biography==

Lachmann was born in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], in present-day [[Lower Saxony]]. He studied at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], devoting himself mainly to philological studies. In [[Göttingen]], he founded a critical and philological society in 1811, in conjunction with [[Georg Ludolf Dissen|Dissen]], [[Ernst Schulze (poet)|Schulze]], and [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen|Bunsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Lachmann, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ADB|17|471|481|Lachmann, Karl|Wilhelm Scherer|ADB:Lachmann, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, he joined the [[Prussian army]] as a volunteer ''[[chasseur]]'' and accompanied his detachment to [[Paris]], but did not see active service. In 1816, he became an assistant master in the Friedrichswerder [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at Berlin, and a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the university. The same summer he became one of the principal masters in the Friedrichs-Gymnasium of [[Königsberg]], where he assisted his colleague, the Germanist [[Friedrich Karl Köpke]], with his edition of [[Rudolf von Ems]]' ''[[Barlaam und Josaphat]]'' (1818), and also assisted his friend in a contemplated edition of the works of [[Walther von der Vogelweide]].

In January 1818, he became professor extraordinarius of classical philology in the [[University of Königsberg]], and at the same time began to lecture on [[Old German]] [[grammar]] and the [[Middle High German]] poets. He devoted himself during the following seven years to an extraordinarily detailed study of those subjects, and in 1824, obtained a leave of absence in order to search the libraries of middle and south Germany for further materials.

In 1825, Lachmann was nominated extraordinary professor of classical and German philology at the [[Humboldt University]], Berlin (ordinary professor 1827); in 1830, he was admitted a member of the [[Academy of Sciences]]. He died in [[Berlin]].

==Importance in scholarship==

Lachmann is a figure of considerable importance in the history of German philology.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Rudolf von Raumer]], ''Geschichte der germanischen Philologie'', 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career, Lachmann translated the first volume of P.E. Müller's ''Sagabibliothek des skandinavischen Altertums'' (1816). In his ''"Habilitationsschrift" über die ursprungliche Gestalt des Gedichts von der Nibelungen Noth'' (1816), and in his review of [[Friedrich Heinrich von der Hagen|Hagen]]'s ''Nibelungen'' and [[Georg Friedrich Benecke|Benecke]]'s ''Bonerius'', contributed in 1817 to the ''Jenaische Literaturzeitung'', he had already laid down the rules of [[textual criticism]] and elucidated the phonetic and metrical principles of Middle High German in a manner which marked a distinct advance in that branch of investigation.

The rigidly scientific character of his method becomes increasingly apparent in the ''Auswahl aus den hochdeutschen Dichtern des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts'' (1820); in the edition of [[Hartmann von Aue|Hartmann]]'s ''Iwein'' (1827); in those of Walther von der Vogelweide (1827) and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] (1833); in the papers "''Über das [[Hildebrandslied]]''," "''Über althochdeutsche Betonung und Verskunst''," "''Über den Eingang des Parzivals''," and "''Über drei Bruchstücke niederrheinischer Gedichte''" published in the ''Abhandlungen'' of the Berlin Academy; and in ''Der Nibelunge Not und die Klage'' (1826), which was followed by a critical commentary in 1836.

Lachmann's ''Betrachtungen über Homer's Iliad'', first published in the ''Abhandlungen'' of the Berlin Academy in 1837 and 1841, in which he sought to show that the ''[[Iliad]]'' consists of eighteen independent "layers" variously enlarged and interpolated, had considerable influence on 19th century [[Homeric scholarship]], although his views are no longer accepted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

His smaller edition of the [[New Testament]] appeared in 1831, the 3rd edition in 1846, and the larger second edition, in two volumes, between 1842 and 1850. The plan of Lachmann's edition, which he explained in his ''Studia Krit.'' of 1830, is a modification of the unaccomplished project of [[Richard Bentley]]. Lachmann was the first major editor to break from the [[Textus Receptus]], seeking to restore the most ancient reading current in [[manuscript]]s of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], using the agreement of the [[Western text-type|Western]] authorities ([[Old Latin]] and Greek Western [[Uncial]]s) as the main proof of antiquity of a reading where the oldest Alexandrian authorities differ.

Lachmann's edition of [[Lucretius]] (1850), which was the principal occupation of his life from 1845, is perhaps his greatest achievement of scholarship. He demonstrated how the three main manuscripts all derived from one [[archetype]], containing 302 pages of 26 lines to a page. Further, he was able to show that this archetype was a copy of a manuscript written in a [[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]] hand, which was in turn a copy of a manuscript of the 4th or 5th centuries written in [[rustic capitals]]. To say his recreation of the text was accepted is anticlimactic; [[Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro|HAJ Munro]] characterized this accomplishment as "a work which will be a landmark for scholars as long as the Latin language continues to be studied." Lachmann also edited [[Propertius]] (1816); [[Catullus]] (1829); [[Tibullus]] (1829); [[Joseph Genesius|Genesius]] (1834); [[Terentianus Maurus]] (1836); [[Babrius]] (1845); [[Avianus]] (1845); [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] (1841–1842); the ''Agrimensores Romani'' (1848–1852); and [[Lucilius]] (edited after his death by [[Johannes Vahlen|Vahlen]], 1876). He also translated [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s sonnets (1820) and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1829).

'''Keim's process''' is a technique of [[fresco]] preparation and painting intended to maximize the lifetime of the finished work. The process, as reported in 1884 at the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in London, was created by chemist and craftsman Adolf Wilhelm Keim of [[Munich]], as an improvement on the earlier [[stereochromy]] technique of Schlotthaner and [[Johann Nepomuk von Fuchs]].&lt;ref name="rivington"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rivington | first = J.

==The process==
*First, the surface to be painted is prepared by removing any damp bricks, overly burnt bricks, or decayed wood, and replacing these, and also removing any existing traces of [[stucco]].
*The surface is then coated with a mixture of [[quartz]] sand, infusorial earth (calcined fossil meal), and powdered [[marble]], mixed four parts to one with [[quicklime]] [[calcium hydroxide|slaked]] with [[distilled water]]. The purpose of this layer is to ensure adhesion of the subsequent layers to the surface. Next, a layer of lime-sand [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] is applied to even the surface, with care taken to avoid cracking. This layer is allowed to dry for up to a year.
*Once dry, a painting ground composed of white quartz sand, marble sand, marble meal, and infusorial earth is combined eight parts to one with slaked lime, and applied to the surface at a thickness of one eighth to one quarter inch. This layer dries for several days, at which point a crust of [[carbonate]] has formed on the surface. This crust is removed with a mixture of one part [[hydrofluosilicic acid]] to three parts distilled water, which is brushed on and allowed to dry for 24 hours, after which the surface is rinsed with distilled water.
*A hardening fluid of one part [[potassium silicate]] to two parts water is then brushed on and allowed to dry for 24 hours, before a second layer is applied and allowed to dry again. This surface may be painted immediately, or may sit unpainted for several years.
*[[Pigment]]s (selected from a set of thirty-eight) are treated with [[alkaline]] solutions of [[potash]] or [[ammonia]] to prevent color change caused by the alkaline [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]] to come. Alternative pigments are best for those that cannot be used with an alkaline fixative.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt;
*Finally, the completed painting is fixed with an application of "[[waterglass]]" (sodium silicate) treated with [[ammonium carbonate]], applied in a fine spray in several layers, until no more is absorbed. The chemical interaction of the fixative with the underlying pigments and ground create a material analogous to marble, and highly resistant to chemical corrosion.&lt;ref name="builder"/&gt;

Keim's focus on carefully preparing the painting ground came from his study of older frescos and their state of preservation.&lt;ref name="osgood"&gt;{{cite book | last = Osgood | first = J. R. | author2 = et. al. | title = American Architect and Architecture | publisher = | volume = 15 | date = 1884 | pages = 125 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qJgwAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=%22Keim%27s+process%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=37GXMOD6PY&amp;sig=iOtL0ckgLyy6mHUqXfpvspHh6HE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Aps9VIbZHcv8sAS_u4KoCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Keim's%20process%22&amp;f=false | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keim reportedly labored for twelve years to refine his process.&lt;ref name="builder"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6550">==Life history method==

The method was first used when interviewing [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and specifically Native American leaders who were asked by an interviewer to describe their lives with an insight as to what it was like to be that particular [[person]]. The purpose of the interview was to capture a living picture of a disappearing (as such) people/[[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]].

Later the method was used to interview [[criminal]]s and [[prostitutes]] in [[Chicago]]. Interviewers looked at [[Social work|social]] and [[police]]-records, as well as the [[society]] in general, and asked subjects to talk about their lives. The resulting report discussed (i) Chicago at that particular time; (ii) how the subject viewed their own life (i.e. `how it was like to be this particular person') and (iii) how society viewed the subject and whether they would be [[incarceration|incarcerated]], receive help, perform social work, etc.
 
The landmark of the life history method was developed in the 1920s and most significantly embodied in [[The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]] by [[W.I Thomas]] and [[Florian Znaniecki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Story of Life History: Origins of the Life History Method in Sociology|last = Goodson|first = Ivor|authorlink=Ivor Goodson|date = November 12, 2009|journal = Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;The authors employed a Polish immigrant to write his own life story which they then interpreted and analyzed. According to Martin Bulmer, it was "the first systematically collected sociological life history".&lt;ref name="Bulmer1986-54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Bulmer|title=The Chicago School of Sociology: Institutionalization, Diversity, and the Rise of Sociological Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0dJJZvcE2YC&amp;pg=PA54|date=15 August 1986|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-08005-5|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach later lost momentum as quantitative methods became more prevalent in American sociology. The method was revived in the 1970s, mainly through the efforts of French sociologist [[Daniel Bertaux]] and Paul Thompson whose life history research focused on such professions as bakers and fishermen. Major initiatives of the life history method were undertaken also in Germany, Italy, and Finland.

In the German context, the life history method is closely associated with the development of [[biographical research]] and biographical-narrative interviews. The [[narrative interview]] as a method for conducting open narrative interviews in empirical [[social research]] was developed in [[Germany]] around 1975. It borrowed concepts from [[Phenomenology (sociology)|phenomenology]] ([[Alfred Schütz]]), [[symbolic interactionism]] ([[George Herbert Mead]]), [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]), and [[sociology of knowledge]] ([[Karl Mannheim]]). The development and improvement of the method are closely connected to German sociologist [[Fritz Schütze]], part of the [[Bielefeld Sociologist’s Working Group]], which maintained close academic cooperation with American sociolinguists and social scientists such as [[Erving Goffman]], [[Harvey Sacks]], [[John J. Gumperz|John Gumpertz]], and [[Anselm Strauss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Köttig|first=Michaela|last2=Völter|first2=Bettina|date=December 2015|title=„Das ist Soziologe sein!“ – Ein narratives Interview mit Fritz Schütze zur Geschichte seines Werkes in der Soziologie|url=http://www.nwrsa.de/wp-content/uploads/Schuetze-Interview_1_2017.pdf|journal=Rundbrief 69/ Dezember 2015 der Sektion Biographieforschung in der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie|volume=|pages=35 – 53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of life histories was further developed by the biographical case reconstruction method of German sociologist [[Gabriele Rosenthal]] for the analysis of life ''history'' and life ''story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-86395-374-4/rosenthal_interpretive.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Interpretive Social Research.

==Technique==
In both cases, the one doing the interview should be careful not to ask "yes or no"-questions, but to get the subject to tell "the story of his or her life", in his or her own words. This is called the "[[narrative]]" method. It is common practice to begin the interview with the subject's early childhood and to proceed [[chronology|chronologically]] to the present. Another approach, dating from the Polish Peasant, is to ask participants to write their own life stories. This can be done either through competitions (as in Poland, Finland or Italy) or by collecting written life stories written spontaneously. In these countries, there are already large collections of life stories, which can be used by researchers.

[[File:Marc Shapiro picture 5.jpg|thumb|Marc B. Shapiro]]
'''Marc B. Shapiro''' (Hebrew: מלך שפירא, born 1966) is a professor and the author of various books and articles on Jewish history, philosophy, theology, and rabbinic literature.

== Education and career ==
Shapiro received his BA at [[Brandeis University]] and his PhD at [[Harvard University]], where he was the last PhD student of Professor [[Isadore Twersky]]. He received rabbinical ordination from Rabbi [[Ephraim Greenblatt]]. Shapiro's father is [[Edward S. Shapiro]], who has published books on American history and American Jewish history.

Shapiro holds the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Chair in Judaic Studies at the [[University of Scranton]]. Shapiro is an on-line lecturer for Torah in Motion, for which he also leads Jewish history tours to Europe and Morocco. He often writes for the Seforim Blog.

Shapiro has been a resident of [[West Orange, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Johanna. [http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/060106/njLocalScholarOrganizes.html "Local scholar organizes conference on history of Modern Orthodoxy"], ''[[New Jersey Jewish News]]'', June 1, 2006. Accessed June 28, 2018. "A West Orange scholar is the co-organizer of the first-ever conference in America on the history of Modern Orthodoxy, to be held June 13–15 in Scranton, Pa. Marc B. Shapiro, who holds the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Chair in Jewish Studies at the University of Scranton, said the conference will take a historical view of the movement in order to explore its meaning for today."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
Shapiro's writings often challenge the bounds of the conventional Orthodox understanding of Judaism using academic methodology while adhering to Modern Orthodox sensibilities. His book, ''Between the Yeshiva World and Modern Orthodoxy,'' a biography of [[Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg]], was a National Jewish Book Award finalist. His second book, ''The Limits of Orthodox Theology'', also a National Jewish Book Award finalist, argued against the conventional Orthodox belief that [[Maimonides]] Thirteen Principles of Faith are unquestionable dogma.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/6488/author-challenges-rambam-s-principles/|title=Author Challenges Rambam's Principles|work=The Forward|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gidon Rothstein, writing in the Association for Jewish Studies Review, called the book's collection of sources "remarkable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothstein|first=Gidon|date=2005-04-01|title=Marc B. Shapiro. The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised. The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. 221 pp.|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ajs-review/article/div-classtitlemarc-b-shapiro-span-classitalicthe-limits-of-orthodox-theology-maimonidesandapos-thirteen-principles-reappraisedspan-the-littman-library-of-jewish-civilization-oxford-oxford-university-press-2004-221-ppdiv/9C4EAB7E70036B57A425206932142CDC|journal=AJS Review|volume=29|issue=1|pages=169–171|doi=10.1017/S0364009405260099|issn=1475-4541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was criticized by some Hareidi Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Zev Leff]], an American [[Haredi Judaism|Hareidi]] rabbi, wrote that "I cannot recommend it to the general public, who can be easily misled by some of the questionable theses in this book."&lt;ref name="Leff"&gt;http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/ja/5767/summer67/76_79.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, his book ''Changing the Immutable: How Orthodox Judaism Rewrites Its History'' was released. The book documents the phenomenon of internal censorship in Orthodoxy. [[Adam Ferziger]] said the book "is the outstanding product of a master of rabbinic literature and an extraordinarily sharp-eyed and meticulous scholar."&lt;ref&gt;http://marginalia.lareviewofbooks.org/the-sagacious-scholar-and-the-censor-by-adam-ferziger/&lt;/ref&gt; Yair Hoffman, writing in the Hareidi online website [[Yeshiva World News]], criticized the book, saying that "there is a plethora of material that simply should not have been included in the book because it does not back up his thesis."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/313895/book-review-of-changing-the-immutble.html|title=Book Review: Marc Shapiro's "Changing the Immutable"|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra Glinter, writing in [[The Forward]], praised Shapiro's "evenhanded, evidence-heavy approach" and that he was not a "polemicist," but said "his argument could also have benefited from a more critical thrust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/culture/311651/orthodoxys-inconvenient-truths/|title=Orthodoxy's Inconvenient Truths|last=Glinter|first=Ezra|date=2015-07-13|work=The Forward|access-date=2017-03-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial and Revolutionary eras==

The first newspapers appeared in major port cities such as Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and Charleston in order to provide merchants with the latest trade news. They typically copied any news that was received from other newspapers, or from the London press. The editors discovered they could criticize the local governor and gain a bigger audience; the governor discovered he could shut down the newspapers. The most dramatic confrontation came in New York in 1734, where the governor brought [[John Peter Zenger]] to trial for criminal libel after his paper published some  satirical attacks. Zenger's lawyers argued that truth was a defense against libel and the jury acquitted Zenger, who became the iconic American hero for freedom of the press.  The result was an emerging tension between the media and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Olson, "The Zenger Case Revisited: Satire, Sedition and Political Debate in Eighteenth Century America." ''Early American Literature'' (2000) 35#3 pp: 223-245. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eal/summary/v035/35.3olson.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy was widespread in America, with over half of the white men able to read. The illiterates often could hear newspapers read aloud at local taverns. By the mid-1760s, there were 24 weekly newspapers in the 13 colonies (only New Jersey was lacking one), and the satirical attack on government became common practice in American newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Copeland, Colonial American Newspapers: Character and Content'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William David Sloan, and Julie Williams, ''The Early American Press, 1690-1783'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The French and Indian war (1757–63) was the featured topic of many newspaper stories, giving the colonials a broader view of American affairs. [[Benjamin Franklin]], already famous as a printer in Philadelphia published one of the first editorial cartoons, ''[[Join, or Die]]'', calling on the colonies to join together to defeat the French. By reprinting news originating in other papers, colonial printers created a private network for evaluating and disseminating news for the whole colonial world. Franklin took the lead, and eventually had two dozen newspapers in his network.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Frasca, "Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network and the Stamp Act," ''Pennsylvania History'' (2004) 71#3 pp. 403-419 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27778636  in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The network played a major role in organizing opposition to the Stamp Act, and in organizing and embolding the Patriots in the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;David Copeland,  "'Join, or die': America's press during the French and Indian War." ''Journalism History'' (1998) 24#3 pp: 112-23 [http://search.proquest.com/openview/73184dced3cd49c14fdb5574c6612884/1?pq-origsite=gscholar online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial newspaper networks played a major role in fomenting the American Revolution, starting with their attack on the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Schlesinger, "The colonial newspapers and the Stamp Act." ''New England Quarterly'' (1935) 8#1 pp: 63-83. [http://www.oakton.edu/user/1/jholderf/American%20History%203.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; They provided essential news of what was happening locally and in other colonies, and they provided the arguments used by the patriots, to Voice their grievances such as "No taxation without representation!"&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Merritt, "Public Opinion in Colonial America: Content Analyzing the Colonial Press." ''Public Opinion Quarterly''  (1963) 27#3 pp: 356-371. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2747114 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The newspapers also printed and sold pamphlets, such as the phenomenally successful ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776), which destroyed the king's prestige and jelled Patriot opinion overnight in favor of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop D. Jordan, "Familial Politics: Thomas Paine and the Killing of the King, 1776." ''Journal of American History'' (1973): 294-308. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2936777 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Neutrality became impossible, and the few Loyalist newspapers were hounded and ceased publication when the war began. However, the British controlled important cities for varying periods of time, including New York City, 1776 to 1783. They sponsored a Loyalist press that vanished in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Mott, ''American Journalism: A History, 1690-1960'' pp 79-94&lt;/ref&gt;

== New nation, 1780s–1820s==
{{main|First Party System}}
[[File:~party3.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Federalist poster about 1800. Washington (in heaven) tells partisans to keep the pillars of Federalism, Republicanism and Democracy]]
With the formation of the first two political parties in the  1790s, Both parties set up national networks of newspapers to provide a flow of partisan news and information for their supporters.  The newspapers also printed pamphlets, flyers, and ballots that voters could simply drop in the ballot box.

By 1796, both parties had a national network of newspapers, which attacked each other vehemently.  The [[History of American newspapers|Federalist and Republican newspapers]] of the 1790s traded vicious barbs against their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Daniel, ''Scandal and Civility: Journalism and the Birth of
American Democracy'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most heated rhetoric came in debates over the French Revolution, especially the [[Jacobin#The Terror|Jacobin Terror]] of 1793–94 when the guillotine was used daily.  Nationalism was a high priority, and the editors fostered an intellectual nationalism typified by the Federalist effort to stimulate a national literary culture through their clubs and publications in New York and Philadelphia, and through Federalist [[Noah Webster]]'s efforts to simplify and Americanize the language.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine O'Donnell Kaplan, ''Men of Letters in the Early Republic: Cultivating Forms of Citizenship'' 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of political passion came in 1798 as the Federalists in Congress passed the four [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. The fourth Act made it a federal crime to publish "any false, scandalous, or malicious writing or writings against the Government of the United States, with intent to defame... Or to bring them... into contempt or disrepute." Two dozen men were charged with felonies for violating the  Sedition Act, chiefly newspaper editors from the Jeffersonian Republican Party. The act expired in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Berns, "Freedom of the Press and the Alien and Sedition Laws: A Reappraisal," ''Supreme Court Review'' (1970) pp. 109-159
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3108724 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Party System: 1830s–1850s==
{{main|History of American newspapers#The press in the Party System: 1820–1890}}
Both parties relied heavily on their national network of newspapers. Some editors were the key political players in their states, and most of them filled their papers with useful information on rallies and speeches and candidates, as well as the text of major speeches and campaign platforms.

== Third Party System: 1850s–1890s==
{{main|Third Party System}}
Newspapers continued their role as the main internal communication system for the Army-style campaigns of the era. The goal was not to convince independents, who are few in number, but to rally all the loyal party members to the polls by making them enthusiastic about the party's platform, and apprehensive about the enemy.

Nearly all weekly and daily papers were party organs until the early 20th century. Thanks to Hoe's invention of high-speed rotary presses for city papers, and free postage for rural sheets, newspapers proliferated. In 1850, the Census counted 1,630 party newspapers (with a circulation of about one per voter), and only 83 "independent" papers. The party line was behind every line of news copy, not to mention the authoritative editorials, which exposed the 'stupidity' of the enemy and the 'triumphs' of the party in every issue. Editors were senior party leaders, and often were rewarded with lucrative postmasterships. Top publishers, such as [[Horace Greeley]], [[Whitelaw Reid]], [[Schuyler Colfax]], [[Warren Harding]] and [[James M. Cox|James Cox]] were nominated on the national ticket. After 1900, [[William Randolph Hearst]], [[Joseph Pulitzer]] and other big city politician-publishers discovered they could make far more profit through advertising, at so many dollars per thousand readers. By becoming non-partisan they expanded their base to include the opposition party and the fast-growing number of consumers who read the ads but were less and less interested in politics. There was less and less political news after 1900, apparently because citizens became more apathetic, and shared their partisan loyalties with the new professional sports teams that attracted larger and larger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lee Kaplan, ''Politics and the American press: the rise of objectivity, 1865-1920'' (2002) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. Summers, ''The Press Gang: Newspapers and Politics, 1865-1878'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progressive era==
{{main|Fourth Party System|Muckraker}}
The American Newspaper industry during this era had been massively expanding. The number of English-language newspapers had nearly tripled during this time. Technology had a hand to do with this because of faster printing presses, and more efficient transportation. Newspapers such as the New York World and the New York Journal appealed to a wide variety of audiences with pages devoted to finances, sports, women, entertainment, etc. Special Interest newspapers were also on the rise during this period with many different groups pushing their agenda through newspapers and other forms of media. These special interest newspapers include the National American Woman Suffrage Association's Woman's Journal, The Anti-Saloon League's American Issue, and others. There even came a time that there was up to nine publications in the major cities such as Chicago, Boston, and New York which in turn created fierce competition. Competition caused these publications to lower their prices to just a penny just to stay afloat. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Progressive Era: Primary Documents on Events from 1890 to 1914|last=Burt|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2004|isbn=0313320977|location=West-port,CT|pages=7-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magazines were not a new medium but they became much more popular around 1900, some with circulations in the hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  Thanks to the rapid expansion of national advertising, the cover price fell sharply to about 10 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter C. Holloran et al. eds.|title=The A to Z of the Progressive Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rt3243E-Wm0C&amp;pg=PA266|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cause was the heavy coverage of corruption in politics, local government and big business, especially by ''Muckrakers.''  They were journalists in the [[Progressive Era]] (1890s-1920s) who wrote for popular magazines to expose social and political sins and shortcomings. They relied on their own  [[investigative journalism]] reporting; muckrakers often worked to expose social ills and corporate and [[Corruption in the United States|political corruption]]. Muckraking magazines–notably ''[[McClure's]]''–took on corporate monopolies and crooked [[political machine]]s while raising public awareness of chronic urban poverty, unsafe working conditions, and [[social issues]] like [[child labor]].  These Journalists were nicknamed muckrakers by Theodore Roosevelt because he complained they were being disruptive by raking up the muck.
&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Shapiro,  ed., ''The muckrakers and American society'' (Heath, 1968), contains representative samples as well as academic commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ray Stannard Baker]], [[George Creel]], and [[Brand Whitlock]] specialized in exposing corruption at the state and local levels. [[Lincoln Steffens]] went after corruption in big cities. [[Ida Tarbell]] attacked John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company. Most of the muckrakers wrote nonfiction, but fictional exposes often had a major impact as well, such as those by [[Upton Sinclair]].  He is best known for exposing the corrupt meatpacking industry and the horrific working conditions of men working in these factories and the contamination in the meat.&lt;ref&gt;Judson A. Grenier, "Muckraking the muckrakers: Upton Sinclair and his peers." in  David R Colburn and Sandra Pozzetta, eds., ''Reform and Reformers in the Progressive Era '' (1983) pp: 71-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Deal era ==
{{main|Fifth Party System|New Deal Coalition}}
Most of the major newspapers in the larger cities were owned by conservative publishers and they turned hostile to liberal President [[Franklin D Roosevelt]] by 1934 or so, including major chains run by [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Roosevelt turned to radio, where he could reach more listeners more directly. During previous election campaigns , the parties sponsored nationwide broadcasts of major speeches. Roosevelt, however, gave intimate talks, person-to-person, as if he were in the same room sitting next to the fireplace. His rhetorical technique was extraordinarily effective. However, it proved very hard to duplicate. Young [[Ronald Reagan]], beginning a career in as a radio broadcaster and Hollywood star, was one of the few to match the right tone, nuance, and intimacy that Roosevelt had introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas B. Craig, ''Fireside Politics: Radio and Political Culture in the United States, 1920-1940'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Fireside-Politics-Political-1920-1940-Reconfiguring-ebook/dp/B007RKNUR6/  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

In peacetime, [[Freedom of the press]] was not an issue for newspapers. However radio presented the new issue, for the government control the airwaves and licensed them. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] ruled in the "Mayflower decision" in 1941 against the broadcasting of any editorial opinion, although political parties could still purchase airtime for their own speeches and programs. This policy was replaced in 1949 by the "[[Fairness Doctrine]]" which allowed editorials, if opposing views were given equal time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan L. Brinson|title=The Red Scare, Politics, and the Federal Communications Commission, 1941-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V02uMPJGX5MC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television era: 1950–1980s ==
Television arrived in the American home in the 1950s, and immediately became the main campaign medium. Party loyalties had weakened and there was a rapid growth in the number of independents. As a result candidates Paid less attention to rallying diehard supporters and instead appealed to independent-minded voters. They adopted television advertising techniques as their primary campaign device. At first the parties paid for long-winded half-hour or hour long speeches. By the 1960s, they discovered that the 30-second or one-minute commercial, repeated over and over again, was the most effective technique. It was expensive, however, so fund-raising became more and more important in winning campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. West, ''Air Wars: Television Advertising and Social Media in Election Campaigns, 1952-2012'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Major technological innovations transformed the mass media. Radio, already overwhelmed by television, transformed itself into a niche service. It developed an important political dimension based on [[Talk radio]]. Television survived with a much reduced audience, but remained the number one advertising medium for election campaigns. Newspapers were in desperate trouble; most afternoon papers closed, and most morning papers barely survived, as the Internet undermined both their advertising and their news reporting.

The new social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, made use first of the personal computer and the Internet, and after 2010 of the smart phones to connect hundreds of millions of people, especially those under age 35. By 2008, politicians and interest groups were experimenting with systematic use of social media to spread their message among much larger audiences than they had previously reached.&lt;ref&gt;Juliet E. Carlisle, and Robert C. Patton, "Is Social Media Changing How We Understand Political Engagement? An Analysis of Facebook and the 2008 Presidential Election," ''Political Research Quarterly'' (2013) 66#4 pp 883-895.

As political strategists turn their attention to the 2016 presidential contest, they identify Facebook as an increasingly important advertising tool. Recent technical innovations have made possible more advanced divisions and subdivisions of the electorate. Most important, Facebook can now deliver video ads to small, highly targeted subsets. Television, by contrast, shows the same commercials to all viewers, and so cannot be precisely tailored.&lt;ref&gt;Shane Goldmacher, "Facebook the Vote: The social network at the center of American digital life could become the epicenter of the presidential race," [http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/facebook-the-vote-20150612 ''National Journal Magazine'' June 13, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Online presence is vital to the success of a presidential candidate's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://globalriskinsights.com/2016/03/how-social-media-is-changing-political-campaigns/|title=How social media is changing political campaigns {{!}} GRI|date=2016-03-11|newspaper=Global Risk Insights|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media presence lets candidates: have direct access to voters, advertise for free, and fundraise, among other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uspolitics.about.com/od/CampaignsElections/tp/How-Social-Media-Has-Changed-Politics.htm|title=Social Media in Politics - Twitter and Facebook as Campaigns Tools|newspaper=About.com News &amp; Issues|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13279">The '''Master of Social Work''' ('''MSW''') is a [[master's degree]] in the field of [[social work]]. It is a [[professional degree]] with specializations compared to [[Bachelor of Social Work]] (BSW). MSW promotes macro-, meso- and micro-aspects of professional social work practice, whereas the BSW focuses more on direct social work practices in community, hospitals ([[Patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatient and inpatient]] services) and other fields of social services.

== Canada ==
In Canada, the MSW is considered a professional master's degree and is offered through several universities. Most schools are accredited by the Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work (C.A.S.W.E.).

All students entering an MSW program are required to have a recognized bachelor's degree in a related field. Generally, students with a Bachelor of Social Work would enroll in a one-year program, whereas those with other undergraduate degrees ([[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], etc.) would enroll in a two-year program. In Canada the average Master of Social Work graduate can earn anywhere from $60,000 CAD to $150,000 CAD, depending on their role and work environment.

The oldest social work program in Canada is offered at the [[University of Toronto]] through the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work. Social work students at the UofT choose from a number of specializations (i.e. gerontology, children and their families, mental health, social service administration, social justice and diversity), and have opportunities to pursue their MSW's with a variety of collaborative programs, such as Addiction Studies, Sexual Diversity Studies, and Asia-Pacific Studies, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/2year/yr2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528072518/http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/2year/yr2.htm |archivedate=2011-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/mswcollab.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528072521/http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/mswcollab.htm |archivedate=2011-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students could also pursue their MSW degrees in combination with either a Master of Health Science or a [[Juris Doctor]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/mswcombined.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528072523/http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/mswcombined.htm |archivedate=2011-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Carleton University]]
*[[Wilfrid Laurier University]]
*[[University of Toronto]]
*[[Ryerson University]]
*[[York University]]
*[[McGill University]]

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, [[clinical social work]] could first be studied in academia as part of a certificate program beginning in 1908. Later, two and three year programs were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-social-sciences/social-policy/IASS/100-years-of-social-work.pdf 100 Years of Social Work] University of Birmingham, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Tavistock Clinic in London remains the leading centre for the study of clinically oriented social work and offers programmes up to and including Professional Doctorate level. The Journal of Social Work Practice represents the main organ of research and scholarly output in this area in the UK.

== United States ==
In the [[United States]], MSW degrees must be received from a [[graduate school]] that has been approved by the [[Council on Social Work Education]] (CSWE) should the graduate seek future licensure.  The MSW typically requires two years of full-time graduate study in combination with two years (900–1200 cumulative hours) of internship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Required Internship hours|url=http://www.cswe.org/File.aspx?id=13780|work=2008 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards|publisher=Council on Social Work Education|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; also referred to as field practicum, education, or experience. While some students obtain a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) before pursuing a master's, most MSW programs accept applicants with undergraduate degrees in a broad range of liberal arts fields. Some MSW programs provide BSW graduates with an advanced standing option, allowing them to complete an MSW in a shorter period of time (typically 1 year).

Most MSW programs allow students to choose a clinical or direct practice track, which focuses on direct practice with clients, or a macro practice track, with a focus on political advocacy, [[community organizing]], policy analysis and/or human services management. While the clinical track tends to be more popular, there has been a resurgence in community practice concentrations recently. There are also opportunities at many universities to obtain joint degrees, such as an MSW and a Public Administration degree, MSW and Public Health, or MSW and Law. The MSW practice scope has broadened in recent years to include the specialty practice areas of geriatrics and work with veterans. In some schools the curriculum is based on a generalist model which integrates the facets of the various practice areas within social work.

The MSW is considered a terminal practice degree in the field of social work.  The DSW (Doctorate of Social Work) and Ph.D in social work are the final degrees offered in the field of social work.  There are inherent differences between the DSW and the PhD; the DSW further develops skills to continue practice with individual clients and client systems in the field. The PhD prepares graduates to conduct research and teach in institutions of higher education. There are few DSW programs available in the United States.

Though Master of Social Work is by far the most common degree title used by graduate social work schools in the United States, it is not universal. For example, [[Columbia University School of Social Work]] offers an M.S. degree in social work, the School of Social Service Administration of the [[University of Chicago]] confers an A.M. degree, and the [[University of Texas]]  confers the MSSW (Master of Science in Social Work) degree. The [[Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences]] at [[Case Western Reserve University]] confers the MSSA (Master of Science in Social Administration) degree.

[[Clark Atlanta University]]'s [[Whitney M. Young]] School of Social work is also credited with creating the administration of social work from an Afro-centric perspective.  [[Clark Atlanta]]'s school of social work has also had various stalwarts in the profession affiliated with it such as [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], Dorcas Bowles, [[Whitney Young]], Hattie Mitchell, Naomi Ward and Rufus Lynch.

==Employment Outlook and Opportunities U.S.==

Although it is possible to be a [[social worker]] with a bachelor's degree in the U.S., some fields of practice require a master's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/choices/|title=NASW Press|author=|date=|website=www.socialworkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], the profession is expected to grow by 25% between 2010 and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=25% between 2010 and 2020|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Community-and-Social-Service/Social-workers.htm|work=2012 Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing elderly population is resulting in accelerated job growth among gerontology social workers. Social workers with a focus on mental health and substance abuse are currently in high demand as offenders are directed to treatment instead of jail time, a trend that is expected to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialwork.une.edu/resources/news/msw-jobs-outlook/|title=MSW Jobs Outlook {{!}} UNE Online|website=socialwork.une.edu|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A master's degree could be seen as a tool which will help to compete with tomorrow's job market. The Employment Projection shows that those with higher levels of education in the field tend to earn more than those with just a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment Projection|url=http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm|work=2012 Earnings and Unemployment Rates by Educational Attainment|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The median annual salary for social workers according to the 2016 [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] was $46,890, or $22.54 hourly.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''[https://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/social-workers.htm#tab-1]'' Bureau Of Labor Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;
Between the years 2016 and 2026, the job outlook is projected to increase by 16%, which is 9% higher than the national job growth average.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Average salaries will vary depending on the specific field of social work itself. Those who seek employment as social workers in the [[healthcare industry]] typically average the highest salaries, ranging between $54,141-$65,489.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www1.salary.com/Medical-Social-Worker-MSW-Salary.html]''Salary.com&lt;/ref&gt;
By obtaining a license in the field of clinical social work, the salary ranges from $40,494 - $76,205 according to [[PayScale]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Licensed_Clinical_Social_Worker_(LCSW)/Salary#CareerPaths]'' PayScale&lt;/ref&gt;

Social workers' earnings varied according to their area of specialization and work environment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Worker Salary Guide|url=http://www.gradschools.com/search-programs/social-work-msw/social-worker-salary|publisher=Gradschools.com|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15520">'''Maternal death in fiction''' is a common theme encountered in literature, movies, and other media.

The death of a mother during [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]] or [[Postnatal|puerperium]] is a tragic event. The chances of a child surviving such an extreme birth are compromised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://apha.confex.com/apha/131am/techprogram/paper_62489.htm | author=Uhler SA | title=Impact of a mother’s death on child health and survival in Haiti | date=November 13, 2003 | accessdate=August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fictional literature the death of a pregnant or delivering mother is a powerful device: it removes one character and places the surviving child into an often hostile environment which has to be overcome. 

==Literature==

===19th century===
*In the [[Grimm Brothers]]' ''[[Snow White]]'', Snow White's mother died in childbirth. Soon afterwards, her father took a new wife who was beautiful, but very vain, and who possessed supernatural powers.
* In [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'', Liza Bolkonskaya, wife of [[Andrey Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Prince Andrei]] dies giving birth to a son called Nikolai.
* In [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' the title character's mother, Agnes, dies giving birth to him.
* Another Dickens novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', Scrooge's younger sister Fan dies in childbirth giving birth to his nephew Fred. Scrooge's father blames him for his mother also dying in childbirth.
* In the 1891 play ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Spring Awakening]]'' by [[Frank Wedekind]] and the same-named contemporary [[Spring Awakening (musical)|musical]] Wendla dies from a botched [[abortion]].
* In [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'', the author ridicules the convention of heroines having mothers who die in childbirth, by beginning the novel: "No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine. Her situation in life, the character of her father and mother... were all equally against her... Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a good constitution. She had three sons before Catherine was born; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might expect, she still lived on."
* In [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'',  [[Catherine Earnshaw]] goes into early labor and dies after giving birth to her daughter, [[Catherine Linton]].
* In Elizabeth Gaskell's'' [[Mary Barton]]'', when the heroine is a young girl, her mother dies in childbirth along with the baby, deeply affected by the grief of her sister Esther's disappearance, leaving Mary to be brought up by her father.
* Fanny Robin in Thomas Hardy's ''[[Far From the Madding Crowd]]'' also dies in childbirth along with the child, who was fathered by Frank Troy, Bathsheba's husband.
* In Henry James' ''[[Washington Square (novel)|Washington Square]]'', Catherine Sloper's mother dies shortly after her birth and the death of his beautiful and talented wife permanently alters Dr Sloper and causes him to be cold and unfeeling towards Catherine.
* Lucetta Farfrae (formerly Lucette Le Sueur) in Thomas Hardy's ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' has a miscarriage and dies, following a seizure induced by the public revelation of her love affair with Michael Henchard.

===20th century===
* Catherine Barkley, the nurse and principal supporting character in Hemingway's ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', dies in childbirth shortly after her son is [[Stillbirth|stillborn]].
*In [[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay]]'s 1932 [[Bengali novels|Bengali novel]] ''Aparajito'', Aparna dies giving birth to her son Kajal, after which the despairing father [[The Apu Trilogy|Apu]] abandons his child. It was later adapted into the film, ''[[The World of Apu]]''.
*In [[Thornton Wilder]]'s play ''[[Our Town]]'', Emily Webb dies in childbirth.
* In [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel ''[[The Real Life of Sebastian Knight]]'' Knight's first love, Clare Bishop, later bleeds to death in childbirth "next to an empty cradle".
* The title character dies in childbirth in Nabokov's [[Lolita]], as does Humbert Humbert's first wife.
* In [[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s novel ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', Amaranta Ursula Buendía dies while giving birth to Aureliano, the child she has with her nephew Aureliano Babilonia.
* In [[Barry Hughart]]'s novel ''The Bridge of Birds'', [[Li Kao]]'s mother dies immediately after giving birth to him. She lives only long enough to ask for [[Kaoliang wine]], which is misinterpreted by those in attendance as naming the child Li Kao.

* In [[Ken Follett]]'s novel ''[[The Pillars of the Earth]]'', Tom Builder's wife Agnes dies in childbirth in the woods.
* In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' saga, [[Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt-Riddle]], the mother of the series' chief antagonist, [[Lord Voldemort]], dies after giving birth to him, living just long enough to name him Tom Marvolo Riddle.
* In [[Gregory Maguire]]'s novel ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West|Wicked]]'' Melena dies giving birth to her third child, Shell.
* In [[P.D. James]]' mystery novels, her central detective, [[Adam Dalgliesh]], loses his wife and child in childbirth.
* In ''[[Revolutionary Road]]'', the female protagonist dies after inducing a miscarriage.

The '''McGill Executive Institute''' is the corporate education and management development unit of the [[McGill University]] [[Desautels Faculty of Management]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. It provides a variety of public business seminars as well as custom [[executive education]] and coaching for all levels of management.

Founded in 1956,&lt;ref name="computers"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QokxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=naUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=1308%2C2644596 McGill Management Institute teaches the unusual...it’s where executives go to learn about computers], The Montreal Gazette, Aug 18, 1984, Retrieved on August 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute has a full-time staff of learning design and program managers working with professors at McGill’s Faculties of Management, Law, Arts, Education and Medicine, external guest experts in specific fields, as well as visiting professors from universities worldwide. The Institute’s clientele includes businesses, not-for-profit organizations and government/public sector services.

==History==

After establishing the first management diploma in 1906, McGill University began offering evening classes in business education in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2010-2011/sites/mcgill.ca.study.2010-2011/files/desautels_faculty_of_management_201011_0.pdf  Desautels Faculty of Management: Programs, Courses and University Regulations 2010-2011], Desautels Website, PDF retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Following Canada's post World War II expansion, McGill University responded to the needs of senior executives by offering seminars in personnel management, marketing, and finance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EIMtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dpkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20personnel-management&amp;pg=3548%2C915652 McGill University Evening Extension Course listing], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 8, 1950, Retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrent to business seminars offered by McGill, the Executive Development Institute, a private business education organization, began to offer the Executive Development Course (EDC) in 1949, in affiliation with the [[Montreal Board of Trade]]. It was developed with support from the Graduate School of Business at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vJgtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kZ0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=3255%2C552133 Executive Development Institute, 12th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 5, 1961, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aMItAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d54FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=montreal%20board-of-trade%20seminar%20institute%20executive&amp;pg=4026%2C1105140 Executive Development Institute, 13th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 7, 1962, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W8MtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_Z4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=1953%2C316811 Executive Development Institute, 15th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Aug 3, 1964, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A precursor to the existence of many MBA and later EMBA programs, the EDC was designed to provide a comprehensive look at management practices in strategy, human resources, marketing, negotiations and financial acumen.&lt;ref name="computers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kZMtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j54FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=3272%2C1782776 To Help the Executive Grow], The Montreal Gazette - Jul 11, 1963, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the McGill Management Institute was founded to facilitate the more effective delivery of business seminars offered at McGill University.&lt;ref name="computers" /&gt; In 1973, the Executive Development Institute merged with the McGill Management Institute and, under the McGill banner, continued the facilitation of the EDC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UhQyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3qEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=1486%2C4031929 Ross Plans Book on University Growth], The Montreal Gazette - Aug 31, 1973, Retrieved on August 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zYcxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uKEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=5535%2C2565363 Psychological Survival for Executives], The Montreal Gazette - April 10, 1974, Retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The merger coincided with a move to its current home in the Bronfman building at McGill University on Sherbrooke Street in Montreal, where it underwent a significant expansion of its offerings. By 1984, the McGill Management Institute was offering 70 day-time seminars and 20 evening courses each year, in addition to the EDC.&lt;ref name="computers" /&gt;

In 1993, the McGill Management Institute was renamed the McGill International Executive Institute. It took its current name, the McGill Executive Institute, in 2002. It is a division of the [[Desautels Faculty of Management]].

==Philosophy==

The McGill Executive Institute has been noted for its approach to action-based learning,&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R. Fowler, University of Calgary, 2009, pg 213, Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for its international dimension. In his 2009 work, ''Executive Education in Canadian Firms'', Bruce Gordon R. Fowler states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The executive programs at this Institute recognize better than most schools, even among the other eight illustrious institutions discussed here, the need for international diversity and content. Indeed, McGill has been recognized as having an international dimension unsurpassed in North America for diversity among students and faculty, and for program style and content. The scope of McGill's global outlook is certainly equal to that of Harvard and INSEAD, also featured here as giants of international connectivity, which simply must be part of any program involving  executives of international or multinational firms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R. Fowler, University of Calgary, 2009, pg 138, Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Products and Services==
Each year, the McGill Executive Institute provides approximately 20 to 40 open enrolment seminars addressing a number of business topics. The Institute’s longest running program is the Executive Development Course which was launched in 1949. The EDC has been expanded over the years, and is currently offered in three successive modules: the Executive Development Course, the Advanced Management Course, and Integrated Management Thinking. Together, these are referred to by the Institute as the [[Mini-MBA]] Series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://executive.mcgill.ca/seminars List of Seminars available from McGill Executive Institute website], Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The McGill Executive Institute also designs and delivers customized learning solutions specifically for an organization’s team of managers or executives.  Services range from short workshops delivered in English, French or bilingual formats to global initiatives with delivery of modules to participants across management levels over several years.

The McGill Executive Institute also offers an International Masters in Practicing Management (IMPM), as well as the Advanced Leadership Program (ALP). These longer, global programs occur over several modules and across multiple international locations, in conjunction with other universities: The Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, India; Lancaster University in the UK; Korea Development Institute School of Public Policy and Management in Seoul, Korea; and INSEAD in France. Both the ALP and the IMPM were co-founded and are co-directed by Professor [[Henry Mintzberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39361">'''Museum integrated pest management''' is the practice of monitoring  and managing [[Pest (organism)|pest]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] information with [[pest control]] methods to prevent pest damage to [[Collection (artwork)|collections]] and [[cultural heritage]]. Preserving cultural heritage is the ultimate goal for most museum collection personnel. Museum pests come in many different forms: insects, mites, rodents, bats, birds, and fungi&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe"&gt;{{cite web|last=Monroe|first=Retz|title=Integrated Preventative Pest Management|url=http://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ippm-pest-control-paper.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two most common types are insects and fungi.&lt;ref name="(American Museum of natural History, IPM)"&gt;{{cite web|last=American Museum of natural History|title=(American Museum of natural History, IPM)|url=http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/8/integrated-pest-management|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely recommended that every museum have some form of pest control in place and monitoring system to protect their collection and that museums review their storage and museum facilities to determine how to best control and prevent pest infestations while utilizing an Integrated Pest Management plan.

==Integrated Pest Management components==
Museum IPM is a sub specialty of [[Integrated pest management]] that focuses specifically on the application in museums and cultural institutions. The primary difference between IPM and Museum IPM is that in the context of a museum, the main focus is placed on the protection of [[Collection (artwork)|collections]] from pests.

Integrated Pest Management is a ‘holistic’ approach to controlling pests” that seeks to understand what pests are attracted to, their habits, and life cycles.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State"&gt;{{cite web|last=Missouri Secretary of State|title=Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/localrecs/conservation/notes/pestmanagement.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this program is to identify what types of pests are located in the building, establish the museum's short- and long-term goals for their IPM program, and build a consensus amongst the staff.&lt;ref name="11 steps process"&gt;{{cite web|last=national parks|title=11 steps process|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/Documents/11StepIPMCard111406FrontBack.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum should “consult experts if necessary and choose the most appropriate and safe control methods for (the) eradication” of the pests.&lt;ref name="NPS - Harpers Ferry Center"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Parks|title=NPS - Harpers Ferry Center|url=http://www.nps.gov/hfc/products/cons/con-faq2.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important not to panic and rush to rash decisions if a few pests are discovered. A museum should be thoughtful and plan out of their steps before taking any action.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)"&gt;{{cite web|last=national parks|title=(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated Pest Management requires the museum to allocate time and energy for the implementation and monitoring the progress of their program. An IPM program “will require the coordinated effort of all staff members to properly implement, and may initially be more expensive than traditional pest management”.&lt;ref name="(Smithsonian- Integrated Pest Management check list)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smithsonian|title=(Smithsonian- Integrated Pest Management check list)|url=http://www.si.edu/mci/downloads/articles/pests9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation===
The implementation of integrated pest management should be done in steps. To begin, a museum should review a floor plan of the building and determine all “doors, windows, water and heat sources, and drains”, as well as all furniture and other objects within the museum.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; The museum can place traps that have been numbered and dated throughout the building using the floor plan as a guide of potential problem areas. The location of the traps should be documented and marked on the floor plan. Once the traps are in place, they should be monitored. Detailed notes should be made on the finding in the traps, which pests are being trapped, how they are accessing the museum, and what do these trapped pests look for in a food source. After the first few months, the trap placement should be refined to insure the best outcome.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

===Isolation and quarantine of any infested cultural objects===
Before any new items or objects enter the collection storage area, the contents should be inspected for any signs of insect activity.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; If an object is found, or even thought to be infested, it should be immediately isolated and put into quarantine. The museum should next look to identify the pest and determine what type of harm the pests can cause.&lt;ref name="NPS - Harpers Ferry Center" /&gt; Infested objects should be place into sealed plastic bags before moving them into the collection area. It is important to secure the object and make sure that no other eggs or larvae fall from the object and possibly spread the infestation.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; The objects around the quarantined object should also be examined to determine the extent of the infestation.

===Monitoring and Inspection===
The museum must monitor all of their pest management programs to ensure they are effective. Routine monitoring will provide information about the points of entry, amount of insects, where they reside in the building, and what they are feeding on.&lt;ref name="(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management"&gt;{{cite web|last=(Northeast document conservation|title=(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this information, a museum will be able to identify the damaged areas and what pests are infesting the museum. The staff should be careful in the placement of these traps to ensure that they do not come into contact with objects from the collection.&lt;ref name="(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management"&gt;{{cite web|last=(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|title=(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management}}&lt;/ref&gt; When traps are placed in a new location in the building they should be checked within the first 48 hours. This will help confirm where the problem areas are located and if adjustments need to be made to the trap locations. The next step should be weekly and then monthly inspections. Once the pests have been identified and the best location confirmed, then the traps should be changed every two months, or sooner if they are full or have lost their stickiness.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management"&gt;{{cite web|last=Northeast document conservation center|title=Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the staff conducts their insect monitoring, the staff member “should use a bright flashlight during inspections, looking for live adults and larvae and the presence of shed larval skins or feces”.&lt;ref name="http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/manual/museum.cfm"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Parks|title=IPM manual|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/manual/museum.cfm|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for the museum staff to continually review all components of the pest management program and determine if adjustments are needed.

===Identification and documentation===
A key component in Integrated Pest Management for museums is the ability to identify the pests causing issues so the museum staff can establish a plan of attack to remove the pest from the building. Traps can be used to identify the pests, the extent of infestation, and determine the source of the infestation.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; All of the identification information on the pests should be documented to keep track of the pests, points of entry, and potential damage the pest may cause. Having these “records of inspection results...will help identify seasonal risk factors and areas with a high frequency of problems”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Parks Services|title=National Parks Services-IPM manual|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/manual/museum.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum should review the data and ask “can we simply remove the pest? are eggs present? what is the least damaging approach to treatment?”.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; Once a museum have this information written down and confirmed by all those involved in the program, a treatment strategy can be planned and implemented.

===Treatment action===
* '''Traps''': Traps are an important part of Integrated Pest Management and they come in different shapes, sizes, and odors.&lt;ref name="AIC 41st"&gt;{{cite web|last=AIC|title=AIC - Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.conservators-converse.org/2013/06/41st-annual-meeting-workshop-integrated-pest-management-for-collections/|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traps will help to identify the museums pest problem, and should be periodically emptied as the dead pests will attract and be food for other pests.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; Before any treatment action is executed, it is important to consult the curator, the conservator, and review any history on the object affected.
* '''Sticky traps''': The most common traps are sticky traps or glue boards. These traps should be placed in high risk areas and will provide the museum’s staff insight into the pests that are infesting the building and “can be used to give information on the pest, an indication of their number and seasonal cycles and where they congregate … (the best place these trap are) … in corners, near doors, vents, fireplaces and other potential entry points for insects”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; Sticky traps should be inspected weekly and all findings clearly reported.
* '''Pheromone traps''': Pheromone traps have natural scents that attract a target pest group. These traps can serve as an effective warning system, and are typically also deployed with/as sticky traps. Currently pheromone traps are only available for “[[webbing clothes moth]]s, [[drug store beetle]]s, [[cigarette beetle]]s, and the [[German cockroach]], but more are being developed”.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;
* '''Light traps''': Light Traps emit ultraviolet light to attract moths and flies. Most insects are drawn towards light, but these traps should not be used on their own.&lt;ref name="(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; Other traps, usually sticky traps, should be installed near light traps to help encourage and trap more pests.
* '''Chemical control of museum pests''': Pesticides should only be used as a last resort as “pesticides used in museum pest control are generally some of the same products used for household or other structural pest control”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; These chemicals can be damaging to the health to the staff and to anyone else that visits the building. Chemicals “can cause acute symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and breathing difficulty”.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; Chemicals can also cause damage to the museum’s collection such as metal corrosion, deterioration of proteins (fur, feather, leather, and wool), deterioration of paper, stiffening/softening of plastic and change the pigments.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; Pesticides will do notthing to prevent the infestation, they only kill the pests after the fact, once the damage has already been done. Museum objects should avoid direct treatment, however, if the object requires pesticides to remove pests it should be fumigated. All fumigation should be performed by a professional.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

==Common museum pests==
There are many different type of [[Pest (organism)|pests]] that can affect a museum and its collection. It will be important for the museum staff to identify the pests, as well as understand how they will act and what they will feed on. Insects will cause damage not only through their feeding habits but their tracks, tunnel and nesting habits may also cause damage. Most damage will occur when the insect is in its larva stage – when most of the feeding takes place – though some insects like booklice will continue to damage objects past the larva stage.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; Rodents can cause further damage through the increased risk of fire when they gnaw on wires.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

===[[Insects]]===
* '''Fabric pests''': There are two groups of Fabric pests that are common in museums: carpet beetles and clothes moths. These pest eat proteins like [[wool]], [[fur]], [[feathers]], dead animals and [[horn (anatomy)|horns]].&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; These pests are known to burrow into materials such as storage bins or little used drawers.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
* '''Wood pests''': The most common wood pests are the wood boring beetle and the dry wood termites. These pest are known to attack and damage objects made of wood and often go undetected on the surface as they burrow into the wood.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;
* '''Stored product pests''': The most common stored product pests or pantry pests are the cigarette beetle and the drugstore beetle. These pests are known to infest “[[seeds]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[Food grain|grain]]s, [[spices]], [[dried fruits]], and [[vegetables]]," items which many museums include.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
* '''Moisture pests''': Moisture can be damaging not only to the building but also to the objects in the collection that “may attract a number of moisture-loving pests that can do additional damage”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; [[Mold]] is damaging on its own but it also attracts pests like [[Psocoptera]] to feed on the objects that are affected by mold. It is important for museums to keep their facilities and collection areas free from any dampness and immediately deal with leaks or possible water damage.
* '''General pests''': General pests are any household pests that enter into a building through [[window]]s, [[door]]s, cracks, and any other entrance to the museum. These pest include [[cockroaches]], [[rodents]], [[silverfish]], and [[ants]] and will cause damage to the museum and their objects. The most common damage occurs from the [[nest]]ing and feeding behaviors.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

===Rodents===
It will become apparent if your museum has a rodent infestation as the pests leave behind droppings and gnaw marks. [[Rodents]] will breed rapidly and begin shredding and nest in objects they come into contact with. It is important to note that rodents “will not discriminate between valuable objects, packing or rubbish”.&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives"&gt;{{cite web|last=David Pinniger &amp; Peter Winsor|title=Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives|url=http://formacaompr.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/ipm_guide-pestes.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to never use rodent bait, because “poisoned  rodents often crawl away and die in unreachable areas such as between walls and under furniture, and their carcasses provide food for other pests”.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; Traps should be used to remove rodents from the museum in a more humane manner that will prevent the rodents from attracting more pests or causing larger problems.

===Birds===
[[Birds]] can cause damage to the exterior of the museum when they roost or nest on “windowsills, ledger, and other architectural features”.&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives" /&gt; Bird droppings can cause staining and damage to the building and any fabric attached to the building. Museum staff will also need to be careful when they are around birds and items infested by birds as they can “pose a health hazard to humans … as (they) carry [[parasites]] and [[disease]]”.&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives" /&gt; Bird droppings can also be tracked into the museum and collection space, and by working to remove the birds from entrances, the tracking of the droppings can be controlled.

===Bats===
[[Bat]]s can cause damage and mess with their droppings.

|-
| [[Furniture Beetle]]||Anobium punctatum (DeGeer)||[[File:Anobium.punctatum.jpg|thumb|Anobium.punctatum]]
The Furniture beetle are similar to the common carpet beetle and the two can be easily mistaken for one another. These beetles eat a number of common materials found in a museum, including [[Turtle shell|tortoise shell]], [[fur]], [[feathers]], [[silk]], [[horn (anatomy)|horns]], [[wool]] and [[furniture]].&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
|-
| [[German Cockroach]]||Blattella germanica (Linnaeus)||[[File:German cockroach.jpg|thumb|German cockroach]]
The [[German cockroach]] can cause damage to objects in a museum's collection by “spitting brown fluid called attar…(this) … can get stuck on artifacts and is very bad to get out”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; It is important to identify if your infestation includes young cockroaches as this means you have an infestation and nesting. If these pests have wings and legs this could be a sign that you also have [[mice]]. If this is the case, you should not use rodent bait to deal with the mice, as cockroaches are attracted to the rodent bait; it “is loaded with [[anti-coagulants]], a blood thinner which have no effect on insects …(and) … will only aggravate the roach situation”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt;
|-
| [[Larder Beetle]]||Dermestes lardarius (Linnaeus)||[[File:Klannebille topp.jpg|thumb|Klannebille topp]]
The [[larder beetle]]  are winged insects with coarse yellow hairs and usually have dark spots along their back.

|-
| [[Silverfish]]||Lepisma saccharina (Linnaeus)||[[File:LepismaSaccharina.jpg|thumb]]
[[Silverfish]] are [[nocturnal]] insects that enjoy “cool and moist conditions”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; These insects feed on the [[starch]] from paper and wallpaper, as well as feed on dead insect parts. The silverfish eats around the ink of the paper it damages and may prevent conservation from easily taking place.
|-
| [[Varied Carpet Beetle]]||Anthrenus verbasci (Linnaeus)||[[File:Anthrenus verbasci MHNT Fronton Side view.jpg|thumb|A''nthrenus verbasci'']]
The various carpet beetles are active [[scavengers]]. These beetles damage carpets, animal products such as feathers, furs, leather, silk, bone, and hides.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; The carpet beetle is known to live along [[baseboards]] and behind furniture.
|-
| Warehouse Beetle||[[Trogoderma variabile]] (Ballion)||[[File:Trogoderma variabile.jpg|thumb|Trogoderma variabile]]
The warehouse beetle is lively and grows at a rapid rate. These beetles can be found in stored food and are attracted to plants and insect collections in a museum.&lt;ref name="MuseumPest.net - Warehouse beetle"&gt;{{cite web|last=MuseumPest.net|title=Warehouse beetle|url=http://museumpests.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Warehouse-Beetle.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beetle can be found in the [[dark]], storage areas or in cracks in the building.

==Pest prevention==
There are a number of steps that a museum can put in place to help to prevent pests within their buildings. It is important to inspect any item that is coming in the storage area such as a new accessions or loans. Museums should maintain good housekeeping and restrict food in the museum to help prevent pests in the first place. It is important for the museum to keep the environments in exhibition galleries and the collection storage areas stable with low, controlled [[humidity]] and [[temperature]].
 
A museum may also install sweeps and gaskets on exterior [[door]]s, [[Window screen|screens]] on all [[Drain (plumbing)|drains]] and [[window]]s, while also [[caulking]] all cracks in the building. Museums can make their facilities less attractive to pest by removing any plants growing near the building, cleaning the [[Rain gutter|gutter]]s, using [[sodium vapor]] lighting, minimizing [[dust]], vacuuming the floors, and eliminating clutter.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

===Routes of entry===
Pest will always find a way into your building, so it is important to determine how pests are entering your building. The location of the building should be taken into account as every "building has their own [[ecosystem]] based on their location and other historic factors".&lt;ref name="(American Museum of natural History, IPM)" /&gt; It is important to secure the exterior of the building. It does not matter how many pests you trap and kill; if there is a way for more to enter your building you will never completely remove all pests from the building. All of the cracks and holes in the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] should be sealed and repaired. All exterior trash receptacles should be placed away from the building, and plants should be at least a foot away from the building.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; Having [[grass]] growing against the building gives insects another way into the building and a place to hide and tunnel under the foundation.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt;

* Windows

All windows should be tightly sealed. Weatherstripping can be placed around the windows to insure that the window is tightly sealed.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt;

* Doors

All doors should be checked and confirmed that they are firmly on their hinges and brush sweepers are installed.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; Brush sweepers are highly effective against pests, especially rodents.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; Having sticky traps placed around the sides of doors may prevent pests and monitor what types of pests can be entering the museum.

===Storage condition===
Collection storage areas are especially at risk from pests as they can be darker, tight spaces that often go undisturbed for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; If these tight spaces are left undisturbed and unmonitored for months or years at a time, they will provide  an atmosphere for pests to nest in high quantities. All collection areas should be fully cleaned at least twice a year with regular inspections once a month.

===Water sources===
Insects and other pests are attracted to [[water]] and damp areas. Common sources of water within the building are water pipes that can be found running throughout the building for restrooms, kitchens, water fountains, custodial closets, and climate control equipment.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; Water can also be found standing on the [[roof]] or in [[basement]]. If there are any unused [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s or drains, they should be screened or sealed off to not house unwanted guests.

===Lights===
It is important to reduce the attractiveness of the building to pests, and one of the ways that this can be achieved is through the lighting. A museum should use light shields, curtains, and keep windows closed to minimize the attractiveness of entering the building.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; Any “lighting affixed to the building should be made with sodium vapor and not mercury” and should have a yellowish tint.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; [[Sodium vapor]] repels insects, and installing these lights outside of the building can help reduce the pests.

===Housekeeping===
One of the most important compotes of preventing pests is having good housekeeping skills. The building should be regularly vacuumed, mopped, and dusted, and food debris should be removed. When the museum is vacuumed, the edge tool around the furniture and baseboards should be used as pests tend to hide in these locations.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; The collection storage area should be kept clean and free of clutter. Every six months the entire collection storage area should be cleaned, and every month a visual inspection should be conducted throughout the space.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt;

===Temperature and humidity===
Pests can be controlled and growth even slowed when the humidity and temperature is controlled. Humidity should be kept below a maximum of 50%.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; In some cases the pest infestation can be directly related to the humidity and temperature within the building. The optimum temperature should around 68&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt;

===Screens, caulking, and filters===
Museum can use screens, filters, and caulking to prevent the entry of pests. Screens should be placed over windows and drains. Filters should be used on all of the air vents and replaced on a regular basis. Caulk can be used to seal cracks and holes in the walls, floors, and round pipes.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

=== Food sources===
Pests can find many sources of food within a museum; “pests are normally wild creatures but they are opportunistic and if material is available that resembles their preferred natural food or nesting, they will readily adapt and possibly thrive."&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives" /&gt; Food sources can range from human food, to plants and trash. Human food should be consumed in restricted area and have any food put away quickly after use. Plants can come in many forms, including potted plants, cut flowers, and dying plants. Trash should also be collected and removed from the building daily.

==Pest removal==
* Heat 
Treating an object with heat is a method used to disinfect objects by either an oven or a commercial kiln. When the internal temperature reaches “130°F for three hours it will kill any insect”; however, this kind of heat can damage veneer, damage finish of specimens, warp lumber, or melt glues.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

* Freezing 
Freezing an object is one of the best ways to disinfect and to destroy pests. This process should be done in a controlled freezer that can reach temperatures below 0&amp;nbsp;°F. “Books, mammal, ethnographic materials and bird collections have been successfully frozen for insect control,” though freezing is not always the best option for certain objects such as certain [[wood]]s, [[bone]], lacquers, some painted surfaces, and [[leather]].&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; Before an object is frozen for one to two weeks, it should be wrapped tightly in plastic or in a plastic bag.

* Vacuuming 
Vacuuming an infested object can remove pests. It is important to ensure that the “materials are not fragile or deteriorated" if they are to be vacuumed.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; Vacuuming should remove all of the hatched pest, but some eggs may remain as they can be microscopic. After the object has been vacuumed, it should be placed in a plastic bag isolating the object. During the isolation, the objects should be monitored to make sure that no pests remain on the object, and after the pests life cycle is completed the cleaning process may needed to be repeated.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

* Microwave 
Microwaving an infested object is still an experimental technique but has been known to “kill cockroach, silverfish, and psocids inside books … the average infested book is microwaved on high for 20-30 seconds”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16404">In [[macroecology]] and [[community (ecology)|community ecology]], an '''occupancy frequency distribution''' ('''OFD''') is the distribution of the numbers of species occupying different numbers of areas.&lt;ref name="Mcgeoch2002"/&gt; It was first reported in 1918 by the Danish botanist [[Christen C. Raunkiær]] in his study on plant communities. The OFD is also known as the species-range size distribution in literature.&lt;ref name="Gaston1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaston1998"/&gt;

== Bimodality ==

A typical form of OFD is a [[bimodal distribution]], indicating the [[species]] in a community is either rare or common, known as Raunkiaer's law of distribution of frequencies.&lt;ref name="Papp1997" /&gt; That is, with each species assigned to one of five 20%-wide occupancy classes, Raunkiaer's law predicts bimodal distributions within homogenous plant formations with [[mode (statistics)|modes]] in the first (0-20%) and last (81-100%) classes.&lt;ref name="Papp1997" /&gt; Although Raunkiaer's law has long been discounted as an index of plant community homogeneity,&lt;ref name="Mcintosh1962"/&gt; the method of using occupancy classes to construct OFDs is still commonly used for both plant and animal assemblages. [[Henry Gleason]] commented on this law in a 1929 ''[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]'' article: "In conclusion we may say that Raunkiaer's law is merely an expression of the fact that in any association there are more species with few individuals than with many, that the law is most apparent when [[quadrat]]s are chosen of the most serviceable size to show frequency, and that it is obscured or lost if the quadrats are either too large or too small."&lt;ref name="Gleason1929" /&gt;  Evidently, there are different shapes of OFD found in literature. Tokeshi reported that approximately 46% of observations have a [[skewness|right-skewed]] [[unimodal distribution|unimodal shape]], 27% bimodal, and 27% [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]].&lt;ref name="Tokeshi1992"/&gt; A recent study reaffirms about 24% bimodal OFDs in among 289 real communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hui | first1 = C | year = 2012 | title = Scale effect and bimodality in the frequency distribution of species occupancy | url = | journal = Community Ecology | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 30–35 | doi = 10.1556/ComEc.13.2012.1.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors ==

As pointed out by Gleason,&lt;ref name="Gleason1929" /&gt; the variety shapes of OFD can be explained, to a large degree, by the size of the sampling interval. For instance, McGeoch and Gaston (2002)&lt;ref name="Mcgeoch2002"/&gt; show that the number of satellite (rare) species declines with the increase of sampling grains, but the number of core (common) species increases, showing a tendency from a bimodal OFD towards a right-skewed unimodal distribution. This is because [[species range]], measured as occupancy, is strongly affected by the spatial scale and its aggregation structure,&lt;ref name="Hui2010"/&gt; known often as the [[scaling pattern of occupancy]]. Such scale dependence of occupancy has a profound effect on other macroecological patterns, such as the [[occupancy-abundance relationship]].

Other factors that have been proposed to be able to affect the shape of OFD include the degree of habitat heterogeneity,&lt;ref name="Raunkiaer1934"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1984"/&gt; species specificity,&lt;ref name="Brown1995"/&gt; landscape productivity,&lt;ref name="Maurer1990"/&gt; position in the geographic range,&lt;ref name="Williams1988"/&gt; species dispersal ability&lt;ref name="Collins1997"/&gt; and the extinction–colonization dynamics.&lt;ref name="Hanski1982"/&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

Three basic models have been proposed to explain the bimodality found in occupancy frequency distributions.

===Sampling results===
Random sampling of individuals from either [[lognormal]] or [[log-series distrbution|log-series]] rank abundance distributions (where random choice of an individual from a given species was proportional to its frequency) may produce bimodal occupancy distributions.&lt;ref name="Papp1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nee1991"/&gt; This model is not particularly sensitive or informative as to the mechanisms generating bimodality in occupancy frequency distributions, because the mechanisms generating the lognormal species abundance distribution are still under heavy debate.

===Core-satellite hypothesis===
Bimodality may be generated by colonization-extinction metapopulation dynamics associated with a strong rescue effect.&lt;ref name="Hanski1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanski1993"/&gt; This model is appropriate to explain the range structure of a community that is influenced by metapopulation processes, such as dispersal and [[local extinction]].&lt;ref name="Storch2002"/&gt; However, it is not robust because the shape of the occupancy frequency distribution generated by this model is highly sensitive
to species immigration and extinction parameters.&lt;ref name="Tokeshi1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheiner1997"/&gt; The metapopulation model does also not explain scale dependence in the occupancy frequency distribution.

===Occupancy probability transition===
The third model that describes bimodality in the occupancy frequency distribution is based on the [[scaling pattern of occupancy]] under a [[Self-similarity|self-similar]] assumption of species distributions (called the occupancy probability transition [OPT] model).&lt;ref name="Hui2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hui2007b"/&gt; The OPT model is based on Harte et al.'s bisection scheme&lt;ref name="Harte1999"/&gt; (although not on their probability rule) and the recursion probability of occupancy at different scales. The OPT model has been shown to support two empirical observations:&lt;ref name="Hui2007a"/&gt;
#That bimodality is prevalent in interspecific occupancy frequency distributions.
#that the number of satellite species in the distribution increases towards finer scales.

The OPT model demonstrates that the sample grain of a study, sampling adequacy, and the distribution of species saturation coefficients (a measure of the fractal dimensionality of a species distribution) in a community are together largely able to explain the patterns commonly found in empirical occupancy distributions. [[Cang Hui|Hui]] and McGeoch (2007) further show that the self-similarity in species distributions breaks down according to a power relationship with spatial scales, and we therefore adopt a power-scaling assumption for modeling species occupancy distributions.&lt;ref name="Hui2007b"/&gt; The bimodality in occupancy frequency distributions that is common in species communities, is confirmed to a result for certain mathematical and statistical properties of the probability distribution of occupancy. The results thus demonstrate that the use of the bisection method in combination with a power-scaling assumption is more appropriate for modeling species distributions than the use of a self-similarity assumption, particularly at fine scales. This model further provokes the Harte-Maddux debate: Harte et al.&lt;ref name="Harte1999"/&gt; demonstrated that the [[power law]] form of the [[Species-area curve|species–area relationship]] may be derived from a bisected, self-similar landscape and a community-level probability rule.&lt;ref name="Ostling2004"/&gt; However, Maddux&lt;ref name="Maddux2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maddux1999"/&gt; showed that this self-similarity model generates biologically unrealistic predictions. [[Cang Hui|Hui]] and McGeoch (2008) resolve the Harte–Maddux debate by demonstrating that the problems identified by Maddux result from an assumption that the probability of occurrence of a species at one scale is independent of its probability of occurrence at the next, and further illustrate the importance of considering patterns of species co-occurrence, and the way in which species occupancy patterns change with scale, when modeling species distributions.&lt;ref name="Hui2008"/&gt;

'''Palaeoarchaeology''' (or '''paleoarcheology''') is the [[archaeology]] of [[deep time]].&lt;ref name=Anderson2003&gt;{{cite journal|title=Archaeology is anthropology|volume=13|series=Archeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association|author=David G. Anderson|publisher=American Anthropological Association|year=2003|isbn=9781931303125|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleoarchaeologists' studies focus on hominid fossils ranging from 15,000,000 to 10,000 years ago, and  emphasize human evolution and how humans have adapted to the environment in the past few million years.&lt;ref name="Arch?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Archaeology?|url=http://www.indril.com/research/introanth/Unit1/1arch.html|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the field of study began in the late 1850s and early 1860s, with a shift in interest caused by the discoveries made by [[Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes|Boucher de Perthes]], after [[Joseph Prestwich]], [[Hugh Falconer]], and [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]] had visited Boucher de Perthes's site in the Somme valley themselves. Two such archaeologists who had been attracted to join archaeological societies by palaeoarchaeology were [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]. Evans, Pitt Rivers, and [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] all promoted interest in the field, each an enthusiast and each quickly rising to positions of authority and influence within archaeological circles. In 1868, for example, they together organized, in conjunction with the annual general meeting in [[Norwich]] of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], the Third International Congress of Prehistoric Archaeology.&lt;ref name=Chapman1989&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Towards an Institutional History of Archaeology: British Archaeologists and Allied Interests in the 1860s|author=William Chapman|title=Tracing archaeology's past: the historiography of archaeology|series=Publications in archaeology|editor=Andrew L. Christenson|publisher=SIU Press|year=1989|isbn=9780809315239|pages=156&amp;ndash;158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of paleoarchaeology sites are found in Southern and Eastern Africa. Some of the most productive sites have been those of Hadar, Sterkfontein, Kanapoi, and Olduvai Gorge.&lt;ref name=Paleo2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Paleoanthropology- Hominid Family History|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Paleoanthropology.html|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that paleoarchaeology deals with such ancient human remains presents some unique difficulties. Often the remains that are found are incomplete. In addition, paleoarchaeologists often deal with remains that lie somewhere between their primate ancestors and modern humans. This can make the analysis of the remains rather difficult. Similar finds can be rare so paleoarchaeologists must rely on the reanalysis of existing fossils.&lt;ref name="Arch?" /&gt;

In addition to the traditional methods of archaeology and physical anthropology,  linguistics, paleogenomics, geography and various fields of environmental studies are used to explore the questions in the field.

'''''Passage to Nirvana, A Survivor's Zen Voyage: Reflections on Loss, Discovery, Healing &amp; Hope''''' is a memoir by [[Lee Carlson]], written over a several year period from 2005-2010 primarily on board a 60-foot sailboat named Nirvana that he shared with his fiancée Meg.  It was his first book, although he had made his living as a writer for most of his adult life, working first as a journalist, magazine editor and freelance writer, and then moving into advertising and marketing copywriting. The book centers around Carlson's [[Traumatic Brain Injury]] and subsequent recovery, as well as his mother's death from a [[Traumatic Brain Injury]]. However the book is much more far-ranging, delving into such subjects as [[Zen Buddhism]], [[sailing]], [[divorce]], [[children]], [[family]] and even [[poetry]]. Ultimately it is a book about finding peace and happiness after a traumatic life event, a book about finding the joy in living.

==Plot summary==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lee-5 3 2small.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Carlson in 2011.]] --&gt;
''Passage to Nirvana'' begins with Carlson's accident, when he was hit by a car standing outside a car wash, striking his head violently on the pavement, fracturing his skull, lapsing into a light coma and sustaining a Traumatic Brain Injury, with bleeding on the brain and other damage. The story follows him through his brief hospitalization, then a year-long rehab in Florida, then his return to the North Fork of Long Island where he tries to rebuild his shattered life. His wife has left him and moved away with their children, his business has evaporated, he has no home and has to begin with noting to renew his life. During his year in Florida he also helps care for his mother, who is severely disabled from her own traumatic brain injury sustained when she fell down a flight of basement stairs. She is in a wheelchair, unable to walk, talk or feed herself. While he is in Florida, his mother eventually dies. Upon returning to Long Island, more misfortunes seem to continue: his aunt dies of cancer, as does his brother-in-law, and he returns to Buffalo to help his sister and her children while his brother-in-law is in the hospital.

{{rquote|right|"I'm a believer in storytelling, I think the human mind has always learned from storytelling — from Grendel to Aesop's Fables to the Arabian Nights. Storytelling helps us organize our world.|Lee Carlson in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.buffalonews.com/life/health-parenting/article245999.ece | title=Finding 'Nirvana' in a haze of traumatic brain injury | publisher= [[The Buffalo News]]| date=November 9, 2010| accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While this may sound morbid and depressing, the bulk of the book is uplifting, a positive affirmation of life. Carlson concentrates on his Zen Buddhist studies and meditation as a way of helping him heal, working with the noted writer and Zen teacher [[Peter Matthiessen]]. Sections of the book take place in the Ocean Zendo, a Zen center run by Matthiessen, and much of the book is a meditation on the spiritual aspects of healing, acceptance and rebuilding a life. Eventually Carlson meets a beautiful, understanding woman who has been through difficulties of her own: a difficult divorce, raising two children as a single mother. They fall in love, and decide to buy a sailboat named "Nirvana" that they discover rotting in a boatyard in [[St. Martin]]. They renovate the boat, sail her back to the eastern end of Long Island, where they are joined by their four children and two dogs, working at creating a new family and a new life. Eventually they sail "Nirvana" to the Bahamas for a winter writing sabbatical, where most of the book was written.

Trying to describe the "plot" is difficult, however, as the book is really a collection of short essays, some about events happening in real time, some about Traumatic Brain Injury, some reflections on various aspects of philosophy and Eastern thought, and some stories recalling the author's childhood. See the section "Unique Writing Style" below for more information.

==Unique writing style==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NirvanaInsideBook.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The unique creative layout of the book, with each chapter preceded by a very short poem Carlson calls a "Po."]] --&gt;
The book is written as a series of short, interconnected essays, many of them short, short stories no more than a few pages long, using some example from Carlson's life and recovery as a kind of moral fable. Most of the chapters are preceded by exceedingly short poems, often consisting of only three or four words, that Carlson calls a "Po." The narrative of the book is not linear, and in the book's introduction Carlson says that much of the book's unique style came from how his brain functioned during his recovery. The Po because initially he could not remember long sentences; the short chapters because he could not remember longer chapters, and the non-linear narrative because that's how his mind was functioning, having trouble concentrating on any one thing for long periods of time. As such the narrative jumps back and forth, loops around in time, and is refreshingly inventive and interesting. At the same time, each short chapter is designed as a stand-alone essay, so the reader can pick up the book, turn to any chapter and read it as a kind of short story.

==Background and publication==
Written during 2005-2010, and published in [[2010 in literature|2010]], ''Passage to Nirvana'' was rejected by a number of mainstream publishers and agents, due to its unusual writing style and layout. Because of his background in magazine publishing, Carlson decided to form his own publishing company, Henry Chapin and Sons, to publish and market the book. Given his interest in new technology, the internet, and the rapidly changing publishing business, he also decided to use the new crowdfunding paradigm for raising money to publish the book, and raised nearly $13,000 from small, individual donors using the arts funding web site [[kickstarter]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Julie (2010-1-20). [http://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2010/10/644/local-authors-go-the-self-publish-route/ "Local authors go the self-publish route." ''The Suffolk Times'']. Retrieved March 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He then used Facebook, as well as the worldwide network of Amazon.com sites such as Amazon Japan as a way of marketing the book and reaching out to a worldwide readership, where the book found a following, gathering fans from not only the U.S., but from Canada, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, the U.K., Ireland, France, Italy, Russia, Poland, Morocco, South Africa, Croatia, India, Nepal, Indonesia, Japan, Australia and other countries.

==Reviews and criticism==
''Passage to Nirvana'' has received positive reviews. One reviewer said, "Mr. Carlson is playful with words, which is part of the enchantment of his po-etics, or short poems, called po. With titles like “Passage to Nirvana” and “The Book of Po,” they made me think of “Passage to India” and “Life of Pi.” The references lead by imagination to the land of origin for Buddhism, or so I take it. Mr. Carlson’s journey is graced with whimsy, like a good south wind with the sail in a reach and spray in your face....The writing here is lucid, with a light touch — light of heart." &lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Rev. Robert (2011-3-10)[http://www.easthamptonstar.com/dnn/Arts/OntheRoadtoSomewhere/tabid/14386/Default.aspx "On the Road to Somewhere."

Retrieved March 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reviewer said "No one is perfect, and realizing this is the first step in finding that second opportunity in life. "Passage to Nirvana: A Survivor's Zen Voyage: Reflections on Loss, Discovery, Healing &amp; Hope" is an inspirational and spiritual read from Lee Carlson. Recovering from a traumatic brain injury, he found new joy in life and found his own passage to joy in life through many arts of Zen. Thoughtful and riveting reading, "Passage to Nirvana" is an enlightening and educational read that shouldn't be overlooked for those looking for their own second chances." &lt;ref&gt;(2011-01). [http://www.midwestbookreview.com/sbw/jan_11.htm#Religion/Spirituality ''Midwest Book Review''].Retrieved March 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third review called ''Passage to Nirvana'' "An inspirational story of how love and the strength of the human spirit can triumph over adversity, Passage to Nirvana is a reminder to cherish every day and never forget that our health is, indeed, our wealth."&lt;ref&gt;(2011-01). [http://windcheckmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=947:passage-to-nirvana&amp;catid=93:book-review&amp;Itemid=425 "Passage to Nirvana." ''Windcheck Magazine''].  Retrieved March 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the book is ostensibly about recovering from Traumatic Brain Injury, the spiritual nature of the book is one thing that seems to have captured many people's attention. There is the review in the East Hampton Star that was written by a minister (see first review above), and on the book's website there are many reviews and testimonials from people with two testimonials from religious teachers standing out: “Amazing, Really Amazing. I Want to Share it With Others.” -Rabbi John Linder, Temple Solei; and “Deserves to be Hailed As A Unique and Lasting Contribution to American Letters.” -Reverend Thomas Yorty, Westminster Presbyterian Church. The book has received all five-star reviews on Amazon.com.

'''Pedophilia''' ([[American and British English spelling differences|alternatively]] spelled '''paedophilia''') is a [[Mental disorder|psychiatric disorder]] in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive [[sexual attraction]] to [[prepubescent]] children.&lt;ref name="Gavin"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors =Gavin H|title =

Pedophilia is termed '''pedophilic disorder''' in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] ([[DSM-5]]), and the manual defines it as a [[paraphilia]] involving intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] about prepubescent children that have either been acted upon or which cause the person with the attraction distress or [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] difficulty.&lt;ref name="DSM 5"/&gt; The [[International Classification of Diseases]] ([[ICD-11]]) defines it as a "sustained, focused, and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours—involving pre-pubertal children."&lt;ref name=ICD-11&gt;{{Cite web |title=ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]/[[ICD-11]]|date=2018|accessdate=July 7, 2018|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/517058174|at=See section 6D32 Pedophilic disorder|quote=Pedophilic disorder is characterized by a sustained, focused, and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours—involving pre-pubertal children.

Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century. A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s.

==Definitions==
The word ''pedophilia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] παῖς, παιδός (''paîs, paidós''), meaning "child", and φιλία (''[[Philia|philía]]''), "friendly love" or "friendship".&lt;ref name="Liddell, H.G. 1959"&gt;{{cite book|first1=H.G.|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|title=Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford At The Clarendon Press]]|location=Oxford, England|date=1959|ISBN=0-19-910206-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pedophilia'' is used for individuals with a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children aged 13 or younger.&lt;ref name="DSM 5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ICD-10" /&gt;
''Infantophilia'' is a sub-type of pedophilia; it is used to refer to a sexual preference for children under the age of 5 (especially [[infant]]s and [[toddler]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David M.|last1=Greenberg|first2=John|last2=Bradford|first3=Susan|last3=Curry|title=Infantophilia--a new subcategory of pedophilia?: a preliminary study |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4721/444e410960fc51ef6eaea13a15300b968973.pdf|journal=The Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |publisher=American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |location=Bloomfield, Connecticut|volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=63–71 |date=1995 |pmid=7599373 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mayoclinic" /&gt;  This is sometimes referred to as ''nepiophilia'' (from the {{lang-el|νήπιος}} (''népios'') meaning "infant" or "child," which in turn derives from "ne-" and "epos" meaning "not speaking"), though this term is rarely used in academic sources.&lt;ref name="Goode2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sarah D.|last=Goode|title=Understanding and Addressing Adult Sexual Attraction to Children: A Study of Paedophiles in Contemporary Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNKOAgAAQBAJ|date=2009|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|isbn=978-1-135-25804-7|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1= D.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Development and sexual orientation===
Pedophilia emerges before or during puberty, and is stable over time.&lt;ref name="cutler"&gt;{{cite book | author = Cutler, Brian L. | title = Encyclopedia of Psychology and Law | publisher = SAGE | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-4129-5189-0 | p = 549}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is self-discovered, not chosen.&lt;ref name="faganJAMA" /&gt; For these reasons, pedophilia has been described as a disorder of sexual preference, phenomenologically similar to a heterosexual or homosexual sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="cutler" /&gt; These observations, however, do not exclude pedophilia from the group of mental disorders because pedophilic acts cause harm, and mental health professionals can sometimes help pedophiles to refrain from harming children.&lt;ref name="Berlin"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Fred S. | last = Berlin | title = Treatments to Change Sexual Orientation | journal = [[American Journal of Psychiatry]] | publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|location=Washington, DC|date = 2000 | volume = 157 | issue = 5 | pages = 838-838 | accessdate = December 10, 2014 | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=174135 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to misinterpretations that the [[American Psychiatric Association]] considers pedophilia a sexual orientation because of wording in its printed DSM-5 manual, which distinguishes between [[paraphilia]] and what it calls "paraphilic disorder", subsequently forming a division of "pedophilia" and "pedophilic disorder", the association commented: "'[S]exual orientation' is not a term used in the diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder and its use in the DSM-5 text discussion is an error and should read 'sexual interest.'" They added, "In fact, APA considers pedophilic disorder a 'paraphilia,' not a 'sexual orientation.' This error will be corrected in the electronic version of DSM-5 and the next printing of the manual." They said they strongly support efforts to criminally prosecute those who sexually abuse and exploit children and adolescents, and "also support continued efforts to develop treatments for those with pedophilic disorder with the goal of preventing future acts of abuse."&lt;ref name="Wetzstein"&gt;{{cite news| first=Cheryl | last=Wetzstein| title=APA to correct manual: Pedophilia is not a ‘sexual orientation’|work=[[The Washington Times]]|publisher=Washington Times LLC|location=Washington DC|date=October 31, 2013|accessdate=February 14, 2014|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/31/apa-correct-manual-clarification-pedophilia-not-se/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comorbidity and personality traits===
Studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders often report that it co-occurs with other [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]], such as low [[self-esteem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marshall WL | title = The relationship between self-esteem and deviant sexual arousal in nonfamilial child molesters | journal = Behavior Modification | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–96 | year = 1997 | pmid = 8995044 | doi = 10.1177/01454455970211005 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; depression, anxiety, and personality problems. It is not clear whether these are features of the disorder itself, artifacts of sampling bias, or consequences of being identified as a sex offender.&lt;ref name="setocomorbidity" /&gt; One review of the literature concluded that research on personality correlates and psychopathology in pedophiles is rarely methodologically correct, in part owing to confusion between pedophiles and child sex offenders, as well as the difficulty of obtaining a representative, community sample of pedophiles.&lt;ref&gt;Okami, P. &amp; Goldberg, A. (1992). "Personality Correlates of Pedophilia: Are They Reliable Indicators?", ''Journal of Sex Research'', Vol. 29, No. 3, pp. 297–328. "For example, because an unknown percentage of true pedophiles may never act on their impulses or may never be arrested, forensic samples of sex offenders against minors clearly do not represent the population of "pedophiles", and many such persons apparently do not even belong to the population of "pedophiles"."&lt;/ref&gt; Seto (2004) points out that pedophiles who are available from a clinical setting are likely there because of distress over their sexual preference or pressure from others. This increases the likelihood that they will show psychological problems. Similarly, pedophiles recruited from a correctional setting have been convicted of a crime, making it more likely that they will show anti-social characteristics.&lt;ref name="seto2004" /&gt;

Impaired self-concept and interpersonal functioning were reported in a sample of child sex offenders who met the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia by Cohen et al. (2002), which the authors suggested could contribute to motivation for pedophilic acts. The pedophilic offenders in the study had elevated [[psychopathy]] and cognitive distortions compared to healthy community controls. This was interpreted as underlying their failure to inhibit their criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen LJ, McGeoch PG, Watras-Gans S, Acker S, Poznansky O, Cullen K, Itskovich Y, Galynker I | title = Personality impairment in male pedophiles | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = 10 | pages = 912–9 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12416601 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v63n1009 | url = http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2002/v63n10/v63n1009.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in 2009 and 2012 found that non-pedophilic child sex offenders exhibited psychopathy, but pedophiles did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Strassberg, Donald S., Eastvold, Angela, Kenney, J.

Wilson and Cox (1983) studied the characteristics of a group of pedophile club members. The most marked differences between pedophiles and controls were on the introversion scale, with pedophiles showing elevated shyness, sensitivity and depression. The pedophiles scored higher on [[neuroticism]] and [[psychoticism]], but not enough to be considered pathological as a group. The authors caution that "there is a difficulty in untangling cause and effect. We cannot tell whether paedophiles gravitate towards children because, being highly introverted, they find the company of children less threatening than that of adults, or whether the social withdrawal implied by their introversion is a result of the isolation engendered by their preference i.e., awareness of the social [dis]approbation and hostility that it evokes" (p.&amp;nbsp;324).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilson G.

A review of qualitative research studies published between 1982 and 2001 concluded that child sexual abusers use [[cognitive distortion]]s to meet personal needs, justifying abuse by making excuses, redefining their actions as love and mutuality, and exploiting the power imbalance inherent in all adult–child relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lawson L | title = Isolation, gratification, justification: offenders' explanations of child molesting | journal = Issues in Mental Health Nursing | volume = 24 | issue = 6–7 | pages = 695–705 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12907384 | doi=10.1080/01612840305328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cognitive distortions include the idea of "children as sexual beings", uncontrollability of sexual behavior, and "sexual entitlement-bias".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mihailides S, Devilly GJ, Ward T | title = Implicit cognitive distortions and sexual offending | journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–350 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15560415 | doi = 10.1177/107906320401600406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child pornography===
Consumption of [[child pornography]] is a more reliable indicator of pedophilia than molesting a child,&lt;ref name="setocp" /&gt; although some non-pedophiles also view child pornography.&lt;ref name="lanning79"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis, Fifth Edition |first=Kenneth V. |last=Lanning |year=2010 |publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children |url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |page=79 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224092439/http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Child pornography may be used for a variety of purposes, ranging from private sexual gratification or trading with other collectors, to preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the [[child grooming]] process.&lt;ref name=CrossonTower208&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding child abuse and neglect  |first=Cynthia |last=Crosson-Tower |isbn=0-205-40183-X |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |year=2005|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wortley14&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Pornography on the Internet |author1=Richard Wortley |author2=Stephen Smallbone |journal=Problem-Oriented Guides for Police |volume=No. 41 |pages=14–16 |url=http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/Publications/e04062000.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107070400/http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/Publications/e04062000.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Levesque64&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexual Abuse of Children: A Human Rights Perspective |first=Roger J.

Pedophilic viewers of child pornography are often obsessive about collecting, organizing, categorizing, and labeling their child pornography collection according to age, gender, sex act and fantasy.&lt;ref name=CrossonTower200&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding child abuse and neglect |first=Cynthia |last=Crosson-Tower |isbn=0-205-40183-X |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |year=2005|pages=198–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to FBI agent Ken Lanning, "collecting" pornography does not mean that they merely view pornography, but that they save it, and "it comes to define, fuel, and validate their most cherished sexual fantasies".&lt;ref name="lanning79" /&gt; Lanning states that the collection is the single best indicator of what the offender wants to do, but not necessarily of what has or will be done.&lt;ref name="lanning107"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis, Fifth Edition |first=Kenneth V. |last=Lanning |year=2010 |publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children |url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |page=107 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224092439/http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers Taylor and Quayle reported that pedophilic collectors of child pornography are often involved in anonymous internet communities dedicated to extending their collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Quayle, E.  |author2=Taylor, M. | year = 2002 | title = Child pornography and the internet: Assessment Issues | journal = British Journal of Social Work | volume = 32 | page = 867 | doi=10.1093/bjsw/32.7.863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Although what causes pedophilia is not yet known, researchers began reporting a series of findings [[association (statistics)|linking]] pedophilia with brain structure and function, beginning in 2002. Testing individuals from a variety of referral sources inside and outside the criminal justice system as well as [[control group|controls]], these studies found associations between pedophilia and lower [[Intelligence quotient|IQs]],&lt;ref name=Blanchard2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Blanchard R. |author2=Kolla N.

Such studies suggest that there are one or more neurological characteristics present at birth that cause or increase the likelihood of being pedophilic. Some studies have found that pedophiles are less cognitively impaired than non-pedophilic child molesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Joyal, CC, Plante-Beaulieu, J. &amp; De Chanterac, A. | title = The neuropsychology of sexual offenders: A meta-analysis. | journal = Journal of Sexual Abuse | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–177 | year = 2014 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236138973 | quote = The distinction between nonpedophilic child molesters and exclusive pedophile child molesters, for instance, could be crucial in neuropsychology because the latter seem to be less cognitively impaired (Eastvold et al., 2011; Schiffer &amp; Vonlaufen, 2011; Suchy et al., 2009). Pedophilic child molesters might perform as well as controls (and better than nonpedophilic child molesters) on a wide variety of neuropsychological measures when mean IQ and other socioeconomic factors are similar (Schiffer &amp; Vonlaufen, 2011).

Another study, using structural [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], indicated that male pedophiles have a lower volume of [[white matter]] than a [[Scientific control|control group]].&lt;ref name = Cantor2008/&gt; Functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]) has indicated that child molesters diagnosed with pedophilia have reduced activation of the [[hypothalamus]] as compared with non-pedophilic persons when viewing sexually arousing pictures of adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Walter  ''et al'' | year = 2007 | title = Pedophilia Is Linked to Reduced Activation in Hypothalamus and Lateral Prefrontal Cortex During Visual Erotic Stimulation | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.10.018| pmid = 17400196 | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = 6| pages = 698–701}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 functional [[neuroimaging]] study notes that central processing of sexual stimuli in heterosexual "paedophile forensic inpatients" may be altered by a disturbance in the prefrontal networks, which "may be associated with stimulus-controlled behaviours, such as sexual compulsive behaviours".

Blanchard, Cantor, and Robichaud (2006) reviewed the research that attempted to identify [[hormone|hormonal]] aspects of pedophiles.&lt;ref name = Blanchard2006&gt;Blanchard, R., Cantor, J.

While not causes of pedophilia themselves, [[Child abuse|childhood abuse]] by adults or [[comorbidity|comorbid]] psychiatric illnesses—such as [[personality disorder]]s and [[substance abuse]]—are risk factors for acting on pedophilic urges.&lt;ref name=faganJAMA&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fagan PJ, Wise TN, Schmidt CW, Berlin FS | title = Pedophilia | journal = JAMA | volume = 288 | issue = 19 | pages = 2458–65 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12435259 | doi = 10.1001/jama.288.19.2458 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12435259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard, Cantor, and Robichaud addressed comorbid psychiatric illnesses that, "The theoretical implications are not so clear.

A study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 heterosexual men by using the Wilson Sex Fantasy Questionnaire exam determined that males with a pronounced degree of [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] interest (including pedophilia) had a greater number of older brothers, a high 2D:4D [[digit ratio]] (which would indicate low prenatal [[androgen]] exposure), and an elevated probability of being [[Left-handedness|left-handed]], suggesting that disturbed hemispheric [[Lateralization of brain function|brain lateralization]] may play a role in deviant attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rahman Q, Symeonides DJ | title = Neurodevelopmental Correlates of Paraphilic Sexual Interests in Men | journal = [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 166–172 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 18074220 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9255-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

===DSM and ICD-11===
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) has a significantly larger diagnostic features section for pedophilia than the previous DSM version, the [[DSM-IV-TR]], and states, "The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely disclose this paraphilia and to individuals who deny any sexual attraction to prepubertal children (generally age 13 years or younger), despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary."&lt;ref name="DSM 5"/&gt; Like the DSM-IV-TR, the manual outlines specific criteria for use in the diagnosis of this disorder. These include the presence of sexually arousing fantasies, behaviors or urges that involve some kind of sexual activity with a prepubescent child (with the diagnostic criteria for the disorder extending the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13) for six months or more, or that the subject has acted on these urges or suffers from distress as a result of having these feelings. The criteria also indicate that the subject should be 16 or older and that the child or children they fantasize about are at least five years younger than them, though ongoing sexual relationships between a 12- to 13-year-old and a late adolescent are advised to be excluded. A diagnosis is further specified by the sex of the children the person is attracted to, if the impulses or acts are limited to [[incest]], and if the attraction is "exclusive" or "nonexclusive".&lt;ref name="DSM 5"/&gt;

The [[ICD-10]] defines pedophilia as "a sexual preference for children, boys or girls or both, usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age".&lt;ref name="WHOPaedophilia"&gt;See section F65.4 Paedophilia. {{Cite web|title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) Version for 2010|publisher=[[ICD-10]]|accessdate=November 17, 2012|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F65.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the DSM, this system's criteria require that the person be at least 16 years of age or older before being diagnosed as a pedophile. The person must also have a persistent or predominant sexual preference for prepubescent children at least five years younger than them.&lt;ref name=ICD-10/&gt; The [[ICD-11]] defines pedophilic disorder as a "sustained, focused, and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours—involving pre-pubertal children."&lt;ref name=ICD-11/&gt; It also states that for a diagnosis of pedophilic disorder, "the individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges or be markedly distressed by them. This diagnosis does not apply to sexual behaviours among pre- or post-pubertal children with peers who are close in age."&lt;ref name=ICD-11/&gt;

Several terms have been used to distinguish "true pedophiles" from non-pedophilic and non-exclusive offenders, or to distinguish among types of offenders on a continuum according to strength and exclusivity of pedophilic interest, and motivation for the offense (see [[Child sexual abuse#Offenders|child sexual offender types]]). Exclusive pedophiles are sometimes referred to as ''true pedophiles.'' They are sexually attracted to prepubescent children, and only prepubescent children. Showing no erotic interest in adults, they can only become sexually aroused while fantasizing about or being in the presence of prepubescent children, or both.&lt;ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/&gt; Non-exclusive offenders—or "non-exclusive pedophiles"—may at times be referred to as ''non-pedophilic'' offenders, but the two terms are not always synonymous. Non-exclusive offenders are sexually attracted to both children and adults, and can be sexually aroused by both, though a sexual preference for one over the other in this case may also exist. If the attraction is a sexual preference for prepubescent children, such offenders are considered pedophiles in the same vein as exclusive offenders.&lt;ref name="WHOPaedophilia"/&gt;&lt;ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/&gt;

Neither the DSM nor the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria require actual sexual activity with a prepubescent youth. The diagnosis can therefore be made based on the presence of fantasies or sexual urges even if they have never been acted upon. On the other hand, a person who acts upon these urges yet experiences no distress about their fantasies or urges can also qualify for the diagnosis. ''Acting'' on sexual urges is not limited to overt sex acts for purposes of this diagnosis, and can sometimes include [[indecent exposure]], [[voyeurism|voyeuristic]] or [[frotteurism|frotteuristic]] behaviors,&lt;ref name="DSM 5"/&gt; or masturbating to [[child pornography]].&lt;ref name="setocp"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seto MC, Cantor JM, Blanchard R | title = Child pornography offenses are a valid diagnostic indicator of pedophilia | journal = J Abnorm Psychol | volume = 115 | issue = 3 | pages = 610–5 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16866601 | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.115.3.610 | quote = The results suggest child pornography offending is a stronger diagnostic indicator of pedophilia than is sexually offending against child victims }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, these behaviors need to be considered in-context with an element of clinical judgment before a diagnosis is made. Likewise, when the patient is in late adolescence, the age difference is not specified in hard numbers and instead requires careful consideration of the situation.&lt;ref name=DSMmedem&gt;[http://www.medem.com/MedLB/article_detaillb.cfm?article_ID=ZZZUZRUZGLC&amp;sub_cat=355 ''Pedophilia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508052445/http://www.medem.com/MedLB/article_detaillb.cfm?article_ID=ZZZUZRUZGLC&amp;sub_cat=355 |date=2006-05-08 }} DSM at the Medem Online Medical Library&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] ({{ICD10|F|66|1|f|60}}) includes people who acknowledge that they have a sexual preference for prepubertal children, but wish to change it due to the associated psychological or behavioral problems (or both).

===Debate regarding criteria===
The DSM-IV-TR criteria was criticized simultaneously for being over-inclusive, as well as under-inclusive.&lt;ref name=Studer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Studer LH, Aylwin AS | title = Pedophilia: The problem with diagnosis and limitations of CBT in treatment | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 774–781 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16766133 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2006.04.030 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most researchers distinguish between child molesters and pedophiles,&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Studer/&gt; Studer and Aylwin argue that the DSM criteria are over-inclusive because all acts of child molestation warrant the diagnosis. A child molester satisfies criteria A because of the behavior involving sexual activity with prepubescent children and criteria B because the individual has acted on those urges.&lt;ref name=Studer/&gt; Furthermore, they argue that it also is under-inclusive in the case of individuals who do not act upon it and are not distressed by it.&lt;ref name=Studer/&gt; The latter point has also been made by several other researchers who have remarked that a so-called "contented pedophile"—an individual who fantasizes about having sex with a child and masturbates to these fantasies, but does not commit child sexual abuse, and who does not feel subjectively distressed afterward—does not meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for pedophilia, because this person does not meet Criterion B.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Donohue W, Regev LG, Hagstrom A | title = Problems with the DSM-IV diagnosis of pedophilia | journal = Sex Abuse | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–105 | year = 2000| pmid = 10872239 | doi = 10.1023/A:1009586023326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenpedo"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Green R | year = 2002 | title = Is pedophilia a mental disorder? | url = http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/pedophilia.htm | journal = [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume = 31 | issue =  | pages = 467–471| doi = 10.1023/a:1020699013309 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101012005114/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/pedophilia.htm | archivedate = 2010-10-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DiagnosticCompare&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moulden HM, Firestone P, Kingston D, Bradford J | year = 2009 | title = Recidivism in pedophiles: an investigation using different diagnostic methods | journal = Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 680–701 | doi=10.1080/14789940903174055}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale survey about usage of different classification systems showed that the DSM classification is only rarely used. As an explanation, it was suggested that the under-inclusiveness, as well as a lack of validity, reliability and clarity might have led to the rejection of the DSM classification.&lt;ref name="feelgood"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feelgood S, Hoyer J | year = 2008 | title = Child molester or paedophile?

[[Ray Blanchard]], an [[Canadians of American origin|American-Canadian]] [[Sexology|sexologist]] known for his research studies on pedophilia, addressed (in his literature review for the DSM-5) the aforementioned objections to the DSM-IV-TR, and proposed a general solution applicable to all paraphilias. This meant namely a distinction between ''paraphilia'' and ''paraphilic disorder''. The latter term is proposed to identify the diagnosable mental disorder which meets Criterion A and B, whereas an individual who does not meet Criterion B can be ascertained but ''not'' diagnosed as having a paraphilia.&lt;ref name="pmid19757012"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blanchard R | title = The DSM diagnostic criteria for pedophilia | journal = Arch Sex Behav | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 304–16 |date=April 2010  | pmid = 19757012 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-009-9536-0 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard and a number of his colleagues also proposed that hebephilia become a diagnosable mental disorder under the DSM-5 to resolve the physical development overlap between pedophilia and hebephilia by combining the categories under ''pedophilic disorder'', but with specifiers on which age range (or both) is the primary interest.&lt;ref name="dsm5.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchard&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard R, Lykins AD, Wherrett D, Kuban ME, Cantor JM, Blak T, Dickey R, Klassen PE | title = Pedophilia, Hebephilia, and the DSM-V | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 335–350 | year = 2009 | pmid = 18686026 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9399-9 | url = https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10508-008-9399-9 | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal for hebephilia was rejected by the American Psychiatric Association,&lt;ref name=prnsdhebephilia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/witness/201212/psychiatry-rejects-novel-sexual-disorder-hebephilia |title=Psychiatry Rejects Novel Sexual Disorder "Hebephilia" |author=Karen Franklin |date=2 December 2012 |publisher=Psychology Today |location=USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the distinction between ''paraphilia'' and ''paraphilic disorder'' was implemented.&lt;ref name="DSM 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dsm5.org Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paraphilic Disorders |year=2013 |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Publishing]] |url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Paraphilic%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724010712/https://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Paraphilic%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Psychiatric Association stated that "[i]n the case of pedophilic disorder, the notable detail is what wasn't revised in the new manual. Although proposals were discussed throughout the DSM-5 development process, diagnostic criteria ultimately remained the same as in DSM-IV TR" and that "[o]nly the disorder name will be changed from pedophilia to pedophilic disorder to maintain consistency with the chapter’s other listings."&lt;ref name= "dsm5.org Fact Sheet"/&gt; If hebephilia had been accepted as a DSM-5 diagnosable disorder, it would have been similar to the ICD-10 definition of pedophilia that already includes early pubescents,&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt; and would have raised the minimum age required for a person to be able to be diagnosed with pedophilia from 16 years to 18 years (with the individual needing to be at least 5 years older than the minor).&lt;ref name="dsm5.org"/&gt;

O'Donohue, however, suggests that the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia be simplified to the attraction to children alone if ascertained by self-report, laboratory findings, or past behavior. He states that any sexual attraction to children is pathological and that distress is irrelevant, noting "this sexual attraction has the potential to cause significant harm to others and is also not in the best interests of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = O'Donohue W | title = A critique of the proposed DSM-V diagnosis of pedophilia | journal = Arch Sex Behav | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 587–90 | date = Jun 2010 | pmid = 20204487 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-010-9604-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also arguing for behavioral criteria in defining pedophilia, Howard E. Barbaree and [[Michael C. Seto]] disagreed with the American Psychiatric Association's approach in 1997 and instead recommended the use of actions as the sole criterion for the diagnosis of pedophilia, as a means of [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] simplification.&lt;ref name="barbaree-seto"&gt;Barbaree, H. E., and Seto, M. C. (1997). Pedophilia: Assessment and Treatment. ''Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment''. 175-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

===General===
There is no evidence that pedophilia can be cured.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt; Instead, most therapies focus on helping the pedophile refrain from acting on their desires.&lt;ref name=faganJAMA/&gt;&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Seto MC, Ahmed AG |title=Treatment and management of child pornography use |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=207–214 |year=2014 |pmid=24877707 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some therapies do attempt to cure pedophilia, but there are no studies showing that they result in a long-term change in sexual preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Camilleri, Joseph A., and Quinsey, Vernon L. |date= 2008 | title = Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment, 2nd edition | publisher = The Guilford Press | page = 193 | chapter = Pedophilia: Assessment and Treatment | editor1-last = Laws | editor1-first = D. Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Seto]] suggests that attempts to cure pedophilia in adulthood are unlikely to succeed because its development is influenced by prenatal factors.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt; Pedophilia appears to be difficult to alter but pedophiles can be helped to control their behavior, and future research could develop a method of prevention.&lt;ref name="berlin"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.paraphilias.com/publications/pdfs/Peer%20Comment.pdf|title=Peer Commentaries on Green (2002) and Schmidt (2002) - Pedophilia: When Is a Difference a Disorder?|first=Fred S.|last=Berlin|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=31|issue=6|date=December 2002|pages=479–480|doi=10.1023/A:1020603214218|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-12-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029223349/http://www.paraphilias.com/publications/pdfs/Peer%20Comment.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several common limitations to studies of treatment effectiveness. Most categorize their participants by behavior rather than erotic age preference, which makes it difficult to know the specific treatment outcome for pedophiles.&lt;ref name=faganJAMA/&gt; Many do not select their treatment and control groups [[Randomized controlled trial|randomly]]. Offenders who refuse or quit treatment are at higher risk of offending, so excluding them from the treated group, while not excluding those who would have refused or quit from the control group, can bias the treated group in favor of those with lower recidivism.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rice ME, Harris GT | year = 2003 | title = The size and signs of treatment effects in sex offender therapy | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 989 | pages = 428–40 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb07323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of treatment for non-offending pedophiles has not been studied.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;

===Cognitive behavioral therapy===
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) aims to reduce attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that may increase the likelihood of sexual offenses against children. Its content varies widely between therapists, but a typical program might involve training in self-control, social competence and empathy, and use [[cognitive restructuring]] to change views on sex with children. The most common form of this therapy is [[relapse prevention]], where the patient is taught to identify and respond to potentially risky situations based on principles used for treating addictions.&lt;ref name="seto171"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|page= 171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy is mixed.&lt;ref name="seto171" /&gt; A 2012 [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane Review]] of randomized trials found that CBT had no effect on risk of reoffending for contact sex offenders.&lt;ref name="cochrane"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dennis JA, Khan O, Ferriter M, Huband N, Powney MJ, Duggan C | year = 2012 | title = Psychological interventions for adults who have sexually offended or are at risk of offending | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007507.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meta-analyses in 2002 and 2005, which included both randomized and non-randomized studies, concluded that CBT reduced recidivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lösel F, Schmucker M | year = 2005 | title = The effectiveness of treatment for sexual offenders: a comprehensive meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Experimental Criminology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 117–46 | doi=10.1007/s11292-004-6466-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hanson RK, Gordon A, Harris AJ, Marques JK, Murphy W, etal | year = 2002 | title = First report of the collaborative outcome data project on the effectiveness of treatment for sex offenders | journal = Sexual Abuse | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–94 | doi=10.1177/107906320201400207}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate over whether non-randomized studies should be considered informative.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref name="rice2012"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Rice ME, Harris GT | year = 2012 | chapter = Treatment for adult sex offenders: may we reject the null hypothesis? | title = Handbook of Legal &amp; Ethical Aspects of Sex Offender Treatment &amp; Management |veditors=Harrison K, Rainey B | location = London | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed.&lt;ref name="cochrane" /&gt;

===Behavioral interventions===
Behavioral treatments target sexual arousal to children, using satiation and aversion techniques to suppress sexual arousal to children and [[covert sensitization]] (or [[masturbation|masturbatory]] reconditioning) to increase sexual arousal to adults.&lt;ref name="setobehav"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|page= 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral treatments appear to have an effect on sexual arousal patterns during phallometric testing, but it is not known whether the effect represents changes in sexual interests or changes in the ability to control genital arousal during testing, nor whether the effect persists in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Barbaree, H. E., Bogaert, A. F., &amp; Seto, M. C. (1995). Sexual reorientation therapy for pedophiles: Practices and controversies. In L. Diamant &amp; R. D.

===Sex drive reduction===
Pharmacological interventions are used to lower the sex drive in general, which can ease the management of pedophilic feelings, but does not change sexual preference.&lt;ref name="camillerimedical"&gt;{{cite book | author = Camilleri, Joseph A., and Quinsey, Vernon L. |date= 2008 | title = Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment, 2nd edition | publisher = The Guilford Press | pages = 199–200 | chapter = Pedophilia: Assessment and Treatment | editor1-last = Laws | editor1-first = D. Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antiandrogens]] work by interfering with the activity of testosterone. [[Cyproterone acetate]] (Androcur) and [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] (Depo-Provera) are the most commonly used. The efficacy of antiantrogens has some support, but few high-quality studies exist. Cyproterone acetate has the strongest evidence for reducing sexual arousal, while findings on medroxyprogesterone acetate have been mixed.&lt;ref name="setopharm"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|pages= 177–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue]]s such as [[leuprorelin]] (Lupron), which last longer and have fewer side-effects, are also used to reduce libido,&lt;ref name="pmid15985890"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen LJ, Galynker II | title = Clinical features of pedophilia and implications for treatment | journal = Journal of Psychiatric Practice | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 276–89 | year = 2002 | pmid = 15985890 | doi = 10.1097/00131746-200209000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref name="setopharm" /&gt; The evidence for these alternatives is more limited and mostly based on open trials and case studies.&lt;ref name=SetoReview /&gt; All of these treatments, commonly referred to as "[[chemical castration]]", are often used in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guay, DR | year = 2009 | title = Drug treatment of paraphilic and nonparaphilic sexual disorders | journal = Clinical Therapeutics | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–31 | doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.01.009 | pmid=19243704}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers]], when treating child molesters, "anti-androgen treatment should be coupled with appropriate monitoring and counseling within a comprehensive treatment plan."&lt;ref name="atsacast"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Anti-androgen therapy and surgical castration |work=Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers |url=http://www.atsa.com/ppantiandro.html |year=1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829070929/http://www.atsa.com/ppantiandro.html |archivedate=August 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These drugs may have side-effects, such as weight gain, breast development, liver damage and osteoporosis.&lt;ref name=SetoReview /&gt;

Historically, surgical [[castration]] was used to lower sex drive by reducing testosterone. The emergence of pharmacological methods of adjusting testosterone has made it largely obsolete, because they are similarly effective and less invasive.&lt;ref name="camillerimedical" /&gt; It is still occasionally performed in Germany, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and a few U.S. states. Non-randomized studies have reported that surgical castration reduces recidivism in contact sex offenders.&lt;ref name="setocastrate"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|pages= 181–182, 192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers opposes surgical castration&lt;ref name="atsacast" /&gt; and the [[Council of Europe]] works to bring the practice to an end in Eastern European countries where it is still applied through the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Prague Urged to End Castration of Sex Offenders | newspaper = DW.DE | date = 2009-02-05 | url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4004260,00.html | accessdate = 2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

===Pedophilia and child molestation===
The prevalence of pedophilia in the general population is not known,&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref name="seto2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seto MC | title = Pedophilia and sexual offenses against children | journal = Annu Rev Sex Res | volume = 15 | issue =  | pages = 321–61 | year = 2004 | pmid = 16913283 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is estimated to be lower than 5% among adult men.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt; Less is known about the prevalence of pedophilia in women, but there are case reports of women with strong sexual fantasies and urges towards children.&lt;ref name="setowomen" /&gt; Most sexual offenders against children are male. Females may account for 0.4% to 4% of convicted sexual offenders, and one study estimates a 10 to 1 ratio of male-to-female child molesters.&lt;ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/&gt; The true number of female child molesters may be underrepresented by available estimates, for reasons including a "societal tendency to dismiss the negative impact of sexual relationships between young boys and adult women, as well as women's greater access to very young children who cannot report their abuse", among other explanations.&lt;ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/&gt;

The term ''pedophile'' is commonly used by the public to describe all child sexual abuse offenders.&lt;ref name="ames"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt; This usage is considered problematic by researchers, because many child molesters do not have a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children, and are consequently not pedophiles.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Studer/&gt; There are motives for child sexual abuse that are unrelated to pedophilia,&lt;ref name="barbaree-seto" /&gt; such as stress, marital problems, the unavailability of an adult partner,&lt;ref&gt;Howells, K.

Some pedophiles do not molest children.&lt;ref name="setovii" /&gt; Little is known about this population because most studies of pedophilia use criminal or clinical samples, which may not be representative of pedophiles in general.&lt;ref name="setononrep"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|pages= 47–48, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Michael Seto suggests that pedophiles who commit child sexual abuse do so because of other anti-social traits in addition to their sexual attraction.

According to Abel, Mittleman, and Becker&lt;ref&gt;Abel, G. G., Mittleman, M. S., &amp; Becker, J. V. (1985). "Sex offenders: Results of assessment and recommendations for treatment". In M. H. Ben-Aron, S. J. Hucker, &amp; C. D. Webster (Eds.), ''Clinical criminology: The assessment and treatment of criminal behavior'' (pp. 207–220). Toronto, Canada: M &amp; M Graphics.&lt;/ref&gt; (1985) and Ward ''et al.'' (1995), there are generally large distinctions between the characteristics of pedophilic and non-pedophilic molesters. They state that non-pedophilic offenders tend to offend at times of stress; have a later onset of offending; and have fewer, often familial, victims, while pedophilic offenders often start offending at an early age; often have a larger number of victims who are frequently extrafamilial; are more inwardly driven to offend; and have values or beliefs that strongly support an offense lifestyle. One study found that pedophilic molesters had a median of 1.3 victims for those with girl victims and 4.4 for those with boy victims.&lt;ref name="schaefer" /&gt; Child molesters, pedophilic or not, employ a variety of methods to gain sexual access to children. Some groom their victims into compliance with attention and gifts, while others use threats, alcohol or drugs, or physical force.&lt;ref name="setotactics"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|pages= 64, 189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Pedophilia is believed to have occurred in humans throughout history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not formally named, defined or studied until the late 19th century. The term '''''paedophilia erotica''''' was coined in an 1896 article by the [[Vienna|Viennese]] psychiatrist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] but does not enter the author's ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]''&lt;ref name=Krafft-Ebing&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Von Krafft-Ebing | first1 = Richard |others= Translated to English by Francis Joseph Rebman| title = Psychopathia Sexualis | year = 1922 | publisher = Medical Art Agency | location = | pages = 552–560| isbn = 1-871592-55-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the 10th German edition.&lt;ref name="janssen"&gt;{{cite journal | last  = Janssen | first = D.F. | year = 2015 | title = "Chronophilia": Entries of Erotic Age Preference into Descriptive Psychopathology | journal = Medical History | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 575–598 | issn = 0025-7273 | doi=10.1017/mdh.2015.47 | pmid=26352305 | pmc=4595948}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of authors anticipated Krafft-Ebing's diagnostic gesture.&lt;ref name="janssen" /&gt; In ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', the term appears in a section titled "Violation of Individuals Under the Age of Fourteen", which focuses on the [[forensic psychiatry]] aspect of [[Child sexual abuse#Offenders|child sexual offenders]] in general. Krafft-Ebing describes several typologies of offender, dividing them into [[psychopathology|psychopathological]] and non-psychopathological origins, and hypothesizes several apparent causal factors that may lead to the sexual abuse of children.&lt;ref name=Krafft-Ebing/&gt;

Krafft-Ebing mentioned ''paedophilia erotica'' in a typology of "psycho-sexual perversion". He wrote that he had only encountered it four times in his career and gave brief descriptions of each case, listing three common traits:
# The individual is tainted [by heredity] (''hereditär belastete'')&lt;ref name="Roudinesco"&gt;Roudinesco, Élisabeth (2009). ''Our dark side: a history of perversion,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=W3ejX6C_qfwC&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 144.] Polity, {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4593-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The subject's primary attraction is to children, rather than adults.
# The acts committed by the subject are typically not intercourse, but rather involve inappropriate touching or manipulating the child into performing an act on the subject.

He mentions several cases of pedophilia among adult women (provided by another physician), and also considered the [[homosexuality and pedophilia|abuse of boys by homosexual men]] to be extremely rare.&lt;ref name=Krafft-Ebing/&gt; Further clarifying this point, he indicated that cases of adult men who have some medical or [[neurology|neurological]] disorder and abuse a male child are not true pedophilia and that, in his observation, victims of such men tended to be older and pubescent. He also lists ''pseudopaedophilia'' as a related condition wherein "individuals who have lost [[libido]] for the adult through masturbation and subsequently turn to children for the gratification of their sexual appetite" and claimed this is much more common.&lt;ref name=Krafft-Ebing/&gt;

Austrian neurologist [[Sigmund Freud]] briefly wrote about the topic in his 1905 book ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' in a section titled ''The Sexually immature and Animals as Sexual objects.'' He wrote that exclusive pedophilia was rare and only occasionally were prepubescent children exclusive objects. He wrote that they usually were the subject of desire when a weak person "makes use of such substitutes" or when an uncontrollable instinct which will not allow delay seeks immediate gratification and cannot find a more appropriate object.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex Mobi Classics pages 18-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomist]] and psychiatrist [[Auguste Forel]] wrote of the phenomenon, proposing that it be referred to it as "Pederosis", the "Sexual Appetite for Children". Similar to Krafft-Ebing's work, Forel made the distinction between incidental sexual abuse by persons with [[dementia]] and other organic brain conditions, and the truly preferential and sometimes exclusive sexual desire for children. However, he disagreed with Krafft-Ebing in that he felt the condition of the latter was largely ingrained and unchangeable.&lt;ref name=Forel&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Forel  |  first1 = Auguste |others= Translated to English by C.F. Marshall, MD| title = The Sexual Question: A scientific, psychological, hygienic and sociological study for the cultured classes | year = 1908  |  publisher = Rebman | location = | pages = 254–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''pedophilia'' became the generally accepted term for the condition and saw widespread adoption in the early 20th century, appearing in many popular [[Medical dictionary|medical dictionaries]] such as the 5th Edition of ''Stedman's'' in 1918. In 1952, it was included in the first edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic  and statistical manual of mental disorders |author=  American Psychiatric Association Committee on Nomenclature and  Statistics |year=1952 |edition= 1st|publisher=The Association |location=Washington,  D.C |page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition and the subsequent DSM-II listed the disorder as one subtype of the classification "Sexual Deviation", but no diagnostic criteria were provided. The DSM-III, published in 1980, contained a full description of the disorder and provided a set of guidelines for diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic   and statistical manual of mental disorders |author=  American Psychiatric Association: Committee on Nomenclature and  Statistics |year=1980 |edition= 3rd|publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, D.C |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revision in 1987, the DSM-III-R, kept the description largely the same, but updated and expanded the diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-III-R | year = 1987 | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | location = Washington, DC  | isbn = 0-89042-018-1 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and forensic psychology==

===Definitions===
''Pedophilia'' is not a legal term,&lt;ref name=mayoclinic/&gt; and having a sexual attraction to children is not illegal.&lt;ref name=faganJAMA/&gt; In law enforcement circles, the term ''pedophile'' is sometimes used informally to refer to any person who commits one or more sexually-based crimes that relate to [[age of consent|legally underage]] victims. These crimes may include [[child sexual abuse]], [[statutory rape]], offenses involving [[child pornography]], [[child grooming]], [[stalking]], and [[indecent exposure]]. One unit of the United Kingdom's [[Child Abuse Investigation Command]] is known as the "[[Paedophile Unit]]" and specializes in online investigations and enforcement work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Child abuse investigation impact | publisher = [[Metropolitan Police Service]] (met.police.uk) | accessdate = April 18, 2014 | url = http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/policies/child_abuse_investigation_eia2012.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140419015830/http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/policies/child_abuse_investigation_eia2012.pdf | archivedate = April 19, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forensic science texts, such as Holmes (2008), use the term to refer to offenders who target child victims, even when such children are not the primary sexual interest of the offender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Holmes | first1 = Ronald M. | title = Profiling Violent Crimes: An Investigative Tool | publisher = Sage Publications | isbn = 1-4129-5998-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Kenneth Lanning, however, makes a point of distinguishing between pedophiles and child molesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis, Fifth Edition |first=Kenneth V. |last=Lanning |year=2010 |publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children |url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |pages=16–17, 19–20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224092439/http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil and legal commitment===
In the United States, following ''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]'', sex offenders who have certain mental disorders, including pedophilia, can be subject to indefinite [[civil commitment]] under various state laws&lt;ref name="setocivil" /&gt; (generically called [[sexually violent predator laws|SVP laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Morris, Grant H. | year = 2002 | title = Commentary: Punishing the Unpunishable—The Abuse of Psychiatry to Confine Those We Love to Hate | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law | volume = 30 | pages = 556–562 | url = http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/30/4/556.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the federal [[Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act]] of 2006.&lt;ref name=apabc&gt;{{cite news|author=Holland, Jesse J. |title=Court: Sexually dangerous can be kept in prison |newspaper=Associated Press |date=May 17, 2010 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=10666088 |accessdate=May 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520014516/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=10666088 |archivedate=May 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar legislation exists in Canada.&lt;ref name="setocivil" /&gt;

In ''Kansas v. Hendricks'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] upheld as constitutional a Kansas law, the [[Sexually Violent Predator Act]], under which Hendricks, a pedophile, was found to have a "mental abnormality" defined as a "congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses to the degree that such person is a menace to the health and safety of others", which allowed the State to confine Hendricks indefinitely irrespective of whether the State provided any treatment to him.&lt;ref name=guilford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guilford.com/cgi-bin/cartscript.cgi?page=etc/courts_updates.html&amp;cart_id=#part_two|title=Psychological Evaluation for the Courts, Second Edition - A Handbook for Mental Health Professionals and Lawyers - 9.04 Special Sentencing Provisions (b) Sexual Offender Statutes|publisher=Guilford.com|accessdate=2007-10-19}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6MQj-mjHgBIC&amp;pg=PA248 | title = Legal aspects of corrections management | isbn = 978-0-7637-2545-7 | author1 = Cripe | first1 = Clair A | last2 = Pearlman | first2 = Michael G | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gngG9zPmNKMC&amp;pg=PA159 | title = Inside the minds of sexual predators | isbn = 978-0-313-37960-4 | author1 = Ramsland | first1 = Katherine M | last2 = McGrain | first2 = Patrick Norman | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[United States v. Comstock]]'', this type of indefinite confinement was upheld for someone previously convicted on child pornography charges; this time a federal law was involved—the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act.&lt;ref name=apabc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/us/politics/18offenders.html | work=The New York Times | first=Adam | last=Liptak | title=Extended Civil Commitment of Sex Offenders Is Upheld | date=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walsh Act does not require a conviction on a sex offense charge, but only that the person be a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prisoner]], and one who "has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and who is sexually dangerous to others", and who "would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released".&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barker, Emily | year = 2009 | title = The Adam Walsh Act: Un-Civil Commitment  | journal = Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | page = 145 | ssrn = 1496934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, offenders with pedophilia are more likely to be recommended for civil commitment than non-pedophilic offenders. About half of committed offenders have a diagnosis of pedophilia.&lt;ref name="setocivil" /&gt; Psychiatrist [[Michael First]] writes that, since not all people with a paraphilia have difficulty controlling their behavior, the evaluating clinician must present additional evidence of volitional impairment instead of recommending commitment based on pedophilia alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = First, Michael B., Halon, Robert L. | year = 2008 | title = Use of DSM Paraphilia Diagnoses in Sexually Violent Predator Commitment Cases | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | page = 450 | url = http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/36/4/443.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===General===
Pedophilia is one of the most stigmatized mental disorders.&lt;ref name="jahnkeblind"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jahnke, S., Hoyer, J. | year = 2013 | title = Stigma against people with pedophilia: A blind spot in stigma research? | journal = International Journal of Sexual Health | volume = 25 | pages = 169–184 | doi=10.1080/19317611.2013.795921}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study reported high levels of anger, fear and social rejection towards pedophiles who have not committed a crime.&lt;ref name="jahnkesurveys"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jahnke, S., Imhoff, R., Hoyer, J. | year = 2015 | title = Stigmatization of People with Pedophilia: Two Comparative Surveys | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–34 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-014-0312-4 | pmid=24948422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggested such attitudes could negatively impact child sexual abuse prevention by reducing pedophiles' mental stability and discouraging them from seeking help.&lt;ref name="jahnkeblind" /&gt; According to sociologists Melanie-Angela Neuilly and Kristen Zgoba, social concern over pedophilia intensified greatly in the 1990s, coinciding with several sensational sex crimes (but a general decline in child sexual abuse rates). They found that the word ''pedophile'' appeared only rarely in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Le Monde]]'' before 1996, with zero mentions in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Neuillya, M.  |author2=Zgobab, K. | year = 2006 | title = Assessing the Possibility of a Pedophilia Panic and Contagion Effect Between France and the United States | journal = Victims &amp; Offenders | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 225–254 | doi=10.1080/15564880600626122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social attitudes towards child sexual abuse are extremely negative, with some surveys ranking it as morally worse than murder.&lt;ref name="setoviii"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|page= viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early research showed that there was a great deal of misunderstanding and unrealistic perceptions in the general public about child sexual abuse and pedophiles. However, a 2004 study concluded that the public was well-informed on some aspects of these subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCartan, K. | title = 'Here There Be Monsters': the public's perception of paedophiles with particular reference to Belfast and Leicester | journal = [[Medicine, Science and the Law]] | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 327–42 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15573972 | doi = 10.1258/rsmmsl.44.4.327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misuse of medical terminology===
The words ''pedophile'' and ''pedophilia'' are commonly used informally to describe an adult's sexual interest in pubescent or post-pubescent teenagers. The terms ''[[hebephilia]]'' or ''[[ephebophilia]]'' may be more accurate in these cases.&lt;ref name=mayoclinic/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.usccb.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite web|title=Pedophilia|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/pedophilia |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''|accessdate=July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially seen in the case of [[Mark Foley]] during the [[Mark Foley congressional page incident|congressional page incident]]. Most of the media labeled Foley a pedophile, which led David Tuller of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine to state that Foley was not a pedophile but rather an ephebophile.&lt;ref name="www.slate.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Tuller|title=What To Call Foley. The congressman isn't a pedophile. He's an ephebophile|publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''|date=2006-10-04|accessdate=2010-10-17|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2151018/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common usage of ''pedophilia'' is to refer to the act of sexual abuse itself,&lt;ref name="setovii" /&gt; rather than the medical meaning, which is a ''preference'' for prepubescents on the part of the older individual ([[#Pedophilia and child molestation|see above]] for an explanation of the distinction).&lt;ref name="ames" /&gt;&lt;ref name=lanning3e/&gt; There are also situations where the terms are misused to refer to relationships where the younger person is an adult of legal age, but is either considered too young in comparison to their older partner, or the older partner occupies a position of authority over them.&lt;ref name="www.huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Guzzardi| first = Will| title = Andy Martin, GOP Senate Candidate, Calls Opponent Mark Kirk A "De Facto Pedophile" | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/06/andy-martin-gop-senate-ca_n_413624.html  | date = 2010-01-06| accessdate = 15 January 2010 | work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers state that the above uses of the term ''pedophilia'' are imprecise or suggest that they are best avoided.&lt;ref name="ames"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.usccb.org"/&gt; The [[Mayo Clinic]] states that ''pedophilia'' "is not a criminal or legal term".&lt;ref name=mayoclinic/&gt;

===Anti-pedophile activism===
{{Main|Anti-pedophile activism}}
Anti-pedophile activism encompasses opposition against pedophiles, against pedophile advocacy groups, and against other phenomena that are seen as related to pedophilia, such as child pornography and child sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/global_crime_report/investigation/cybercrime2.shtml|title=Global Crime Report - INVESTIGATION - Child porn and the cybercrime treaty part 2 - BBC World Service|date=|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the direct action classified as anti-pedophile involves demonstrations against sex offenders, against pedophiles advocating for the legalization of sexual activity between adults and children, and against Internet users who solicit sex from minors.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/872436.stm Families flee paedophile protests] August 9, 2000.

High-profile media attention to pedophilia has led to incidents of [[moral panic]], particularly following reports of pedophilia associated with [[Satanic ritual abuse]] and [[day-care sex-abuse hysteria|day care sex abuse]].&lt;ref name = Jewkes1&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jewkes Y |title=Media and crime |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif |year=2004 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=7rSICweU5QYC&amp;pg=PA76 76–77] |isbn=0-7619-4765-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of [[vigilante|vigilantism]] have also been reported in response to public attention on convicted or suspected child sex offenders. In 2000, following a media campaign of "naming and shaming" suspected pedophiles in the UK, hundreds of residents took to the streets in protest against suspected pedophiles, eventually escalating to violent conduct requiring police intervention.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

The woman is preparing to penetrate the man's anus with the dildo.|A woman pegging a man [[doggy style]] with a [[Strap-on dildo|4-strap harness]] and [[dildo]].]]

'''Pegging''' is a [[sexual practice]] in which a woman performs [[anal sex]] on a man by [[sexual penetration|penetrating]] the man's [[Human anus|anus]] with a [[strap-on dildo]]. This practice may also involve stimulating the [[male genitalia]].

The [[neologism]] "pegging" was popularized when it became the winning entry in a contest in [[Dan Savage]]'s "[[Savage Love]]" sex advice column, held after an observation was made that there was no common name or dictionary definition for the act in the [[English language]].&lt;ref name=sl&gt;These three links chronicle how the term ''pegging'' came into usage.

==Pleasurable aspects==

===Physical pleasure===
{{Main|Strap-on dildo}}
In terms of physical pleasure, a woman's [[genitals]] may get direct stimulation from the base of the dildo, or in the case of a [[double-ended dildo]], from vaginal (or internal) penetration. A woman can use a secondary [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]], between the dildo and her genitals, to get pleasure from pegging. Men may find stimulation of the anus, rectum, and especially the prostate, pleasurable. During anal sex, male pleasure can be particularly derived from the [[prostate]], which can lead to an [[orgasm]] and [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="Prostate massage"&gt;{{cite web|title= The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=March 28, 2008|url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2246.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010203540/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2246.html |archivedate=October 10, 2011 |accessdate=July 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men enjoy [[masturbation|masturbating]] (or being manually stimulated) during pegging.
Triple-ended dildos provide both vaginal and anal stimulation of the female partner.

===Psychological pleasure===
Advice columnist [[Dan Savage]] wrote that he believes all men should try pegging at least once, as it may introduce them to a new enjoyable sexual activity and illuminate them to the receiver's perspective in sex.&lt;ref name=sl/&gt;

==Instructional materials==
A few instructional movies and books have emerged in recent years, including ''[[Bend Over Boyfriend]]'' (1998), Based on a series of lectures and workshops by Robert Lawrence and [[Carol Queen]] and co-produced by Fatale Media, Inc. The movie was created and directed by Shar Rednour and Jackie Strano, SIR Video Movies co-founders. ''Bend Over Boyfriend'' originally inspired [[Dan Savage]] to call the act "BOBing" but his readers subsequently voted on the winning term, "pegging".&lt;ref name=nault&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]|number=52|date=Summer 2010|title=Bend Over Boyfriend to Take it Like a Man: pegging pornography and the queer representation of straight sex|first=Curran|last=Nault|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc52.2010/naultPegging/ |accessdate=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American pornographic film director and sex educator [[Tristan Taormino]] released an instructional pegging movie in 2009 by [[Vivid Entertainment]] Studio, ''Tristan Taormino's Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bridges | first1 = Ana J. | last2 = Sun | first2 = Chyng | last3 = Wosnitzer | first3 = Robert | last4 = Scharrer | first4 = Erica | last5 = Liberman | first5 = Rachael | title = A comparison of male and female directors in popular pornography: what happens when women are at the helm? | journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 312–325 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2008.00439.x | date = September 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a detailed explanation about male anal pleasure and strap-on dildo sex. In it, she teaches a workshop with instructions and skills for safe and pleasurable female on male anal sex. There are three scenes, in which pairs of pornographic actors explore different sexual devices and positions for pegging.

As an author of numerous sex guides and informational books on various sexual taboos, [[Violet Blue (author)|Violet Blue]] wrote and released ''The Adventurous Couple's Guide to Strap-On Sex'' in 2007.

Since 2010, the sex educator by the screen name of Ruby Ryder has been running a blog and podcast entitled ''Pegging Paradise''. As of September 2017, the podcast has over 166 episodes.&lt;ref name=peggingparadise&gt;[http://peggingparadise.com Ruby Ryder's Pegging Paradise].&lt;/ref&gt; She also runs the instructional site ''Pegging: 101'' which is especially targeting those interested in pegging with no interests in the association with BDSM. &lt;ref name=pegging101&gt;[http://pegging101.com Pegging: 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==
The first pegging scene in film (long before the term was coined) appears to have been in the 1970 film ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'', based on the novel of the same name by [[Gore Vidal]], although it was not explicit. The first explicit pegging scene is believed to have been in the 1976 pornographic film ''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]''.&lt;ref name=nault/&gt;

Female-to-male strap-on pornography became a popular subgenre in the early 21st century, with a number of studios producing dedicated series about it. Pegging films include ''Strap It On'', ''Babes Ballin Boys'', ''Strap Attack'', ''Strap-on Chicks'', ''Boss Bitches'', various films produced by LEDA Studios, as well as San Francisco-based BDSM themed website ''[[kink.com|Men In Pain]]''.

Female [[porn stars]] who expressed their pleasure in pegging their male partners include [[Taylor Wane]], [[Debi Diamond]], [[Brittany Andrews]], and [[Monique Covét]]. When questioned about her particular [[kink (sexual)|kink]], Covét replied, "If we women have to take it from behind, then why not a man?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budapestsun.com/news/54577 |title=Not just another Barbie |date=July 25, 2002 |work=[[The Budapest Sun]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302065043/http://www.budapestsun.com/news/54577 |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=July 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plastiglomerate''' is a term that was proposed by Patricia Corcoran, [[Charles J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5905">'''Policy studies''' is a subdisicipline of [[political science]] that includes the analysis of the process of policymaking (the policy process) and the contents of policy ([[policy analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ascher|first1=William|title=The evolution of the policy sciences: Understanding the rise and avoiding the fall|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|volume=5|issue=2|pages=365|date=1986|doi=10.2307/3323551|url=https://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/3323551|jstor=3323551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy analysis includes substantive area research (such as health or education policy), [[program evaluation]] and impact studies, and policy design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=419922|title=Political Science and Public Policy|first1=Paul|last1=Sabatier|date=1 June 1991|journal=Political Science &amp; Politics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=144–147|doi=10.2307/419922}}&lt;/ref&gt; It "involves systematically studying the nature, causes, and effects of alternative [[public policies]], with particular emphasis on determining the [[policies]] that will achieve given goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3110267|title=The Policy Studies Perspective|first1=Stuart S.|last1=Nagel|first2=Duncan|last2=MacRae|editor-first1=Robert L.|editor-last1=Lineberry|editor-first2=Theodore J.|editor-last2=Lowi|editor-first3=Alan|editor-last3=Stone|editor-first4=Charles O.|editor-last4=Jones|editor-first5=James A.|editor-last5=Wilde|editor-first6=R.

Policy Studies also examines the conflicts and conflict resolution that arise from the making of policies in civil society, the private sector, or more commonly, in the public sector (e.g. government).

It frequently focuses on the [[public sector]] but is equally applicable to other kinds of organizations (e.g., the not-for-profit sector).  Some policy study experts graduate from [[public policy school]]s with [[public policy degrees]]. Alternatively, experts may have backgrounds in [[policy analysis]], [[program evaluation]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]], [[geography]], [[law]], [[political science]], [[social work]], [[environmental planning]] and [[public administration]].

Traditionally, the field of policy studies focused on [[domestic policy]], with the notable exceptions of [[foreign policy|foreign]] and [[defense policy|defense policies]]. However, the wave of [[economic globalization]], which ensued in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, created a need for a subset of policy studies that focuses on [[global governance]], especially as it relates to issues that transcend [[national borders]] such as [[climate change]], [[terrorism]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[economic development]]. This subset of policy studies, which is often referred to as international policy studies, typically requires mastery of a [[second language]] and attention to [[cross-cultural]] issues in order to address [[nation]]al and [[cultural bias]]es. For example, the [[Monterey Institute of International Studies]] at [[Middlebury College]] offers Master of Arts programs that focus exclusively on [[international]] policy through a mix of [[interdisciplinary]] and [[cross-cultural]] analysis called the "Monterey Way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miis.edu/academics/courses|title=Courses - Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of academic programs in policy studies include the [[Harvard Kennedy School]] and the [[LBJ School of Public Affairs]].

'''Shamanic music''' is music played either by actual shamans as part of their rituals, or by people who, whilst not themselves shamans, wish to evoke the cultural background of [[shamanism]] in some way. So '''Shamanic music''' includes both music used as part of shamans' rituals and music that refers to, or draws on, this.

In shamanism the shaman has a more active musical role than the medium in [[spirit possession]]. But a shaman's ritual is a ritual performance and not a musical performance, and this shapes its musical dimension. A shaman uses various ways of making sounds to which different ritual purposes are ascribed. Of particular importance are the shaman's song and shaman's drumming.

Recently in [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Siberia]], music groups drawing on a knowledge of shamanic culture have emerged. In the West shamanism has served as an imagined background to musics meant to [[altered state of consciousness|alter a listener's state of mind]].

[[Culture of Korea|Korea]] and [[Tibetan culture|Tibet]] are two cultures where the music of shamanic ritual has interacted closely with other traditions.

== Shamanic and musical performance ==

Although shamans use singing as well as drumming and sometimes other instruments, a shamanic ritual is not a musical performance in the normal sense, and the music is directed more to [[spirits]] than to an audience. Several things follow from this. First, a shamanic ritual performance is, above all, a series of actions and not a series of musical sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Mihály Hoppál, ''Tracing Shamanism in Tuva: A History of Studies'', in Mongush Kenin Lopsan,  ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'', Istor Budapest 1997 p 129 "...the struggle with the harmful spirits during which great drumbeats indicated that the shaman had driven a "steel arrow" for each beat into the spirits of sickness."&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the shaman's attention is directed inwards towards her or his visualisation of the spirit world and communication with the spirits, and not outwards to any listeners who might be present.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hodgkinson, ''Musicians, Carvers, Shamans'', Cambridge Anthropology vol 25, no 3, (2005/2006) p 9."Sergei Tumat (a Tuvan shaman who had previously studied music):   “When I shamanize, I'm not here, not in the place where I'm playing the dungur drum, it's just  my material body that's there: I'm away with the spirits, that's where my total attention is. If someone touches me, tries to get my attention there in the yurt, that's dangerous, it  would be like falling a long way: so it's completely different from playing music to an  audience, where you have to be there, to be attentive to what your material body is  doing, to everything I learned in music school...”"&lt;/ref&gt; Third, it is important for the success of the ritual that it be given its own clearly defined context that is quite different from any kind of entertainment. Fourth, any theatrical elements that are added to impress an audience are of a type to make the contact with the spirits seem more real and not to suggest the performer's musical virtuosity. From a musical perspective shamanic ritual performances have the distinctive feature of {{wt|en|discontinuity}}. Breaks may happen because a spirit is proving difficult to communicate with, or the shaman needs to call a different spirit. Typically, phases of the performance are broken off abruptly, perhaps to be restarted after a gap, perhaps not.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001, p135-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hutton, ''The Shamans of Siberia'', Isle of Avalon Press, 1993, p29 and p31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Humphrey, ''Shamans and elders''. Oxford, OUP1996,  p 235-7&lt;/ref&gt; The rhythmic dimension of the music of shamans' rituals has been connected to the idea of both incorporating the rhythms of nature and magically re-articulating them.&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Serra, (in Italian)''Ritmo e ciclità nella cultura sciamanica'', in Antonello Colimberti (ed) ''Musiche e sciamani'', Textus, Milan 2000, p67&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shamanism and possession ==

It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rouget, ''Music and Trance'', University of Chicago Press 1985 p125&lt;/ref&gt; that shamanism and [[spirit possession]] involve contrasting kinds of special states of mind. The shaman actively enters the spirit world, negotiates with her or his own helper spirit and then with other spirits as necessary, and moves between different territories of the spirit world. The possessed medium, on the other hand,  is the passive recipient of a powerful spirit or god. This reflects on the different uses of music involved. Possession music&lt;ref&gt;Fremont E.Besmer, ''Horses, Musicians and Gods: The Hausa Cult of Possession-Trance''.  Ahmadu Bello UP 1983&lt;/ref&gt; is typically long in duration, [[Hypnosis|mesmeric]], loud and intense, with climaxes of rhythmic intensity and volume to which the medium has learned to respond by entering a trance state: the music is not played by the medium but by one or more musicians. In shamanism, the music is played by the shaman, confirms the shaman's power (in the words of the shaman's song), and is used actively by the shaman to modulate movements and changes of state as part of an active journey within the spirit world. In both cases the connection between music and an [[altered state of mind]] depends on both psychoacoustic and cultural factors, and the music cannot be said to 'cause' trance-states.&lt;ref&gt;Roberte Hamayon,(in French) ''Pour en finir avec la 'trance' et 'l'extase' dans l'étude du chamanisme'', in Etudes mongoles et sibériennes 26: Variations Chamaniques 2, 1995, p155 seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of sounds ==
{{See also|Sound mimesis in various cultures|Imitation of sounds in shamanism}}

Sound is tactile; whereas visual information is experienced at the surface, auditory information seems to be both outside and inside the body.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ong, ''Orality and Literacy: The technologizing of the word'', Methuen, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|In oral cultures in which survival involves close contact with nature, sound often connects inner feelings to features of the natural environment]]. In many cases, this holds also for the [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|music in shamanistic practice, including e.g. onomatopoeia, imitation of animal cries etc.]]. The shaman's use of sound is to catalyse an imaginary inner environment which is experienced as a sacred space-time in which the shaman travels and encounters spirits.  Sound, passing constantly between inner and outer, connects this imaginary space with the actual space of the ritual in which the shaman is moving and making ritual actions and gestures.

It has been suggested that the sound material used by the shaman constitutes a system of sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Ruggero, (in Italian)  ''La musica sciamanica'' . - Xenia - 2004, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of a [[semiotics]] of the sound material would imply a symbolic language shared between the shaman and the surrounding community. However, the evidence suggests that any symbolic language elements are understood only by the shaman and perhaps by other shamans initiated by this shaman. In other words, the symbolic language - if there is one - is more likely to be shared with the spirits than with a human community.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Taussig,  ''The Nervous System'' . - Routledge - 1992 p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

A shaman may use different sounds for different ritual purposes: 
*'''Setting up the sound-space of the ritual''' 
A very important element in [[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian shamanism]] is the use of hanging metallic objects - possibly including small bells - attached to the shaman's ritual cloak and to the inside of the drum and also sometimes to the beater. This sets up a continuously moving sound field, heard as a single complex sound.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stiller, ''Handbook of Instrumentation'', University of California Press, 1985, p 121, {{ISBN|0-520-04423-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further element is the spatialisation of sound brought about not only by the shaman's movement, but also by techniques of singing into the drum to create the illusion of the voice coming from elsewhere. Different individual shamans and different local traditions may use different sounds. For example, in the south of Tuva and in Mongolia the ''khomus'', or jaw harp is commonly used in shamanising.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001, p124&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Preparation'''
Particular sounds, like bells, may be used for purifying the place in which the ritual is to be performed.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Walker, ''Music as Knowledge in Shamanism and Other Healing Traditions of Siberia'', in
Arctic Anthropology.2003; 40(2): p45&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a ritual involving contact with the spirits is always potentially dangerous, and one of the dangers is that of pollution.

*'''Calling and sending back spirits'''
A bell may also be used for calling or sending back spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kongin Seo, ''Hanyang Kut: Korean Shaman Ritual Music from Seoul'', Routledge 2002 p14&lt;/ref&gt; Shamans will also imitate the sounds of birds and animals in order to call spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Levin, ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing'',  (Indiana University Press 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Sami shamanic singing, called [[Joik]], is also about summoning, for example, animal spirits, rather than singing about them or representing them: the spirit is experienced as being present.&lt;ref&gt;Tina Ramnarine, ''Acoustemology, Indigeneity &amp; Joik'', Ethnomusicology vol 53, no 2, spring/summer 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Healing'''
Within shamanic ritual, sound can also be used as a healing power, conceived as a way of directing spiritual energy from the shaman into an afflicted person.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Walker, 2003, p46&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tuva]] sick persons are said to have been healed by the sound of a stringed instrument made from a tree struck by lightning.

== Shaman's song ==

The '''shaman's song''' - or ''algysh'' &lt;ref&gt;Mongush Kenin Lopsan, ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'' Istor Budapest 1997&lt;/ref&gt; in Tuvan - is personal to the shaman&lt;ref&gt;Mihály Hoppál, ''Studies on Eurasian Shamanism'' in ''Shamans and Cultures''  in Mihály Hoppál and Keith Howard eds pp258-288 Istor Budapest 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and tells of her or his birthplace, initiation, ancestral pedigree, special gifts and special connections to particular spirits. The melody and words are composed by the shaman and generally remain the same throughout the shaman's professional life.  The ''algysh'' is often sung near the beginning of the ritual and accompanied by drumming on the dungur drum. It serves to remind the shaman of their shamanic identity and power. It proclaims the shaman's abilities and announces the shaman to the spirits. In some traditions the shaman's song may be broken up into short sections, varied and recombined in different performances.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Humphrey, ''Shamans and elders''.

The single headed frame [[frame drum|'''drum''']]  is widely used in shamanic ritual, often with metallic ritual objects dangling inside, held by an interior wooden cross-piece, and played with a special beater that may also itself be a rattle.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Hyder, ''Shamanism and Music in Siberia :  DRUM AND SPACE'' {{cite web |url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/musicanddance/projects/project6/essays/file45912.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622115511/http://www.soas.ac.uk/musicanddance/projects/project6/essays/file45912.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drum will be made of consecrated materials, a specially chosen tree and the skin of a carefully chosen animal, sometimes by a specialist drum-maker. It will also have been 'enlivened' usually by a more powerful shaman so as to give it its spiritual properties.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001 p128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sevyan Vainshtein, ''The Tuvan Shaman's Drum and the ceremony of its Enlivening'', in V.Dioszegi (ed), ''Popular Beliefs and Folklore in Siberia'', Bloomington 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The head is sometimes decorated with a graphic typically representing the [[Religious cosmology|division of the cosmos into upper, middle and lower worlds]].  A shamanic ritual often begins with heating the drum head over a fire to bring it up to the desired pitch. A number of theories have been advanced to explain the importance of percussion in ritual music in general.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Walter, ''The Medium of the Message: Shamanism as Localised Practice in the Nepal Himalayas'' in ''The Archaeology of Shamanism'', ed Neil Price, Routledge 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Needham, ''Percussion and Transition'', Man 2:606-14. 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  One line of explanation is [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]], whereby the tempo of the drum enables the shaman to enter the desired brain wave state, which corresponds to the number of beats per second of the drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthlove.org/ECSTATIC%20TRANCE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105162700/http://www.earthlove.org/ECSTATIC%20TRANCE.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of shamanism, it seems that the portable drum is highly suited for a performance in which action and gesture are the top line.&lt;ref&gt;Roberte Hamayon, (in French)''Gestes et Sons, Chamane et Barde'',   in ''Chamanisme et Possession, Cahiers de Musiques Traditionelles 19'', Ateliers d'Ethnomusicologie, Genève, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The physical gesture of playing the drum is often integrated into a shamanic dance. For this reason the drumming is not restricted to regular tempo but may speed up and slow down with irregular accents.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hodgkinson, ''Siberian shamanism and improvised music'', Contemporary Music Review vol 14, parts 1-2, Netherlands, Harwood,1996, p62.&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions, the skin of a shaman's drum should be cut after his/her death.&lt;ref&gt;Mongush Kenin Lopsan,  ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'' Istor Budapest 1997  p121&lt;/ref&gt; In others, not.&lt;ref&gt;Vilmos Diószegi,  ''Tracing Shamans in Siberia'' Anthropological Publications, Netherlands 1968, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shamanic groups ==

From the late 1980s with the loosening up of political restrictions a number of Siberian native cultures underwent a cultural renaissance, shamans began to practice openly again, and musicians formed '''bands''' drawing on shamanic traditions. Cholbon&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lecomte,(in French) ''Approches Autochtones du Chamanisme Sibérien au début du XXI Siècle'',  in ''Chamanisme et Possession, Cahiers de Musiques Traditionelles 19'', Ateliers d'Ethnomusicologie, Genève, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and AiTal,&lt;ref&gt;Aimar Ventsel, ''Sakha Pop Music'' p.10 http://www.princeton.edu/~restudy/soyuz_papers/Ventsel.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sakha/Yakutsk, Biosyntes and early [[Yat-Kha]] in Tuva fall into this category. Nevertheless, the musicians involved, if sometimes unsure of their own exact role, recognized an important difference between artists using shamanic themes and shamans themselves. In the West bands began to apply the label 'shamanic' loosely to any music that might induce a trance state.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Howard, ''Sonic Transformations of  Shamanic Representations''  in AHRP Research Centre Newsletter 4, SOAS 2004, p19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terence McKenna, ''The Archaic revival''  Harper Collins 1991&lt;/ref&gt; This was partly due to the rarity of actual recordings of shamans' rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rouget, ''Music and Trance'', University of Chicago Press 1985 p130&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the British-Tuvan group [[K-Space (band)|K-Space]] developed ways of combining improvisation, electronics and experimental recording and montage techniques with the more shamanic side of Tuvan traditional music. In Hungary [[Galloping Coroners|Vágtázó Halottkémek]]&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Milun quotes Anna Szemere: ''Up From the Underground - The Culture of Rock Music in Postsocialist Hungary'' Penn State Press 2001, http://www.pum.umontreal.ca/revues/surfaces/vol1/milun.html&lt;/ref&gt;(in English: Galloping Coroners) later [[Galloping Wonder Stag|Vágtázó Csodaszarvas]] set out under the banner of shamanpunk  to use ethnographic materials as manuals on how to reach and communicate ecstatic states. From 2005 Vágtázó Csodaszarvas (Galloping Wonder Stag) continued Vágtázó Halottkémek music philosophy turning it into a neotraditional music style closer to world music, replacing electronic guitars and drums with acoustic volk instruments.

== Korean shamanic music ==
{{See also|Korean shamanism}}

'''[[Korea]]''' is the only country where shamanism appears to have been a state religion practiced by the literate classes, during the Three Kingdoms Period (57BC-668AD). Under successive dynasties shamanism was gradually relegated to a popular or folk status with the arrival of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. The early official status of shamanism is the probable explanation for the fact that shamanic ritual in Korea developed highly complex and established forms. Correspondingly the music used in shamanic rituals is more elaborate in Korea than elsewhere. Furthermore, since the emergence of Korean contemporary nationalism, there has been a strong and sustained state intervention to preserve artistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Howard, ''Perspectives on Korean Music: Preserving Korean Music: Intangible Cultural Properties as Icons of Identity'' v. 1 (SOAS Musicology Series) 2006&lt;/ref&gt; All of these factors make it uniquely difficult in Korea to distinguish the 'pure' from hybrid and concert forms of shamanic ritual music. For example, ''[[Sinawi]]'' is a musical form that can be used in shamanic rituals, or to accompany folk dances, or for urban concert performance. In the ritual context ''Sinawi'' is often performed by a small ensemble with the ''changgo'' hour-glass drum and two melodic instruments, often the ''taegum'' flute and the ''[[piri]]'' oboe. In concert the ensemble is augmented with stringed instruments&lt;ref&gt;Kyo-Chul Chung  CD notes for ''Seoul Ensemble of Traditional Music'' World Network 12, WDR 54.039.&lt;/ref&gt;   Modern ''Sinawi'' is played in a minor mode in 12/8 time.&lt;ref&gt;CD notes for''A selection of Korean traditional music, volume 2''. Instrumental Music 2, SBCD-4380-2&lt;/ref&gt; The role of music in Korean shamanism seems intermediary between the possession trance model and the Siberian model: in the ''Kut'' ritual, the music, played by musicians, first calls on the god to possess the ''mudang'' (shaman), then accompanies the god during their time in the shaman's body, then sends back and placates the god at the end.&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism, The Spirit World of Korea'', eds Chai-shin Yu and R.Guisso, Asian Humanities Press, Berkeley California 1988&lt;/ref&gt; However, the shaman is the singer and dancer and the shaman directs the musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Bo Hyeong CD notes for Kim Suk Chul Ensemble: ''Shamanistic Ceremonies of the Eastern Seaboard'',  JVC, VICG-5261 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bön shamanic music and Buddhist music ==

Before Buddhism came to Tibet, the local form of shamanism was '''[[Bön]]'''.  Bön developed into an organised religion. When Buddhism arrived, both religions began competing with each other, and incorporated many of each other's practices. The Bön shaman's drum on a pole became part of Tibetan Buddhist ritual music ensembles. Also, the shang - a kind of bell-cymbal - became incorporated in Buddhist rituals. It was formerly only used by shamans to clear away negative energy before shamanic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret J. Kartomi ''On concepts and classifications of musical instruments''University of Chicago Press, 1990 pp 75-83 {{ISBN|978-0-226-42549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frankperry.co.uk/Tibetan%20Bowls.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216183730/http://frankperry.co.uk/Tibetan%20Bowls.htm |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepathoflight.it/worken.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613215026/http://www.thepathoflight.it/worken.php |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice of giving a sonorous identity to deities, of calling them and sending them back by means of sounds, may well have entered Tibetan Buddhist ritual from Bön tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Helffer (in French)''Traditions musicales dans un monastère du Bouddhisme Tibétain'' in ''L'Homme 171-2'', Paris 2004 pp 183-184&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===pre-SkIO===
Skidaway Island was originally a hunting and ceremonial ground of the [[Timucua]] Indians. European settlement of the island was successful between 1754 and 1771, and included John Milledge (the father of [[John Milledge]]), who established a plantation on the northern end. He named it "Modena," presumably after the [[Modena|Italian city]] for its famed production of [[silk]]. Silk was an early industry of the European settlers of coastal Georgia. The Modena Plantation grew corn, cotton, oranges and mulberry trees, and kept sheep, cattle, hogs and horses. It survived as a plantation into the 1840s, until John Milledge III sold it in 1843. The name "Modena" is still used to refer to the northern part of the island.

After the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), many of the plantations on the island were unable to continue without slave labor, and their owners gradually sold them to wealthy northerners, who mostly held them on speculation. Much of the island reverted to wilderness and was used mainly for hunting, trapping, fishing and lumber for several decades. The Modena Plantation changed hands sixteen more times after the war. In 1927 the property became a private hunting preserve for Ralph H. Isham, best known for purchasing a collection of [[James Boswell]]'s private papers from [[Baron Talbot of Malahide]] and passing them to [[Yale University]].

Mr. Isham sold the property in 1934 to Robert C. Roebling (great-grandson of [[John A. Roebling|John Augustus Roebling]]). The Roebling family (Robert, Dorothy, and five children) established a farm for [[Angus cattle|Black Angus cattle]] while living on their {{convert|176|ft|m|adj=on}} [[schooner]], the ''[[Schooner Black Douglas|Black Douglas]]'', which provided all of the power needed by the farm until it was sold in 1941 to the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. The cattle farm was very successful for the next twenty years, until it came to an end in 1954 due to post-[[World War II|WWII]] economic pressures. Many of the buildings from the farm are still standing and in use by SkIO, most notably the seven-sided barn with its compass rose mosaic at the center.

Another successful European settler of the mid-18th century was Henry Yonge, who had a plantation located just southeast of Modena, called Orangedale. In 1877 it came into the ownership of the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine Order]]. The Benedictines tried to establish a monastery and Catholic school for the newly freed former slaves on the island, but were unsuccessful. They abandoned their efforts in 1889. The "Priest tract," as the property had come to be called, became one of many acquired by a partnership of Thomas Bourke Floyd, James Boog Floyd, and A. Goden Guerard Jr. Thomas Floyd eventually assumed ownership of the entire middle portion of the island, until economic hardship forced a transfer to C&amp;S Bank in 1924. The [[Union Camp Corporation]] purchased it from the bank in 1941.

===The Founding of SkIO===
[[Image:Skidaway Institute of Oceanography.jpg|thumb|Main entrance to SkIO]]
In 1966, the Georgia Science and Technology Commission of the [[Georgia General Assembly]] proposed the establishment of an oceanographic research center on Skidaway Island. The thought at the time was to foster economic growth in coastal Georgia by attracting secondary industries of oceanography, in much the same way that secondary industries of space exploration had arisen around [[NASA]].

Dorothy Roebling donated approximately {{convert|790|acre|km2|1}} of the Modena property to the State of Georgia for this purpose in 1967, including {{convert|384|acre|km2|1}} of high land, all of the buildings and farm workers, and both of their docks on the Skidaway River at the western side of the island. In addition, Union Camp donated {{convert|635|acre|km2|1}} of the Orangedale property, including {{convert|300|acre|km2|1}} of high land with access to the Wilmington River at the eastern side of the island; this portion of the campus is now called Priest Landing.

With the land donations, the Georgia General Assembly created the "Ocean Science Center of the Atlantic (OSCA)" in 1967. The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography was officially created in January 1968 with Thomas Jackson (formerly of [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]) as director, two co-directors, a secretary, and several former workers inherited from the Roebling farm. Its first faculty member, Herbert L. Windom, began work in July 1968. President [[Richard Nixon]] and Governor [[Lester Maddox]] dedicated the first building of the program in 1970. Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] dissolved OSCA in 1972, at which point SkIO became an independent research unit in the University System of Georgia.

SkIO has had five directors during its existence: Thomas Jackson (1967–1970), David Menzel (1970–1993), Herbert L. Windom (1994–2001), James G. Sanders (2002–2016), and Clark R. Alexander (2016–present).

==The Skidaway Marine Science Campus==

Much of the institute's research since its inception has focused on the southeastern U.S. [[continental shelf]], the influences of land, open ocean, and atmosphere on the continental shelf, and other continental shelf environments worldwide.

Several other institutions share the {{convert|684|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} campus with SkIO including:

===UGA Marine Extension Service===
The [[University of Georgia]] Marine Extension Service (UGA MAREX) consists of several educational outreach facilities in the state of Georgia, including one on the Skidaway Marine Science Campus. The [http://marex.uga.edu/ Marine Education Center and Aquarium (MECA)] operates a small public saltwater aquarium of local marine fish and invertebrates, which is visited by 18,000 schoolchildren per year. There is also a small research facility for [[shellfish]] [[aquaculture]].

===Gray's Reef===
The campus hosts the administering offices for [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]'s [[Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary]], which is one of thirteen [[United States National Marine Sanctuary|marine sanctuaries]] in the United States. It consists of {{convert|17|sqnmi|km2 sqmi|0}} of a nearshore live-bottom rock reef, {{convert|17|nmi|km mi|0}} off the coast of [[Sapelo Island]], Georgia.

===GSU Applied Coastal Research Lab===
Dr. Clark Alexander of SkIO is the director of [[Georgia Southern University]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20070613184618/http://cost.georgiasouthern.edu/geo/acrl.html Applied Coastal Research Laboratory (ACRL)], which studies sedimentary processes of the coastal zone of Georgia, such as [[Hydrogeology|groundwater hydrology]] and [[Erosion#Shoreline|shoreline erosion]].

===CIRE Lab===
The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070331141437/http://www.skio.usg.edu/aboutus/info/cire.php CIRE program] ("A '''C'''ollaboration to '''I'''ntegrate '''R'''esearch and '''E'''ducation in Marine and Environmental Science and Biotechnology") of [[Savannah State University]] (SSU) collaborates with SkIO to operate a teaching laboratory on the campus. It provides hands-on research experience to undergraduate marine science students from SSU.

===Georgia Tech Chemical Ecology Lab===
Dr. [[Mark Hay]] of [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] has a laboratory facility at Priest Landing for studies in [[chemical ecology]]. Research focuses on the ability of marine fauna to detect predators, prey, competitors, and compatriots by smell, at varying levels of water turbulence.

===Georgia Aquarium===
The [[Georgia Aquarium]] has a specimen collection facility at Priest Landing.

===Georgia DNR===
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources Historic Preservation Division operates the Coastal Underwater Archaeology Field Station on campus. The field station manages, surveys, and protects state-owned underwater and shoreline archaeological sites on navigable inland and coastal waterways extending three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) offshore. The station provides archaeological assistance to local, state, and federal agencies as well as the general public by offering information, support, educational opportunities, and technical guidance regarding Georgia’s underwater cultural resources and maritime heritage.

==Research Vessels and Facilities==
[[Image:RVSavannah2007.JPG|thumb|right|The ''R/V Savannah'' [[research vessel]] at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography]]SkIO operates the ''R/V Savannah'', a {{convert|92|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[research vessel]]. Unlike its predecessor, the {{convert|72|ft|m|0|adj=on}} ''R/V Blue Fin'' (1970–2001) which had the hull of a [[fishing trawler]] and was originally a yacht named ''Princess Anne'', the ''Savannah'' was specifically designed for marine research by the scientists who use it. It has a full-time crew of four and has been in operation since 2001.

In addition to the two docks originally from the Roebling farm and a third dock later constructed on the Skidaway River, a {{convert|300|ft|m|-1|adj=on}} dock was constructed at Priest Landing to provide low-tide access for large research and other seagoing vessels from the Wilmington River. It was completed in 1972.

==Significant Research Projects==
&lt;!-- DOE Ocean Margins Program? and did anything interesting happen in the 80s? --&gt;

===CEPEX===
In the 1970s, SkIO, in conjunction with the [[University of British Columbia]] and the Dept. of Fisheries for [[Scotland]], initiated the Controlled Ecosystem Pollution Experiment (CEPEX), which studied the responses of [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] marine organisms when exposed to low, chronic levels of various pollutants. The studies were conducted in the open ocean, and the ecosystems were controlled by capturing water of various depths in large plastic enclosures.&lt;ref name="cepex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1154376&amp;isnumber=25911|title=CEPEX|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- giant test tubes in the sea!! o.O --&gt;

===JGOFS===
During the 1990s, SkIO was a participant in the [http://www1.whoi.edu/ Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS)], which was an international effort of over twenty nations to study the ocean carbon cycle on a global scale.&lt;ref name="jgofs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijgofs.whoi.edu/|title=JGOFS|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included numerous research cruises in all of the oceans of the world, with many projects studying the biology and organic geochemistry of organic matter as it cycles in the water column and eventually settles on the seafloor.

===SABSOON===

'''Southwest University of Political Science and Law''' ('''SWUPL''') is a national public university located in [[Chongqing]].

It was founded in 1953 with the original name '''Southwest College of Political Science and Law'''. It was one of the oldest Faculty of Political Science and Law after the People's Republic of China was established. Its law school ranks 3rd among all the law schools in China. Notable alumni include [[Liang Huixing]], [[Liang Zhiping]], [[He Weifang]], and [[Zhang Xinbao]].

Zhou Qiang, grade 1978 graduate from the Law Department of SWUPL, was elected president of the Supreme People's Court of China at the fifth plenary meeting of the first session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing on March 15, 2013.

==History==
As one of the oldest political science and law universities in China, Southwest University of Political Science and Law (SWUPL) developed from the Department of Political Science and Law at Southwest University of People’s Revolution which was founded in 1950, with Marshal Liu Bocheng as the university president.

In 1953, SWUPL was officially established through merging the Political Science and Law departments of Chongqing University and Sichuan University, the Law departments of Chongqing Finance and Economy College, and of Guizhou University and Yunnan University.

In 1978, the University was accredited as a key university by the State Council. In 2000, the administration of the University was transferred from the Ministry of Justice to the Chongqing municipality, thus creating a system of co-administration between the central and local government.

In 2003, it was approved as one of the first universities to grant doctoral degree of first-level legal discipline. In 2004, it established one post-doctorate mobile station of Law. In 2007, SWUPL was awarded as “excellent undergraduate education” by Ministry of Education.

In 2008, SWUPL became the key university co-administrated by Ministry of Education and Chongqing Municipality.

SWUPL became the first University in Chongqing co-administrated by the Ministry and Municipality. On October 24, 2012.

The University has three campuses, the main in Yubei, the other two in Shapingba and Baoshenghu, covering a total area of 3136.17 mu. There are 14 schools, including School of Civil and Commercial law, School of Economic Law, Law School, School of Administrative Law, School of International Law, School of Criminal investigation, School of Marxism, School of Juris Master, School of Management, School of Politics and Public Administration, School of Journalism and Communication, School of Foreign Languages, School of Applied Law, and School of Economics.

It offers 20 bachelor’s programs, 37 master’s programs of sub-disciplines, 4 professional master’s programs and 10 doctoral programs of sub-discipline, and 2 national key disciplines. The University has postdoctoral center for legal research and 6 provincial key bases for humanity and social science research. It has 1421 faculty and staff members, among which 1157 are full-time. It has 5159 postgraduates and 18591 undergraduates. The University’s library boasts a collection of more than 4,200,000 books.

SWUPL has international exchange programs with over 60 universities from U.S., United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Thailand, and South Korea. In 2014, SWUPL and Coventry University established China's only undergraduate Sino-UK English Law programme. SWUPL and University of Montana have also jointly established the first Confucius Institute in Northwest of U.S. In 2011, SWUPL and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) signed a cooperation agreement on the International Training Centre for local Authorities Project. The project, with a total of 100 million US dollars investment, will build training center in SWUPL and make full use of the training resources of the United Nations.

63 years since the foundation of the University, SWUPL has developed a multi-level and multi-type higher education for undergraduates, postgraduates, doctoral candidates, and international students, and has educated more than 200,000 high ranking specialized personnel. It is the university that provided the most law personnel for the country. A large number of alumni have become backbones and leading figures in law field and other professions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7944">The concept of the '''spatial icon''', introduced by [[Aleksey Lidov|Alexei Lidov]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hodegetria of Constantinople" in the encyclopedia ''Miraculous icons in the Eastern Christian culture'', Moscow, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; plays a central role in [[hierotopy]] and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are image-visions, that are evoked, for example, in the space of a [[temple]] or [[sanctuary]]. The spatial icon encompasses a broad range of components involved in the formation and definition of sacred spaces.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Spatial Icons. The Miraculous Performance with the Hodegetria of Constantinople" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of  Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Progress-tradition, 2006, pp. 325-372.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a consciously created spatial image that transcends the material objects involved in its formation. A variety of plastic elements, including everything from buildings to decoration, and from [[mural]]s to [[liturgy|liturgical]] artifacts, work together to form a spatial icon. Sacred [[relic]]s and iconic images often play an integral role in the creation of a comprehensive spatial image.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bogdanovich.

Lidov. [http://hierotopy.ru/contents/NewJerusalems_01_Lidov_Introduction_2009_RusEng.pdf "New Jerusalems. Transferring of the Holy Land as Generative Matrix of Christian Culture"] in ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', ed. A.

Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 101-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, spatial icons were the work of specific authors; their art could be compared with that of contemporary [[film director]]s, for in both cases, there is the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Creator of Sacred Space as a Phenomenon of Byzantine Culture" in ''L’artista a Bisanzio e nel mondo cristiano-orientale'', ed. Michele Bacci, Pisa, 2003, pp.135-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performativity, as well as various dynamic elements, is a significant feature of spatial icons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Byzantine World and Performative Spaces" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011. pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a statue or building, they are constantly in motion, changing with the movement and activity of ritual and celebration, as well as with the alteration of light, odor and the movements of those participating and inhabiting them. The Tuesday performance surrounding the [[Hodegetria#Constantinople|Hodegetria icon in Constantinople]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: spatial icons and image-paradigms in Byzantine culture", Ch. 2. Spatial icons. The Miraculous Performance with the Hodegetria in Constantinople. Moscow: Theoria, 2009, pp. 39-70.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Donkey walk]] taking place in [[Medieval]] Moscow&lt;ref&gt;M. Flier. "The Image of the Tsar in the Muscovite Palm Sunday Ritual" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 533-562.&lt;/ref&gt; are classical examples of iconic performativity in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Christian]] tradition. In both cases, the city itself was temporarily transformed into the matrix of a spatial icon; the participants involved in these rituals were thus veritable co-creators of the sacred space along with the artists, priests and celebrants responsible for leading it. Another example of this performative element at work in spatial icons can be found in the ritual creation and destruction of the [[sand mandala]] in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition.

&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THE OPENING SENTENCE WITHOUT FIRST PROPOSING YOUR CHANGE AT THE TALK PAGE.--&gt;'''Statistics''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] dealing with [[data]] collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation.&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2006) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', Oxford University Press. {{isbn|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jan-Willem |last=Romijn |year=2014 |title=Philosophy of statistics |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In applying statistics to, for example, a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a [[statistical population]] or a [[statistical model]] process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [[statistical survey|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]].&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;
See [[glossary of probability and statistics]].

When [[census]] data cannot be collected, [[statistician]]s collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey [[sample (statistics)|samples]]. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An [[experimental study]] involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an [[observational study]] does not involve experimental manipulation.

Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: [[descriptive statistics]], which summarize data from a sample using [[Index (statistics)|indexes]] such as the [[mean]] or [[standard deviation]], and [[statistical inference|inferential statistics]], which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation).&lt;ref name=LundResearchLtd&gt;{{cite web|last=Lund Research Ltd. |url=https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/descriptive-inferential-statistics.php |title=Descriptive and Inferential Statistics |publisher=statistics.laerd.com |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a ''distribution'' (sample or population): ''[[central tendency]]'' (or ''location'') seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while ''[[statistical dispersion|dispersion]]'' (or ''variability'') characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of [[probability theory]], which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.

A standard statistical procedure involves the [[statistical hypothesis testing|test of the relationship]] between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, and this is compared as an [[alternative hypothesis|alternative]] to an idealized [[null hypothesis]] of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: [[Type I error]]s (null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false positive") and [[Type II error]]s (null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a "false negative").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is the Difference Between Type I and Type II Hypothesis Testing Errors?|url = http://statistics.about.com/od/Inferential-Statistics/a/Type-I-And-Type-II-Errors.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework: ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error. Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic ([[Bias (statistics)|bias]]), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of [[missing data]] or [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]] may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.

Statistics can be said to have begun in ancient civilization, going back at least to the 5th century BC, but it was not until the 18th century that it started to draw more heavily from [[calculus]] and [[probability theory]]. In more recent years statistics has relied more on statistical software to produce tests such as descriptive analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.answers.org.za/index.php/tutorials|title= How to Calculate Descriptive Statistics|publisher=Answers Consulting|date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematical statistics===
{{Main|Mathematical statistics}}

Mathematical statistics is the application of [[mathematics]] to statistics. Mathematical techniques used for this include [[mathematical analysis]], [[linear algebra]], [[stochastic analysis]], [[differential equations]], and [[measure-theoretic probability theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakshmikantham,|first=ed. by D. Kannan, V.|title=Handbook of stochastic analysis and applications|date=2002|publisher=M. Dekker|location=New York|isbn=0824706609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schervish|first=Mark J.|title=Theory of statistics|date=1995|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0387945466|edition=Corr. 2nd print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

In applying statistics to a problem, it is common practice to start with a [[statistical population|population]] or process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as "all persons living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal".

Ideally, statisticians compile data about the entire population (an operation called [[census]]). This may be organized by governmental statistical institutes. ''[[Descriptive statistics]]'' can be used to summarize the population data. Numerical descriptors include [[mean]] and [[standard deviation]] for [[Continuous probability distribution|continuous data]] types (like income), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing [[categorical data]] (like race).

When a census is not feasible, a chosen subset of the population called a [[sampling (statistics)|sample]] is studied. Once a sample that is representative of the population is determined, data is collected for the sample members in an observational or [[experiment]]al setting. Again, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data. However, the drawing of the sample has been subject to an element of randomness, hence the established numerical descriptors from the sample are also due to uncertainty. To still draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population, ''[[inferential statistics]]'' is needed. It uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting for randomness. These inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no questions about the data ([[hypothesis testing]]), estimating numerical characteristics of the data ([[Estimation theory|estimation]]), describing [[Association (statistics)|associations]] within the data ([[correlation and dependence|correlation]]) and modeling relationships within the data (for example, using [[regression analysis]]).  Inference can extend to [[forecasting]], [[prediction]] and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied; it can include [[extrapolation]] and [[interpolation]] of [[time series]] or [[spatial data analysis|spatial data]], and can also include [[data mining]].

== Data collection ==

===Sampling===
When full census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect sample data by developing specific [[design of experiments|experiment designs]] and [[survey sampling|survey samples]]. Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through [[statistical model]]s. The idea of making inferences based on sampled data began around the mid-1600s in connection with estimating populations and developing precursors of life insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1082|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represents the overall population. Representative [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.

Sampling theory is part of the [[mathematics|mathematical discipline]] of [[probability theory]]. Probability is used in [[statistical theory|mathematical statistics]] to study the [[sampling distribution]]s of [[sample statistic]]s and, more generally, the properties of [[statistical decision theory|statistical procedures]]. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method.
The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to [[deductive reasoning|deduce]] probabilities that pertain to samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite direction—[[inductive reasoning|inductively inferring]] from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.

===Experimental and observational studies===
A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate [[causality]], and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables on dependent variables]]. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: [[Experiment|experimental studies]] and [[Observational study|observational studies]]. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective.
An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve [[Scientific control|experimental manipulation]]. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated.
While the tools of data analysis work best on data from [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized studies]], they are also applied to other kinds of data—like [[natural experiment]]s and [[Observational study|observational studies]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David A. Freedman (statistician)|Freedman, D.A.]] (2005) ''Statistical Models: Theory and Practice'', Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|978-0-521-67105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;—for which a statistician would use a modified, more structured estimation method (e.g., [[Difference in differences|Difference in differences estimation]] and [[instrumental variable]]s, among many others) that produce [[consistent estimator]]s.

====Experiments====
The basic steps of a statistical experiment are:
# Planning the research, including finding the number of replicates of the study, using the following information:  preliminary estimates regarding the size of [[Average treatment effect|treatment effects]], [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], and the estimated [[experimental error|experimental variability]]. Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary. Statisticians recommend that experiments compare (at least) one new treatment with a standard treatment or control, to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects.
# [[Design of experiments]], using [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]] to reduce the influence of [[confounding variable]]s, and  [[randomized assignment]] of treatments to subjects to allow [[bias of an estimator|unbiased estimates]] of treatment effects and experimental error. At this stage, the experimenters and statisticians write the ''[[protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]]'' that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the'' primary analysis'' of the experimental data.
# Performing the experiment following the [[Protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]] and [[analysis of variance|analyzing the data]] following the experimental protocol.
# Further examining the data set in secondary analyses, to suggest new hypotheses for future study.
# Documenting and presenting the results of the study.

Experiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous [[Hawthorne study]] examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the [[Western Electric Company]]. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the [[assembly line]] workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a [[control group]] and [[double-blind|blindness]]. The [[Hawthorne effect]] refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.&lt;ref name="pmid17608932"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCarney R, Warner J, Iliffe S, van Haselen R, Griffin M, Fisher P |title=The Hawthorne Effect: a randomised, controlled trial |journal=BMC Med Res Methodol |volume=7|pages=30 |year=2007 |pmid=17608932 |pmc=1936999 |doi=10.1186/1471-2288-7-30 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Observational study====
An example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a [[cohort study]], and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rothman|editor1-first=Kenneth J|editor2-last=Greenland|editor2-first=Sander|editor3-last=Lash|editor3-first=Timothy|title=Modern Epidemiology|date=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|page=100|edition=3rd|language=English|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[case-control study]] is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.

== Types of data ==
{{main|Statistical data type||Levels of measurement}}

Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of [[level of measurement|levels of measurement]]. The psychophysicist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with [[longitude]] and [[temperature]] measurements in [[Celsius]] or [[Fahrenheit]]), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.

Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as [[categorical variable]]s, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as [[Variable (mathematics)#Applied statistics|quantitative variables]], which can be either [[Probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] or [[Probability distribution#Continuous probability distribution|continuous]], due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with [[data type]] in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the [[Boolean data type]], polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned [[integer]]s in the [[integer (computer science)|integral data type]], and continuous variables with the [[real data type]] involving [[floating point]] computation. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.

Other categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey (1977)&lt;ref&gt;Mosteller, F., &amp; Tukey, J.W. (1977). ''Data analysis and regression''. Boston: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and balances. Nelder (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Nelder, J.A. (1990). The knowledge needed to computerise the analysis and interpretation of statistical information. In ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence: the need for information about data''. Library Association Report, London, March, 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. See also Chrisman (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chrisman | first1 = Nicholas R | year = 1998 | title = Rethinking Levels of Measurement for Cartography | url = | journal = Cartography and Geographic Information Science | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 231–242 | doi=10.1559/152304098782383043}}&lt;/ref&gt; van den Berg (1991).&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg, G. (1991). ''Choosing an analysis method''. Leiden: DSWO Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions. "The relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations. Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer" (Hand, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;82).&lt;ref&gt;Hand, D.J. (2004). ''Measurement theory and practice: The world through quantification.'' London: Arnold.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology and theory of inferential statistics ==

===Statistics, estimators and pivotal quantities===
Consider [[Independent identically distributed|independent identically distributed (IID) random variables]] with a given [[probability distribution]]: standard [[statistical inference]] and [[estimation theory]] defines a [[random sample]] as the [[random vector]] given by the [[column vector]] of these IID variables.&lt;ref name=Piazza&gt;Piazza Elio, Probabilità e Statistica, Esculapio 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statistical population|population]] being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters.

A [[statistic]] is a random variable that is a function of the random sample, but ''not a function of unknown parameters''. The probability distribution of the statistic, though, may have unknown parameters.

Consider now a function of the unknown parameter: an [[estimator]] is a statistic used to estimate such function. Commonly used estimators include [[Sample mean#Sample mean|sample mean]], unbiased [[sample variance]] and [[Sample covariance#Sample covariance|sample covariance]].

A random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter, but whose probability distribution ''does not depend on the unknown parameter'' is called a [[pivotal quantity]] or pivot. Widely used pivots include the [[z-score]], the [[Chi-squared distribution#Applications|chi square statistic]] and Student's [[Student's t-distribution#How the t-distribution arises|t-value]].

Between two estimators of a given parameter, the one with lower [[mean squared error]] is said to be more [[Efficient estimator|efficient]]. Furthermore, an estimator is said to be [[Unbiased estimator|unbiased]] if its [[expected value]] is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated, and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] to the true value of such parameter.

Other desirable properties for estimators include: [[UMVUE]] estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated (this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency) and [[Consistency (statistics)|consistent]] estimators which [[converges in probability]] to the true value of such parameter.

This still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation, several methods have been proposed: the [[method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]], the [[maximum likelihood]] method, the [[least squares]] method and the more recent method of [[estimating equations]].

===Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis===
Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a [[null hypothesis]] which is usually (but not necessarily) that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Everitt | first = Brian | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0521593468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourstatsguru.com/epar/rp-reviewed/cohen1994/|title=Cohen (1994) The Earth Is Round (p &lt; .05) |publisher=YourStatsGuru.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial. The null hypothesis, H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, asserts that the defendant is guilty. The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (status quo) stands in opposition to H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and is maintained unless H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is supported by evidence "beyond a reasonable doubt". However, "failure to reject H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;" in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily ''accept'' H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; but ''fails to reject'' H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. While one can not "prove" a null hypothesis, one can test how close it is to being true with a [[Statistical power|power test]], which tests for type II errors.

What [[statisticians]] call an [[alternative hypothesis]] is simply a hypothesis that contradicts the [[null hypothesis]].

===Error===
Working from a [[null hypothesis]], two basic forms of error are recognized:
* [[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|Type I errors]] where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false positive".
* [[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|Type II errors]] where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a "false negative".

[[Standard deviation]] refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean, while [[Standard error (statistics)#Standard error of the mean|Standard error]] refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean.

A [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|statistical error]] is the amount by which an observation differs from its [[expected value]], a [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|residual]] is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample (also called prediction).

[[Mean squared error]] is used for obtaining [[efficient estimators]], a widely used class of estimators. [[Root mean square error]] is simply the square root of mean squared error.

[[File:Linear least squares(2).svg|thumb|right|A least squares fit: in red the points to be fitted, in blue the fitted line.]]

Many statistical methods seek to minimize the [[residual sum of squares]], and these are called "[[least squares|methods of least squares]]" in contrast to [[Least absolute deviations]]. The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], which provides a handy property for doing [[regression analysis|regression]]. Least squares applied to [[linear regression]] is called [[ordinary least squares]] method and least squares applied to [[nonlinear regression]] is called [[non-linear least squares]]. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise. Both linear regression and non-linear regression are addressed in [[polynomial least squares]], which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (y axis) as a function of the independent variable (x axis) and the deviations (errors, noise, disturbances) from the estimated (fitted) curve.

Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error.  Many of these errors are classified as [[Random error|random]] (noise) or [[Systematic error|systematic]] ([[bias]]), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of [[missing data]] or [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]] may result in [[bias (statistics)|biased estimates]] and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Donald B.; Little, Roderick J.A., Statistical analysis with missing data, New York: Wiley 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interval estimation===
{{main|Interval estimation}}

[[File:NYW-confidence-interval.svg|thumb|right|[[Confidence intervals]]: the red line is true value for the mean in this example, the blue lines are random confidence intervals for 100 realizations.]]

Most studies only sample part of a population, so results don't fully represent the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. [[Confidence intervals]] allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value in 95% of all possible cases. This does ''not'' imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95%. From the [[frequentist inference|frequentist]] perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a [[random variable]].  Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed [[random variable]]s. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a [[credible interval]] from [[Bayesian statistics]]: this approach depends on a different way of [[Probability interpretations|interpreting what is meant by "probability"]], that is as a [[Bayesian probability]].

In principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.

===Significance===
{{main|Statistical significance}}

Statistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question under analysis. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the [[p-value]]).

[[File:P-value in statistical significance testing.svg|upright=1.8|thumb|right|In this graph the black line is probability distribution for the [[test statistic]], the [[Critical region#Definition of terms|critical region]] is the set of values to the right of the observed data point (observed value of the test statistic) and the [[p-value]] is represented by the green area.]]

The standard approach&lt;ref name="Piazza"/&gt; is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. A [[Critical region#Definition of terms|critical region]] is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true ([[statistical significance]]) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn't belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The [[statistical power]] of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.

Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.

Although in principle the acceptable level of [[statistical significance]] may be subject to debate, the [[p-value]] is the smallest significance level that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis. This test is logically equivalent to saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the [[test statistic]]. Therefore, the smaller the p-value, the lower the probability of committing type I error.

Some problems are usually associated with this framework (See [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Criticism|criticism of hypothesis testing]]):
* A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance, but it is possible to properly formulate tests to account for this. One response involves going beyond reporting only the [[significance level]] to include the [[p-value|''p''-value]] when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted. The p-value, however, does not indicate the [[effect size|size]] or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A better and increasingly common approach is to report [[confidence interval]]s. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or ''p''-values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.
* Fallacy of the transposed conditional, aka [[prosecutor's fallacy]]: criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis (the [[null hypothesis]]) to be favored, since what is being evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed result. An alternative to this approach is offered by [[Bayesian inference]], although it requires establishing a [[prior probability]].&lt;ref name=Ioannidis2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J.P.A. | authorlink1 = John P.A.

* Rejecting the null hypothesis does not automatically prove the alternative hypothesis.
* As everything in [[inferential statistics]] it relies on sample size, and therefore under [[fat tails]] p-values may be seriously mis-computed.{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

== Misuse ==
{{main|Misuse of statistics}}

[[Misuse of statistics]] can produce subtle, but serious errors in description and interpretation—subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors, and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors. For instance, social policy, medical practice, and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics.

Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied, the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The [[statistical significance]] of a trend in the data—which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample—may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as [[statistical literacy]].

There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally [[Misuse of statistics|misused]] by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter.&lt;ref name=Huff&gt;Huff, Darrell (1954) ''[[How to Lie with Statistics]]'',  WW Norton &amp; Company, Inc. New York.  {{isbn|0-393-31072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A  mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation, "[[Lies, damned lies, and statistics|There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics]]". Misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional, and the book ''[[How to Lie with Statistics]]''&lt;ref name=Huff/&gt; outlines a range of considerations. In an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics, reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted (e.g. Warne, Lazo, Ramos, and Ritter (2012)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warne | first1 = R. Lazo | last2 = Ramos | first2 = T. | last3 = Ritter | first3 = N. | year = 2012 | title = Statistical Methods Used in Gifted Education Journals, 2006–2010 | url = | journal = Gifted Child Quarterly | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 134–149 | doi = 10.1177/0016986212444122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding [[Bias (statistics)|bias]].&lt;ref name="Statistics in Archaeology"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Statistics in archaeology | pages = 2093–2100 | first1 = Robert D. | last1 = Drennan | title =  Encyclopedia of Archaeology | year = 2008 | publisher = Elsevier Inc. | editor-first = Deborah M. | editor-last = Pearsall | isbn = 978-0-12-373962-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Misuse can occur when conclusions are [[Hasty generalization|overgeneralized]] and claimed to be representative of more than they really are, often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias.&lt;ref name="Misuse of Statistics"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Jerome B. |title=Misuse of Statistics |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |date=December 1938 |volume=33 |issue=204 |pages=657–674 |location=JSTOR |doi=10.1080/01621459.1938.10502344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand, and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs.&lt;ref name="Statistics in Archaeology" /&gt; Unfortunately, most people do not look for bias or errors, so they are not noticed. Thus, people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well [[Sampling (statistics)|represented]].&lt;ref name="Misuse of Statistics" /&gt; To make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate, the sample taken must be representative of the whole.&lt;ref name="Modern Elementary Statistics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freund|first=J.E.|authorlink = John E. Freund|title=Modern Elementary Statistics|journal=Credo Reference|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Huff, "The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by [bias]... allow yourself some degree of skepticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huff|first=Darrell|title=How to Lie with Statistics|year=1954|publisher=Norton|location=New York|author2=Irving Geis |quote=The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by [bias]... allow yourself some degree of skepticism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To assist in the understanding of statistics Huff proposed a series of questions to be asked in each case:&lt;ref name="How to Lie with Statistics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Huff |first=Darrell |title=How to Lie with Statistics |year=1954 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |author2=Irving Geis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Simple Confounding Case.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|The [[confounding variable]] problem: ''X'' and ''Y'' may be correlated, not because there is causal relationship between them, but because both depend on a third variable ''Z''. ''Z'' is called a confounding factor.]]

===Misinterpretation: correlation===
The concept of [[correlation]] is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause. Statistical analysis of a [[data set]] often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or [[confounding variable]]. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables. (See [[Correlation does not imply causation]].)

== History of statistical science ==

[[File:Jerôme Cardan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Gerolamo Cardano]], the earliest pioneer on the mathematics of probability.]]

{{main|History of statistics|Founders of statistics}}

Some scholars pinpoint the origin of statistics to 1663, with the publication of ''Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality'' by [[John Graunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Walter (1938) "The Founder of Statistics". ''Review of the [[International Statistical Institute]]'' 5(4): 321–328. {{jstor|1400906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its [[History of statistics#Etymology|''stat-'' etymology]]. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences.

Its mathematical foundations were laid in the 17th century with the development of the [[probability theory]] by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Mathematical [[probability theory]] arose from the study of games of chance, although the concept of probability was already examined in [[Medieval Roman law|medieval law]] and by philosophers such as [[Juan Caramuel]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal, Johns Hopkins Univ Pr 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The [[method of least squares]] was first described by  [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in 1805.

[[File:Karl Pearson, 1910.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Karl Pearson]], a founder of mathematical statistics.]]

The modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYFRAAAAMAAJ|title=Studies in the history of statistical method|author=Helen Mary Walker|year=1975|publisher=Arno Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the work of [[Francis Galton]] and [[Karl Pearson]], who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions included introducing the concepts of [[standard deviation]], [[correlation]], [[regression analysis]] and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics—height, weight, eyelash length among others.&lt;ref name=Galton1877&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galton | first1 = F | year = 1877 | title = Typical laws of heredity | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 15 | issue = 388| pages = 492–553 | doi=10.1038/015492a0| bibcode = 1877Natur..15..492. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearson developed the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]], defined as a product-moment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1214/ss/1177012580 | last1 = Stigler | first1 = S.M. | year = 1989 | title = Francis Galton's Account of the Invention of Correlation | url = | journal = Statistical Science | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 73–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]] for the fitting of distributions to samples and the [[Pearson distribution]], among many other things.&lt;ref name="Pearson, On the criterion"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pearson|first1=K.|year=1900|title=On the Criterion that a given System of Deviations from the Probable in the Case of a Correlated System of Variables is such that it can be reasonably supposed to have arisen from Random Sampling|url=|journal=Philosophical Magazine |series=Series 5|volume=50|issue=302|pages=157–175|doi=10.1080/14786440009463897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galton and Pearson founded ''[[Biometrika]]'' as the first journal of mathematical statistics and [[biostatistics]] (then called biometry), and the latter founded the world's first university statistics department at [[University College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=|title=Karl Pearson (1857–1936)|publisher=Department of Statistical Science&amp;nbsp;– [[University College London]]|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/stats/department/pearson.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925065418/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/stats/department/pearson.html|archivedate=2008-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Fisher]] coined the term [[null hypothesis]] during the [[Lady tasting tea]] experiment, which "is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation".&lt;ref&gt;Fisher|1971|loc=Chapter II. The Principles of Experimentation, Illustrated by a Psycho-physical Experiment, Section 8. The Null Hypothesis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;OED quote: '''1935''' R.A. Fisher, ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'' ii. 19, "We may speak of this hypothesis as the 'null hypothesis', and the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation."&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of the 1910s and 20s was initiated by [[William Gosset]], and reached its culmination in the insights of [[Ronald Fisher]], who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world. Fisher's most important publications were his 1918 seminal paper ''[[The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]'', which was the first to use the statistical term, [[variance]], his classic 1925 work ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]'' and his 1935 ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3102/00028312003003223 | title = The Influence of Fisher's "The Design of Experiments" on Educational Research Thirty Years Later | year = 1966 | author = Stanley, J.C. | journal = American Educational Research Journal | volume = 3 | pages = 223 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Box, JF | title = R.A.

The final wave, which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments, emerged from the collaborative work between [[Egon Pearson]] and [[Jerzy Neyman]] in the 1930s. They introduced the concepts of "[[Type I and type II errors|Type II]]" error, power of a test and [[confidence interval]]s. [[Jerzy Neyman]] in 1934 showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive (quota) sampling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neyman | first1 = J | year = 1934 | title = On the two different aspects of the representative method: The method of stratified sampling and the method of purposive selection | url = | journal = [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]] | volume = 97 | issue = 4| pages = 557–625 | jstor=2342192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making, for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology. The use of modern [[computer]]s has expedited large-scale statistical computations, and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually. Statistics continues to be an area of active research, for example on the problem of how to analyze [[Big data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santafe.edu/news/item/sfnm-wood-big-data/|title=Science in a Complex World – Big Data: Opportunity or Threat?|work=Santa Fe Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied statistics, theoretical statistics and mathematical statistics===
''Applied statistics'' comprises descriptive statistics and the application of inferential statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Nikoletseas, M.M. (2014) "Statistics: Concepts and Examples." {{isbn|978-1500815684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, D.R.; Sweeney, D.J.; Williams, T.A. (1994) ''Introduction to Statistics: Concepts and Applications'', pp. 5–9. West Group. {{isbn|978-0-314-03309-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Theoretical statistics'' concerns the logical arguments underlying justification of approaches to [[statistical inference]], as well as encompassing ''mathematical statistics''. Mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of [[probability distribution]]s necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference, but also various aspects of [[computational statistics]] and the [[design of experiments]].

===Machine learning and data mining===
There are two applications for [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]]: data management and data analysis.  Statistics tools are necessary for the data analysis.

===Statistics in society===
Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of [[academic discipline]]s, including [[natural]] and [[social science]]s, government, and business. [[Statistical consultant]]s can help organizations and companies that don't have in-house expertise relevant to their particular questions.

===Statistical computing===

[[File:Gretl screenshot.png|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[gretl]], an example of an [[List of open source statistical packages|open source statistical package]]]]

{{main|Computational statistics}}

The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of [[linear model]]s, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical [[algorithms]], caused an increased interest in [[Nonlinear regression|nonlinear models]] (such as [[neural networks]]) as well as the creation of new types, such as [[generalized linear model]]s and [[multilevel model]]s.

Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on [[Resampling (statistics)|resampling]], such as permutation tests and the [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]], while techniques such as [[Gibbs sampling]] have made use of Bayesian models more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with new emphasis on "experimental" and "empirical" statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]] are now available. Examples of available software capable of complex statistical computation include programs such as [[Mathematica]],  [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SPSS]], and  [[R (programming language)|R]].

===Statistics applied to mathematics or the arts===
Traditionally, statistics was concerned with drawing inferences using a semi-standardized methodology that was "required learning" in most sciences.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} This tradition has changed with use of statistics in non-inferential contexts. What was once considered a dry subject, taken in many fields as a degree-requirement, is now viewed enthusiastically.{{according to whom|date=April 2014}} Initially derided by some mathematical purists, it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas.
* In [[number theory]], [[scatter plot]]s of data generated by a distribution function may be transformed with familiar tools used in statistics to reveal underlying patterns, which may then lead to hypotheses.
* Methods of statistics including predictive methods in [[forecasting]] are combined with [[chaos theory]] and [[fractal geometry]] to create video works that are considered to have great beauty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}
* The [[process art]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] relied on artistic experiments whereby underlying distributions in nature were artistically revealed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} With the advent of computers, statistical methods were applied to formalize such distribution-driven natural processes to make and analyze moving video art.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}
* Methods of statistics may be used predicatively in [[performance art]], as in a card trick based on a [[Markov process]] that only works some of the time, the occasion of which can be predicted using statistical methodology.
* Statistics can be used to predicatively create art, as in the statistical or [[stochastic music]] invented by [[Iannis Xenakis]], where the music is performance-specific. Though this type of artistry does not always come out as expected, it does behave in ways that are predictable and tunable using statistics.

== Specialized disciplines ==
{{main|List of fields of application of statistics}}

Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: [[biostatistics]],  [[computational biology]],  [[computational sociology]],  [[network biology]],  [[social science]],  [[sociology]] and  [[social research]]. Some fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have [[specialized terminology]]. These disciplines include:

{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Actuarial science]] (assesses risk in the insurance and finance industries)
* [[Applied information economics]]
* [[Astrostatistics]] (statistical evaluation of astronomical data)
* [[Biostatistics]]
* [[Business statistics]]
* [[Chemometrics]] (for analysis of data from [[chemistry]])
* [[Data mining]] (applying statistics and [[pattern recognition]] to discover knowledge from data)
* [[Data science]]
* [[Demography]] (statistical study of populations)
* [[Econometrics]] (statistical analysis of economic data)
* [[E-statistics|Energy statistics]]
* [[Engineering statistics]]
* [[Epidemiology]] (statistical analysis of disease)
* [[Geography]] and [[geographic information system]]s, specifically in [[spatial analysis]]
* [[Image processing]]
* [[Medical statistics]]
* [[Political science]]
* [[Psychological statistics]]
* [[Reliability engineering]]
* [[Social statistics]]
* [[Statistical mechanics]]
}}

In addition, there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also developed their own specialised terminology and methodology:
{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|Bootstrap]]{{\}}[[Resampling (statistics)|Jackknife resampling]]
* [[Multivariate statistics]]
* [[Statistical classification]]
* [[Structured data analysis (statistics)]]
* [[Structural equation modelling]]
* [[Survey methodology]]
* [[Survival analysis]]
* Statistics in various sports, particularly [[Baseball statistics|baseball]] – known as  [[Sabermetrics]] – and [[Cricket statistics|cricket]]
}}

Statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. It is used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes (as in [[statistical process control]] or SPC), for summarizing data, and to make data-driven decisions. In these roles, it is a key tool, and perhaps the only reliable tool.

'''Technology [[forecasting]]''' attempts to predict the future characteristics of useful technological [[machine]]s, [[Procedure (term)|procedures]] or [[wikt:technique|techniques]].

==Important aspects==
{{quotebox|"'''I think we have a cultural affinity for technology that reflects optimism, but we all make poor forecasts.'''" &amp;mdash; ''Jim Moore, director of the Transportation Engineering Program at the University of Southern California''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/autos/story/20160706-5-transportation-technologies-we-wish-were-more-popular&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Primarily, a technological [[forecasting|forecast]] deals with the characteristics of [[technology]], such as levels of technical performance, like speed of a military aircraft, the power in watts of a particular future engine, the accuracy or precision of a [[measuring instrument]], the number of [[transistors]] in a chip in the year 2015, etc. The forecast does not have to state how these characteristics will be achieved.

Secondly, technological forecasting usually deals with only useful machines, procedures or techniques. This is to exclude from the domain of technological forecasting those commodities, services or techniques intended for luxury or amusement.

==Rational and explicit methods==
The whole purpose of the recitation of alternatives is to show that there really is no alternative to forecasting. If a decision maker has several alternatives open to him or her, s/he will choose among them on the basis of which provides him/her with the most desirable outcome. Thus his/her decision is inevitably based on a forecast. His/her only choice is whether the forecast is obtained by rational and explicit methods, or by intuitive means.

The virtues of the use of rational methods are as follows:
#They can be taught and learned,
#They can be described and explained,
#They provide a procedure followable by anyone who has absorbed the necessary training, and in some cases,
#These methods are even guaranteed to produce the same forecast regardless of who uses them.

The virtue of the use of explicit methods is that they can be reviewed by others, and can be checked for consistency. Furthermore, the forecast can be reviewed at any subsequent time.
Technology forecasting is not imagination.

==Methods of technology forecasting==
Commonly adopted methods of technology forecasting include the [[Delphi method]], [[forecast by analogy]], [[growth curve (statistics)|growth curve]]s and [[extrapolation]]. Normative methods of technology forecasting — like the [[relevance tree]]s, [[morphological model]]s, and [[mission flow diagram]]s — are also commonly used.

==Combining forecasts==
Studies of past forecasts have shown that one of the most frequent reasons why a forecast goes wrong is that the forecaster ignores related fields.

A given technical approach may fail to achieve the level of capability forecast for it, because it is superseded by another technical approach which the forecaster ignored.

Another problem is that of inconsistency between forecasts. Because of these problems, it is often necessary to combine forecasts of different technologies. Therefore rather than to try to select the one method which is most appropriate, it may be better to try to combine the forecasts obtained by different methods.

If this is done, the strengths of one method may help compensate for the weaknesses of another.

===Reasons for combining forecasts===
The primary reason for [[Consensus forecasts|combining forecasts]] of the same technology is to attempt to offset the weaknesses of one forecasting method with the strengths of another.
In addition, the use of more than one forecasting method often gives the forecaster more insight into the processes at work which are responsible for the growth of the technology being forecast.

===Trend curve and growth curves===
A frequently used combination is that of growth curves and a trend curve for some technology.
Here we see a succession of growth curves, each describing the level of functional capability achieved by a specific technical approach.

An overall trend curve is also shown, fitted to those items of historical data which represent the currently superior approach.

The use of growth curves and a trend curve in combination allows the forecaster to draw some conclusions about the future growth of a technology which might not be possible, were either method used alone.

With growth curves alone, the forecaster could not say anything about the time at which a given technical approach is likely to be supplanted by a successor approach.

With the trend curve alone, the forecaster could not say anything about the ability of a specific technical approach to meet the projected trend, or about the need to look for a successor approach.
Thus the need for combining forecasts.

===Identification of consistent deviations===
Another frequently used combination of forecasts is that of the trend curve and one or more analogies.

We customarily consider the scatter of data points about a trend curve to be due to random influences which we can neither control nor even measure. However, consistent deviations may represent something other than just random influences.

Where such consistent deviations are identified, we may have an opportunity to apply an analogy. Typical events which bring about deviations from a trend are wars and depressions. Thus the purpose of combining analogies with a trend forecast is to predict deviations from the trend deviations which are associated with or caused by external events or influences.

As with other uses of analogy, it is important to determine the extent to which the analogy between the event used as the basis for the forecast, and the historical model event, satisfies the criteria for a valid analogy.

===Forecasts of different technologies===
Combining forecasts of different technologies may be even more important than combining the forecasts of the same technology.

One reason for this is the fact that technologies may interact or be interrelated in some fashion.
Another reason for this is that of consistency in an overall picture or scenario. One of the simplest examples of interacting trends is the projection to absurdity, i.e. simply projecting the given data indefinitely without getting any specific result. For instance, if one simply projects recent rates of growth of world population, one arrives at some fantastic conclusions about the density of population in a particular place by various dates in the next millennium.

Some other trends which can confidently be expected to not continue indefinitely are:
#Annual production of scientific papers.
#Number of automobiles per capita.
#[[Watt-hour|Kilowatt hours]] of electricity generated annually.

Another instance of interacting trends was in the case of the number of scientists in the U.S. growing faster than the overall population. Since the 1940s through the 1960s, science as an activity in the United States grew exponentially. The number of dollars spent on R&amp;D was growing faster than the GNP (in the 1960s).

If projected indefinitely, these two curves would give the result that eventually every person in the U.S. would be working as a scientist and the entire GNP would be devoted to R&amp;D alone, which are however absurd conclusions. Thus it is clear that the scientific discipline of technology forecasting is not mere trend extrapolation but also involves combining forecasts.

==Uses in manufacturing==
Almost all modern manufacturing firms utilize the services of a technological forecaster. Nevertheless, there are a number of alternatives to the rational and explicit forecasting of technology, such as 'no forecast', 'anything can happen' (i.e. relying on pure chance), 'window-blind forecasting', 'genius forecasting' and boasting of a 'glorious past' (i.e. adopting the same old techniques).

Thus technological forecasting is not mere astrology or palmistry, but a scientific and well defined procedure adopted by a technological forecaster or a consultancy for the forecasting of a particular technology. Even though technological forecasting is a scientific discipline, some experts are of the view that "the only certainty of a particular forecast is that it is wrong to some degree."

'''''The Will to Doubt: An Essay in Philosophy for the General Thinker''''' is a [[book]] published in 1907 by [[University of Michigan]] professor [[Alfred Henry Lloyd]]. Professor Lloyd would later become interim President of the University of Michigan in 1925.

==Thesis==
''The Will to Doubt'' was Lloyd's fourth book and was published as a volume in the Ethical Library Series. The book was a response to [[William James]]' 1896 collection of essays titled ''[[The Will to Believe]]''. Professor Lloyd's simple thesis is that "doubt is essential to real belief".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/willtodoubtessay00lloyrich#page/n11/mode/2up ''The Will to Doubt'']. London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1907, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote at the beginning of the 20th century, in what he called an age of doubt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We would often hide it from others, not to say from ourselves, but it is there, and we all know it to be there.&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Though many fear doubt, and try to keep it hidden and locked away, the confession of doubt is in fact the beginning of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Themes==
Fear is a chief motivator of [[dogmatism]], and dogmatic people are slaves to their fears. This is not genuine confidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; But doubt is not the road to [[atheism]]; in fact, doubt is part of a very difficult road to [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] built upon these arguments in subsequent years, even directly referencing Lloyd in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]].

This is a '''timeline''' of [[women in computing]]. It covers the time when women worked as "[[Human computer|human computers]]" and then as programmers of physical computers. Eventually, women programmers went on to write software, develop Internet technologies and other types of programming. Women have also been involved in [[computer science]], various related types of engineering and computer hardware.

He was replaced by [[Florencio Tamesis]] who became the School of Forestry's second dean, as well as its first [[Filipino people|Filipino]] dean.&lt;ref name = '100 Years 0.5'/&gt;

The [[Second World War]] devastated the campus. All the School of Forestry buildings, including student and faculty houses, were destroyed. Large parts of the [[Mount Makiling|Makiling Forest Reserve]], which is administered by the school were likewise damaged. Only four faculty including Tamesis and silviculture professor Teodoro C. Delizo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elib.gov.ph/details.php?uid=e6a3c7d8512263bc1f479867b0fe555d|title=Forest nursery and plantation handbook for the Philippines|author=Teodoro Cachero Delizo|date=1964|publisher=University of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with five students returned upon the resumption of classes.

Due to the distance of the Bureau of Forestry in Manila from the Forest School in [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]] (about 64 kilometers), directors of the bureau appointed foresters-in-charge to manage the school, a practice which continued until 1957.&lt;ref name="100 Years 0.5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="100 Years"/&gt;

The '''Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre''' ('''VSSC''') is a major space research centre of the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO), focusing on rocket and space vehicles for India's [[satellite]] programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isro.gov.in/isrocentres/vssc.aspx |title=Welcome To ISRO :: Centres :: Thiruvananthapuram :: Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre(VSSC) |publisher=Isro.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Thiruvananthapuram]], in the Indian state of [[Kerala]].

The centre had its beginnings as the [[Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station]] (TERLS) in 1962. It was renamed in honour of Dr. [[Vikram Sarabhai]], often regarded as the father of the Indian space program.

The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre is one of the main research and development establishments within ISRO. VSSC is an entirely indigenous facility working on the development of sounding rockets, the Rohini and Menaka launchers, and the [[ASLV]], [[PSLV]], [[GSLV]] and [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III|GSLV Mk III]] families of launch vehicles.

==History==
Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) is the largest among the ISRO facilities. It is a centre for the design and development of satellite launch vehicles and associated technologies. The centre pursues research and development in a host of distinct technology domains including [[aeronautics]], [[avionics]], and [[composite material|composites]], primarily for the purpose of advancing the development of launch vehicle technology in India.

After incorporation of the [[Indian National Committee for Space Research]] (INCOSPAR) in 1962, its first act was the establishment of the [[Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station]] (TERLS) at Thumba, in Thiruvananthapuram. Thumba was picked as the launch site for sounding rockets for meteorological and upper atmospheric research due to its location on the geomagnetic equator.

21 November 1963 marked India's first venture into space, with the launch of a two-stage [[Nike Apache]] [[sounding rocket]] from TERLS. The first rockets launched were built in United States.

The first Indian designed and built rocket, RH-75, made its maiden flight on 20 November 1967. This was the 52nd launch of a sounding rocket from TERLS. It was flown twice again in 1967 and another 12 times in 1968, making a total of 15 RH-75 flights.

Among the sounding rockets to have flown from TERLS were [[Arcas (rocket)|Arcas]]-1, [[Arcas (rocket)|Arcas]]-11, [[Centaure (rocket)|Centaure]]-1, 11A and 11B, [[Dragon (rocket)|Dragon]]-1, Dual Hawk, Judy Dart, Menaka-1, Menaka-1Mk 1 and Mk11, [[Nike Tomahawk]], M-100, [[Petrel (rocket)|Petrel]], RH-100, RH-125, RH-200 (S), RH-300, variants of RH-560, etc. There have been a total of nearly 2200 sounding rocket launches from TERLS, so far.

Over the years VSSC has designed, developed and launched a family of sounding rockets under the generic name, Rohini Sounding Rockets (RSR) to serve a range of scientific missions. The currently operational Rohini Sounding Rockets are RH-200, RH-300, RH-560 and their different versions. These sounding rockets are launched for carrying out research in areas like meteorology and upper atmospheric processes up to an altitude of about 500&amp;nbsp;km.

TERLS was formally dedicated to the [[United Nations]] on 2 February 1968, by then [[Prime Minister of India]], Mrs. [[Indira Gandhi]]. Although no direct funding from the UN was involved, scientists from several countries including United States, Russia (former [[USSR]]), France, Japan, Germany and UK continue to utilize the TERLS facility for conducting rocket based experiments. Over 1161 USSR meteorological sounding rockets called M-100 were launched from TERLS every week from 1970 until 1993.

After the sudden demise of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai on 30 December 1971, TERLS and associated space establishments at Thiruvananthapuram were renamed as the ''Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre'' in his honour.

In the early 1980s, VSSC was instrumental in the development of India's [[Satellite Launch Vehicle]] program, SLV-3. This was followed in the late 1980s with the [[Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (ASLV), for launching 150&amp;nbsp;kg satellites into near earth orbits.

In the 1990s, VSSC contributed to the development of India’s workhorse launch vehicle, the [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (PSLV).

==Facilities==
In addition to its main campus located at [[Thumba]] and Veli, VSSC has integration and checkout facilities located at Valiamala. Facilities for development of reinforced plastics and composites are located at [[Vattiyoorkavu]] in Thiruvananthapuram City. The ISRO plant in [[Aluva]] produces [[ammonium perchlorate]], a vital ingredient for solid propellant motors. [[Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station]] (TERLS) and the Space Physics Laboratory (SPL) are also within the VSSC campus. SPL focuses on research activities in disciplines such as atmospheric boundary layer physics, numerical atmospheric modeling, atmospheric aerosols, atmospheric chemistry, trace gases, atmospheric dynamics, thermospheric-ionospheric physics, planetary sciences, etc. 

Satish Dhawan Supercomputing Facility.

VSSC has a large workforce of about 4500 employees, most of them specialists in frontier disciplines.

==Programs==
Over the last four decades VSSC has become the leading centre for development of launch vehicle technology.&lt;ref name=vscc-site&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vssc.gov.in/internet/ |title=Government of India, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre |publisher=Vssc.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VSSC has a matrix organization based on Projects and Entities. Core project teams manage project activities. System level activities of the projects are carried out by system development agencies. Major programmes of VSSC include the [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (PSLV), [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (GSLV), Rohini Sounding Rockets, Space Capsule Recovery Experiment, Reusable Launch Vehicles and Air Breathing Propulsion.

VSSC pursues research and development in the fields of aeronautics, avionics, composites, computer and information technology, control guidance and simulation, launch vehicle design, mechanical engineering, mechanisms vehicle integration and testing, propellants polymers and materials, propulsion propellants and space ordnance, and systems reliability. These research Entities are the system development agencies for the Projects and thus provide for the realization of the project objectives. Management systems area provides for programme planning and evaluation, human resource development, budget and manpower, technology transfer, documentation and outreach activities.

VSSC is certified for compliance to ISO 9001:2000 quality management system. The quality objectives of the Centre are planning, implementing and maintaining a quality system during design, development, production, and operation of subsystems and systems for launch vehicles. It also aims at achieving continued improvement in process for its zero defect goal.

ISRO has developed an array of sounding rockets and four generations of launch vehicles and thus establishing operational space transportation system. Most of launch vehicle development is carried out at VSSC.

Current focus of VSSC is on the [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (GSLV), the GSLV Mk III and the Reusable Launch Vehicle- Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD).

In January 2007, the [[Space Capsule Recovery Experiment]] Module (SRE-1) was safely brought back to earth after 10 days in orbit. This involved a host of technologies developed at VSSC, including [[thermal protection system]]s to withstand the large heat flux of [[atmospheric re-entry]].

VSSC made significant contribution to India's maiden mission to the Moon, [[Chandrayaan-1]].

VSSC R&amp;D efforts have included solid propellant formulations. Another focus area has been navigation systems; the ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU) established at Vattiyoorkavu is a part of VSSC.

VSSC is involved in the development of air-breathing vehicles. A [[reusable launch vehicle]] technology demonstrator is under development, which will be tested soon.

VSSC also has programs focused on applications of space technology including village resource centres, [[telemedicine]], [[electronic learning|tele-education]], [[disaster management]] support and outreach through [[Direct To Home]] television broadcast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10442">The '''Wordos''' is a [[writing circle|writing workshop]] based in [[Eugene, Oregon]], [[United States]]. Its members meet once a week to [[critic|critique]] stories and discuss the art, craft, and business of [[writing]]. It is a long-running [[speculative fiction]] critique group, and has a high concentration of [[publishing|published]] authors. However, having prior publishing credits is not a prerequisite to joining. The group has produced winners of the [[Galaxy Press]] international [[Writers of the Future]] contest six years in a row.&lt;ref name=RGMarch07&gt;{{cite news |last=McCowan |first=Karen |title=Eugene's bunch of Wordos continues to find success |url=http://www.registerguard.com/news/2007/03/21/a1.scificentral.0321.p1.php?section=cityregion |publisher=''[[The Register-Guard]]'' |date=March 21, 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group promotes itself as a means to help writers produce [[fiction]] of salable quality, and to continually improve their writing abilities. The workshop's primary focus is on [[Short story|short]] speculative fiction, but members have had fiction of other lengths and genres critiqued.

==History==
Founded in 1987, "The Wordos" was originally called "The Eugene Professional Writers Workshops, Inc." The name was changed in 1995, to make it "shorter and friendlier."

Members also report on news over the previous week, including accepted stories, rejections, and re-write requests from publishers.

==Awards==
A member of the Wordos has won or placed in the [[L. Ron Hubbard]] [[Writers of the Future]] contest consistently since 2001. There have also been several [[Nebula Award]]-winning workshop members and members who have been nominated for or won the [[Endeavour Award]], [[World Fantasy Award]], and [[Philip K. Dick Award]].

'''Yagan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|eɪ|ɡ|ən}}; c. 1795&amp;nbsp;– 11 July 1833) was an [[Indigenous Australian]] warrior from the [[Noongar]] people. He played a key part in [[Indigenous Australian resistance|early resistance]] to [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|British colonial settlement]] and rule in the area surrounding what is now [[Perth, Western Australia]]. Yagan was pursued by the local authorities after he killed Erin Entwhistle, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler. It was an act of retaliation after Thomas Smedley, another of Butler's servants, shot at a group of Noongar people stealing potatoes and fowls, killing one of them.&lt;ref&gt;N. Green, ''Broken Spears: Aborigines and Europeans in the southwest of Australia'', Perth p. 79. Also Hallam and Tilbrook, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Depositions: Taken Before the Lieutenant Governor and Executive Council at Perth|date = 25 May 1833|work = The Perth Gazette|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government offered a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] for Yagan's capture, dead or alive, and a young settler, William Keats, subsequently shot and killed him. Yagan's execution figures in Australian history as a symbol of the unjust and sometimes brutal treatment of the indigenous peoples of Australia by colonial settlers. He is considered a hero by the Noongar.&lt;ref name="Colbung 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="noongar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noongarculture.org.au/yagan/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419144410/http://www.noongarculture.org.au/yagan/|archivedate=19 April 2013|title=Yagan |publisher=[[Land council|South West Aboriginal Land &amp; Sea Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his shooting, settlers removed Yagan's head to claim the bounty. Later, an official sent it to London, where it was exhibited as an "[[anthropology|anthropological]] curiosity" and eventually given to a museum in [[Liverpool]]. It held the head in storage for more than a century before burying it with other remains in an unmarked grave in Liverpool in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2010/07/12/aboriginal-warrior-yagan-is-finally-laid-to-rest-after-170-years-100252-26834867/ Aboriginal warrior Yagan is finally laid to rest after 170 years], ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'', 12 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the Noongar asked for repatriation of the head, both for religious reasons and because of Yagan's traditional stature. The burial site was identified in 1993; officials [[exhumation of Yagan's head|exhumed the head]] four years later and [[Repatriation|repatriated]] it to Australia. After years of debate within the Noongar community on the appropriate final resting place, Yagan's head was buried in a traditional ceremony in the [[Swan Valley (Western Australia)|Swan Valley]] in July 2010, 177 years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/warrior-reburied-170-years-after-death.htm/|title=Warrior reburied 170 years after death|publisher=[[Australian Geographic]]|date=12 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623230023/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/warrior-reburied-170-years-after-death.htm|archivedate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
A member of the [[Whadjuk]] Noongar people, Yagan belonged to a [[tribe]] of around 60 people whose name, according to [[Robert Lyon (Australian settler)|Robert Lyon]], was ''[[Beeliar (tribe)|Beeliar]]''. Scholars now believe that the Beeliar people may have been a family subgroup (or [[clan]]) of a larger tribe whom [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]] called ''Beelgar''.&lt;ref name="Bourke 1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bourke, Michael|year=1987|chapter=Chapter 3: Yagan 'The Patriot' and 'Governor' Weeip|title=On the Swan|location=Nedlands, Western Australia|publisher=University of Western Australia Press|isbn=0-85564-258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lyon, the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan]] and [[Canning River (Western Australia)|Canning]] rivers, as far south as [[Mangles Bay, Western Australia|Mangles Bay]].{{sfn|Green|1984|p=50}} The group had customary land usage rights over a much larger area than this, extending north as far as [[Lake Monger, Western Australia|Lake Monger]] and northeast to the [[Helena River]]. The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to move over their neighbours' land, possibly due to kinship and marriage ties with neighbouring groups.&lt;ref name="Hallam 1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hallam, Sylvia J.  |author2=Tilbrook, Lois |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1990|title = Aborigines of the Southwest Region, 1829–1840 (The Bicentennial Dictionary of Western Australians, Volume VIII)|location= Nedlands, Western Australia | publisher=University of Western Australia Press|isbn=0-85564-296-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yagan is thought to have been born around 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/now_showing/first_australians/resistance/yagan/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122053747/http://nma.gov.au/exhibitions/now_showing/first_australians/resistance/yagan/|archivedate=22 November 2011 |title=National Museum of Australia – Yagan's story |publisher=Nma.gov.au |date=2 September 1997 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Midgegooroo]], an [[elder (administrative title)|elder]] of the Beeliar people;{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=229}} his mother was presumably one of Midgegooroo's two wives. Yagan was probably a ''Ballaroke'' in the [[Noongar classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/after-160-years-its-time-for-yagan-to-go-home-1260837.html |title=After 160 years, it's time for Yagan to go home – News |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=11 May 1997 |archivedate=24 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224050019/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/after-160-years-its-time-for-yagan-to-go-home-1260837.html  | first1=Graham | last1=Nown | first2=Andrew | last2=Rosthorn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
According to the historian Neville Green, Yagan had a wife and two children.&lt;ref name="Green 1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Green, Neville|year=1981|chapter=Aborigines and White Settlers in the Nineteenth Century|pages=72–123|editor=Stannage, Tom|title=A New History of Western Australia|location=Nedlands, Western Australia | publisher=University of Western Australia Press|isbn=0-85564-170-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Green|1984|p=82}} A report in the ''[[Perth Gazette]]'' in 1833 gives the names of his children as "Naral", age 9, and "Willim", age 11;&lt;ref name="Gazette1June1833-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=[[:File:PerthGazette 1833 06 01 2.jpg|The Native's again!!]]  |work=[[Perth Gazette]] |location=Perth |id= |page=87 |date=1 June 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, most other sources state that the warrior was unmarried and childless. Described as taller than average with an impressive burly physique, Yagan had a distinctive tribal tattoo on his right shoulder, which identified him as "a man of high degree in tribal law."&lt;ref name="Green 1981"/&gt;{{sfn|Green|1984|p=82}} He was generally acknowledged to be the most physically powerful of his tribe.{{sfn|Green|1979|p=2}}

===Relations with settlers===
Yagan would have been about 35 years old in 1829 when [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] settlers landed in the area and established the [[Swan River Colony]].{{sfn|Green|1984|p=39}} For the first two years of the colony, relations between settlers and Noongar were generally amicable, as there was little competition for resources. The Noongar welcomed the white settlers as ''Djanga'',{{sfn|Green|1984|p=53}} the returned spirits of their dead.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=53}} Historical reports noted the two groups shared fish.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=73}} As time passed, conflicts between the two cultures gradually became more frequent.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=73}} The settlers incorrectly thought that the Noongar were nomads who had no claim to the land over which they roamed. Colonists fenced off land for grazing and farming according to their traditional practices of land use.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=73}}

As the colonists fenced off more land, the Noongar were increasingly denied access to their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony.{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=35}} In addition, the Noongar practice of [[firestick farming]]: [[bushfire|firing]] [[the bush]] to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.{{sfn|Green|1984|pp=74–75}}

In December 1831 Yagan and his father led the first significant Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in Western Australia. Thomas Smedley, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler, ambushed some natives who were raiding a potato patch, and killed one of Yagan's family group.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=79}} A few days later, Yagan, Midgegooroo and others stormed the farmhouse and, finding the door locked, began to break through the mud-brick walls. Inside were Butler's servant Erin Entwhistle and his two sons Enion and Ralph.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}} After hiding his sons under the bed, Entwhistle opened the door to parley and was killed by Yagan and Midgegooroo.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}} Noongar tribal law required that murders be avenged by the killing of a member of the murderer's tribal group, not necessarily the murderer. The Noongar considered servants and employees to be part of the settlers' groups.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=77}} Historians believe the Noongar attack on Entwhistle was retribution under their tribal law.&lt;ref name="Hallam 1990"/&gt; Not understanding tribal law (and unlikely to agree with its concepts), the white settlers took the killing to be an unprovoked murder and dispatched a force to arrest Yagan's group, without success.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}}

In June 1832 Yagan led a party of Aborigines in attacking two labourers sowing a field of wheat alongside the Canning River near [[Kelmscott, Western Australia|Kelmscott]]. One of the men, John Thomas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimberly|first=W.B.|title=History of West Australia|year=1897|pages=78–79|archivedate=16 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316195308/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_West_Australia/Chapter_9|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_West_Australia/Chapter_9}}&lt;/ref&gt; escaped, but the other, William Gaze, was wounded and later died as a result.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}} The settlement declared Yagan an outlaw and offered a reward of £20 for his capture. He avoided capture until early October 1832. A group of fishermen enticed Yagan and two companions into their boat, then pushed off into deep water.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}} The fishermen took the three Noongar men to the Perth guardhouse, from which they were transferred to the [[Round House (Western Australia)|Round House]] at [[Fremantle]]. Yagan was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of settler [[Robert Lyon (Australian settler)|Robert Lyon]]. Arguing that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, Lyon said Yagan should not be considered a criminal but a [[prisoner of war]] and suggested he should be treated as such.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}} At the recommendation of [[John Septimus Roe]], the [[Surveyor-General of Western Australia]], Yagan and his men were exiled on [[Carnac Island]] under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}}{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=36}}

Lyon thought he could teach Yagan British ways and convert him to Christianity. He hoped to gain his cooperation and use his tribal stature to persuade the Noongar to accept colonial authority. Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=81}} After a month, Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an unattended [[dinghy]] and rowing to [[Woodman Point, Western Australia|Woodman Point]] on the mainland. The Government did not pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=81}}{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|pp=38–39}}

In January 1833 two Noongar, Gyallipert and Manyat, visited Perth from [[King George Sound]],{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=229}} where relations between settlers and natives were amicable. Two settlers, Richard [Robert?] Dale and George Smythe, arranged for the men to meet a party of local Noongar to encourage friendly relations in the Swan River Colony. On 26 January Yagan led a group of ten formally armed Noongars in greeting the two men near Lake Monger.{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=40}}{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} The men exchanged weapons and held a ''[[corroboree]]'', though the groups did not appear to share a language. Yagan and Gyallipert competed at spear throwing.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} As an example of his prowess, Yagan struck a walking stick from a distance of 25&amp;nbsp;metres.{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=40}}

Gyallipert and Manyat remained in Perth for some time. On 3 March, Yagan obtained permission to hold another corroboree, this time in the Post Office garden in Perth. The Perth and King George Sound men met at dusk, chalked their bodies, and performed a number of dances including a [[kangaroo]] hunt dance. ''[[The Perth Gazette]]'' wrote that Yagan "was master of ceremonies and acquitted himself with infinite grace and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article642172 |title=Native Corrobory at Perth |newspaper=[[The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal]] |date=16 March 1833 |accessdate=6 October 2013 |page=42 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=41}}

During February and March, Yagan was involved in a series of minor conflicts with settlers. In February William Watson complained that Yagan had pushed open his door, demanded a gun, and taken [[handkerchief]]s. Watson had to give him and his companions flour and bread. The following month, Yagan was among a group who received biscuits from a military contingent under Lieutenant Norcott; when Norcott tried to restrict his supply, Yagan threatened him with his spear.&lt;ref name="perthgazMar21833"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article642195 |title=The Soldier Speared at Clarence |newspaper=[[The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal]] |date=2 March 1833 |accessdate=6 October 2013 |page=34 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Yagan was with a group of Noongar who entered Watson's house while he was away. The group left after Watson's wife called on neighbours for help.{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=41}} The next day Captain Ellis lectured the Noongar about their behaviour. The frequent incidents prompted ''The Perth Gazette'' to remark on "the reckless daring of this desperado who sets his life at a pin's fee&amp;nbsp;... For the most trivial offence&amp;nbsp; ... he would take the life of any man who provoked him. He is at the head and front of any mischief."&lt;ref name="perthgazMar21833"/&gt;

===Wanted dead or alive===
On the night of 29 April, a party of Noongar broke into a Fremantle store to steal flour{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=41}} and they were shot at by the caretaker Peter Chidlow. Domjum, a brother of Yagan, was badly injured and died in jail a few days later. The rest of the party moved from Fremantle to [[Preston Point, Western Australia|Preston Point]], where Yagan reportedly vowed vengeance for the death. Between 50 and 60 Noongar gathered at [[Bull Creek, Western Australia|Bull Creek]], where they met a party of settlers who were loading carts with provisions.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=82}} Later that day, the group ambushed the lead cart, killing two settlers, Tom and John Velvick. Tribal law required only a single death for vengeance. Some historians have speculated that the Velvicks were targeted because they had previously been convicted for assaulting Aboriginal people and coloured seamen.{{sfn|Green|1979|p=3}}{{sfn|Green|1984|p=84}} [[Alexandra Hasluck]] has also argued that stealing provisions was an important motive in the attack,{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=41}} but this has been refuted elsewhere.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=82}}

For the killing of the Velvicks, the Lieutenant-Governor [[Frederick Irwin]] declared Yagan, Midgegooroo and Munday to be outlaws, offering rewards of £20 each for the capture of Midgegooroo and Munday, and a reward of £30 for Yagan's capture, dead or alive.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} Munday successfully appealed against his proscription.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=84}} Midgegooroo, Yagan and their group immediately moved from their territory north towards the Helena Valley.{{sfn|Green|1984|pp=84–85}} On 17 May, Midgegooroo was captured on the Helena River. After a brief, informal trial, he was executed by [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]]. Yagan remained at large for over two months.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}}{{sfn|Green|1984|p=86}}

Late in May, [[George Fletcher Moore]] reported seeing Yagan on his property and talking with him in [[pidgin]] English. Moore wrote in the ''Perth Gazette'':
{{quote|Yagan stepped forward and leaning with his left hand on my shoulder while he gesticulated with the right, delivered a sort of recitation, looking earnestly in my face. I regret I could not understand it, I thought from the tone and manner that the purport was this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You came to our country&amp;nbsp;— you have driven us from our haunts, and disturbed us in our occupations. As we walk in our own country we are fired upon by the white men; why should the white men treat us so?"&lt;ref name="Gazette1June1833-2"&gt;{{cite news |title=From a correspondent |first=George Fletcher |last=Moore |authorlink=George Fletcher Moore |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:PerthGazette_1833_06_01_2.jpg |work=[[Perth Gazette]] |location=[[Perth, Western Australia]] |id= |page=87 |date=1 June 1833 |accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore 1884"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Since Moore had little knowledge of Yagan's native language, the historian Hasluck suggests that this account is probably more indicative of "a feeling of conscience on the part of the white men" than an accurate rendering of Yagan's state of mind.{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=44}}}}

Yagan asked Moore whether Midgegooroo was dead or alive. Moore gave no reply, but a servant answered that Midgegooroo was a prisoner on Carnac Island. Yagan warned, "White man shoot Midgegooroo, Yagan kill three."&lt;ref name="Moore 1884"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moore, George Fletcher|year=1884|title=[[Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia|Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia, and also a Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines]]| pages=191–192 |location=London | publisher=M.

He later wrote, "The truth is, every one wishes him taken, but no one likes to be the captor&amp;nbsp;... there is something in his daring which one is forced to admire."&lt;ref name="Moore 1884"/&gt;

===Death===
[[Image:Yagan-Belhus.png|thumb|Map of skirmish area showing gravesite and Henry Bull's mill]]
On 11 July 1833, two teenage brothers named William and James Keates were herding cattle along the Swan River north of [[Guildford, Western Australia|Guildford]] when a group of Noongar approached while en route to collect flour rations from [[Henry Bull (settler)|Henry Bull]]'s house.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} The Keates brothers suggested Yagan remain with them to avoid arrest.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} While he was staying with them during the morning, the brothers decided to kill the warrior and claim the reward.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} When the natives were ready to depart, the Keateses took their last opportunity. William Keates shot Yagan,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=231}} and James shot Heegan, another native, in the act of throwing his spear. The brothers ran away, but other Noongar overtook William and speared him to death. James escaped by swimming the river. Shortly afterward he returned with a party of armed settlers from Bull's estate.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=87}}{{sfn|Green|1979|p=4}}

When the party of settlers arrived, they found Yagan dead and Heegan dying.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=231}} Heegan "was groaning and his brains were partly out when the party came, and whether humanity or brutality, a man put a gun to his head and blew it to pieces."{{sfn|Green|1984|p=87}} The settlers cut Yagan's head from his body, and skinned his back to obtain his tribal markings as a trophy. They buried the bodies a short distance away.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=231}}

James Keates claimed the reward, but his conduct was widely criticised.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=231}} ''The Perth Gazette'' referred to Yagan's killing as "a wild and treacherous act&amp;nbsp;... it is revolting to hear this lauded as a meritorious deed."&lt;ref name="Perth Gazette 18330713"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article641981 |title=THE NATIVES. |newspaper=[[The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal]] |date=20 July 1833 |accessdate=6 October 2013 |page=114 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]] understood that "he was killed in self-defence by the young lad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38887581 |title=Aboriginal Perth |author=Daisy M.

==Yagan's head==

===Exhibition and burial===
[[Image:Yagan's head from Moore's diary.png|thumb|A portion of [[George Fletcher Moore]]'s handwritten diary, showing sketches of Yagan's head{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=232}}]]
Yagan's head was initially taken to Henry Bull's house. Moore saw it there and sketched the head a number of times in his unpublished, handwritten diary, commenting that "possibly it may yet figure in some museum at home."{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=231}} The head was preserved by smoking.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=232}}

In September 1833, [[Frederick Irwin|Governor Irwin]] sailed for London, partly to give his own account of the events leading up to the killing. This was an unusual measure, especially given his regiment was about to leave for a tour of duty in India. The Colonial Office indicated satisfaction with Irwin's administration of the colony.&lt;ref name="Cook 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cook | first = Karen Severud | year = 2003 | title = The Secret Agenda of Western Australian Explorer, Robert Dale (1809–1853) | journal=The Globe | issue = 54 | pages = 23–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelling with Irwin was Ensign [[Robert Dale]], who had somehow acquired Yagan's head. According to the historian Paul Turnbull, Dale appears to have persuaded Irwin to let him have the head as an "anthropological curiosity".&lt;ref name="Turnbull 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Turnbull | first = Paul | year = 1998 | title = "Outlawed Subjects": The Procurement and Scientific Uses of Australian Aboriginal Heads, ca. 1803–1835 | journal=Eighteenth-Century Life | volume = 22|issue = 1|pages = 156–171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in London, Dale tried to sell the head to scientists, approaching a number of [[anatomy|anatomists]] and [[phrenology|phrenologists]]. His price of ₤20 failed to find a buyer, so he made an agreement with [[Thomas Pettigrew]] for the exclusive use of the head for 18 months.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} Pettigrew, a surgeon and antiquarian,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} was well known in the London social scene for holding private parties at which he unrolled and [[autopsy|autopsied]] [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=An interview with Egyptologist Salima Ikram |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/mummy/ikram.html |title=NOVA &amp;#124; The Mummy Who Would Be King &amp;#124; The Afterlife |publisher=PBS |date=17 November 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He displayed the head on a table in front of a [[Panoramic View of King George's Sound, Part of the Colony of Swan River|panoramic view of King George Sound]] reproduced from Dale's sketches.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} For effect, the head was adorned with a fresh corded headband and feathers of the [[red-tailed black cockatoo]].

[[Image:Yagan.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Yagan'' by [[George Cruikshank]].&lt;br /&gt;This portrait was painted from observations of Yagan's severed head, which had shrunk substantially during preservation by smoking. [[George Fletcher Moore]] said it bore little resemblance to the living Yagan, whose face was "plump, with a burly-headed look about it".&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1884, [https://archive.org/stream/diarytenyearsev00moorgoog#page/n310/mode/2up p. 289]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Pettigrew had the head examined by a phrenologist. Examination was considered difficult because of the large [[Bone fracture|fracture]] across the back of the head caused by the gunshot. His conclusions were consistent with contemporary European opinion of Indigenous Australians.&lt;ref name="Turnbull 1998"/&gt; Dale published these in a pamphlet entitled ''[[Descriptive Account of the Panoramic View &amp;c. of King George's Sound and the Adjacent Country]]'',&lt;ref name="Dale 1834"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dale, Robert|year=1834|title=Descriptive Account of the Panoramic View &amp;amp;c. of King George's Sound and the Adjacent Country|location=London|publisher=J. Cross &amp; R. Havell|authorlink=Robert Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Pettigrew encouraged his guests to buy as a [[souvenir]] of their evening. The frontispiece of the pamphlet was a hand-coloured [[aquatint]] print of Yagan's head by the artist [[George Cruikshank]].{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}}

Early in October 1835, Yagan's head and the panoramic view were returned to Dale, then living in [[Liverpool]]. On 12 October he presented them to the [[Liverpool Royal Institution]],{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} where the head may have been displayed in a case along with some other preserved heads and wax models illustrating cranial anatomy.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} In 1894 the Institution's collections were dispersed, and Yagan's head was lent to the [[Liverpool Museum]]; it is thought not to have been put on display there.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} By the 1960s Yagan's head was badly deteriorated. In April 1964 the museum decided to dispose of it. It arranged burial of the head on 10 April 1964, together with a [[Peru]]vian mummy and a [[Māori people|Māori]] head. They were buried in [[Everton Cemetery]]'s General Section 16, grave number 296.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|pp=233–234}} In later years a number of burials were made around the grave. For example, in 1968 a local hospital buried directly over the box, 20 [[stillbirth|stillborn]] babies and two infants who died soon after birth.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=234}}

===Lobbying for repatriation===
For many years beginning in the early 1980s,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=235}} a number of Noongar groups sought the return of Yagan's head to Australia.
{{quote|It is Aboriginal belief that because Yagan's skeletal remains are incomplete, his spirit is earthbound. The uniting of his head and torso will immediately set his spirit free to continue its eternal journey.&lt;ref name="Colbung 1996"/&gt;}}

At the time, there was no historical trail for the head after Pettigrew passed it on. Tribal elders entrusted the Aboriginal leader [[Ken Colbung]] with the search.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=235}} In the early 1990s, Colbung enlisted the aid of [[University of London]] [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Peter Ucko]]. One of Ucko's researchers, Cressida Fforde, &lt;!--was funded by the [[Government of Australia]] to--&gt; conducted a literature search for information on the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/now_showing/first_australians/resistance/yagan/repatriation/ |title=National Museum of Australia – Repatriation |publisher=Nma.gov.au |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/hitech-fbi-tools-to-retrieve-aborigine-chiefs-head-1253531.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107123910/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/hitech-fbi-tools-to-retrieve-aborigine-chiefs-head-1253531.html|archivedate=7 November 2012|title=Hi-tech FBI tools to retrieve aborigine chief's head – News |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=1 June 1997 |accessdate=10 July 2010  | first=Ian | last=Burrell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fforde successfully traced the head in December 1993.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|pp=42, 235}} The following April, Colbung applied to exhume the remains under Section 25 of the [[Burial Act 1857]].{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=235}} [[Home Office]] regulations required [[next of kin]] consent before disturbing the remains of the 22 infants. Colbung's solicitors requested waiver of this condition on grounds that the exhumation would be of great personal significance to Yagan's living relatives, and great national importance to Australia.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=235}}

Meanwhile, divisions in the Noongar community in Perth began to develop. Some elders questioned Colbung's role and one Noongar registered a complaint with the [[Liverpool City Council]] over his involvement. Media reports indicated acrimonious debate within the Noongar community about who had the best cultural qualifications to take possession of the head.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|pp=235–236}} The academic Hannah McGlade claims that these divisions were largely manufactured by the media, particularly ''[[The West Australian]]'', which "aimed to and successfully represented the Nyungar community in terms of disharmony and dissent". She alleges that one ''West'' reporter contacted Noongar who were known to be in disagreement, and quoted one to the other, so as to elicit provocative responses. The disputes were "trumpeted" by ''The West'', allowing it to "preach" against the infighting.&lt;ref name="McGlade 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Hannah | last = McGlade | year = 1998 | title = The repatriation of Yagan: A story of manufacturing dissent | journal=Law Text Culture | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 245–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July a public meeting was held in Perth. All parties agreed to put aside their differences and co-operate to ensure that the repatriation was a "national success".{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=236}} A Yagan Steering Committee was established to co-ordinate the repatriation, and Colbung's application was allowed to proceed.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=236}}  In January 1995 the Home Office advised Colbung that it was unable to waive the requirement to obtain next of kin consent for the exhumation. It contacted the five relatives whose addresses were known, and received unconditional consent from only one. Accordingly, on 30 June 1995, Colbung and the other interested parties were advised that the application for exhumation had been rejected.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=236}}

Meeting on 21 September, the Yagan Steering Committee decided to lobby Australian and British politicians for support. In 1997 Colbung was invited to visit the United Kingdom at the British government's expense{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=236}} and he arrived on 20 May. His visit attracted substantial media coverage,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=236}} and increased the political pressure on the British Government. He secured the support of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[John Howard]], after [[gatecrasher (person)|gate crashing]] the Prime Minister's June visit to the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=237}}

===Exhumation===
{{Main article|Exhumation of Yagan's head}}
[[Image:Yagan's grave surface EM data.png|thumb|300px|A horizontal colour contour map of ground conductivity of Yagan's grave site, showing an anomaly in the electromagnetic signature caused by metal artefacts buried with Yagan's head]]
While Colbung was in the United Kingdom, Martin and Richard Bates were engaged to undertake a [[geophysics|geophysical]] survey of the grave site. Using [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[ground penetrating radar]] techniques, they identified an approximate position of the box that suggested it could be accessed from the side via the adjacent plot. A report of the survey was passed to the Home Office, prompting further discussions between the British and Australian Governments.&lt;ref name="Bates 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeological Geophysics: Yagan's Head|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_sgg/personal/crblink/web/arch/yagan.htm|accessdate=14 December 2005|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050312073041/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_sgg/personal/crblink/web/arch/yagan.htm |archivedate = 12 March 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of concern to the Home Office were an undisclosed number of letters that it had received objecting to Colbung's involvement in the repatriation process; it therefore sought assurances from the Australian Government that Colbung was a correct applicant.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=237}} In response Colbung asked his elders to ask the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC) to tell the British Home Office that he was the correct applicant. ATSIC then convened a meeting in Perth at which it was again resolved that Colbung's application could proceed.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=237}}

Colbung continued to press for the exhumation, asking that it be performed before the 164th anniversary of Yagan's death on 11 July, so that the anniversary could be the occasion of a celebration.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}} His request was not met, and on the anniversary of Yagan's death, Colbung conducted a short memorial service at the burial plot in Everton. He returned to Australia empty-handed on 15 July.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}}

The [[exhumation of Yagan's head]] eventually proceeded, without Colbung's knowledge,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}} by excavating six feet down the side of the grave, then tunnelling horizontally to the location of the box. Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a [[forensics|forensic]] [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] from the [[University of Bradford]] positively identified the [[human skull|skull]] as Yagan's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew's report.&lt;ref name="Bates 2005"/&gt;{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}} The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}}

===Repatriation===
On 27 August 1997, a delegation of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung, [[Robert Bropho]], Richard Wilkes and Mingli Wanjurri-Nungala arrived in the UK to collect Yagan's head. The delegation was to have been larger, but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}} The handover of Yagan's skull was further delayed, however, when a Noongar named Corrie Bodney applied to the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]] for an injunction against the handover. Claiming that his family group has sole responsibility for Yagan's remains, Bodney declared the exhumation illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head's exhumation and removal to Australia.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}} On 29 August, Justice Henry Wallwork rejected the injunction application, on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements, and on the evidence of another Noongar elder (Albert Corunna, who claimed to be a closer relation of Yagan) and anthropologist Pat Baines, both of whom refuted Bodney's claim to sole responsibility.&lt;ref name="McGlade 1998"/&gt;

Yagan's skull was handed over to the Noongar delegation at a ceremony at [[Liverpool Town Hall]] on 31 August 1997.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], earlier that day:{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} &lt;blockquote&gt;That is how nature goes&amp;nbsp;... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things. And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;Maeder, Jay: [http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/newsreel-article-1.783688 The Newsreel: The Long And Winding Road], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', 4 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}}

Throughout the repatriation process, many sections of the international media treated the story as a joke. For example, the ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'' ran a story under the headline ''Raiders of the Lost Conk'', in which Yagan's head was referred to as a "pickled curio", and Colbung's actions were treated as a publicity stunt.&lt;ref name="Shoemaker 2000"/&gt;

===Preparations for reburial===
On its return to Perth, Yagan's head continued to be a source of controversy and conflict.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} Responsibility for reburial of the head was given to a "Committee for the Reburial of Yagan's Kaat", headed by Richard Wilkes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, Richard [http://www.dia.wa.gov.au/Documents/News/Yagan%20Memorial%20Park/YMP_Newsletter_Feb24.pdf A Message from the Chairperson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216230719/http://dia.wa.gov.au/Documents/News/Yagan%20Memorial%20Park/YMP_Newsletter_Feb24.pdf |date=16 February 2011 }} Yagan Memorial Park Newsletter, February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reburial was delayed by disputes between elders over the burial location, mainly due to uncertainty of the whereabouts of the rest of his body,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} and disagreement about the importance of burying the head with the body.

A number of attempts were made to locate the remains of Yagan's body, which were believed to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of [[Belhus, Western Australia|Belhus]].&lt;ref name="DIA 2009"&gt;{{cite news | title = Yagan Memorial Park | date = November 2009 | newspaper = DIA Newsletter | issue = 1 | publisher = Department of Indigenous Affairs, Government of Western Australia | page = 4 | url = http://purl.slwa.wa.gov.au/download/slwa_b2920804_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[remote sensing]] survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that [[Dreamtime]] spirits can reunite the remains.&lt;ref name="Lampathakis 2005"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lampathakis|first=Paul|title=Hunt for Yagan narrows|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=6 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the Western Australian Planning Commission and the [[Department of Aboriginal Affairs]] jointly published a document entitled ''Yagan's Gravesite Master Plan'', which discussed "matters of ownership, management, development and future use" of the property on which Yagan's remains are believed to be buried. Under consideration was the possibility of turning the site into an Indigenous burial site, to be managed by the Metropolitan Cemeteries Board.

Yagan's head spent some time in storage in a bank vault before being handed over to forensics experts who reconstructed a model from it. After that it was held in storage at Western Australia's state [[morgue|mortuary]]. Plans to re-bury the head were repeatedly deferred, causing ongoing conflict between Noongar groups.&lt;ref name="Philip 2006"&gt;Philip, Martin (2006). "Yagan waits for final resting place."

"Head of Nyoongar warrior Yagan will be finally laid to rest in Swan Valley]".

==Legacy==
The repatriation of Yagan's head increased the Aboriginal leader's notability. He is considered a famous historical figure throughout Australia,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=234}} with material about him appearing in such publications as the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'',&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography | last = Hasluck | first = Alexandra | authorlink = Alexandra Hasluck |year= 1967|title =Yagan ( – 1833)| id = A020578b.htm | accessdate =6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Western Australia's school [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name="CCoWA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Aboriginal and intercultural studies | url = http://newwace.curriculum.wa.edu.au/docs/COS_docs/171791_7_1.pdf |format=PDF| publisher=[[Curriculum Council of Western Australia]] | accessdate =6 March 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080411053559/http://newwace.curriculum.wa.edu.au/docs/COS_docs/171791_7_1.pdf |archivedate = 11 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of greatest significance, however, to the Noongar people,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=234}} for whom he is "a revered, cherished and heroic individual&amp;nbsp;... patriot and visionary hero of WA's South-West".&lt;ref name="Colbung 1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colbung, Ken|year=1996|title=Yagan: The Swan River "Settlement"|publisher=Australia Council for the Arts|authorlink=Ken Colbung}}&lt;/ref&gt; The return of his head was likened by some Indigenous Australians to the November 1993 ceremonial repatriation from [[Gallipoli]] of Australia's [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|unknown soldier]].&lt;ref name="Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 2001"&gt;[[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] (2001).

[[Image:Alas Poor Yagan (2 panels).jpg|thumb|400px|The final two frames of [[Dean Alston]]'s 1997 cartoon ''[[Alas Poor Yagan]]'']]
On 6 September 1997 ''[[The West Australian]]'' published a [[Dean Alston]] [[cartoon]] entitled ''[[Alas Poor Yagan]]'',&lt;ref name="Alston 1997"&gt;[[Dean Alston|Alston, Dean]] (1997). [[Alas Poor Yagan]]. ''[[The West Australian]]'', 6 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; which was critical of the fact that the return of Yagan's head had become a source of conflict between Noongars instead of fostering unity.&lt;ref name="Federal Court of Australia 2004"/&gt; The cartoon was interpreted by some as insulting aspects of Noongar culture, and casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of Indigenous Australians with mixed racial heritage.&lt;ref name="Federal Court of Australia 2004"/&gt; The content of the cartoon offended many Indigenous Australians, and a group of Noongar elders complained about the cartoon to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]].&lt;ref name="Federal Court of Australia 2004"/&gt; The commission ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to Noongar beliefs but was not in breach of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]] because it was "an artistic work" that was published "reasonably and in good faith", and was therefore exempt.&lt;ref name="Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 2001"/&gt; This ruling was upheld on appeal by the [[Federal Court of Australia]],&lt;ref name="Federal Court of Australia 2004"&gt;[[Federal Court of Australia]] (2004).

===Statue===
From the mid-1970s, members of the Noongar community lobbied for the erection of a [[statue]] of Yagan as part of the [[WAY 1979]] sesquicentennial celebrations. Their requests were refused, however, after then [[Premier of Western Australia]] [[Charles Court|Sir Charles Court]] was advised by one prominent historian that Yagan was not important enough to warrant a statue.&lt;ref name="Inglis 1998"&gt;{{cite book | first = K. S. | last = Inglis | year = 1998 | title = Sacred Places | publisher=Melbourne University Press | isbn = 0-522-84976-8 | page = 448 | quote = [Hasluck] advised the states anti-Labor government not to agree. University historians pleaded Yagan's cause in vain.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbung claims "Court was more interested in spending tax payers' money on refurbishing the badly neglected burial place of [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|Captain James Stirling]], WA's first governor."&lt;ref name="Colbung 1996"/&gt; Despite this setback, the Noongar community persisted, establishing a Yagan Committee and running a number of fund-raising drives. Eventually, sufficient funds were collected to allow the commissioning of Australian sculptor [[Robert Hitchcock]] to create a statue. The result was a life-size statue in [[bronze]], depicting Yagan standing naked with a spear held across his shoulders. Hitchcock's statue of Yagan was officially opened by Yagan Committee chairperson Elizabeth Hanson on 11 September 1984. It stands on [[Heirisson Island]] in the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] near Perth.

In 1997, within a week of the return of Yagan's head to Perth, vandals beheaded the statue using an [[angle grinder]]. Soon after a replacement head was installed and it too was detached and stolen. Credit for the act was anonymously claimed by a "British loyalist" as an act of retaliation for Colbung's comments about [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} The [[Western Australia Police]] did not succeed in identifying the vandals, nor in recovering the heads, and deemed it infeasible to have the statue fenced off or placed under guard.&lt;ref name="Phillips 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1998 | title = Western Australia: July to December 1977 | journal=[[Australian Journal of Politics &amp; History]] | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 270–285 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8497.00018 | author=[[Harry C. J. Phillips|Phillips, Harry]] |author2=Black, David |authorlink2=David Black (historian) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentary on the beheadings varied widely. One column in ''The West Australia'' found humour in them, referring to the head as a "bonce" and a "noggin", and finished with a pun on "skullduggery".&lt;ref name="Muecke 2004"/&gt; Stephen Muecke calls this the "satirical trivialising of Aboriginal concerns";&lt;ref name="Muecke 2004"&gt;{{cite book | first = Stephen | last = Muecke | year = 2004 |pages=39–42 |title = Ancient and Modern: Time, Culture and Indigenous Philosophy | publisher=UNSW Press | isbn = 0-86840-786-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Adam Shoemaker writes "This is the stuff of light humour and comic relief. There is no sense of the decapitation as being an act of vandalism, even less that it could have been motivated by malevolence&amp;nbsp;... [T]he piece has a definite authorising function".&lt;ref name="Shoemaker 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Adam | last = Shoemaker | year = 2000 | title = The Headless State | journal=Griffith Law Review | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 358–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, academic analysis has treated the act with much more gravity. In 2007, for example, David Martin described the decapitation as "an act which speaks not only to the continuance of white settler racism, but also to the power of mimesis to invigorate our modern memorials and monuments with a life of their own."&lt;ref name="Martin 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | first = David | last = Martin | year = 2007 | title = Of monuments and masks: historiography in the time of curiosity's ruin | journal=Postcolonial studies | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 311–320 | doi = 10.1080/13688790701488197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly]] [[Janet Woollard]] called for the statue's [[intimate part|genitalia]] to be covered up, but nothing was done. In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again called for the statue's groin to be covered, on the grounds that such a depiction would be more historically accurate, as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under consideration is the creation of a new statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.&lt;ref name="Kent 2005"&gt;Kent, Melissa (2005).

In 2002, the South African-born Australian poet [[John Mateer]] published his fourth collection of poems, entitled ''Loanwords''.&lt;ref name="Mateer 2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mateer, John|year=2002|title=Loanwords|location=Fremantle, Western Australia | publisher=Fremantle Arts Centre Press|isbn=1-86368-359-3|authorlink=John Mateer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is divided into four sections, of which the third, ''In the Presence of a Severed Head'', has Yagan as its subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=J.
