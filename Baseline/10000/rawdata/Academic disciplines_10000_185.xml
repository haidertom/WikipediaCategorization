[[File:ADVENT-engine.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Cut-away view of a prospective ADVENT engine]]
The '''ADaptive Versatile ENgine Technology''' (or '''ADVENT''') program is an [[aircraft engine]] development program run by the [[United States Air Force]] with the goal of developing an efficient [[variable cycle engine]] for next generation military aircraft in the 20,000&amp;nbsp;lbf (89&amp;nbsp;kN) thrust class.

==Objective==
The objective of ADVENT is to develop an engine that is optimized for several design points, rather than the traditional single point. Instead of having an engine that is designed solely for high speed (like many current fighter engines are) or for high [[fuel efficiency]] (like many current commercial engines are), the final ADVENT engine would be designed to operate at both those conditions.&lt;ref name="wppress"&gt;Barr, Larine. [http://www.wpafb.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123048376 "Air Force plans to develop revolutionary engine"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605114250/http://www.wpafb.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123048376 |date=June 5, 2011 }}. US Air Force press release, 11 April 2007, Accessed: 20 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific goals include reducing average fuel consumption by 25% and reducing the temperature of cooling air produced by the engine.&lt;ref name="rrpress"&gt;[http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/release/3/109107/rolls_royce-selected-for-advent-demonstrator.html "Rolls Royce Selected for ADVENT Demonstrator"], Press Release, 18 Oct 2009, Accessed 20 Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The ADVENT engine was originally targeted at the Air Force's 2018 [[Next-Generation Bomber]], but uncertainty in that program has led Rolls-Royce (RR), one of the primary developers involved with the project, to predict that the ADVENT engine will be better suited for a potential 2020 engine upgrade for the [[F-35 Lightning II]]. RR, who is partnered with GE Aviation on the embattled [[General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136|F136]] alternate engine for the F-35, has suggested that the ADVENT development contracts are all the more reason to continue the F136, as any engine upgrade from [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] (makers of the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney F135|F135]] engine currently used in the F-35) would have to be separately funded, either internally or to additional government cost.&lt;ref&gt;Trimble, Steven. [http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/06/11/327771/rolls-royce-f136-survival-is-key-for-major-f-35-engine.html "Rolls Royce: F136 Survival is key for major F-35 engine upgrade"] ''[[Flight International]]'', 11 June 2009, Accessed: 20 Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ADVENT program is one of several related development projects being pursued under the Air Force's [[Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines]] (VAATE) program. After being announced in April 2007, [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] and [[GE Aviation]] were awarded Phase I contracts in August 2007 to explore concepts, develop and test critical components, and begin preliminary designs of an engine.&lt;ref name="wppress"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trimble, Steven. [http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/09/25/217104/pratt-whitney-loses-second-bid-for-usaf-engine-technology.html "Pratt &amp; Whitney Loses Second Bit for USAF Technology Contracts"]. Flightglobal, 25 September 2007. Accessed: 20 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Rolls-Royce was awarded the Phase II contract to continue component testing and integrate the developed technologies into a technology demonstrator engine.&lt;ref name="rrpress"/&gt; GE Aviation was also awarded funds to continue development of their technology demonstration core, which was unexpected as the ADVENT program had originally called for a single contractor to be selected for Phase II.&lt;ref&gt;Trimble, Steve. [http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/10/15/333519/corrected-usaf-selects-general-electric-and-rolls-royce-to-continue-advent-work.html "USAF Selects General Electric and Rolls-Royce to Continue ADVENT work"]. ''Flight International'', 15 October 2009. Accessed: 20 Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

USAF officials have denied that the program is an attempt to create a backup engine program for the F-35.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Austin. [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0512/76408.html "Lawmakers suspect jet engine end run."] ''Politico'', 16 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the threat of the GE/RR F136, Pratt &amp; Whitney has funded an adaptive fan variant of its F135, that may qualify for the follow-on ''Adaptive Engine Technology Development'' (AETD) program under the US Air Force Research Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, Dave. [http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/farnborough-pratt-to-test-new-adaptive-fan-f135-variant-next-year-374283/ "FARNBOROUGH: Pratt to test new adaptive fan F135 variant next year."] ''Flight International'', 12 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, GE was chosen to continue its ADVENT work into the AETD program.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Robert. [http://americanmachinist.com/news/usaf-taps-ge-develop-new-jet-engines "USAF Taps GE to Develop New Jet Engines."] ''American Machinist'', 21 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney were selected over Rolls Royce to continue the AETD program to mature fuel-efficient, high-thrust powerplants.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Graham.  [http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/asd_09_18_2012_p01-02-496815.xml "Pratt In, Rolls Out, GE Stays On AFRL Advanced Engine Demo."] ''Aviation Week'', 18 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Operational testing of the engine was expected to begin in 2013.&lt;ref name="rrpress"/&gt;

In 2014, [[Chuck Hagel]] requested a $1 billion investment in the engine technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140224/NEWS05/302240043 |title=Pentagon, Air Force doubles down on engine technology |last1=Mehta |first1=Aaron |date=24 February 2014 |website= militarytimes.com |publisher=Gannett Government Media |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|government official]] has warned that [[Budget sequestration in 2013|sequestration]] risks ending the program.&lt;ref name=aw2015-04&gt;{{cite news |first=Graham |last=Warwick |url=http://aviationweek.com/technology/budget-cuts-future-weapons-could-have-long-term-impact |title=Budget Cuts To Future Weapons Could Have Long-Term Impact |work=[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]] |date=3 April 2015 |accessdate=8 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Pratt wrapped up tests of their three stream engine with a F135 core, which may be used on the Penetrating Counter Air (PCA) platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/air-force-association/2017/09/18/pratt-whitney-completes-tests-for-new-adaptive-engine-that-could-power-future-fighter/ |title=Eyeing the future fighter, Pratt &amp; Whitney hits milestone with new adaptive engine |last1=Insinna  |first1= Valerie |date=18 September 2017 |website=www.defensenews.com |publisher=Sightline Media Group |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is most known for the biblical narrative in which she was summoned by King David, who had seen her bathing and lusted after her. She was the mother of [[Solomon]], who succeeded David as king, making her the [[Queen mother]].

==Biblical narrative==
[[File:David begehrt Batseba 17Jh.jpg|thumb|[[David]] seducing Bathsheba. Anonymous 17th century painting.]]
Bathsheba was the daughter of [[Eliam]] ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|11:3|HE}}, [[Ammiel]] in {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|3:5|HE}}). An Eliam is mentioned in {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|23:34|HE}} as the son of [[Ahithophel]], who is described as the [[Gilon]]ite. Bathsheba was the wife of [[Uriah the Hittite]].

[[File:Bethsabée, by Jean-Léon Gérôme.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]'s depiction of Bathsheba bathing watched by David.]]
David's first interactions with Bathsheba are described in {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|11|NASB}}, and are omitted in the [[Books of Chronicles]]. David, while walking on the roof of his palace, saw a very beautiful woman bathing. He ordered enquiries and found out that she was Bathsheba, wife of Uriah. He desired her and later made her pregnant. The text in the Bible does not explicitly state whether Bathsheba consented to sex.&lt;ref name=Campbell2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Antony F. Campbell|title=2 Samuel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgmyJVkci14C&amp;pg=PA104|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B.

In an effort to conceal his sin, David summoned Uriah from the army (with whom he was on campaign) in the hope that Uriah would have sex with her and think that the child belongs to him. But Uriah was unwilling to violate the ancient kingdom rule applying to warriors in active service.&lt;ref name="Smith1889"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Robertson Smith|title=Lectures on the Religion of the Semites: First Series. The Fundamental Institutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPANAQAAIAAJ|year=1889|publisher=A. and C. Black|page=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than go home to his own bed, he preferred to remain with the palace troops.

After repeated efforts to convince Uriah to have sex with Bathsheba the king gave the order to his general, [[Joab]], that Uriah should be placed on the front lines of the battle, where Uriah would be more likely to die. David had Uriah himself carry the message that led to his death. After Uriah has been killed, David married Bathsheba.

David's action was displeasing to the Lord, who sent [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan the prophet]] to reprove the king. After relating the parable of the rich man who took away the one little ewe lamb of his poor neighbor ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|12:1–6|KJV}}), and exciting the king's anger against the unrighteous act, the prophet applied the case directly to David's action with regard to Bathsheba. The king at once confessed his sin and expressed sincere repentance. Bathsheba's first child by David was struck with a severe illness and died, unnamed, a few days after birth, which the king accepted as his punishment. Nathan also noted that David's house would be punished for Uriah's murder. 

Bathsheba later gave birth to David's son [[Solomon]]. In David's old age, Bathsheba secured the succession to the throne by Solomon instead of David's elder surviving sons by his other wives, such as [[Chileab]] ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:1–6|HE}}), [[Adonijah]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|1:11–31|HE}}) and others ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:1–6|HE}}). David's punishment came to pass years later when one of David's much-loved sons, [[Absalom]], led an insurrection that plunged the kingdom into [[civil war]]. Moreover, to manifest his claim to be the new king, Absalom had sexual intercourse in public with ten of his father's concubines, which could be considered a direct, tenfold divine retribution for David's taking the woman of another man ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|16:20–23|KJV}}).

==Judaism==
=== Relationship to Ahithophel ===
John Gill mentions that in Rabbinic literature Bathsheba is supposed to have been the granddaughter of [[Ahitophel]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/2-samuel-23-34.html|title=2 Samuel 23:34 Commentary – John Gill's Exposition of the Bible|website=Bible Study Tools|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is that she is called the daughter of Eliam in 2 Sam. 11:3, and 2 Sam 23:34 mentions an Eliam, the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, one of David's "[[David's Mighty Warriors|thirty]]". The assumption is then that these two Eliams are the same person. This would then explain why Ahitophel, one of David's chief advisers, chose the side of [[Absalom]] during his rebellion.

However in 1 Chronicles the names are very different: Bathsheba is called Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel in 1 Chronicles 3:5. And in the list of David's thirty in 1 Chronicles 11:36 we have Ahijah the Pelonite.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some have also questioned whether Ahithophel would have been old enough to have a granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/A/ahithophel.html|title=Ahithophel in the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia.|website=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Online|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In rabbinic literature ===
Bathsheba was the granddaughter of [[Ahithophel]], David's famous counselor. The [[Haggadah]] states that Ahithophel was misled by his knowledge of [[astrology]] into believing himself destined to become king of Israel. He therefore induced Absalom to commit an unpardonable crime ({{bibleverse|2 Sam.|16:21|KJV}}), which sooner or later would have brought with it, according to Jewish law, the penalty of death; the motive for this advice being to remove Absalom, and thus to make a way for himself to the throne. His astrological information had been, however, misunderstood by him; for in reality it only predicted that his granddaughter, Bathsheba, the daughter of his son Eliam, would become queen (Sanh. 101b, YalḲ. Sam. § 150).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/993-ahithophel "Ahitophel", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Midrash]] portrays the influence of [[Satan]] bringing about the sinful relation of David and Bathsheba as follows: Bathsheba was bathing, perhaps behind a screen of wickerwork. Satan is depicted as coming in the disguise of a bird. David, shooting at the bird, strikes the screen, splitting it; thus Bathsheba is revealed in her beauty to David (Sanhedrin 107a).

== Christianity ==
In {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:6}}, "the wife of Uriah" is mentioned as one of the [[ancestors of Jesus]].

Bathsheba is recognized as the archetypal example of the Queen Mother, foreshadowing the role of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|the Blessed Virgin Mary]] as [[Queen of Heaven]]. Bathsheba's son, King Solomon, rises to greet her, bows down in veneration, and furnishes her a seat at his right hand. This demonstrates her exalted status and share in the royal kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Kings 2:19–20|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bathsheba acts as intercessor for her subjects, delivering their petitions to the King: "Pray ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Kings 2:17|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biblical Queenship"&gt;https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/is-marys-queenship-biblical&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingdom of Heaven"&gt;https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/is-there-a-queen-in-the-kingdom-of-heaven-pt-ii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirwin"&gt;Kirwin, George F. ''The Nature of the Queenship of Mary'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossier"&gt;Rossier, Francois. ''L'intercession entre les hommes dans la bible hebraique by Francois Rossier'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sri1"&gt;Sri, Edward. ''Queen Mother: A Biblical Theology of Mary's Queenship'', 2005. pp. 49-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jesus founds the Church, he maintains continuity with his hereditary [[Davidic line|House of David]]: Mary, who is mother of [[Christ the King]], is accorded the highly-favored status in Catholicism as the Queen Mother in the Kingdom of God, and continues to intercede on behalf of the faithful who pray to her.&lt;ref name="Biblical Queenship" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingdom of Heaven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sri2"&gt;Sri, Edward.

== Islam ==
In Islam [[David]] is considered to be a prophet, and some Islamic tradition views the [[Bible]] story as incompatible with the principle of infallibility ([[Ismah]]) of the prophets. A [[hadith]] quoted in [[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)|Tafsir al-Kabir]] and [[Majma' al-Bayan]] expresses that [[Ali bin Abi Talib]] said: "Whoever says that David, has married [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]]'s wife as the legends are narrate, I will punish him twice: one for [[:wiktionary:qazf|qazf]] (falsely accusing someone of adultery) and the other for desecrating the prophethood (defamation of prophet David)".&lt;ref&gt;"عن سعيد بن المسيب أن علي بن أبي طالب  كرم اللّه تعالى وجهه قال: «من حدثكم بحديث داود على ما يرويه القصّاص جلدته مائة و ستين(جلّدته مائة جلدة مضاعفا) و هو حد الفرية على الأنبياء»" ([[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)|Tafsir al-Kabir]], al-Razi, vol. 26, p. 379; [[Ruh al-Ma'ani]], vol. 12, p. 178; Tafsir al-Muraghi, vol. 23, p. 111.)&lt;br /&gt;
"روي عن أمير المؤمنين (ع) أنه قال لا أوتى برجل يزعم أن داود تزوج امرأة أوريا إلا جلدته حدين حدا للنبوة و حدا للإسلام" (Tafsir [[Majma' al-Bayan]], vol 8, p 736.)
"لأنّ المزاعم المذكورة تتّهم من جهة إنسانا مؤمنا بارتكاب عمل محرّم، و من جهة اخرى تنتهك حرمة مقام النبوّة، و من هنا حكم الإمام بجلد من يفتري عليه عليه السّلام مرّتين (كلّ مرّة 80 سوطا)"([[Tafsir Nemooneh]], vol 19, p 257.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hadith narrated from [[Shia]] scholars states that [[Ali Al-Ridha]], during the discussions with the scholars of other religions about prophets' infallibility, asked one of them, "What do you say about David?" he said "David was praying, when a beautiful bird appeared in front of him, and David left his prayer and went after the bird. While David was walking on the roof of his palace, he saw Bathsheba having a bath... so David placed her husband in the front lines of the battlefield, in order to get killed, so that he could marry Bathsheba." [[Ali Al-Ridha]] got upset and said: "[[Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un]], you assign sluggishness in prayer to the prophet of God, and then accuse him of unchastity, and then charge him with the murder of an innocent man!"
He asked "so what is the story of Uriah?" and Ali Al-Ridha said "At that time, women whose husbands passed away or got killed in the war would never get married again (and this was the source of many evils). David was the first person to break this tradition. So after Uriah was incidentally killed in the war, David married his wife, but people could hardly accept this anomalous marriage (and subsequently legends were made about this marriage.)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tafsir Nemooneh]]'', vol. 19, p. 257; [[Oyoun Akhbar Al-Ridha]], vol. 1, p. 154; Amali Saduq, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Massys - David and Bathsheba.JPG|left|thumb|''Bathsheba with David's messenger, as the king watches from his roof'', 1562 [[Jan Massys]]]]

Bathsheba's name appears in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|3:5|NASB}} spelled "Bath-shua", the form becomes merely a variant reading of "Bath-sheba". The passages in which Bath-sheba is mentioned are {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|11:2–12:24|NASB}}, and {{bibleverse|1 Kings|1:2|NASB}}—both of which are parts of the oldest stratum of the books of Samuel and Kings, part of that [[court history of David]], written by someone who stood very near the events and who did not idealize David. The material contained in it is of higher historical value than that in the later strata of these books. Budde later connected it with the [[Jahwist]] document of the Hexateuch.&lt;ref name=JE&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2659-bath-sheba Morris Jastrow, Jr., Morris et al. "Bath-sheba", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', 1906]&lt;/ref&gt;

The only interpolations that concern the story of Bathsheba are some verses in the early part of the twelfth chapter, that heighten the moral tone of Nathan's rebuke of David. According to [[Karl Budde]] the interpolated portion is 12: 7, 8, and 10–12; according to [[Friedrich Schwally]] and H. P. Smith, the whole of 12: 1–15a is an interpolation, and 12:. 15b should be joined directly to 11: 27. This does not directly affect the narrative concerning Bathsheba herself. 1 Chronicles omits all reference to the way in which Bathsheba became David's wife, and gives only the names of her children in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|3:5|NASB}} -- Shimea, Shobab, [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], and Solomon.&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

The father of Bathsheba was Eliam ("Ammiel" in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|3:5|NASB}}). As this was also the name of a son of Ahithophel, one of David's heroes ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|23:34|NASB}}), perhaps Bathsheba was a granddaughter of Ahithophel and that the latter's desertion of David at the time of Absalom's rebellion was in revenge for David's conduct toward Bathsheba.&lt;ref name="McKenzie2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven L.

[[Kenneth E. Bailey]] interprets the passage from a different perspective: he says that David's Jerusalem was tightly packed and Bathsheba's house may have been as close as twenty feet away from David's rooftop; people in ancient times were exceptionally modest about their bodies, so he suggests that Bathsheba displayed herself deliberately, so that instead of being an innocent victim, it was actually she who seduced David in order to rid herself of Uriah, and move in with King David.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth E. Bailey, ''Jesus Through Middle Eastern Eyes''. pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell states "The 'violation of Bathsheba' may be the least unsatisfactory terminology, especially given the ambivalence of the text's storytelling."&lt;ref name=Campbell2005/&gt; According to Michael D. Coogan, the faulting of David is made clear in the text from the very beginning: "It was springtime, the time when kings go forth to war... but David remained in Jerusalem" ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|11:1|NASB}}); if David had been away at war, the incident would not have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael D., ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Bathsheba incident leads to a shift in the book's perspective; afterwards David "is largely at the mercy of events rather than directing them".&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael D. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; He is no longer able to control his family, and ends up being overthrown by Absalom. And in {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|13|NASB}} the story of David's son [[Amnon]]'s rape of his sister [[Tamar (2 Samuel)|Tamar]], told so soon after the incident of Bathsheba, seems to draw a parallel between the sexual misconduct of father and son.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael D. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

Bathsheba at her Bath is the formal name for the subject in art showing Bathsheba bathing, watched by King David. In art the subject is one of the most commonly shown in the [[Power of Women]] ''topos''. As an opportunity to feature a large female nude as the focus of a [[history painting]], the subject was popular from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. Sometimes Bathsheba's maids, or the "messengers" sent by David are shown, and often a distant David watching from his roof. The messengers are sometimes confused with David himself, but most artists follow the Bible in keeping David at a distance in this episode.

Paintings with articles include:

In 1892 [[August Weismann]] proposed in his [[germ plasm]] theory that heritable information is transmitted only via [[germ cell]]s, which he thought contained determinants (genes). [[Francis Galton]], supposing that undesirable traits such as [[club foot]] and [[criminality]] were inherited, advocated eugenics, aiming to prevent supposedly defective people from breeding. [[Samuel George Morton]] and [[Paul Broca]] attempted to relate the cranial capacity (internal skull volume) to skin colour, intending to show that white people were superior. Other workers such as [[H. H. Goddard]], and [[Robert Yerkes]] attempted to [[Intelligence Quotient|measure people's intelligence]] and to show that the resulting scores were heritable, again to demonstrate the supposed superiority of people with white skin.

Galton popularized the phrase [[nature and nurture]], later often used to characterize the heated debate over whether genes or the environment determined human behavior. Scientists such as ecologists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Normile, Dennis |title=Nature From Nurture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=351 |issue=6276 |pages=908–910 |date=2016 |doi=10.1126/science.351.6276.908|pmid=26917750 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and behavioural geneticists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Powledge, Tabitha M. |title=Behavioral Epigenetics: How Nurture Shapes Nature|journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=588–592 |date=2011 |doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.8.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; now see it as obvious that both factors are essential, and that they are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moore, David S. |year=2003 |title=The Dependent Gene: The Fallacy of Nature Vs.

Late in the 20th century, the [[Biological determinism of human gender roles|determinism of gender roles]] was debated by geneticists and others. Biologists such as [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] attempted to describe [[femininity]] and [[homosexuality]] according to then-current social standards; against this, the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] and others argued that clothing and other preferences vary in different societies. The biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] founded the discipline of sociobiology, founded on observations of animals such as [[social insects]], controversially suggesting that its explanations of social behaviour might apply to humans.

==History==

=== Roots ===
Biological determinism is the belief that a human’s behavior is controlled by an person’s genes and inherited traits. It dates back to the 1800s. Stephen Jay Gould has spent his career tracing the roots of this “western” thought because it is more involved than anyone could have assumed. Gould suggests that the main theories of biological determinism are based on bad biology and bad use of the scientific method. When a scientist says they used the scientific method to gather their data, the readers automatically assume that the information given must be correct. 
	
Gould presents three key ideas that have influenced biological determinism. The first is that measurement and quantification have changed science over the past century and without context, these measurements are useless. If something is assigned a number, then it must be real, true, and scientific. If these numbers and measurements are given without context, then the data can be given many different meanings. The second is that reinfication, the idea that certain qualities (intelligence, race) are valid because we put a name on it. One could separate a group into different components and give a name to these divided groups and have it be true, but actually, there is nothing scientific about intelligence being used as a unitary quality. The third problem is that the main thought behind biological determinism is that traits are inherited. Scientists have traced certain traits through families lines and found that some are inherited. Gould suggests that these studies merely restate the original assumption. Gould points out that various theories of biological determinism have no evidence or science to back them up, and even though these ideas are very flawed, people still widely accept them. 
	
However, Gould is thought to be flawed in his own way because readers believe he is simply disregarding certain aspects of science. Gould questions that since the scientific aspects of the works themselves are so flawed that why is it so widespread accepted. Gould suggests that there could be some social, political, and economic forces which could explain why these biological determinism theories are so widely accepted, but he fails to go further deep into the topic. Gould shows that these biological determinism theories have many consequences for human life and scientists in the future can see these and use his book to continue trying to show the people that biological determinism, is in fact, false. 
	
In this review of Gould’s essay by Garland E. Allen, Allen writes that Gould has helped future scientists examine social, economic, and political values of this time regarding biological determinism. Biological determinism is still prominent in scientific works, past and present, that have been regarded by the public as true and believable. Gould wants his readers to understand that biological determinism has roots all throughout science, even though it has been proven false. .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Garland E.|date=1984|editor-last=Gould|editor-first=Stephen Jay|title=The Roots of Biological Determinism|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=141–145|jstor=4330882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germ plasm===
{{main|Germ plasm}}
In 1892, the Austrian biologist [[August Weismann]] proposed that multicellular organisms consist of two separate types of cell: [[somatic cell]]s, which carry out the body's ordinary functions, and [[germ cell]]s, which transmit heritable information. He called the material that carried the information, now identified as [[DNA]], the [[germ plasm]], and individual components of it, now called [[gene]]s, determinants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weismann, August |authorlink=August Weismann |year=1892 |title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung |trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A Theory of Inheritance |language=German |publisher=Fischer |location=Jena |url=http://www.esp.org/books/weismann/germ-plasm/facsimile/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann argued that there is a one-way transfer of information from the germ cells to somatic cells, so that nothing acquired by the body during an organism's life can affect the germ plasm and the next generation. This effectively denied that [[Lamarckism|Lamarckism (inheritance of acquired characteristics)]] was a possible mechanism of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Huxley, Julian| authorlink=Julian Huxley |year=1942 |title=Evolution, the modern synthesis |publisher=Allen and Unwin |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern equivalent of the theory, expressed at molecular rather than cellular level, is the [[central dogma of molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner, J. Scott |editor1=Henning, Brian G.|editor2=Scarfe, Adam Christian |title=Biology's Second Law: Homeostasis, Purpose, and Desire |work=Beyond Mechanism: Putting Life Back Into Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=naQm1_Lutq4C&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2013 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7391-7436-4 |page=192 |quote=Where Weismann would say that it is impossible for changes acquired during an organism's lifetime to feed back onto transmissible traits in the germ line, the CDMB now added that it was impossible for information encoded in proteins to feed back and affect genetic information in any form whatsoever, which was essentially a molecular recasting of the Weismann barrier.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eugenics===
[[File:Francis Galton 1850s.jpg|thumb|upright|The early eugenicist [[Francis Galton]] invented the term [[eugenics]] and popularized the phrase [[nature and nurture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Galton, Francis |authorlink=Francis Galton |date=1874 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_uE-bpGo2N4C&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=On men of science, their nature and their nurture |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain |volume=7 |pages=227–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Eugenics}}

Early ideas of biological determinism centred on the inheritance of undesirable traits, whether physical such as [[club foot]] or [[cleft palate]], or psychological such as [[alcoholism]], [[bipolar disorder]] and [[criminality]]. The belief that such traits were inherited led to the desire to solve the problem with the [[eugenics]] movement, led by a follower of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911), by forcibly reducing breeding by supposedly defective people. By the 1920s, many U.S. states brought in laws permitting the compulsory [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] of people considered genetically unfit, including inmates of [[prison]]s and [[psychiatric hospital]]s. This was followed by similar laws in Germany, and throughout the Western world, in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Garland Edward |title=Biological determinism |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/biological-determinism |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AllenReview&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Garland E. |title=The Roots of Biological Determinism: review of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1984 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=141–145 |jstor=4330882 |doi=10.1007/bf00397505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mismeasure&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |title=The Mismeasure of Man |date=1981 |publisher=W. W. Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific racism===
{{main|Scientific racism}}

Under the influence of determinist beliefs, the American [[craniologist]] [[Samuel George Morton]] (1799–1851), and later the French anthropologist [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880), attempted to measure the cranial capacities (internal skull volumes) of people of different skin colours, intending to show that whites were superior to the rest, with larger brains. All the supposed proofs from such studies were invalidated by methodological flaws. The results were used to justify [[slavery]], and to oppose [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name=AllenReview/&gt;

===Heritability of IQ===
{{main|Heritability of IQ}}[[Alfred Binet]] (1857–1911)  designed tests specifically to measure performance, not innate ability.  From the late 19th century, the American school, led by researchers such as [[H. H. Goddard]] (1866–1957), [[Lewis Terman]] (1877–1956), and [[Robert Yerkes]] (1876–1956), transformed these tests into tools for measuring inherited mental ability.  They attempted to measure people's intelligence with [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ tests]], to demonstrate that the resulting scores were [[heritable]], and so to conclude that people with white skin were superior to the rest.  It proved impossible to design culture-independent tests and to carry out testing in a fair way given that people came from different backgrounds, or were newly arrived immigrants, or were illiterate. The results were used to oppose immigration of people from southern and eastern Europe to America.&lt;ref name=AllenReview/&gt;

[[Richard Lewontin]], [[Steven Rose]], and [[Leon Kamin]]'s book ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'' discussed a study of girls who were relatively "[[masculinity|masculinized]]". The biologists [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] looked for ways to describe femininity that fitted their own social standards, such as clothing preference or using makeup. The experiment, in Lewontin's words, "ignores the existence of societies in which women wear pants, or in which men wear skirts, or in which men enjoy and appropriate jewelry to themselves." Gender differences in work are becoming less pronounced, suggesting that these are imposed by society.&lt;ref name=LewontinRoseKamin1984&gt;[[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin, Richard]], Steven Rose, and Leon Kamin.

==Nature versus nurture debate==
{{main|Nature and nurture}}

The belief in biological determinism has been matched by a [[tabula rasa|blank slate]] denial of any possible influence of genes on human behavior, leading to [[Nature and nurture|a long and heated debate about "nature and nurture"]]. By the 21st century, many scientists had come to feel that the dichotomy made no sense. They noted that genes were expressed within an environment, in particular that of [[prenatal development]], and that genes were continuously controlled by the environment through mechanisms such as [[epigenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Matt Ridley |author=Ridley, M. |date=2003 |title=Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience, &amp; What Makes Us Human |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=978-0-002-00663-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moore, David S. |title=The Developing Genome: An Introduction to Behavioral Epigenetics |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-199-92234-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gutiérrez, Luci |date=January 24, 2014 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/time-to-retire-the-simplicity-of-nature-vs-nurture-1390610295 |title=Time to Retire The Simplicity of Nature vs. Nurture |newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|upright|Representation of the Buddha in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], 1st century CE]]
{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist art''' is the [[art|artistic practices]] that are influenced by [[Buddhism]]. It includes art media which depict [[Buddha]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; [[mandala]]s and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as [[vajra]]s, bells, [[stupa]]s and [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist temple architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Buddhist Art? |url=http://buddhistartnews.wordpress.com/what-is-buddhist-art/ |publisher=Buddhist Art News |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BCE, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and co-developed with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] art, with cave temple complexes built together, each likely influencing the other.&lt;ref name=blurton113&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 113-116, 160-162, 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-iconic phase (5th century – 1st century BCE)==
{{See also|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Footprint of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. 1st century BCE, [[Gandhara]].]]
During the 2nd to 1st century BCE, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha’s life and teachings. These took the form of votive tablets or [[frieze]]s, usually in relation to the decoration of stupas.
Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form, but only through [[Buddhist symbolism]]. This period may have been [[aniconism in Buddhism|aniconic]].

Artists were reluctant to depict the Buddha anthropomorphically, and developed sophisticated aniconic symbols to avoid doing so (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear). This tendency remained as late as the 2nd century CE in the southern parts of India, in the art of the [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district#Amaravati School|Amaravati School]] (see: [[Mara (demon)|Mara's assault on the Buddha]]).
It has been argued that earlier anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha may have been made of wood and may have perished since then. However, no related archaeological evidence has been found.

The earliest works of Buddhist art in India date back to the 1st century BCE The
[[Mahabodhi Temple]] at Bodh Gaya became a model for similar structures in Burma
and Indonesia. The frescoes at [[Sigiriya]] are said to be even older than the
[[Ajanta Caves]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art ]  Frontline Magazine 13–26 May 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconic phase (1st century CE – present)==
{{see also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Padmapani, cave 1, Ajanta, India.jpg|thumb|left|Over life-size figure of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Padmapani]], cave 1, [[Ajanta Caves]], 5th century]]
Anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha started to emerge from the 1st century CE in [[Northern India]]. The two main centers of creation have been identified as [[Gandhara]] in today’s [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]], in [[Pakistan]], and the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern India.

Hellenistic culture was introduced in Gandhara during the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign: 321–298 BCE), founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]], conquered the Macedonian satraps during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]] of 305–303 BCE. Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]] (reign: 268-232 BCE), who formed the largest Empire in the Indian subcontinent, converted to Buddhism following the [[Kalinga War]]. Abandoning an expansionist ideology, Ashoka worked to spread the religion and philosophy throughout his empire as described in the [[edicts of Ashoka]]. Ashoka claims to have converted the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

After the overthrow of the Mauryan Empire by the [[Shunga Empire]], the  [[Greco-Bactrian]] and subsequently the [[Indo-Greek]] Kingdoms invaded north-western India. They facilitated the spread of Greco-Buddhist art style to other parts of the subcontinent. The Indo-Greek King [[Menander I]] was renown as a great patron of Buddhism, attaining the title of an [[arhat]].&lt;ref&gt;"(In the Milindapanha) Menander is declared an arhat", McEvilley, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] persecuted Buddhism, presumably to further erase the legacy of the Mauryan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Caleb; Sarao, K. T. S. (2010). "Pushyamitra Sunga, a Hindu ruler in the second century BCE, was a great persecutor of Buddhists". In Danver, Steven L. Popular Controversies in World History. ABC-CLIO. p. 89. {{ISBN|9781598840780}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the decline of Buddhist art east of Mathura.

Gandharan Buddhist sculpture displays [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Hellenistic artistic influence]] in the forms of human figures and ornament. Figures were much larger than any known from India previously, and also more naturalistic, and new details included wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, and [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf ornament.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Inscribed Seated Buddha Image in Abhaya Mudra - Kushan Period - Katra Keshav Dev - ACCN A-1 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5972.JPG|thumb|Mathura school Buddha, [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]]]]

The art of Mathura tends to be based on an Indian tradition, exemplified by the anthropomorphic representation of divinities such as the [[Yaksha|Yaksas]], although in a style rather archaic compared to the later representations of the Buddha. The Mathuran school contributed clothes covering the left shoulder of thin [[muslin]], the wheel on the palm, the lotus seat.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Mathura and Gandhara also influenced each other. During their artistic florescence, the two regions were even united politically under the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], both being capitals of the empire. It is still a matter of debate whether the anthropomorphic representations of Buddha was essentially a result of a local evolution of Buddhist art at Mathura, or a consequence of Greek cultural influence in Gandhara through the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] [[syncretism]].

This iconic art was characterized from the start by a realistic idealism, combining realistic human features, proportions, attitudes and attributes, together with a sense of perfection and serenity reaching to the divine. This expression of the Buddha as both man and God became the iconographic canon for subsequent Buddhist art.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Remains of early Buddhist painting in India are vanishingly rare, with the later phases of the [[Ajanta Caves]] giving the great majority of surviving work, created over a relatively short up to about 480 CE.  These are highly sophisticated works, evidently produced in a well-developed tradition, probably painting secular work in palaces as much as religious subjects.

Buddhist art continued to develop in India for a few more centuries. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of Mathura evolved during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (4th to 6th century CE) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. The art of the Gupta school was extremely influential almost everywhere in the rest of Asia. At the end of the 12th century CE, Buddhism in its full glory came to be preserved only in the Himalayan regions in India. These areas, helped by their location, were in greater contact with Tibet and China - for example the art and traditions of [[Ladakh]] bear the stamp of Tibetan and Chinese influence.
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|240px|Buddhist expansion throughout Asia.]]
As Buddhism expanded outside of India from the 1st century CE, its original artistic package blended with other artistic influences, leading to a progressive differentiation among the countries adopting the faith.
* A '''Northern route''' was established from the 1st century CE through [[Central Asia]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], in which [[Mahayana]] Buddhism prevailed.
* A '''Southern route''', where [[Theravada]] Buddhism dominated, went through [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]].

==Northern Buddhist art==
[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|left|thumb|A Chinese wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE)]]

The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] to Central Asia, China and ultimately Korea and Japan started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Ming]] (58-75&amp;nbsp;AD). However, extensive contacts started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]], with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]], were either [[Parthia]]n, [[Kushan]], [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] or [[Kuchean]].

Central Asian missionary efforts along the [[Silk Road]] were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of [[Serindian art]] from the 2nd through the 11th century in the Tarim Basin, modern [[Xinjiang]]. Serindian art often derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Pakistan]], combining Indian, Greek and [[Roman art|Roman]] influences. Silk Road Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs, Buddhist imagery, and a select few representations of [[Kami|Japanese gods]].

The art of the northern route was also highly influenced by the development of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, an inclusive branch of Buddhism characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]], and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. Mahāyāna goes beyond the traditional [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist]] ideal of the release from suffering ([[dukkha|duḥkha]]) of [[arhat]]s, and emphasizes the [[bodhisattva]] path. The Mahāyāna sutras elevate the Buddha to a transcendent and infinite being, and feature a pantheon of bodhisattvas devoting themselves to the [[Paramita|Six Perfections]], ultimate knowledge ([[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]]), enlightenment, and the liberation of all sentient beings. Northern Buddhist art thus tends to be characterized by a very rich and syncretic Buddhist pantheon, with a multitude of images of the various [[Buddhahood|buddhas]], bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings ([[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]).

===Afghanistan===
[[File:GBA1(trimmed).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue from a Buddhist monastery, 700&amp;nbsp;AD, Afghanistan]]
Buddhist art in [[Afghanistan]] (old [[Bactria]]) persisted for several centuries until the spread of Islam in the 7th century. It is exemplified by the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Other sculptures, in [[stucco]], [[schist]] or [[clay]], display very strong blending of Indian post-[[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] mannerism and Classical influence, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]].

Although Islamic rule was somewhat tolerant of other religions "[[People of the Book|of the Book]]", it showed little tolerance for Buddhism, which was perceived as a religion depending on "[[idolatry]]". Human figurative art forms also being prohibited under Islam, Buddhist art suffered numerous attacks, which culminated with the systematic destructions by the [[Taliban]] regime. The Buddhas of Bamyan, the sculptures of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], and many of the remaining artifacts at the Afghanistan museum have been destroyed.

The multiple conflicts since the 1980s also have led to a systematic pillage of archaeological sites apparently in the hope of reselling in the international market what artifacts could be found.

===Central Asia===
{{See also|Dunhuang|Mogao Caves|Kingdom of Khotan|Silk Road|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
[[File:SerindianGroup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Serindian art]], 6th-7th century [[Terra cotta|terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang).]]
[[Central Asia]] long played the role of a meeting place between China, India and [[Iran|Persia]]. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] to the West led to increased contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

Thereafter, the expansion of Buddhism to the North led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oasis of Central Asia. Some [[Silk Road]] cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between East and West.

The eastern part of Central Asia  ([[Chinese Turkestan]] ([[Tarim Basin]], [[Xinjiang]]) in particular has revealed an extremely rich [[Serindian art]] ([[cave painting|wall paintings]] and [[relief]]s in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. Works of art reminiscent of the Gandharan style, as well as scriptures in the Gandhari script [[Kharoshti]] have been found. These influences were rapidly absorbed however by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.

===China===
{{see also|Chinese Buddhist sculpture}}
Buddhism arrived in [[China]] around the 1st century CE, and introduced new types of art into China, particularly in the area of [[statue|statuary]]. Receiving this distant religion, strong Chinese traits were incorporated into Buddhist art.

====Northern Dynasties====
In the 5th to 6th centuries, the [[Northern Dynasties]] developed rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible and realistic manner, progressively led to a change towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

====Tang Dynasty====

Following a transition under the [[Sui Dynasty]], Buddhist sculpture of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. Because of the dynasty's openness to foreign influences, and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India, Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Indian art of the Gupta period. During that time, the Tang capital of [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) became an important center for Buddhism. From there Buddhism spread to [[Korea]], and [[Japanese missions to Tang China]] helped it gain a foothold in Japan.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang China|Wuzong]] outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) in order to support the indigenous religion, [[Taoism]]. He confiscated Buddhist possessions, and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the development of the religion and its arts in China.

[[Chán]] Buddhism however, as the origin of Japanese [[Zen]], continued to prosper for some centuries, especially under the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), when Chan monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.

[[File:Chinesischer Maler von 1238 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of the Chinese [[Zen]] Buddhist [[Wuzhun Shifan]], painted in 1238&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Song Dynasty]].]]

Early paintings by Chán monks tended to eschew the meticulous realism of [[Gongbi]] painting in favour of vigorous, monochrome paintings, attempting to express the impact of enlightenment through their brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, A; ''The imperial capitals of China: an inside view of the celestial empire'', Random House 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84595-010-1}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Neo-Confucianism]] under [[Zhu Xi]] in the twelfth century resulted in considerable criticism of the monk-painters. Connected as they were with the then-unpopular school of Chan Buddhism, their paintings were discarded and ignored. Some paintings survived after being transported to Japan by visiting Zen monks, but the school of Chan painting gradually diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Valérie Malenfer; ''Dreaming the southern song landscape: the power of illusion in Chinese painting'', BRILL 1999, {{ISBN|978-90-04-11011-3}} p161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qing Dynasty====
During the Qing Dynasty, Manchu emperors supported Buddhist practices for a range of political and personal reasons. The [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was a devotee of Chan Buddhism, while his successor, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] promoted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], claiming to be the human embodiment of the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref&gt;Weidner, Marsha Smith, and Patricia Ann Berger. Latter Days of the Law : Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850-1850. Lawrence, KS: Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was under the rule of the third Qing ruler, the [[Qianlong Emperor]], that imperial patronage of the Buddhist arts reached its height in this period. He commissioned a vast number of religious works in the Tibetan style, many of which depicted him in various sacred guises.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.113&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art produced during this period are characterized by a unique fusion of Tibetan and Chinese artistic approaches. They combine a characteristically Tibetan attention to iconographic detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements. Inscriptions are often written in Chinese, Manchu, Tibetan, Mongolian and Sanskrit, while paintings are frequently rendered in vibrant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p.webm|thumb|Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p]]
Additionally, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] initiated a number of large-scale construction projects; in 1744 he rededicated the [[Yonghe Temple]] as Beijing's main Tibetan Buddhist monastery, donating a number of valuable religious paintings, sculptures, textiles and inscriptions to the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xumi Fushou Temple]], and the works housed within, is another project commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] that embodies the unique blend of Tibetan and Manchu artistic styles that characterized Buddhist art produced in China under Qianlong's reign.

After the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s abdication in 1795, the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism at the Qing court declined. The motives behind the Qing emperors' promotion of Tibetan Buddhism have been interpreted as a calculated act of political manipulation, and a means of forging ties between Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan communities, though this has been challenged by recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Patricia Ann. Empire of Emptiness : Buddhist Art and Political Authority In Qing China. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legacy====
[[File:Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p.webm|thumb|Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p]]
The popularization of Buddhism in China has made the country home to one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts in the world. The [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] and the [[Bingling Temple]] caves near [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] province, the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province, and the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] near [[Chongqing]] municipality are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.

===Korea===
{{see also|Buddhism in Korea|Korean Buddhist sculpture|Korean art}}
[[Korea]]n Buddhist art generally reflects an interaction between other Buddhist influences and a strongly original Korean culture. Additionally, the art of the steppes, particularly Siberian and [[Scythia]]n influences, are evident in early Korean Buddhist art based on the excavation of artifacts and burial goods such as [[Silla]] [[Crown of Silla|royal crowns]], belt buckles, daggers, and comma-shaped [[gogok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/crown.htm |title=Crown |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Arts of Korea |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this indigenous art was geometric, abstract and richly adorned with a {{clarify span|characteristic "barbarian" luxury|date=November 2012}}. Although many other influences were strong, Korean Buddhist art, "bespeaks a sobriety, taste for the right tone, a sense of abstraction but also of colours that curiously enough are in line with contemporary taste" (Pierre Cambon, ''Arts asiatiques- Guimet''').

====Three Kingdoms of Korea====
[[File:Pensive Bodhisattva 02.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], semi-seated contemplative Maitreya probably from Silla circa early 7th century.]]
The first of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] to officially receive Buddhism was [[Goguryeo]] in 372.&lt;ref name=graysonp25&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chinese records and the use of Buddhist motifs in Goguryeo murals indicate the introduction of Buddhism earlier than the official date.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baekje]] Kingdom officially recognized Buddhism in 384.&lt;ref name=graysonp25/&gt; The [[Silla]] Kingdom, isolated and with no easy sea or land access to China, officially adopted Buddhism in 535 although the foreign religion was known in the kingdom due to the work of Goguryeo monks since the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Encyclopedia of World History: ancient, medieval, and modern, chronologically arranged |author1=Peter N.

Particularly important in the transmission of sophisticated art styles to the Korean kingdoms was the art of the "barbarian" Tuoba, a clan of non-Han Chinese Xianbei people who established the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty in China in 386. The Northern Wei style was particularly influential in the art of the Goguryeo and Baekje. Baekje artisans later transmitted this style along with Southern Dynasty elements and distinct Korean elements to Japan. Korean artisans were highly selective of the styles they incorporated and combined different regional styles together to create a specific Korean Buddhist art style.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), pp. 27 &amp; 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture, 5th&amp;ndash;9th Century |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Timeline of Arts History |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seokguram Buddha.JPG|upright|thumb|left|[[Seokguram Grotto]] is a [[World Heritage Site]] and dates to the [[Unified Silla]] era.]]
While Goguryeo Buddhist art exhibited vitality and mobility akin with Northern Wei prototypes, the Baekje Kingdom was also in close contact with the [[Southern Dynasties]] of China and this close diplomatic contact is exemplified in the gentle and proportional sculpture of the Baekje, epitomized by Baekje sculpture exhibiting the fathomless smile known to art historians as the [[Baekje smile]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture (5th–9th century) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=metmuseum.org |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silla Kingdom also developed a distinctive Buddhist art tradition epitomized by the [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], a half-seated contemplative maitreya whose Korean-made twin, the Miroku Bosatsu, was sent to Japan as a proselytizing gift and now resides in the Koryu-ji Temple in Japan.&lt;ref name="kenyon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln275/Jap-Kor-art.htm |title=Japanese Art and Its Korean Secret |publisher=www2.kenyon.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms period stimulated massive temple-building projects, such as the [[Mireuksa]] Temple in the Baekje Kingdom and the [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple in Silla. Baekje architects were famed for their skill and were instrumental in building the massive nine-story pagoda at Hwangnyongsa and early Buddhist temples in Yamato Japan such as [[Asuka-dera|Hōkō-ji]] (Asuka-dera) and [[Hōryū-ji]].&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sir Banister Fletcher's a History of Architecture |author1=Fletcher, B. |author2=Cruickshank, D. |date=1996 |publisher=Architectural Press |isbn=9780750622677 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gt1jTpXAThwC |page=716 |accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6th century Korean Buddhist art exhibited the cultural influences of China and India but began to show distinctive indigenous characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/06/eak/ht06eak.htm metmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; These indigenous characteristics can be seen in early Buddhist art in Japan and some early Japanese Buddhist sculpture is now believed to have originated in Korea, particularly from Baekje, or Korean artisans who immigrated to Yamato Japan. Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Korean style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the Koryu-ji Miroku Bosatsu and the Chugu-ji Siddhartha statues. Although many historians portray Korea as a mere transmitter of Buddhism, the Three Kingdoms, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Korea: A Religious History |author=Grayson, J.H. |date=2002 |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |isbn=9780700716050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1BzL2lwPqEC |page=33 |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unified Silla====
[[File:Goryeo Pagoda.jpg|thumb|160px|The Goryeo era [[Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda]] sits on the first floor of the [[National Museum of Korea]].]]
During the [[Unified Silla]] period, [[East Asia]] was particularly stable with China and Korea both enjoying unified governments. Early Unified Silla art combined Silla styles and Baekje styles. Korean Buddhist art was also influenced by new [[Tang Dynasty]] styles as evidenced by a new popular Buddhist motif with full-faced Buddha sculptures. Tang China was the cross roads of East, Central, and South Asia and so the Buddhist art of this time period exhibit the so-called international style. State-sponsored Buddhist art flourished during this period, the epitome of which is the [[Seokguram]] Grotto.

====Goryeo Dynasty====
The fall of the Unified Silla Dynasty and the establishment of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty in 918 indicates a new period of Korean Buddhist art. The Goryeo kings also lavishly sponsored Buddhism and Buddhist art flourished, especially Buddhist paintings and illuminated sutras written in gold and silver ink. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/eak/ht07eak.htm]. The crowning achievement of this period is the carving of approximately 80,000 woodblocks of the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] which was done twice.

====Joseon Dynasty====
The [[Joseon Dynasty]] actively suppressed Buddhism beginning in 1406 and Buddhist temples and art production subsequently decline in quality in quantity although beginning in 1549, Buddhist art does continue to be produced.

[[File:ASURA detail Kohfukuji.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The ASURA in [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (734)]]
Before the introduction of Buddhism, [[Japan]] had already been the seat of various cultural (and artistic) influences, from the abstract linear decorative art of the indigenous Neolithic [[Jōmon]] from around 10500&amp;nbsp;BC to 300&amp;nbsp;BC, to the art during the [[Yayoi]] and [[Kofun]] periods, with developments such as [[Haniwa]] art.

The cultural exchange between India and Japan was not direct, as Japan received Buddhism through Korea, China, Central Asia and eventually India. The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled to the islands together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The cultural contact between Indian Dharmic civilization and Japan through the adoption of Buddhist ideas and aesthetic has contributed to the development of a national cultural order in the subsequent century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Indian Influence on the Art of Japan | author = Sampa Biswas | publisher = Northern Book Centre | year = 2010 | isbn = 9788172112691 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=fLjcMfMGP10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Japan&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisg5jQrPrVAhWKMo8KHXxoBpEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Japan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century. Being geographically at the end of the [[Silk Road]], Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.

From 711, numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], including a five-story [[pagoda]], the Golden Hall of the Horyuji, and the [[Kōfuku-ji]] temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. Indian, Hellenistic, Chinese and Korean artistic influences blended into an original style characterized by realism and gracefulness. The creation of Japanese Buddhist art was especially rich between the 8th and 13th centuries during the periods of [[Nara period|Nara]], [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]].
Japan developed an extremely rich figurative art for the pantheon of Buddhist deities, sometimes combined with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Shinto]] influences. This art can be very varied, creative and bold.

From the 12th and 13th, a further development was [[Zen]] art, and it faces golden days in [[Muromachi Period]], following the introduction of the faith by [[Dogen]] and [[Eisai]] upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as [[sumi-e]]) and poetry (especially [[haiku]]s), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned "non-dualistic" representations. The search for enlightenment "in the moment" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the [[Chanoyu]] tea ceremony or the [[Ikebana]] art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques ([[martial art]]s).

Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Still around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved. Many of them are in wood and are regularly restored.

===Tibet and Bhutan===
{{See also|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}
[[File:Yama tibet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]] 18th century, Tibet]]
[[Tantric Buddhism]] started as a movement in eastern India around the 5th or the 6th century. Many of the practices of Tantric Buddhism are derived from [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] (the usage of [[mantra]]s, [[yoga]], or the burning of sacrificial offerings). Tantrism became the dominant form of Buddhism in [[Tibet]] from the 8th century. Due to its geographical centrality in Asia, Tibetan Buddhist art received influence from Indian, [[Nepal]]i, Greco-Buddhist and Chinese art.

One of the most characteristic creations of Tibetan Buddhist art are the [[mandala]]s, diagrams of a "divine temple" made of a circle enclosing a square, the purpose of which is to help Buddhist devotees focus their attention through meditation and follow the path to the central image of the Buddha.
Artistically, Buddhist [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art and Hindu art tend to be the two strongest inspirations of Tibetan art.

In 10th to 11th centuries, [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], Northern India (at that time part of Western Tibet Kingdom) serves an important role as an intermediary between India and Tibet cultural exchange, especially Buddhist art and philosophy. Notable example of Tibetan Buddhist art in Tabo is its exquisite frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tabo: a lamp for the kingdom : early Indo Tibetan Buddhist art in the western Himalaya, Archeologia, arte primitiva e orientale | author1 =Deborah E.

===Vietnam===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The boy Buddha rising up from lotus. Crimson and gilded wood, Trần-Hồ dynasty, Vietnam, 14th-15th century]]
Chinese influence was predominant in the north of [[Vietnam]] (Tonkin) between the 1st and 9th centuries, and [[Confucianism]] and Mahayana Buddhism were prevalent. Overall, the art of Vietnam has been strongly influenced by Chinese Buddhist art.

In the south thrived the former kingdom of [[Champa]] (before it was later overtaken by the Vietnamese from the north). [[Champa]] had a strongly Indianized art, just as neighboring [[Cambodia]]. Many of its statues were characterized by rich body adornments. The capital of the kingdom of Champa was annexed by Vietnam in 1471, and it totally collapsed in the 1720s, while [[Cham (Asia)|Cham people]] remain an abundant minority across [[Southeast Asia]].

==Southern Buddhist art==
The orthodox forms of Buddhism, also known as Southern Buddhism are still practised in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. During the 1st century CE, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise of the [[Parthia]]n empire in the [[Middle East]], an unvanquished enemy of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connections, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Trade routes linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Thailand|Siam]], lower [[Cambodia]] and southern [[Vietnam]], and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.

[[File:CambodianBuddha.JPG|thumb|upright|A Cambodian Buddha, 14th century]]
For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[Pāli|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and the Indian script, together with [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhism, [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. This expansion provided the artistic context for the development of Buddhist art in these countries, which then developed characteristics of their own.

Between the 1st and 8th centuries, several kingdoms competed for influence in the region (particularly the Cambodian [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] then the Burmese [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdoms) contributing various artistic characteristics, mainly derived from the Indian [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] style. Combined with a pervading Hindu influence, Buddhist images, votive tablets and Sanskrit inscriptions are found throughout the area. Between 8th- and 12th-century, under the patronage of [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]], arts and ideas of Buddhism and Hinduism co-developed and became increasingly intermeshed.&lt;ref name=richardblurton202/&gt; However, with Muslim invasion and sacking of monasteries in India, states Richard Blurton,  "Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India".&lt;ref name=richardblurton202&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 202-204, Quote: "Buddhism flourished in this part of India throughout the first millennium AD, especially under the patronage of Pala kings of the eighth and twelfth centuries. Towards the end of this period, popular Buddhism and Hinduism became increasingly intermeshed. However, when Muslim invaders from further west sacked the monasteries in the twelfth century, Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple.]]

By the 8th to 9th century, [[Sailendra]]n Buddhist art were developed and flourished in [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] kingdom of [[Central Java]], Indonesia. This period marked the renaissance of Buddhist art in Java, as numerous exquisite monuments were built, including [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Mendut]] and [[Borobudur]] stone mandala. The traditions would continue to the 13th century [[Singhasari]] Buddhist art of East Java.

From the 9th to the 13th centuries, Southeast Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The [[Sri Vijaya]] Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence, but both were adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, and their art expressed the rich Mahayana pantheon of the [[Bodhisattva]]s.
The [[Theravada]] Buddhism of the Pali canon was introduced to the region around the 13th century from [[Sri Lanka]], and was adopted by the newly founded [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]]. Since in Theravada Buddhism of the period, Monasteries typically were the central places for the laity of the towns to receive instruction and have disputes arbitrated by the monks, the construction of temple complexes plays a particularly important role in the artistic expression of Southeast Asia from that time.

From the 14th century, the main factor was the spread of [[Islam]] to the maritime areas of Southeast Asia, overrunning [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and most of the islands as far as the [[Southern Philippines]]. In the continental areas, Theravada Buddhism continued to expand into Burma, [[Laos]] and Cambodia.

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddha statue in Sri Lanka.]]
According to tradition, Buddhism was introduced in Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE by Indian missionaries under the guidance of Thera [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], the son of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]]. Prior to the expansion of Buddhism, the indigenous population of Sri Lanka lived in an animistic world full of superstition. The assimilation and conversion of the various pre-Buddhist beliefs was a slow process. In order to gain a foothold among the rural population, Buddhism needed to assimilate the various categories of spirits and other supernatural beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The earliest monastic complex was the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahāvihāra]] at [[Anuradhapura|Anurādhapura]] founded by [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Devānampiyatissa]] and presented to Mahinda Thera. The Mahāvihāra became the centre of the orthodox Theravāda doctrine and its supreme position remained unchallenged until the foundation of the [[Abhayagiri Vihāra]] around BC 89 by [[Valagamba of Anuradhapura|Vaţţagāmaņĩ]].

The Abhayagiri Vihāra became the seat of the reformed Mahāyāna doctrines. The rivalry between the monks of the Mahāvihāra and the Abhayagiri led to a further split and the foundation of the [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavanarama]] near the Mahāvihāra. The main feature of Sinhala Buddhism was its division into three major groups, or ''nikāyas'', named after the three main monastic complexes at Anurādhapura; the Mahāvihāra, the Abhayagiri, and the Jetavanārāma. This was the result in the deviations in the disciplinary rules ''(vinaya)'' and doctrinal disputes. All the other monasteries of Sri Lanka owed ecclesiastical allegiance to one of the three. Sri Lanka is famous for its creations of Buddhist sculptures made of stone and cast in bronze alloy.&lt;ref&gt;von Schroeder, Ulrich. 1990. ''Buddhist Sculptures of Sri Lanka''.

===Myanmar===
[[File:Buddha 00004.JPG|thumb|upright|A Mandalay-style statue of Buddha]]
A neighbor of India, [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was naturally strongly influenced by the eastern part of Indian territory. The [[Mon people|Mon]] of southern Burma are said to have been converted to Buddhism around 200&amp;nbsp;BC under the proselytizing of the Indian king [[Ashoka]], before the schism between [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

Early Buddhist temples are found, such as Beikthano in central Myanmar, with dates between the 1st and the 5th centuries. The Buddhist art of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in Southeast Asia following the expansion of the Mon Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries.

Later, thousands of Buddhist temples were built at [[Bagan]], the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries, and around 2,000 of them are still standing. Beautiful jeweled statues of the Buddha are remaining from that period. Creation managed to continue despite the seizure of the city by the [[Mongols]] in 1287.

During the [[Ava Kingdom|Ava period]], from the 14th to 16th centuries, the Ava (Innwa) style of the Buddha image was popular. In this style, the Buddha has large protruding ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, thin lips and a hair bun that is pointed at the top, usually depicted in the bhumisparsa [[mudra]].&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part1/post_pagan_period__part_1.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 1 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Konbaung dynasty]], at the end of the 18th century, the Mandalay style of the Buddha image emerged, a style that remains popular to this day.&lt;ref name="niu2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part3/post_pagan_period__part_3.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 3 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a marked departure from the Innwa style, and the Buddha's face is much more natural, fleshy, with naturally-slanted eyebrows, slightly slanted eyes, thicker lips, and a round hair bun at the top. Buddha images in this style can be found reclining, standing or sitting.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/mandalay_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalay-style Buddhas wear flowing, draped robes.

Another common style of Buddha images is the Shan style, from the [[Shan people]], who inhabit the highlands of Myanmar. In this style, the Buddha is depicted with angular features, a large and prominently pointed nose, a hair bun tied similar to Thai styles, and a small, thin mouth.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/shan_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cambodia]] was the center of the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] kingdom, which expanded into Burma and as far south as Malaysia between the 3rd and 6th centuries. Its influence seems to have been essentially political, most of the cultural influence coming directly from India.

Later, from the 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu [[Khmer Empire]] dominated vast parts of the Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was foremost in the development of Buddhist art in the region. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of [[Jayavarman VII]], a Buddhist king that built [[Angkor Thom]] walled city, adorned with the smiling face of [[Lokeshvara]] in Angkor Thom ''dvaras'' (gates) and ''prasat'' towers [[Bayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Monuments and Temples of Cambodia and Laos | author = W.

A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.

Often, Khmer art manages to express intense spirituality through divinely beaming expressions, in spite of spare features and slender lines.

The Thai Buddhist art encompasses period for more than a millennia, from pre Thai culture of Dvaravati and Srivijaya, to the first Thai capital of Thai 13th century Sukhothai, all the way to  succeeding Thai kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"&gt;{{cite book | title = Thai Buddhist Art: Discover Thai Art | author = Dawn F.

From the 1st to the 7th centuries, Buddhist art in [[Thailand]] was first influenced by direct contact with Indian traders and the expansion of the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdom, leading to the creation of Hindu and Buddhist art inspired from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] tradition, with numerous monumental statues of great virtuosity.

From the 9th century, the various schools of Thai art then became strongly influenced by Cambodian [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] art in the north and [[Sri Vijaya]] art in the south, both of Mahayana faith. Up to the end of that period, Buddhist art is characterized by a clear fluidness in the expression, and the subject matter is characteristic of the [[Mahayana]] pantheon with multiple creations of [[Bodhisattva]]s.

From the 13th century, [[Theravada]] Buddhism was introduced from Sri Lanka around the same time as the [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] was established.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; The new faith inspired highly stylized images in Thai Buddhism, with sometimes very geometrical and almost abstract figures.

During the [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period (14th-18th centuries), the Buddha came to be represented in a more stylistic manner with sumptuous garments and jeweled ornamentations. Many Thai sculptures or temples tended to be [[gilding|gilded]], and on occasion enriched with inlays.

The ensuing period of [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] saw the further development of Thai Buddhist art.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; By the 18th century, [[Bangkok]] was established as the royal center of the kingdom of [[Siam]]. Subsequently, the Thai rulers filled the city with imposing Buddhist monuments to demonstrate their Buddhist piety as well as to showcase their authority. Among others are the celebrated [[Wat Phra Kaew]] which hosts the [[Emerald Buddha]]. Other Buddhist temples in Bangkok includes [[Wat Arun]] with ''prang'' style towers, and [[Wat Pho]] with its famous image of [[Reclining Buddha]].

Like the rest of Southeast Asia, [[Indonesia]] seems to have been most strongly influenced by India from the 1st century CE. The islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java (island)|Java]] in western Indonesia were the seat of the empire of [[Sri Vijaya]] (8th-13th century), which came to dominate most of the area around the Southeast Asian peninsula through maritime power. The Sri Vijayan Empire had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, under a line of rulers named the [[Sailendra]]. The Sailendras was the ardent temple builder and the devoted patron of Buddhism in Java.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java | author1 = Jean Philippe Vogel | author2 = Adriaan Jacob Barnouw | publisher = Asian Educational Services | year = 1936 | isbn = 9788120612259 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=wQ2x0cbZkn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Java&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLm_6o6PfVAhXKo48KHUc_DuEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Java&amp;f=false| pages = 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sri Vijaya spread Mahayana Buddhist art during its expansion into the Southeast Asian peninsula. Numerous statues of Mahayana [[Bodhisattva]]s from this period are characterized by a very strong refinement and technical sophistication, and are found throughout the region. One of the earliest Buddhist inscription in Java, the [[Kalasan inscription]] dated 778, mentioned about the construction of a [[Kalasan|temple]] for the goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt;

[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Side Detail.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of [[Prajnaparamita of Java|Prajñāpāramitā from Singhasari]], East Java.]]
Extremely rich and refined architectural remains are found in Java and Sumatra. The most magnificent is the temple of [[Borobudur]] (the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built  around 780-850&amp;nbsp;AD), built by Sailendras.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt; This temple is modelled after the Buddhist concept of universe, the [[Mandala]] which counts 505 images of the seated Buddha and unique bell-shaped stupa that contains the statue of Buddha. Borobudur is adorned with long series of bas-reliefs narrated the holy Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas | author = John Miksic | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781462909100 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=borobudur+golden+tales+of+the+buddhas&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP45O7r_rVAhWJtY8KHcpuAfYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20art&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Buddhist structure in Indonesia probably is the [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] stupas at Karawang, West Java, dated from around the 4th century. This temple is some plastered brick stupas. However, Buddhist art in Indonesia reach the golden era during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty rule in Java. The bas-reliefs and statues of [[Boddhisatva]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], and [[Kinnara]] found in [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sewu|Sewu]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], and [[Candi Plaosan|Plaosan]] temple is very graceful with serene expression, While [[Mendut]] temple near Borobudur, houses the giant statue of [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]].

In [[Sumatra]] Sri Vijaya probably built the temple of Muara Takus, and [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]]. The most beautiful example of classical Javanese Buddhist art is the serene and delicate statue of [[Prajnaparamita]] (the collection of National Museum Jakarta) the goddess of transcendental wisdom from [[Singhasari]] kingdom.&lt;ref name ="VCM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prajnaparamita | publisher =Virtual Collections of Asian Masterpieces| url  =http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=12147| accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian Buddhist Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the [[Chola]] rulers of India, then followed by [[Majapahit]] empire.

==Contemporary Buddhist art==
[[File:Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism (1916) (14779469804).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration from the book "Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism" (1916).]]
Many contemporary artists have made use of Buddhist themes. Notable examples are [[Bill Viola]], in his video installations,&lt;ref&gt;Buddha Mind in Contemporary Art, University of California Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Connell]], in sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;ARTlines, April 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allan Graham]] in his multi-media "Time is Memory".&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Rail, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK [[The Network of Buddhist Organisations]] has interested itself in identifying Buddhist practitioners across all the arts. In 2005 it co-ordinated the UK-wide Buddhist arts festival, "A Lotus in Flower";&lt;ref&gt;a poster advertising one of the events is archived here - http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824213345/http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf# |date=24 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 it helped organise the two-day arts conference, "Buddha Mind, Creative Mind".&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwbo-news.blogspot.com/2009/07/report-from-buddha-mind-creative-mind.html |title=Triratna Buddhist Community News: Report from ‘Buddha Mind - Creative Mind?’ conference |author=Lokabandhu |publisher=fwbo-news.blogspot.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the latter an association of Buddhist artists was formed.&lt;ref name="ning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dharmaarts.ning.com/ |title=Dharma Arts Network - Launched at Buddha Mind - Creative Mind ? |publisher=dharmaarts.ning.com |accessdate=2014-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010000408/http://dharmaarts.ning.com/# |archive-date=10 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Catalan Institute of Nanotechnology (ICN)''' (NanoCAT or Institut Català de Nanotecnologia) was established in 2003, at the initiative of the Catalan government and the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (UAB), Catalonia, with the aim of attracting international research talent to create a world renowned centre for [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]] research. 

Research focused in the following areas:
* Synthesis and applications of [[nanoparticles]] and [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]]
* Design and synthesis of [[macromolecules]] for the integration of nanodevices
* [[Magnetism]] of thin films and spintronics
* Imaging and manipulation of [[atoms]] and [[molecules]]
* Theory of surfaces and inter-phases
* Interaction of [[biomaterials]] with inorganic matter

Following collaborations between the ICN and the Spanish government's Centre for Research in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (CIN2), the ICN and the Spanish Research Council (CSIC) agreed to put their collaboration on an official footing and signed a memorandum of understanding to this effect in 2006. 

This agreement was formalised in 2011, when CSIC representatives joined the ICN's board of patrons and then in 2013, when the ICN changed its name to the [[Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2)]].

The '''center of pressure ''' is the point where the total sum of a [[pressure]] field acts on a body, causing a [[force]] to act through that point. The total force vector acting at the center of pressure is the value of the integrated vectorial pressure field.  The resultant force and center of pressure location produce equivalent force and moment on the body as the original pressure field. Pressure fields occur in both static and dynamic fluid mechanics.  Specification of the center of pressure, the reference point from which the center of pressure is referenced, and the associated force vector allows the moment generated about any point to be computed by a translation from the reference point to the desired new point. It is common for the center of pressure to be located on the body, but in fluid flows it is possible for the pressure field to exert a [[Moment (physics)|moment]] on the body of such magnitude that the center of pressure is located outside the body.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Hydrostatic example (dam)==
Since the forces of water on a dam are [[hydrostatic]] forces, they vary linearly with depth.  The total force on the dam is then the integral of the pressure multiplied by the width of the dam as a function of the depth.  The center of pressure is located at the [[centroid]] of the triangular shaped pressure field 2/3 from the top of the water line. The hydrostatic force and tipping moment on the dam about some point can be computed from the total force and center of pressure location relative to the point of interest.

==Historical usage for sailboats==
Center of pressure is used in [[sailboat]] design to represent the position on a [[sail]] where the [[aerodynamic force]] is concentrated.

The relationship of the aerodynamic center of pressure on the sails to the hydrodynamic center of pressure (referred to as the [[center of lateral resistance]]) on the hull determines the behavior of the boat in the wind.  This behavior is known as the "helm" and is either a [[weather helm]] or lee helm. A slight amount of weather helm is thought by some sailors to be a desirable situation, both from the standpoint of the "feel" of the helm, and the tendency of the boat to head slightly to windward in stronger gusts, to some extent self-feathering the sails. Other sailors disagree and prefer a neutral helm.

The fundamental cause of "helm", be it weather or lee, is the relationship of the center of pressure of the sail plan to the center of lateral resistance of the hull. If the center of pressure is astern of the center of lateral resistance, a weather helm, the tendency of the vessel is to want to turn into the wind.

If the situation is reversed, with the center of pressure forward of the center of lateral resistance of the hull, a "lee" helm will result, which is generally considered undesirable, if not dangerous. Too much of either helm is not good, since it forces the helmsman to hold the rudder deflected to counter it, thus inducing extra drag beyond what a vessel with neutral or minimal helm would experience.&lt;ref&gt;Marchaj, C.A. (1985). Sailing Theory and Practice, Revised edition. Putnam. {{ISBN|978-0-396-08428-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft aerodynamics==
A stable configuration is desirable not only in sailing, but in aircraft design as well.  Aircraft design therefore borrowed the term center of pressure.  And like a sail, a rigid non-symmetrical [[airfoil]] not only produces lift, but a [[moment (physics)|moment]].
The center of pressure of an aircraft is the point where all of the aerodynamic pressure field may be represented by a single force vector with no moment.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D., ''Aircraft Performance and Design'', Section 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar idea is the [[aerodynamic center]] which is the point on an [[airfoil]] where the [[pitching moment]] produced by the aerodynamic forces is constant with [[angle of attack]].&lt;ref name="selkirk"&gt;{{cite web

The [[aerodynamic center]] plays an important role in analysis of the [[longitudinal static stability]] of all [[flying machine]]s.  It is desirable that when the pitch angle and angle of attack of an aircraft are disturbed (by, for example [[turbulence]]) that the aircraft returns to its original trimmed pitch angle and [[angle of attack]] without a pilot or [[autopilot]] changing the control surface deflection. For an aircraft to return towards its trimmed attitude, without input from a pilot or autopilot, it must have positive [[longitudinal static stability]].&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 16.1 and 16.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missile aerodynamics==
Missiles typically do not have a preferred plane or direction of maneuver and thus have symmetric airfoils.  Since the center of pressure for symmetric airfoils is relatively constant for small angle of attack, missile engineers typically speak of the complete center of pressure of the entire vehicle for stability and control analysis.  In missile analysis, the center of pressure is typically defined as the center of the additional pressure field due to a change in the angle of attack off of the trim angle of attack.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, F.G., Approximate Methods for Weapon Aerodynamics, AIAA Progress in Astronatuics and Aeronautics, Volume 186

For unguided rockets the trim position is typically zero angle of attack and the center of pressure is defined to be the center of pressure of the resultant flow field on the entire vehicle resulting from a very small angle of attack (that is, the center of pressure in the limit as angle of attack goes to zero).  For positive stability in missiles, the total vehicle center of pressure defined as given above must be further from the nose of the vehicle than the [[center of gravity]].  In missiles at lower angles of attack, the contributions to the center of pressure are dominated by the nose, wings, and fins.  The normalized [[normal force]] coefficient derivative with respect to the angle of attack of each component multiplied by the location of the center of pressure can be used to compute a centroid representing the total center of pressure.  The center of pressure of the added flow field is behind the center of gravity and the additional force "points" in the direction of the added angle of attack; this produces a moment that pushes the vehicle back to the trim position.

In guided missiles where the fins can be moved to trim the vehicles in different angles of attack, the center of pressure is the center of pressure of the flow field at that angle of attack for the undeflected fin position.  This is the center of pressure of any small change in the angle of attack (as defined above).  Once again for positive static stability, this definition of center of pressure requires that the center of pressure be further from the nose than the center of gravity.  This ensures that any increased forces resulting from increased angle of attack results in increased restoring moment to drive the missile back to the trimmed position.  In missile analysis, positive static margin implies that the complete vehicle makes a restoring moment for any angle of attack from the trim position.

== Movement of center of pressure for aerodynamic fields ==
The center of pressure on a symmetric [[airfoil]] typically lies close to 25% of the chord length behind the leading edge of the airfoil.  (This is called the "quarter-chord point".)  For a symmetric airfoil, as [[angle of attack]] and [[lift coefficient]] change, the center of pressure does not move.  It remains around the quarter-chord point for angles of attack below the stalling angle of attack.  The role of center of pressure in the control characterization of aircraft takes a different form than in missiles.

On a [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] airfoil the center of pressure does not occupy a fixed location.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.6&lt;/ref&gt;  For a conventionally cambered airfoil, the center of pressure lies a little behind the quarter-chord point at maximum [[lift coefficient]] (large [[angle of attack]]), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) the center of pressure moves toward the rear.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.11&lt;/ref&gt;  When the lift coefficient is zero an airfoil is generating no lift but a conventionally cambered airfoil generates a nose-down pitching moment, so the location of the center of pressure is an infinite distance behind the airfoil.

For a [[Camber (aerodynamics)#Definition|reflex-cambered]] airfoil, the center of pressure lies a little ahead of the quarter-chord point at maximum [[lift coefficient]] (large [[angle of attack]]), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) the center of pressure moves forward.  When the lift coefficient is zero an airfoil is generating no lift but a reflex-cambered airfoil generates a nose-up pitching moment, so the location of the center of pressure is an infinite distance ahead of the airfoil.  This direction of movement of the center of pressure on a reflex-cambered airfoil has a stabilising effect.

The way the center of pressure moves as lift coefficient changes makes it difficult to use the center of pressure in the mathematical analysis of [[longitudinal static stability]] of an aircraft.  For this reason, it is much simpler to use the [[aerodynamic center]] when carrying out a mathematical analysis.  The aerodynamic center occupies a fixed location on an airfoil, typically close to the quarter-chord point.

The aerodynamic center is the conceptual starting point for longitudinal stability. The [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|horizontal stabilizer]] contributes extra stability and this allows the center of gravity to be a small distance aft of the aerodynamic center without the aircraft reaching neutral stability. The position of the center of gravity at which the aircraft has neutral stability is called the [[neutral point (aeronautics)|neutral point]].

'''Comparative religion''' is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's [[religion]]s. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and forms of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a broadened and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]], and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Religion in the Middle East|Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], [[African religions]], [[Native American religion|American religions]], [[Religion in Oceania|Oceanic religions]], and 
[[Classical antiquity|classical]] [[Hellenistic religion]]s.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Social scientists in the 19th century took a strong interest in comparative and "primitive" religion through the work of [[Max Müller]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], [[William Robertson Smith]], [[James George Frazer]], [[Émile  Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], and [[Rudolf Otto]].&lt;ref&gt; Hans Kippenberg, ''Discovering Religious History in the Modern Age'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas de Lange]], Professor of Hebrew and Jewish Studies at [[Cambridge University]], says that

{{quote|The comparative study of religions is an academic discipline which has been developed within Christian theology faculties, and it has a tendency to force widely differing phenomena into a kind of strait-jacket cut to a Christian pattern. The problem is not only that other 'religions' may have little or nothing to say about questions which are of burning importance for Christianity, but that they may not even see themselves as religions in precisely the same way in which Christianity sees itself as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas de Lange, ''Judaism'', Oxford University Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Geographical classification ==
According to Charles Joseph Adams, in the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification discerns&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] as follows:&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

# Middle Eastern religions, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam and a variety of ancient cults; 
# East Asian religions, the religious communities of China, Japan, and Korea, and consisting of Confucianism, Daoism, the various schools of [[Mahayana]] (“Greater Vehicle”) Buddhism, and [[Shinto|Shintō]]; 
# Indian religions, including early Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Zoroastrianism, and sometimes also the [[Theravada]] (“Way of the Elders”) Buddhism and the Hindu- and Buddhist-inspired religions of South and Southeast Asia; 
# African religions, the ancient belief systems of the various indigenous peoples of Africa, excluding [[ancient Egyptian religion]], which is considered to belong to the ancient Middle East;
# American religions, the beliefs and practices of the various Indigenous peoples of the two American continents; 
# Oceanic religions, the religious systems of the peoples of the Pacific islands, Australia, and New Zealand; and 
# Classical religions of ancient Greece and Rome and their Hellenistic descendants.

=== Middle Eastern religions ===
==== Abrahamic or Western Asian religions ====
{{Main|Abrahamic religion|Western religion|Islamic religion}}

In the study of comparative religion, the category of Abrahamic religions consists of the three [[monotheistic]] religions, [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], which claim [[Abraham]] (Hebrew ''Avraham'' אַבְרָהָם; Arabic ''Ibrahim'' إبراهيم ) as a part of their sacred history. Smaller religions such as [[Bahá'í Faith]] that fit this description are sometimes included but are often omitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/abrahamic.html Why Abrahamic?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908060636/http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/abrahamic.html |date=8 September 2007 }} Lubar Institute for the Study of the Abrahamic Religions at the University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;

The original belief in the [[One God]] of Abraham eventually became strictly monotheistic present-day [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Christians believe that Christianity is the [[Supersessionism|fulfillment]] and continuation of the Jewish [[Tanakh|Old Testament]]. Christians believe that [[Jesus]] (Hebrew ''Yeshua'' יֵשׁוּעַ) is the [[Messiah]] (Christ) foretold in the [[Old Testament]] [[prophecy]], and believe in subsequent New Testament revelations based on the divine authority of Jesus in Christian belief (as the [[Incarnation|Incarnation of God]]). Islam believes the present Christian and Jewish scriptures have been [[Tahrif|corrupted]] over time and are no longer the original divine revelations as given to the [[Revelation#Mass revelation|Jewish people]] and to [[Mosaic authorship|Moses]], [[Pauline Christianity|Jesus]], and other prophets. For Muslims, the [[Qur'an]] is the final, complete revelation from [[God]] (Arabic الله ''[[Allah]]''), who believe it to have been [[divine revelation|revealed]] to [[Muhammad]] alone, who is believed by Muslims to be the [[Prophet of Islam|final prophet of Islam]], and the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]], meaning the last of the prophets ever sent by Allah ("seal of the prophets").
Based on the Muslim figure of the [[Mahdī]], the ultimate savior of humankind and the final Imām of the Twelve Imams, [[Báb|Ali Muhammad Shirazi]], later known as Bab, created the Bábí movement out of the belief that he was the gate to the Twelfth Imām. This signaled a break with Islam and started a new religious system, [[Bábism]]. However, in the 1860s a split occurred after which the vast majority of Bábís who considered Mirza Husayn `Ali or [[Bahá'u'lláh]] to be Báb's spiritual successor founded the Bahá'í Movement, while the minority who followed Subh-i-Azal came to be called Azalis.&lt;ref&gt;"But the upshot of the whole matter is, that out of every hundred Bábís probably not more than three or four are Ezelís &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, all the rest accepting Behá'u'lláh &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as the final and most perfect manifestation of the Truth." (Browne (1889) [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/articles/A-E/browne/brbabism.htm p. 351])&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í division eventually became a full-fledged religion of its own, the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. In comparison to the other Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the number of adherents for Bahai faith and other minor Abrahamic religions are not very significant.

Out of the three major Abrahamic faiths, [[Christianity and Judaism]] are the two religions that diverge the most in theology and practice.

The historical interaction of [[Islam and Judaism]] started in the 7th century CE with the origin and spread of Islam. There are many common aspects between Islam and Judaism, and as Islam [[History of Islam|developed]], it gradually became the major religion closest to Judaism. As opposed to Christianity, which originated from interaction between ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Roman empire|Roman]], and [[Hebrew]] cultures, Judaism is very similar to Islam in its fundamental religious outlook, structure, jurisprudence and practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rabbi David Rosen]], [http://rabbidavidrosen.net/doc/Muslim-Jewish%20Relations/Jewish-Muslim%20Relations,%20Past%20&amp;%20Present%20Nov%2003.doc Jewish-Muslim Relations, Past and Present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616163849/http://rabbidavidrosen.net/doc/Muslim-Jewish%20Relations/Jewish-Muslim%20Relations%2C%20Past%20%26%20Present%20Nov%2003.doc |date=16 June 2007 }}, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There are many traditions within Islam originating from traditions within the [[Hebrew Bible]] or from post-biblical Jewish traditions. These practices are known collectively as the ''[[Isra'iliyat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Justin Jaron Lewis, [http://post.queensu.ca/~jjl/islam.html  Islam and Judaism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405102236/http://post.queensu.ca/~jjl/islam.html |date=5 April 2007 }}, October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical interaction between [[Christianity and Islam]] connects fundamental ideas in Christianity with similar ones in Islam. Islam accepts many aspects of Christianity as part of its faith{{snd}}with some differences in interpretation{{snd}}and rejects other aspects. Islam believes the [[Qur'an]] is the final revelation from [[God]] and a completion of all previous revelations, including the [[Bible]].

==== Iranian religions ====
{{Main|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Iranian religions}}

Several important religions and religious movements originated in [[Greater Iran]], that is, among [[Iranian peoples|speakers of various Iranian languages]]. They include [[Mithraism]], [[Ætsæg Din]], [[Yazdanism]], [[Yarsanism|Ahl-e Haqq]], [[Zurvanism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Manichaeism]], and [[Mazdakism]].

=== East Asian or Taoic religions ===
[[File:Tao.svg|thumb|150px|The [[Chinese character]] depicting ''[[Tao]]'', the central concept in Taoism]]

{{Main|East Asian religions|East Asian Buddhism}}
{{See also|Tao|De (Chinese)}}

A Taoic religion is a religion, or religious philosophy, that focuses on the [[East Asian]] concept of ''[[Tao]]'' ("The Way"). This forms a large group of religions including [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Jeung San Do]], [[Shinto]], [[I-Kuan Tao]], [[Cheondoism|Chondogyo]], [[Chen Tao (True Way Cult)|Chen Tao]] and [[Cao Dai]]. In large parts of East Asia, [[Buddhism]] has taken on some taoic features.

''Tao'' can be roughly stated to be the flow of the universe, or the force behind the natural order. It is believed to be the influence that keeps the universe balanced and ordered and is associated with nature, due to a belief that nature demonstrates the ''Tao''. The flow of ''[[Ch'i]]'', as the essential energy of action and existence, is compared to the universal order of ''Tao''. Following the ''Tao'' is also associated with a "proper" attitude, morality and lifestyle. This is intimately tied to the complex concept of ''[[De (Chinese)|De]]'', or literally "virtue" or "power." ''De'' is the active expression of ''Tao''.

Taoism and [[Chinese Chán|Ch'an Buddhism]] for centuries had a mutual influence on each other in China, Korea and Vietnam. These influences were inherited by [[Zen Buddhism]] when Ch'an Buddhism arrived in Japan and adapted as Zen Buddhism.

'''Contact mechanics''' is the study of the [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of [[solids]] that touch each other at one or more points.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;Johnson, K. L, 1985, '''Contact mechanics''', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popov&gt;Popov, Valentin L., 2010,  ''Contact Mechanics and Friction. Physical Principles and Applications'', Springer-Verlag, 362 p., {{ISBN|978-3-642-10802-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A central distinction in contact mechanics is between [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]] acting [[perpendicular]] to the contacting bodies' surfaces (known as the [[normal vector|normal direction]]) and [[friction]]al stresses acting [[Tangential and normal components|tangentially]] between the surfaces. This page focuses mainly on the normal direction, i.e. on frictionless contact mechanics. [[Frictional contact mechanics]] is discussed separately.  Normal stresses are caused by applied forces and by the [[adhesion]] present on surfaces in close contact even if they are clean and dry.

Contact mechanics is part of mechanical [[engineering]].  The physical and mathematical formulation of the subject is built upon the [[mechanics of materials]] and [[continuum mechanics]] and focuses on computations involving [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]], and [[Plastic Deformation|plastic]] bodies in [[Statics|static]] or [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamic]] contact. Contact mechanics provides necessary information for the safe and energy efficient design of technical systems and for the study of [[tribology]], [[normal contact stiffness|contact stiffness]], [[Contact resistance|electrical contact resistance]] and [[indentation hardness]]. Principles of contacts mechanics are implemented towards applications such as locomotive wheel-rail contact, [[coupling]] devices, [[Brake|braking]] systems, [[tire]]s, [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engines]], [[Linkage (mechanical)|mechanical linkage]]s, [[gasket]] seals, [[metalworking]], metal forming, [[ultrasonic welding]], [[Electrical connector|electrical contacts]], and many others. Current challenges faced in the field may include [[stress analysis]] of contact and coupling members and the influence of [[lubrication]] and material [[design]] on [[friction]] and [[wear]]. Applications of contact mechanics further extend into the [[Microtechnology|micro]]- and [[Nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] realm.

The original work in contact mechanics dates back to 1882 with the publication of the paper "On the contact of elastic solids"&lt;ref&gt;H. Hertz, Über die berührung fester elastischer Körper (On the contact of rigid elastic solids). In: ''[https://archive.org/details/cu31924012500306 Miscellaneous Papers]''. Jones and Schott, Editors, ''J. reine und angewandte Mathematik'' 92, Macmillan, London (1896), p. 156 English translation: Hertz, H.&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=251917 "Ueber die Berührung fester elastischer Körper"]) by [[Heinrich Hertz]]. Hertz was attempting to understand how the optical properties of multiple, stacked [[lens (optics)|lenses]] might change with the [[force]] holding them together. Hertzian contact stress refers to the localized stresses that develop as two curved surfaces come in contact and deform slightly under the imposed loads. This amount of deformation is dependent on the [[modulus of elasticity]] of the material in contact. It gives the contact stress as a function of the normal contact force, the radii of curvature of both bodies and the modulus of elasticity of both bodies. Hertzian contact stress forms the foundation for the equations for load bearing capabilities and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] life in bearings, gears, and any other bodies where two surfaces are in contact.

== History ==
[[File:Hertz contact animated.gif|290px|thumb|widthpx|When a sphere is pressed against an elastic material, the contact area increases.]]
Classical contact mechanics is most notably associated with Heinrich Hertz.&lt;ref name=Hertz&gt;Hertz, H. R., 1882, ''Ueber die Beruehrung elastischer Koerper (On Contact Between Elastic Bodies),'' in '''Gesammelte Werke''' (Collected Works), Vol. 1, Leipzig, Germany, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, Hertz solved the contact problem of two elastic bodies with curved surfaces. This still-relevant classical solution provides a foundation for modern problems in contact mechanics. For example, in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[tribology]], ''Hertzian contact stress'' is a description of the stress within mating parts. The Hertzian contact stress usually refers to the stress close to the area of contact between two spheres of different radii.

It was not until nearly one hundred years later that [[Kenneth L. Johnson|Johnson]], Kendall, and Roberts found a similar solution for the case of [[Adhesion|adhesive]] contact.&lt;ref name=jkr&gt;K. L. Johnson and K. Kendall and A. D. Roberts, Surface energy and the contact of elastic solids, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 324 (1971) 301-313&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory was rejected by [[Boris Derjaguin]] and co-workers&lt;ref name=Maugis&gt;D. Maugis, Contact, Adhesion and Rupture of Elastic Solids, Springer-Verlag, Solid-State Sciences, Berlin 2000, {{ISBN|3-540-66113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed a different theory of adhesion&lt;ref name=DMT&gt;Derjaguin, BV and Muller, VM and Toporov, Y.P., 1975, ''Effect of contact deformations on the adhesion of particles'', Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 53(2), pp. 314-326&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1970s. The Derjaguin model came to be known as the DMT (after Derjaguin, Muller and Toporov) model,&lt;ref name=DMT/&gt; and the Johnson et al. model came to be known as the JKR (after Johnson, Kendall and Roberts) model for adhesive elastic contact. This rejection proved to be instrumental in the development of the Tabor&lt;ref name=Tabor&gt;D. Tabor, The hardness of solids, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 58 (1977) 145-179&lt;/ref&gt; and later Maugis&lt;ref name=Maugis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maugis1&gt;D. Maugis, Adhesion of spheres: The JKR-DMT transition using a Dugdale model, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 150 (1992) 243--269&lt;/ref&gt; parameters that quantify which contact model (of the JKR and DMT models) represent adhesive contact better for specific materials.

Further advancement in the field of contact mechanics in the mid-twentieth century may be attributed to names such as [[Frank Philip Bowden|Bowden]] and [[David Tabor|Tabor]]. Bowden and Tabor were the first to emphasize the importance of surface roughness for bodies in contact.&lt;ref name=bowden1939&gt;, Bowden, FP and Tabor, D., 1939, ''The area of contact between stationary and between moving surfaces'', Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, 169(938), pp. 391--413.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bowden2001&gt;Bowden, F.P. and Tabor, D., 2001, '''The friction and lubrication of solids''', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Through investigation of the surface roughness, the true contact area between friction partners is found to be less than the apparent contact area. Such understanding also drastically changed the direction of undertakings in tribology. The works of Bowden and Tabor yielded several theories in contact mechanics of rough surfaces.

The contributions of Archard (1957)&lt;ref name=archard1957&gt;Archard, JF, 1957, ''Elastic deformation and the laws of friction'',  Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, 243(1233), pp.190--205.&lt;/ref&gt; must also be mentioned in discussion of pioneering works in this field. Archard concluded that, even for rough elastic surfaces, the contact area is approximately proportional to the [[normal force]]. Further important insights along these lines were provided by Greenwood and Williamson (1966),&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, JA and Williamson, JBP., 1966, ''Contact of nominally flat surfaces'', Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, pp. 300-319.&lt;/ref&gt; Bush (1975),&lt;ref&gt;Bush, AW and Gibson, RD and Thomas, TR., 1975, ''The elastic contact of a rough surface'', Wear, 35(1), pp. 87-111.&lt;/ref&gt; and Persson (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Persson, BNJ and Bucher, F. and Chiaia, B., 2002, ''Elastic contact between randomly rough surfaces: Comparison of theory with numerical results'', Physical Review B, 65(18), p. 184106.&lt;/ref&gt; The main findings of these works were that the true contact surface in rough materials is generally proportional to the normal force, while the parameters of individual micro-contacts (i.e., pressure, size of the micro-contact) are only weakly dependent upon the load.

== Classical solutions for non-adhesive elastic contact ==
The theory of contact between elastic bodies can be used to find contact areas and indentation depths for simple geometries.  Some commonly used solutions are listed below.  The theory used to compute these solutions is discussed later in the article.

=== Contact between a sphere and a half-space ===
[[File:Contact sphere-plane.jpg|thumb|Contact of an elastic sphere with an elastic half-space]]
An elastic [[sphere]] of [[radius]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; indents an elastic [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] to depth &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and thus creates a contact area of radius 
:&lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{Rd}&lt;/math&gt; 
The applied force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is related to the displacement &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; by&lt;ref name ="contmech"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=D. A. H.| last2=Gan| first2=Y.| last3=Einav| first3=I.| title= Contact mechanics of fractal surfaces by spline assisted discretisation| journal= International Journal of Solids and Structures| year=2015| volume=59| pages=121–131| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768315000323| doi=10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2015.01.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  F=\tfrac{4}{3} E^*R^{1/2}d^{3/2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{1}{E^*}=\frac{1-\nu^2_1}{E_1}+\frac{1-\nu^2_2}{E_2}
&lt;/math&gt;
and  &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Elastic modulus|elastic moduli]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu_1&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\nu_2&lt;/math&gt; the [[Poisson's ratio]]s associated with each body.

The distribution of normal pressure in the contact area as a function of distance from the center of the circle is&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  p(r) = p_0\left(1-\frac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{1/2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum contact pressure given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   p_0 = \cfrac{3F}{2\pi a^2} = \cfrac{1}{\pi}\left(\cfrac{6F{E^*}^2}{R^2}\right)^{1/3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The radius of the circle is related to the applied load &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{3 F R}{4 E^*}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The depth of indentation &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is related to the maximum contact pressure by
:&lt;math&gt;
   d = \cfrac{a^2}{R} = \left(\cfrac{9F^2}{16{E^*}^2R}\right)^{1/3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The maximum shear stress occurs in the interior at &lt;math&gt;z\approx 0.49a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\nu = 0.33&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Contact between two spheres ===
[[File:Kontakt Kugel Kugel.jpg|120px|thumb|Contact between two spheres.]]
[[File:Kontakt gekreuzter Zylinder.jpg|thumb|Contact between two crossed cylinders of equal radius.]]
For contact between two spheres of radii &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, the area of contact is a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. The equations are the same as for a sphere in contact with a half plane except that the effective radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;ref name="contmech"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Contact between two crossed cylinders of equal radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;===
This is equivalent to contact between a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].

=== Contact between a rigid cylinder with flat-ended and an elastic half-space ===
[[File:Kontakt Zylindrischer Indenter Ebene.jpg|thumb|Contact between a rigid cylindrical indenter and an elastic half-space.]]

If a rigid [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] is pressed into an elastic half-space, it creates a pressure distribution described by&lt;ref name=Sneddon&gt;Sneddon, I. N., 1965, ''The Relation between Load and Penetration in the Axisymmetric Boussinesq Problem for a Punch of Arbitrary Profile.'' Int. J. Eng. Sci. v. 3, pp. 47–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   p(r)=p_0\left(1-\frac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{-1/2}
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the cylinder and
:&lt;math&gt;
  p_0=\frac{1}{\pi}E^*\frac{d}{a}
&lt;/math&gt;
The relationship between the indentation depth and the normal force is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  F=2aE^*d\,
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Contact between a rigid conical indenter and an elastic half-space===
[[File:Kontakt Kegel Ebene.jpg|thumb|Contact between a rigid conical indenter and an elastic half-space.]]
In the case of [[Indentation hardness|indentation]] of an elastic half-space of Young's modulus &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; using a rigid [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] indenter, the depth of the contact region &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and contact radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are related by&lt;ref name=Sneddon/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \epsilon=a\tan\theta
    &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; defined as the angle between the plane and the side surface of the cone.  The total indentation depth &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is given by:&lt;math&gt;
d=\frac{\pi}{2}\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

The total force is
:&lt;math&gt;
  F =\frac{\pi E}{2 \left(1-\nu^2\right)} a^2 \tan \theta=\frac{2E}{\pi\left(1-\nu^2\right)}\frac{d^2}{\tan \theta}
&lt;/math&gt;

The pressure distribution is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  p {\left( r \right)}=\frac{Ed}{\pi a\left(1-\nu^2\right)}\ln\left(\frac{a}{r}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^2-1}\right)
= \frac{Ed}{\pi a\left(1-\nu^2\right)} \cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
The stress has a [[logarithm]]ic [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] at the tip of the cone.

===Contact between two cylinders with parallel axes===
[[File:Kontakt paralleler Zylinder.jpg|thumb|Contact between two cylinders with parallel axes]]
In contact between two cylinders with parallel axes, the force is linearly proportional to the length of cylinders ''L'' and to the indentation depth ''d'':&lt;ref name=Popov4&gt;Popov, V.L., "Contact Mechanics and Friction: Physical Principles and Applications"&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  F\approx\frac{\pi}{4}E^*Ld
&lt;/math&gt;
The radii of curvature are entirely absent from this relationship. The contact radius is described through the usual relationship
:&lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{Rd}
&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;
as in contact between two spheres. The maximum pressure is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;
  p_0=\left(\frac{E^*F}{\pi LR}\right)^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Bearing contact ===

{{main|Bearing pressure}}

The contact in the case of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] is often a contact between a convex surface (male cylinder or sphere) and a concave surface (female cylinder or sphere: [[Boring (manufacturing)|bore]] or [[Spherical bearing|hemispherical cup]]).

=== The Method of Dimensionality Reduction ===
[[File:WikipediabilderKap 4.jpg|thumb|Contact between a sphere and an elastic half-space and one-dimensional replaced model.]]
Some contact problems can be solved with the Method of Dimensionality Reduction (MDR).
In this method, the initial three-dimensional system is replaced with a contact of a body with a linear elastic or viscoelastic foundation (see Fig). The properties of one-dimensional systems coincide exactly with those of the original three-dimensional system, if the form of the bodies is modified and the elements of the foundation are defined according to the rules of the MDR.
&lt;ref name=Popov2&gt;Popov, V.L., ''Method of reduction of dimensionality in contact and friction mechanics: A linkage between micro and macro scales,'' Friction, 2013, v.1, N. 1, pp.41–62.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Popov3&gt;Popov, V.L. and Heß, M., '''Methode der Dimensionsreduktion in Kontaktmechanik und Reibung''', Springer, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for exact analytical results, it is required that the contact problem is axisymmetric and the contacts are compact.

== Hertzian theory of non-adhesive elastic contact ==
The classical theory of contact focused primarily on non-adhesive contact where no tension force is allowed to occur within the contact area, i.e., contacting bodies can be separated without adhesion forces.  Several analytical and numerical approaches have been used to solve contact problems that satisfy the no-adhesion condition.  Complex forces and [[moment (physics)|moments]] are transmitted between the bodies where they touch, so problems in contact mechanics can become quite sophisticated.  In addition, the contact stresses are usually a nonlinear function of the deformation.  To simplify the solution procedure, a [[frame of reference]] is usually defined in which the objects (possibly in motion relative to one another) are static. They interact through surface tractions (or pressures/stresses) at their interface.

As an example, consider two objects which meet at some surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in the (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;)-plane with the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis assumed normal to the surface. One of the bodies will experience a normally-directed [[pressure]] distribution &lt;math&gt;p_z=p(x,y)=q_z(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and in-plane [[surface traction]] distributions &lt;math&gt;q_x=q_x(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_y=q_y(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; over the region &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In terms of a [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]] force balance, the forces:
:&lt;math&gt;
  P_z = \int_S p(x,y)~ \mathrm{d}A ~;~~ Q_x = \int_S q_x(x,y)~ \mathrm{d}A ~;~~ Q_y = \int_S q_y(x,y)~ \mathrm{d}A
 &lt;/math&gt;
must be equal and opposite to the forces established in the other body. The moments corresponding to these forces:
:&lt;math&gt;
  M_x = \int_S y~p(x,y)~ \mathrm{d}A ~;~~ M_y = \int_S x~p(x,y)~ \mathrm{d}A ~;~~ M_z = \int_S [x~q_y(x,y) - y~q_x(x,y)]~ \mathrm{d}A
  &lt;/math&gt;
are also required to cancel between bodies so that they are [[kinematics|kinematically]] immobile.

=== Assumptions in Hertzian theory===
The following assumptions are made in determining the solutions of '''Hertzian''' contact problems:
* The strains are small and within the elastic limit.
* The surfaces are continuous and non-conforming (implying that the area of contact is much smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the contacting bodies).
* Each body can be considered an elastic half-space.
* The surfaces are frictionless.
Additional complications arise when some or all these assumptions are violated and such contact problems are usually called '''non-Hertzian'''.

=== Analytical solution techniques ===
[[File:Hertz.svg|right|thumb|290px|Contact between two spheres.]]
Analytical solution methods for non-adhesive contact problem can be classified into two types based on the geometry of the area of contact.&lt;ref name=Shigley&gt;Shigley, J.E., Mischke, C.R., 1989, '''Mechanical Engineering Design''', Fifth Edition, Chapter 2, McGraw-Hill, Inc, 1989, {{ISBN|0-07-056899-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A '''conforming contact''' is one in which the two bodies touch at multiple points before any deformation takes place (i.e., they just "fit together").  A '''non-conforming contact''' is one in which the shapes of the bodies are dissimilar enough that, under zero load, they only touch at a point (or possibly along a line). In the non-conforming case, the contact area is small compared to the sizes of the objects and the [[stress (physics)|stresses]] are highly concentrated in this area. Such a contact is called ''concentrated'', otherwise it is called ''diversified''.

A common approach in [[linear elasticity]] is to [[Superposition principle|superpose]] a number of solutions each of which corresponds to a point load acting over the area of contact.  For example, in the case of loading of a [[half-plane]], the [[Flamant solution]] is often used as a starting point and then generalized to various shapes of the area of contact.  The force and moment balances between the two bodies in contact act as additional constraints to the solution.

==== Point contact on a (2D) half-plane ====
{{Main|Flamant solution}}
[[File:Point contact fig.svg|thumb|right|290px|Schematic of the loading on a plane by force P at a point (0,0).]]
A starting point for solving contact problems is to understand the effect of a "point-load" applied to an isotropic, homogeneous, and linear elastic half-plane, shown in the figure to the right. The problem may be either [[plane stress]] or [[plane strain]]. This is a [[boundary value problem]] of linear elasticity subject to the traction [[boundary condition]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{xz} (x,0)=0 ~;~~ \sigma_z (x,z)=-P\delta (x,z)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta function]].  The boundary conditions state that there are no shear stresses on the surface and a singular normal force P is applied at (0,0). Applying these conditions to the governing equations of elasticity produces the result
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  \sigma_{xx} &amp; =-\frac{2P}{\pi}\frac{x^2z}{(x^2+z^2)^2} \\
  \sigma_{zz} &amp;=-\frac{2P}{\pi}\frac{z^3}{(x^2+z^2)^2} \\
  \sigma_{xz} &amp; =-\frac{2P}{\pi}\frac{xz^2}{(x^2+z^2)^2}
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
for some point, &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, in the half-plane. The circle shown in the figure indicates a surface on which the maximum shear stress is constant. From this stress field, the [[strain (materials science)|strain]] components and thus the [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacements]] of all material points may be determined.

==== Line contact on a (2D) half-plane ====

===== Normal loading over a region &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;=====
Suppose, rather than a point load &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, a distributed load &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the surface instead, over the range &lt;math&gt;a&lt;x&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The principle of linear superposition can be applied to determine the resulting stress field as the solution to the [[integral]] equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \sigma_{xx} &amp; =-\frac{2z}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{p(x')(x-x')^2\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2} ~;~~
    \sigma_{zz} =-\frac{2z^3}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{p(x')\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2} \\
    \sigma_{xz} &amp; =-\frac{2z^2}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{p(x')(x-x')\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2}
  \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;

===== Shear loading over a region &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;=====
The same principle applies for loading on the surface in the plane of the surface. These kinds of tractions would tend to arise as a result of friction. The solution is similar the above (for both singular loads &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and distributed loads &lt;math&gt;q(x)&lt;/math&gt;) but altered slightly:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \sigma_{xx} &amp; =-\frac{2}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{q(x')(x-x')^3\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2} ~;~~
    \sigma_{zz} =-\frac{2z^2}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{q(x')(x-x')\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2} \\
    \sigma_{xz} &amp; =-\frac{2z}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{q(x')(x-x')^2\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2}
  \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
These results may themselves be superposed onto those given above for normal loading to deal with more complex loads.

====  Point contact on a (3D) half-space ====
Analogously to the Flamant solution for the 2D half-plane, fundamental solutions are known for the linearly elastic 3D half-space as well. These were found by [[Joseph Valentin Boussinesq|Boussinesq]] for a concentrated normal load and by Cerruti for a tangential load. See the section on this in [[Linear elasticity#Solutions for elastostatic cases|Linear elasticity]].

=== Numerical solution techniques ===
Distinctions between conforming and non-conforming contact do not have to be made when numerical solution schemes are employed to solve contact problems. These methods do not rely on further assumptions within the solution process since they base solely on the general formulation of the underlying equations

The first simply restricts the motion and deformation of the bodies by the assumption that no penetration can occur. Hence the gap &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; between two bodies can only be positive or zero
:&lt;math&gt;h \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h = 0&lt;/math&gt; denotes contact. The second assumption in contact mechanics is related to the fact, that no tension force is allowed to occur within the contact area (contacting bodies can be lifted up without adhesion forces). This leads to an inequality which the stresses have to obey at the contact interface. It is formulated for the normal stress  &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n  = \mathbf{t} \cdot \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

At locations where there is contact between the surfaces the gap is zero, i.e. &lt;math&gt;h = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and there the normal stress is different than zero, indeed, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. At locations where the surfaces are not in contact the normal stress is identical to zero; &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, while the gap is positive, i.e., &lt;math&gt;h &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. This type of complementarity formulation can be expressed in the so-called [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions|Kuhn–Tucker]] form, viz.
:&lt;math&gt;h \ge 0\,, \quad \sigma_n \le 0\,, \quad \sigma_n\,h = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;
These conditions are valid in a general way. The mathematical formulation of the gap depends upon the kinematics of the underlying theory of the solid (e.g., linear or nonlinear solid in two- or three dimensions, [[beam theory|beam]] or [[plate theory|shell]] model). By restating the normal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n &lt;/math&gt; in terms of the contact pressure, &lt;math&gt;p &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;p=-\sigma_n &lt;/math&gt;the Kuhn-Tucker problem can be restated as in standard complementarity form, i.e.&lt;math display="block"&gt;h \ge 0\,, \quad p \ge 0\,, \quad p\,h = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;In the linear elastic case the gap can be formulated as &lt;math display="block"&gt;{h} = h_0+{g} + u, &lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;h_0 &lt;/math&gt;is the rigid body separation, &lt;math&gt;g &lt;/math&gt; is the geometry/topography of the contact (cylinder and roughness) and &lt;math&gt;u &lt;/math&gt; is the elastic deformation/deflection. If the contacting bodies are approximated as linear elastic half spaces, the Boussinesq-Cerruti integral equation solution can be applied to express the deformation (&lt;math&gt;u &lt;/math&gt;) as a function of the contact pressure (&lt;math&gt;p &lt;/math&gt;), i.e.,&lt;math display="block"&gt;u=\int_\infty^\infty K(x-s)p(s)ds,&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="block"&gt;K(x-s) = \frac{2}{\pi E^*}\ln|x-s|&lt;/math&gt;for line loading of an elastic half space and&lt;math display="block"&gt;K(x-s) = \frac{1}{\pi E^*}\frac{1}{\sqrt{(x_1-s_1)^2+(x_2-s_2)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;for point loading of an elastic half-space.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

After discretization the linear elastic contact mechanics problem can be stated in standard Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898719000|title=The Linear Complementarity Problem|last=Cottle|first=R.|last2=Pang|first2=J.|last3=Stone|first3=R.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|isbn=9780898716863|series=Classics in Applied Mathematics|doi=10.1137/1.9780898719000}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{array}{c}

== Contact between rough surfaces ==
When two bodies with rough surfaces are pressed into each other, the true contact area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than the apparent contact area &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt;. The mechanics of contacting rough surfaces are discussed in terms of normal contact mechanics and static frictional interactions. Natural and engineering surfaces typically exhibit roughness features, known as asperities, across a broad range of length scales down to the molecular level, with surface structures exhibiting self affinity, also known as [[fractal|surface fractality]]. It is recognized that the self affine structure of surfaces is the origin of the linear scaling of true contact area with applied pressure.&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt; Assuming a model of shearing welded contacts, this linearity between contact area and pressure can also be considered the origin of the  linearity of the relationship between static friction and applied normal force.

In contact between a "random rough" surface and an elastic half-space, the true contact area is related to the normal force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mikic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hyun&gt;Hyun, S., and M.O. Robbins, 2007, ''Elastic contact between rough surfaces: Effect of roughness at large and small wavelengths.'' Tribology International, v.40, pp. 1413-1422.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   A=\frac{\kappa}{E^*h'}F
 &lt;/math&gt;
with  &lt;math&gt;h'&lt;/math&gt;  equal to the root mean square (also known as the quadratic mean) of the surface slope and &lt;math&gt;\kappa \approx2&lt;/math&gt; . The median pressure in the true contact surface
:&lt;math&gt;
  p_{\mathrm{av}} =\frac{F}{A}\approx\frac{1}{2}E^*h'
 &lt;/math&gt;
can be reasonably estimated as half of the effective elastic modulus &lt;math&gt;E^*&lt;/math&gt; multiplied with the root mean square of the surface slope &lt;math&gt;h'&lt;/math&gt; .

== An overview of the GW model ==
Greenwood and Williamson in 1966 (GW)&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt; proposed a theory of elastic 
contact mechanics of rough surfaces which is today the foundation of many theories 
in tribology (friction, adhesion, thermal and electrical conductance, wear, etc.).
They considered the contact between a smooth rigid plane and a nominally flat 
deformable rough surface covered with round tip asperities of the same radius R.
Their theory assumes that the deformation of each asperity is independent of that of its neighbours and is described by the Hertz model.
The heights of asperities have a random distribution. The probability that asperity height
is between &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z + dz&lt;/math&gt; is  &lt;math&gt;\phi(z)dz&lt;/math&gt;.
The authors calculated the number of contact spots n, the total contact area 
&lt;math&gt;A_r&lt;/math&gt; and the total load P in general case. They gave those formulas in two forms: in the basic and using standardized variables.
If one assumes that N asperities covers a rough surface, then the expected number of contacts is

:&lt;math&gt;
n=N\int_d^\infty \phi(z) dz
&lt;/math&gt;

The expected total area of contact can be calculated  from the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
A_a=N\pi R \int_d^\infty (z-d) \phi(z) dz
&lt;/math&gt;

and the expected total force is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
P=\frac{4}{3}N E_r \sqrt{R} \int_d^\infty (z-d)^{3/2} \phi(z) dz
&lt;/math&gt;

where: R - radius of curvature of the microasperity,
z - height of the microasperity measured from the profile line,
d - close the surface,
&lt;math&gt;E_r=(\frac{1-\nu_1^2}{E_1}+\frac{1-\nu_2^2}{E_2})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; - composite Young’s modulus of elasticity,
&lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; - modulus of elasticity of the surface,
&lt;math&gt;\nu_i&lt;/math&gt; - Poisson's surface coefficients.

They introduced standardized separation  
&lt;math&gt;h=d/\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and  standardized height distribution &lt;math&gt;\phi^*(s)&lt;/math&gt;
whose standard deviation is equal to one. Below are presented the formulas in the standardized form.

:&lt;math&gt;
F_n(h)=\int_h^\infty (s-h)^n \phi^*(s) ds
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
n=\eta A_n F_0(h)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
A_a=\pi \eta A R \sigma F_1(h)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
P=\frac{4}{3} \eta A E_r \sqrt{R} \sigma^{3/2} F_{3/2}(h) 
&lt;/math&gt;

where: d is the separation, 
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the nominal contact area,
&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the surface density of asperities,
&lt;math&gt;E^*&lt;/math&gt; is the effective Young modulus.

Recently the exact approximants to &lt;math&gt;A_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; were published by Jedynak&lt;ref name=Jedynak&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301679X18304493] Jedynak, R., (2019), ''Exact and approximate solutions of the infinite integrals of the asperity height distribution for the Greenwood-Williamson and the Greenwood-Tripp asperity contact models'', Tribology International, 130, pp. 206-215.&lt;/ref&gt;. They are given by the following rational formulas, which are very exact approximants to integrals &lt;math&gt;F_n(h)&lt;/math&gt;. They are calculated for the Gaussian distribution of asperities

F_{n}(h)= \frac{a_0+a_1 h+a_2 h^2+a_3 h^3}{1+b_1 h+b_2 h^2+b_3 h^3+b_4 h^4+b_5 h^5+b_6 h^6}\exp\left(-\frac{h^2}{2}\right)

The maximum relative error is &lt;math&gt;1.91*10^{-7}% &lt;/math&gt;. The paper&lt;ref name=Jedynak/&gt; also contains the exact expressions for &lt;math&gt;F_n(h)&lt;/math&gt;

where erfc(z) means the complementary error function and &lt;math&gt;K_{\nu}(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.

For the situation where the asperities on the two surfaces have a Gaussian height distribution and the peaks can be assumed to be spherical,&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;Greenwood, J. A. and Williamson, J. B. P., (1966), ''Contact of nominally flat surfaces,'' Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, vol. 295, pp. 300--319.&lt;/ref&gt; the average contact pressure is sufficient to cause yield when &lt;math&gt; p_{\mathrm{av}} = 1.1\sigma_y \approx 0.39 \sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; is the uniaxial [[yield stress]] and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; is the indentation hardness.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;  Greenwood and Williamson&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt; defined a dimensionless parameter &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; called the '''plasticity index''' that could be used to determine whether contact would be elastic or plastic.

The Greenwood-Williamson model requires knowledge of two statistically dependent quantities; the standard deviation of the surface roughness and the curvature of the asperity peaks.  An alternative definition of the plasticity index has been given by Mikic.&lt;ref name=Mikic&gt;Mikic, B. B., (1974), ''Thermal contact conductance; theoretical considerations'', International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 17(2), pp. 205-214.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yield occurs when the pressure is greater than the uniaxial yield stress.  Since the yield stress is proportional to the indentation hardness &lt;math&gt;\sigma _0&lt;/math&gt;, Mikic defined the plasticity index for elastic-plastic contact to be
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \frac{E^*h'}{\sigma _0}&gt; \tfrac{2}{3}~.&lt;/math&gt;
In this definition &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; represents the micro-roughness in a state of complete plasticity and only one statistical quantity, the rms slope, is needed which can be calculated from surface measurements. For &lt;math&gt;\Psi &lt;\tfrac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, the surface behaves elastically during contact.

In both the Greenwood-Williamson and Mikic models the load is assumed to be proportional to the deformed area.  Hence, whether the system behaves plastically or elastically is independent of the applied normal force.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

== An overview of the GT model ==

The model proposed by Greenwood and Tripp (GT),&lt;ref name=Greenwood1&gt;Greenwood, J. A. and Tripp, J.H., (1970-71), The contact of two nominally flat rough surfaces,'' Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs., vol. 185, pp. 625--634.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the GW model to contact between two rough surfaces. The GT model is widely used in the field of elastohydrodynamic analysis.

The most frequently cited equations given by the GT model are for the asperity contact area

:&lt;math&gt;
A_a =\pi ^2( {\eta \beta \sigma } )^2AF_2 (\lambda),
&lt;/math&gt;

and load carried by asperities 

:&lt;math&gt;
P =\frac{8\sqrt 2 }{15}\pi ( {\eta \beta \sigma } )^2\sqrt{\frac{\sigma }{\beta }} E' AF_{5/2}(\lambda),
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
&lt;math&gt; \eta   \beta  \sigma &lt;/math&gt; - roughness parameter,
&lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; - nominal contact area,
&lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; - Stribeck oil film parameter, first defined by 
Stribeck \cite{gt} as &lt;math&gt; \lambda = h/ \sigma &lt;/math&gt;,  
&lt;math&gt; E' &lt;/math&gt; - effective elastic modulus,
&lt;math&gt; F_2, F_{5/2}(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; - statistical functions introduced
to match the assumed Gaussian distribution of asperities.

The exact solutions for &lt;math&gt;A_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are firstly presented by Jedynak &lt;ref name=Jedynak/&gt;. They are expressed by &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; as follows

:&lt;math&gt;
F_{2}=\frac{1}{2}  (h^2+1)\text{erfc}\left(\frac{h}{\sqrt{2}}\right)-\frac{h}{\sqrt{2 \pi }}\exp\left(-\frac{h^2}{2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
F_{5/2}=\frac{1}{8 \sqrt{\pi }}\exp\left(-\frac{h^2}{4}\right) h^{3/2} \left( (2 h^2+3)
 K_{\frac{3}{4}}\left(\frac{h^2}{4}\right)- (2 h^2+5) K_{\frac{1}{4}}\left(\frac{h^2}{4}\right)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where erfc(z) means the complementary error function and &lt;math&gt;K_{\nu}(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.  

In paper &lt;ref name=Jedynak/&gt; one can find comprehensive review of existing approximants to &lt;math&gt;F_{5/2}&lt;/math&gt;. New proposals give the most accurate approximants to &lt;math&gt;F_{5/2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,  which are reported in the literature. They are given by the following rational formulas, which are very exact approximants to integrals &lt;math&gt;F_n(h)&lt;/math&gt;. They are calculated for the Gaussian distribution of asperities

:&lt;math&gt; 
F_{n}(h)= \frac{a_0+a_1 h+a_2 h^2+a_3 h^3}{1+b_1 h+b_2 h^2+b_3 h^3+b_4 h^4+b_5 h^5+b_6 h^6}\exp\left(-\frac{h^2}{2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

== Adhesive contact between elastic bodies==
When two solid surfaces are brought into close proximity, they experience attractive [[van der Waals force]]s.  Bradley's van der Waals model&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, RS., 1932, ''The cohesive force between solid surfaces and the surface energy of solids'', Philosophical Magazine Series 7, 13(86), pp. 853--862.&lt;/ref&gt; provides a means of calculating the tensile force between two rigid spheres with perfectly smooth surfaces.  The Hertzian model of contact does not consider adhesion possible.  However, in the late 1960s, several contradictions were observed when the Hertz theory was compared with experiments involving contact between rubber and glass spheres.

It was observed&lt;ref name=jkr/&gt; that, though Hertz theory applied at large loads, at low loads
* the area of contact was larger than that predicted by Hertz theory,
* the area of contact had a non-zero value even when the load was removed, and
* there was strong adhesion if the contacting surfaces were clean and dry.
This indicated that adhesive forces were at work.  The Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model and the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) models were the first to incorporate adhesion into Hertzian contact.

=== Bradley model of rigid contact ===
It is commonly assumed that the surface force between two atomic planes at a distance &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; from each other can be derived from the [[Lennard-Jones potential]]. With this assumption
:&lt;math&gt;
   F(z) = \cfrac{16\gamma}{3 z_0}\left[\left(\cfrac{z}{z_0}\right)^{-9} - \left(\cfrac{z}{z_0}\right)^{-3}\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the force (positive in compression), &lt;math&gt;2\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the total surface energy of ''both'' surfaces per unit area, and &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium separation of the two atomic planes.

The Bradley model applied the Lennard-Jones potential to find the force of adhesion between two rigid spheres. The total force between the spheres is found to be
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_a(z) = \cfrac{16\gamma\pi R}{3}\left[\cfrac{1}{4}\left(\cfrac{z}{z_0}\right)^{-8} - \left(\cfrac{z}{z_0}\right)^{-2}\right] ~;~~  \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R_1,R_2&lt;/math&gt; are the radii of the two spheres.

The two spheres separate completely when the ''pull-off force'' is achieved at &lt;math&gt;z = z_0&lt;/math&gt; at which point
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_a = F_c = -4\gamma\pi R .
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model of elastic contact===
[[File:JKRModel.svg|400px|thumb|Schematic of contact area for the JKR model.]]
[[File:JKR-full-cycle.gif|thumb|right|JKR test with a rigid bead on a deformable planar material: complete cycle]]
To incorporate the effect of adhesion in Hertzian contact, Johnson, Kendall, and [[Alan D. Roberts (physicist)|Roberts]]&lt;ref name=jkr/&gt; formulated the JKR theory of adhesive contact using a balance between the stored [[elastic energy]] and the loss in [[surface energy]].  The JKR model considers the effect of contact pressure and adhesion only inside the area of contact. The general solution for the pressure distribution in the contact area in the JKR model is
:&lt;math&gt;
   p(r) = p_0\left(1 - \cfrac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{1/2} + p_0'\left(1 - \cfrac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{-1/2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Note that in the original Hertz theory, the term containing &lt;math&gt;p_0'&lt;/math&gt; was neglected on the ground that tension could not be sustained in the contact zone.  For contact between two spheres
:&lt;math&gt;
   p_0 = \cfrac{2 a E^*}{\pi R} ~;~~
   p_0' = -\left(\cfrac{4\gamma E^*}{\pi a}\right)^{1/2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the area of contact, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the applied force, &lt;math&gt;2\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the total surface energy of '''both''' surfaces per unit contact area,
&lt;math&gt;R_i, E_i, \nu_i,~~i=1,2&lt;/math&gt; are the radii, Young's moduli, and Poisson's ratios of the two spheres, and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} ~;~~ \frac{1}{E^*} = \frac{1-\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \frac{1-\nu_2^2}{E_2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The approach distance between the two spheres is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   d = \cfrac{\pi a}{2 E^*}(p_0 + 2p_0') = \cfrac{a^2}{R}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The Hertz equation for the area of contact between two spheres, modified to take into account the surface energy, has the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{3R}{4E^*}\left(F + 6\gamma\pi R + \sqrt{12\gamma\pi R F + (6\gamma\pi R)^2}\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
When the surface energy is zero, &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the Hertz equation for contact between two spheres is recovered.  When the applied load is zero, the contact radius is
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{9R^2\gamma\pi}{E^*}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The tensile load at which the spheres are separated, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt;, is predicted to be
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_c = -3\gamma\pi R\,
 &lt;/math&gt;
This force is also called the '''pull-off force'''.
Note that this force is independent of the moduli of the two spheres.  However, there is another possible solution for the value of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; at this load.  This is the critical contact area &lt;math&gt;a_c&lt;/math&gt;, given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   a_c^3 = \cfrac{9R^2\gamma\pi}{4E^*}
 &lt;/math&gt;

If we define the '''work of adhesion''' as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Delta\gamma = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 - \gamma_{12}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1,\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; are the adhesive energies of the two surfaces and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is an interaction term, we can write the JKR contact radius as
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{3R}{4E^*}\left(F + 3\Delta\gamma\pi R + \sqrt{6\Delta\gamma\pi R F + (3\Delta\gamma\pi R)^2}\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
The tensile load at separation is
:&lt;math&gt;
   F = -\cfrac{3}{2}\Delta\gamma\pi R\,
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the critical contact radius is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   a_c^3 = \cfrac{9R^2\Delta\gamma\pi}{8E^*}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The critical depth of penetration is
:&lt;math&gt;
   d_c = \cfrac{a_c^2}{R} = \left(\cfrac{9}{4}\right)^{\tfrac{2}{3}}(\Delta\gamma)^{\tfrac{2}{3}}\left(\cfrac{\pi^{\tfrac{2}{3}}~R^{\tfrac{1}{3}}}{{E^*}^{\tfrac{2}{3}}}\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) model of elastic contact ===
The Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) model&lt;ref name=DMT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muller, VM and Derjaguin, BV and Toporov, Y.P., 1983, ''On two methods of calculation of the force of sticking of an elastic sphere to a rigid plane'', Colloids and Surfaces, 7(3), pp. 251-259.&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative model for adhesive contact which assumes that the contact profile remains the same as in Hertzian contact but with additional attractive interactions outside the area of contact.

The radius of contact between two spheres from DMT theory is
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{3R}{4E^*}\left(F + 4\gamma\pi R\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the pull-off force is
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_c = -4\gamma\pi R\,
 &lt;/math&gt;
When the pull-off force is achieved the contact area becomes zero and there is no singularity in the contact stresses at the edge of the contact area.

In terms of the work of adhesion &lt;math&gt;\Delta\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{3R}{4E^*}\left(F + 2\Delta\gamma\pi R\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_c = -2\Delta\gamma\pi R\,
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Tabor parameter ===
In 1977, Tabor&lt;ref name=Tabor1&gt;Tabor, D., 1977, ''Surface forces and surface interactions'', Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 58(1), pp. 2-13.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the apparent contradiction between the JKR and DMT theories could be resolved by noting that the two theories were the extreme limits of a single theory parametrized by the '''Tabor parameter''' (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mu := \cfrac{d_c}{z_0} \approx \left[\cfrac{R(\Delta\gamma)^2}{{E^*}^2 z_0^3}\right]^{1/3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium separation between the two surfaces in contact.  The JKR theory applies to large, compliant spheres for which &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is large.  The DMT theory applies for small, stiff spheres with small values of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Subsequently, Derjaguin and his collaborators&lt;ref&gt;Muller V M, Yuschenko V S &amp; Derjaguin B V.,1980, "On the influence of molecular forces on the deformation of an elastic sphere and its sticking to a rigid plane", Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 77 pp. 91-101.&lt;/ref&gt; by applying Bradley's surface force law to an elastic half space, confirmed that as the Tabor parameter increases, the pull-off force falls from the Bradley value &lt;math&gt; 2\pi R\Delta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; to the JKR value &lt;math&gt; (3/2)\pi R\Delta\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. More detailed calculations were later done by Greenwood &lt;ref&gt;Greenwood J A.,1997, "Adhesion of elastic spheres", Proceedings of the Royal Society, 453 pp. 1277-1297.&lt;/ref&gt; revealing the S-shaped load/approach curve which explains the jumping-on effect. A more efficient method of doing the calculations and additional results were given by Feng &lt;ref&gt;Feng J Q.,2000, "Contact behaviour of spherical elastic particles", Colloids and Surfaces A, 172 pp. 175-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maugis-Dugdale model of elastic contact===
[[File:MaugisDugdale.svg|400px|thumb|Schematic of contact area for the Maugis-Dugdale model.]]
Further improvement to the Tabor idea was provided by Maugis&lt;ref name=Maugis1/&gt; who represented the surface force in terms of a Dugdale [[cohesive zone]] approximation such that the work of adhesion is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Delta\gamma = \sigma_0~h_0
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum force predicted by the Lennard-Jones potential and &lt;math&gt;h_0&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum separation obtained by matching the areas under the Dugdale and Lennard-Jones curves (see adjacent figure).  This means that the attractive force is constant for &lt;math&gt;z_0 \le z \le z_0 + h_0&lt;/math&gt;.  There is not further penetration in compression.  Perfect contact occurs in an area of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and adhesive forces of magnitude &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; extend to an area of radius &lt;math&gt;c &gt; a&lt;/math&gt;.  In the region &lt;math&gt;a &lt; r &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;, the two surfaces are separated by a distance &lt;math&gt;h(r)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h(a) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(c) = h_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The ratio &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; m := \cfrac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the Maugis-Dugdale theory,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, KL and Greenwood, JA, 1997, ''An adhesion map for the contact of elastic spheres'', Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 192(2), pp. 326-333.&lt;/ref&gt; the surface traction distribution is divided into two parts - one due to the Hertz contact pressure and the other from the Dugdale adhesive stress.  Hertz contact is assumed in the region &lt;math&gt;-a &lt; r &lt; a&lt;/math&gt;.  The contribution to the surface traction from the Hertz pressure is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   p^H(r) = \left(\cfrac{3F^H}{2\pi a^2}\right)\left(1 - \cfrac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{1/2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the Hertz contact force &lt;math&gt;F^H&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   F^H = \cfrac{4E^*a^3}{3R}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The penetration due to elastic compression is
:&lt;math&gt;
   d^H = \cfrac{a^2}{R}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The vertical displacement at &lt;math&gt;r = c&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
   u^H(c) = \cfrac{1}{\pi R} \left[a^2(2 - m^2)\sin^{-1}\left(\cfrac{1}{m}\right) + a^2\sqrt{m^2-1}\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the separation between the two surfaces at &lt;math&gt;r = c&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
   h^H(c) = \cfrac{c^2}{2R} - d^H + u^H(c)
 &lt;/math&gt;
The surface traction distribution due to the adhesive Dugdale stress is
:&lt;math&gt;
   p^D(r) = \begin{cases}
               -\cfrac{\sigma_0}{\pi}\cos^{-1}\left[\cfrac{2-m^2-\cfrac{r^2}{a^2}}{m^2\left(1-\cfrac{r^2}{m^2a^2}\right)}\right] &amp; \quad \mathrm{for} \quad r \le a\\
               -\sigma_0 &amp; \quad \mathrm{for} \quad a \le r \le c
            \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The total adhesive force is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   F^D = -2\sigma_0 m^2a^2\left[\cos^{-1}\left(\cfrac{1}{m}\right) + \frac{1}{m^2}\sqrt{m^2 - 1}\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
The compression due to Dugdale adhesion is
:&lt;math&gt;
  d^D = -\left(\cfrac{2\sigma_0 a}{E^*}\right)\sqrt{m^2-1}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the gap at &lt;math&gt;r = c&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
   h^D(c) = \left(\cfrac{4\sigma_0 a}{\pi E^*}\right)\left[\sqrt{m^2-1}\cos^{-1}\left(\cfrac{1}{m}\right) + 1-m\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
The net traction on the contact area is then given by &lt;math&gt;p(r) = p^H(r) + p^D(r)&lt;/math&gt; and the net contact force is &lt;math&gt;F = F^H + F^D&lt;/math&gt;.  When &lt;math&gt;h(c) = h^H(c) + h^D(c) = h_0&lt;/math&gt; the adhesive traction drops to zero.

Non-dimensionalized values of &lt;math&gt;a, c, F, d&lt;/math&gt; are introduced at this stage that are defied as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \bar{a} = \alpha a ~;~~ \bar{c} := \alpha c ~;~~ \bar{d} := \alpha^2 R d ~;~~ \alpha := \left(\cfrac{4E^*}{3\pi\Delta\gamma R^2}\right)^{1/3} ~;~~ \bar{A} := \pi c^2 ~;~~ \bar{F} = \cfrac{F}{\pi\Delta\gamma R}
 &lt;/math&gt;

In addition, Maugis proposed a parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; which is equivalent to the Tabor parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; .  This parameter is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \lambda := \sigma_0\left(\cfrac{9R}{2\pi\Delta\gamma{E^*}^2}\right)^{1/3} = 1.16\mu
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the step cohesive stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; equals to the theoretical stress of the Lennard-Jones potential
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{th} = \cfrac{16\Delta\gamma}{9\sqrt{3}z_0} 
&lt;/math&gt;
Zheng and Yu &lt;ref name=Zheng&gt;Zheng, Z.J. and Yu, J.L., 2007, Using the Dugdale approximation to match a specific interaction in the adhesive contact of elastic objects'', Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 310(1), pp. 27-34.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested another value for the step cohesive stress
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{0} = \exp\left(-\cfrac{223}{420}\right)\cdot\cfrac{\Delta\gamma}{z_0} \approx 0.588\cfrac{\Delta\gamma}{z_0}
&lt;/math&gt;
to match the Lennard-Jones potential, which leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
   \lambda \approx 0.663\mu
&lt;/math&gt;
Then the net contact force may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \bar{F} = \bar{a}^3 - \lambda \bar{a}^2\left[\sqrt{m^2 -1} + m^2 \sec^{-1} m\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the elastic compression as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \bar{d} = \bar{a}^2 - \cfrac{4}{3}~\lambda \bar{a}\sqrt{m^2-1}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The equation for the cohesive gap between the two bodies takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\lambda \bar{a}^2}{2}\left[(m^2-2)\sec^{-1} m + \sqrt{m^2-1}\right] + \cfrac{4\lambda\bar{a}}{3}\left[\sqrt{m^2-1}\sec^{-1} m - m + 1\right] = 1
 &lt;/math&gt;
This equation can be solved to obtain values of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for various values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  For large values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; and the JKR model is obtained.  For small values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; the DMT model is retrieved.

=== Carpick-Ogletree-Salmeron (COS) model ===
The Maugis-Dugdale model can only be solved iteratively if the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is not known a-priori.  The Carpick-Ogletree-Salmeron approximate solution &lt;ref name=COS&gt;Carpick, R.W. and Ogletree, D.F. and Salmeron, M., 1999, ''A general equation for fitting contact area and friction vs load measurements'', Journal of colloid and interface science, 211(2), pp. 395-400.&lt;/ref&gt; simplifies the process by using the following relation to determine the contact radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
  a = a_0(\beta) \left(\cfrac{\beta + \sqrt{1 - F/F_c(\beta)}}{1 + \beta}\right)^{2/3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is the contact area at zero load, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a transition parameter that is related to &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \lambda = -0.924 \ln(1-1.02\beta)
 &lt;/math&gt;
The case &lt;math&gt;\beta = 1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds exactly to JKR theory while &lt;math&gt;\beta = 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to DMT theory.
For intermediate cases &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \beta &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; the COS model corresponds closely to the Maugis-Dugdale solution for &lt;math&gt;0.1 &lt; \lambda &lt; 5&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Influence of contact shape ===
Even in the presence of perfectly smooth surfaces, geometry can come into play in form of the macroscopic shape of the contacting region. When a rigid punch with flat but oddy shaped face is carefully pulled off his soft counterpart, its detachment occurs not instantaneously but detachment fronts start at pointed corners and travel inwards, until the final configuration is reached which for macroscopically isotropic shapes is almost circular. The main parameter determining the adhesive strength of flat contacts occurs to be the maximum linear size of the contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popov|first=Valentin L.|last2=Pohrt|first2=Roman|last3=Li|first3=Qiang|date=2017-09-01|title=Strength of adhesive contacts: Influence of contact geometry and material gradients|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40544-017-0177-3|journal=Friction|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=308–325|doi=10.1007/s40544-017-0177-3|issn=2223-7690}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of detachment can as observed experimentally can be seen in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Friction Physics|title=Science friction: Adhesion of complex shapes|date=2017-12-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV2W91d8vwQ|accessdate=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Removed ", the Association for the Advancement of [[Cost engineering|Cost Engineering]]," - AACE make it quite clear on their website that the legal name is "AACE", and that it has never stood for that. It used to stand for American Association of Cost Engineers.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6729">When estimating the cost for a [[project]], product or other item or investment, there is always [[uncertainty]] as to the precise content of all items in the estimate, how work will be performed, what work conditions will be like when the project is executed and so on. These uncertainties are [[risks]] to the [[project]]. Some refer to these risks as "known-unknowns" because the estimator is aware of them, and based on past experience, can even estimate their probable costs. The estimated costs of the known-unknowns is referred to by cost estimators as '''cost contingency'''.

Contingency "refers to costs that will probably occur based on past experience, but with some uncertainty regarding the amount. The term is not used as a catchall to cover ignorance. It is poor engineering and poor philosophy to make second-rate estimates and then try to satisfy them by using a large contingency account. The contingency allowance is designed to cover items of cost which are not known exactly at the time of the estimate but which will occur on a statistical basis."&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Jelen, James H. Black, ''Cost and Optimization Engineering, Third Edition'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1983, pg 456-457&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost contingency which is included in a [[cost estimate]], bid, or budget may be classified as to its general purpose, that is what it is intended to provide for. For a class 1 construction cost estimate, usually needed for a bid estimate, the contingency may be classified as an estimating and contracting contingency. This is intended to provide compensation for "estimating accuracy based on quantities assumed or measured, unanticipated market conditions, scheduling delays and acceleration issues, lack of bidding competition, subcontractor defaults, and interfacing omissions between various work categories."&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 103&lt;/ref&gt; Additional classifications of contingency may be included at various stages of a project's life, including design contingency, or design definition contingency, or design growth contingency, and change order contingency (although these may be more properly called allowances).

[[AACE International]] has defined contingency as "An amount added to an estimate to allow for items, conditions, or events for which the state, occurrence, or effect is uncertain and that experience shows will likely result, in aggregate, in additional costs. Typically estimated using statistical analysis or judgment based on past asset or project experience. Contingency usually excludes: 
# Major scope changes such as changes in end product specification, capacities, building sizes, and location of the asset or project
# Extraordinary events such as major strikes and natural disasters
# Management reserves
# Escalation and currency effects
Some of the items, conditions, or events for which the state, occurrence, and/or effect is uncertain include, but are not limited to, planning and estimating errors and omissions, minor price fluctuations (other than general escalation), design developments and changes within the scope, and variations in market and environmental conditions. Contingency is generally included in most estimates, and '''is expected to be expended'''".&lt;ref&gt;"Cost Engineering Terminology", Recommended Practice 10S-90, AACE International, WV, rev. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A key phrase above is that it is "''expected to be expended''". In other words, it is an item in an estimate like any other, and should be estimated and included in every estimate and every budget. Because management often thinks contingency money is "fat" that is not needed if a project team does its job well, it is a controversial topic. 

In general, there are four classes of methods used to estimate contingency. ."&lt;ref&gt;Hollmann, John K., "The Monte-Carlo Challenge: A Better Approach", 2007 AACE International Transactions, AACE International, Morgantown, WV, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; These include the following:

# [[Expert judgment]]
# Predetermined guidelines (with varying degrees of judgment and empiricism used)
# Simulation analysis (primarily risk analysis judgment incorporated in a simulation such as [[Monte Carlo option model|Monte-Carlo]])
# Parametric Modeling (empirically-based algorithm, usually derived through regression analysis, with varying degrees of judgment used).

While all are valid methods, the method chosen should be consistent with the first principles of [[risk management]] in that the method must start with risk identification, and only then are the probable cost of those risks quantified. In best practice, the quantification will be probabilistic in nature (Monte-Carlo is a common method used for quantification). 

Typically, the method results in a distribution of possible cost outcomes for the project, product, or other investment. From this distribution, a cost value can be selected that has the desired probability of having a cost underrun or [[cost overrun]]. Usually a value is selected with equal chance of over or underrunning. The difference between the cost estimate without contingency, and the selected cost from the distribution is contingency. For more information, AACE International has catalogued many professional papers on this complex topic.&lt;ref&gt;Uppal, Kul (editor), Professional Practice Guide (PPG)#8, "Contingency", 2nd Edition, AACE International, Morgantown WV, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contingency is included in budgets as a control account. As risks occur on a project, and money is needed to pay for them, the contingency can be transferred to the appropriate accounts that need it. The transfer and its reason is recorded. In [[risk management]], risks are continually reassessed during the course of a project, as are the needs for cost contingency.

'''''Early Netherlandish Painting''', Its Origins and Character'', is a 1953 book on [[art history]] by [[Erwin Panofsky]], derived from the 1947–48 [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]. The book had a wide impact&lt;ref&gt;Shone, Richard and Stonard, John-Paul, eds. ''The Books That Shaped Art History: From Gombrich and Greenberg to Alpers and Krauss'', chapter 7. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; on studies of [[Renaissance art]] and [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in particular, but also studies in [[iconography]], art history, and [[intellectual history]] in general. The book is particularly well-known for its iconographic treatment of [[Jan Van Eyck|Van Eyck's]] ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' as a kind of marriage contract, a hypothesis advanced by Panofsky as early as 1934. The book remains influential despite its reliance on black-and-white reproductions of paintings, which led to some errors of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;''The Books That Shaped Art History'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

''Early Netherlandish Painting'' shares its title with the [[Early Netherlandish Painting (Friedländer)|comprehensive, 14-volume survey]] by [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max J. Friedländer]], a fact obliquely acknowledged at the beginning of the preface.&lt;ref&gt;''Early Netherlandish Painting'', p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19959">'''Failure rate''' is the [[frequency]] with which an [[systems engineering|engineered system]] or component fails, expressed in failures per unit of time.  It is often denoted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[λ]] (lambda) and is highly used in [[reliability engineering]].

The failure rate of a system usually depends on time, with the rate varying over the life cycle of the system.  For example, an automobile's failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its first year of service.  One does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe, overhaul the brakes, or have major [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] problems in a new vehicle.

In practice, the [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF, 1/λ) is often reported instead of the failure rate. This is valid and useful if the failure rate may be assumed constant – often used for complex units / systems, electronics – and is a general agreement in some reliability standards (Military and Aerospace). It does in this case ''only'' relate to the flat region of the [[bathtub curve]], which is also called the "useful life period". Because of this, it is incorrect to extrapolate MTBF to give an estimate of the service lifetime of a component, which will typically be much less than suggested by the MTBF due to the much higher failure rates in the "end-of-life wearout" part of the "bathtub curve".

The reason for the preferred use for MTBF numbers is that the use of large positive numbers (such as 2000 hours) is more intuitive and easier to remember than very small numbers (such as 0.0005 per hour).

The MTBF is an important system parameter in systems where failure rate needs to be managed, in particular for safety systems. The MTBF appears frequently in the [[engineering]] design requirements, and governs frequency of required system maintenance and inspections.  In special processes called [[renewal process]]es, where the time to recover from failure can be neglected and the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time, the failure rate is simply the multiplicative inverse of the MTBF (1/λ).

A similar ratio used in the [[transport industry|transport industries]], especially in [[railway]]s and [[Truck driver|trucking]] is "mean distance between failures", a variation which attempts to [[Correlation|correlate]] actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices.

Failure rates are important factors in the insurance, finance, commerce and regulatory industries and fundamental to the design of safe systems in a wide variety of applications.

==Failure rate in the discrete sense==

The failure rate can be defined as the following:

:The total number of failures within an item [[statistical population|population]], divided by the total time expended by that population, during a particular measurement interval under stated conditions. (MacDiarmid, ''et al.'')

Although the failure rate, &lt;math&gt;\lambda (t)&lt;/math&gt;, is often thought of as the [[probability]] that a failure occurs in a specified interval given no failure before time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, it is not actually a probability because it can exceed 1. Erroneous expression of the failure rate in % could result in incorrect perception of the measure, especially if it would be measured from repairable systems and multiple systems with non-constant failure rates or different operation times. It can be defined with the aid of the [[reliability function]], also called the survival function, &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of no failure before time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{R(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the time to (first) failure distribution (i.e. the failure density function) and &lt;math&gt;R(t)=1-F(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{R(t_1)-R(t_2)}{(t_2-t_1) \cdot R(t_1)}
 = \frac{R(t)-R(t+\Delta t)}{\Delta t \cdot R(t)} \!&lt;/math&gt;

over a time interval &lt;math&gt;(t_2-t_1)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) to &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;(t_2-t_1)&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that this is a [[conditional probability]], where the condition is that the failure has not occurred at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator.

Hazard rate and ROCOF (rate of occurrence of failures) are often incorrectly seen as the same and equal to the failure rate. {{clarify|date=April 2015}} To clarify; the more promptly items are repaired, the sooner they will break again, so the higher the ROCOF. The hazard rate is however independent of the time to repair and of the logistic delay time.

==Failure rate in the continuous sense==
{{merge from|Unobserved heterogeneity in duration models|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Loglogistichaz.svg|thumb|right|300px|Hazard function &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; plotted for a selection of [[log-logistic distribution]]s.]]
Calculating the failure rate for ever smaller intervals of time, results in the '''{{visible anchor|hazard function}}''' (also called '''hazard rate'''), &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;. This becomes the ''instantaneous'' failure rate as &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt;/math&gt; tends to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t)=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{R(t)-R(t+\Delta t)}{\Delta t \cdot R(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

A continuous failure rate depends on the existence of a '''failure distribution''', &lt;math&gt;F(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which is a [[cumulative distribution function]] that describes the probability of failure (at least) up to and including time ''t'',

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Pr}(T\le t)=F(t)=1-R(t),\quad t\ge 0. \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the failure time.
The failure distribution function is the integral of the failure [[probability density function|''density'' function]], ''f''(''t''),

:&lt;math&gt;F(t)=\int_{0}^{t} f(\tau)\, d\tau. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The hazard function can be defined now as

:&lt;math&gt;h(t)=\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}=\frac{f(t)}{R(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Exponential pdf.svg|thumb|right|300px|Exponential failure density functions. Each of these has a (different) constant hazard function (see text).]]
Many probability distributions can be used to model the failure distribution (''see [[List of probability distributions|List of important probability distributions]]''). A common model is the '''exponential failure distribution''',

:&lt;math&gt;F(t)=\int_{0}^{t} \lambda e^{-\lambda \tau}\, d\tau = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

which is based on the [[exponential distribution|exponential density function]]. The hazard rate function for this is:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{R(t)} = \frac{\lambda e^{-\lambda t}}{e^{-\lambda t}} = \lambda .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for an exponential failure distribution, the hazard rate is a constant with respect to time (that is, the distribution is "[[memorylessness|memory-less]]").  For other distributions, such as a [[Weibull distribution]] or a [[log-normal distribution]], the hazard function may not be constant with respect to time. For some such as the [[deterministic distribution]] it is [[monotonic]] increasing (analogous to [[Wear and tear|"wearing out"]]), for others such as the [[Pareto distribution]] it is monotonic decreasing (analogous to [[Burn-in|"burning in"]]), while for many it is not monotonic.

==Decreasing failure rate==
A decreasing failure rate (DFR) describes a phenomenon where the probability of an event in a fixed time interval in the future decreases over time. A decreasing failure rate can describe a period of "infant mortality" where earlier failures are eliminated or corrected&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-1-84800-986-8_1 | chapter = Introduction | first = Maxim | last = Finkelstein| title = Failure Rate Modelling for Reliability and Risk | series = Springer Series in Reliability Engineering | pages = 1–84 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84800-985-1 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and corresponds to the situation where λ(''t'') is a [[decreasing function]].

Mixtures of DFR variables are DFR.&lt;ref name="brown1980"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = M. | title = Bounds, Inequalities, and Monotonicity Properties for Some Specialized Renewal Processes | doi = 10.1214/aop/1176994773 | journal = The Annals of Probability | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 227 | jstor = 2243267| year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixtures of [[exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]] random variables are [[Hyperexponential distribution|hyperexponentially distributed]].

===Renewal processes===

For a [[renewal process]] with DFR renewal function, inter-renewal times are concave.&lt;ref name="brown1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shanthikumar"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shanthikumar | first1 = J.

===Applications===

Increasing failure rate is an intuitive concept caused by components wearing out. Decreasing failure rate describes a system which improves with age.&lt;ref name="proschan" /&gt;
Decreasing failure rates have been found in the lifetimes of spacecraft, Baker and Baker commenting that "those spacecraft that last, last on and on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Baker | first2 = G. A. S. . | doi = 10.2514/3.28040 | title = Impact of the space environment on spacecraft lifetimes | journal = Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 479 | year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1980JSpRo..17..479B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1002/9781119994077.ch1 | chapter = On Time, Reliability, and Spacecraft | first1 = Joseph Homer | last1 = Saleh | first2 =Jean-François | last2 =Castet| title = Spacecraft Reliability and Multi-State Failures | pages = 1 | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781119994077 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliability of aircraft air conditioning systems were individually found to have an [[exponential distribution]], and thus in the pooled population a DFR.&lt;ref name="proschan"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Proschan | first1 = F. | title = Theoretical Explanation of Observed Decreasing Failure Rate | doi = 10.1080/00401706.1963.10490105 | journal = Technometrics | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 375–383 | jstor = 1266340| year = 1963 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coefficient of variation===

When the failure rate is decreasing the [[coefficient of variation]] is ⩾&amp;nbsp;1, and when the failure rate is increasing the coefficient of variation is ⩽&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wierman | first1 = A. | authorlink1 = Adam Wierman| last2 = Bansal | first2 = N. | last3 = Harchol-Balter | first3 = M.|author3-link=Mor Harchol-Balter | title = A note on comparing response times in the M/GI/1/FB and M/GI/1/PS queues | doi = 10.1016/S0167-6377(03)00061-0 | journal = Operations Research Letters | volume = 32 | pages = 73 | url = http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~adamw/papers/fbnote.pdf| year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this result only holds when the failure rate is defined for all t&amp;nbsp;⩾&amp;nbsp;0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Analysis of Queues: Methods and Applications | first = Natarajan | last =Gautam | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2012 | page = 703 | isbn = 1439806586}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the converse result (coefficient of variation determining nature of failure rate) does not hold.

==Failure rate data==
Failure rate [[data]] can be obtained in several ways. The most common means are:
;Historical data about the device or system under consideration: Many organizations maintain internal databases of failure information on the devices or systems that they produce, which can be used to calculate failure rates for those devices or systems. For new devices or systems, the historical data for similar devices or systems can serve as a useful estimate.
;Government and commercial failure rate data: Handbooks of failure rate data for various components are available from government and commercial sources. [[#Online|MIL-HDBK-217F]], ''Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment'', is a [[United States Military Standard|military standard]] that provides failure rate data for many military electronic components. Several failure rate data sources are available commercially that focus on commercial components, including some non-electronic components.
;Testing: The most accurate source of data is to test samples of the actual devices or systems in order to generate failure data. This is often prohibitively expensive or impractical, so that the previous data sources are often used instead.

===Units===
Failure rates can be expressed using any measure of time, but '''hours''' is the most common unit in practice. Other units, such as miles, revolutions, etc., can also be used in place of "time" units.

Failure rates are often expressed in [[engineering notation]] as failures per million, or 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, especially for individual components, since their failure rates are often very low.

The '''Failures In Time''' ('''FIT''') rate of a device is the number of failures that can be expected in one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) device-hours of operation.&lt;ref&gt;
Xin Li; Michael C. Huang; Kai Shen; Lingkun Chu.
[http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~kshen/papers/usenix2010-li.pdf "A Realistic Evaluation of Memory Hardware Errors and Software System Susceptibility"].
2010.
p. 6.
&lt;/ref&gt;
(E.g. 1000 devices for 1 million hours, or 1 million devices for 1000 hours each, or some other combination.) This term is used particularly by the [[semiconductor]] industry.

The relationship of FIT to MTBF may be expressed as: MTBF = 1,000,000,000 x 1/FIT.

===Additivity===
Under certain [[engineering]] assumptions (e.g. besides the above assumptions for a constant failure rate, the assumption that the considered system has no relevant [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancies]]), the failure rate for a complex [[system]] is simply the sum of the individual failure rates of its components, as long as the units are consistent, e.g. failures per million hours. This permits testing of individual components or [[subsystem]]s, whose failure rates are then added to obtain the total system failure rate.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Vita Faraci.
[http://src.alionscience.com/pdf/1Q2006.pdf "Calculating Failure Rates of Series/Parallel Networks"].
2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding "redundant" components to eliminate a [[single point of failure]] improves the mission failure rate, but makes the series failure rate (also called the logistics failure rate) worse—the extra components improve the mean time between critical failures (MTBCF), even though the mean time before something fails is worse.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.quanterion.com/mission-reliability-and-logistics-reliability-a-design-paradox/ "Mission Reliability and Logistics Reliability: A Design Paradox"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
Suppose it is desired to estimate the failure rate of a certain component. A test can be performed to estimate its failure rate. Ten identical components are each tested until they either fail or reach 1000 hours, at which time the test is terminated for that component. (The level of statistical [[confidence interval|confidence]] is not considered in this example.) The results are as follows:

Estimated failure rate is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6\text{ failures}}{7502\text{ hours}} = 0.0007998\, \frac{\text{failures}}{\text{hour}} = 799.8 \times 10^{-6}\, \frac{\text{failures}}{\text{hour}}, &lt;/math&gt;

or 799.8 failures for every million hours of operation.

==Estimation==
The [[Nelson–Aalen estimator]] can be used to estimate the cumulative hazard rate function.

[[Image:Water cycle.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[water cycle]], the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth affects how much water evaporates from oceans, and how long it is retained on land]]

The '''Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)''' is a research program of the [[World Climate Research Programme]] intended to observe, comprehend and [[model (abstract)|model]] the Earth's [[water cycle]]. The experiment also observes how much energy the [[Earth]] receives, studies how much of that energy reaches surfaces of the Earth and how that energy is transformed. [[Sunlight]]'s energy [[evaporate]]s water to produce [[cloud]]s and [[rain]], and  dries out land masses after rain. Rain that falls on land becomes the water budget which can be used by people for [[agricultural]] and other processes.

GEWEX is a collaboration of researchers worldwide to find better ways of studying the water cycle and how it transforms energy through the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name =  "GEWEX"&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/gewex_overview.html About GEWEX], Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment, World Climate Research Programme , Access date 06-22-2008&lt;/ref&gt; If the Earth's climates were identical from year to year, then people could predict when, where and what crops to plant. However, instability created by solar variation, weather trends, and chaotic events create weather that is unpredictable on seasonal scales. Through weather patterns such as [[drought]]s and higher rainfall these cycles impact [[ecosystem]]s and human activities.  GEWEX is designed to collect a much greater amount of data, and see if better models of that data can forecast weather and climate change into the future.

GEWEX is organized into several structures. As GEWEX was conceived projects were organized by participating factions, this task is now done by the International GEWEX Project Office (IGPO). IGPO oversees major initiatives and coordinates between national projects in an effort to bring about communication of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;NASA is the primary sponsor of IGPO&lt;/ref&gt; IGPO claims to support communication exchange between 2000 scientist and is the instrument for publication of major reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/igpo.html International GEWEX Project Office (IGPO)]  GEWEX WCRP&lt;/ref&gt; The Scientific Steering Group organizes the projects and assigns them to panels, which oversee progress and provide critique. The Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project (CEOP) the 'Hydrology Project' is a major instrument in GEWEX.&lt;ref name = "CEOP"/&gt;  This panel includes geographic study areas such as the [[Climate Prediction Program for the Americas]] operated by [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]],&lt;ref&gt;(CPPA integrates what was formally GEWEX American Prediction Project - GAPP and Climate Variability and Predictability, U.S. CLIVAR.) [http://www.climate.noaa.gov/cpo_pa/cppa/ Climate Program Office], National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/ref&gt; but also examines several types of climate zones (e.g. high altitude and semi-arid).&lt;ref name = "CEOP"&gt;[http://www.ceop.net/ Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Another panel, the GEWEX Radiation Panel oversees the coordinated use of satellites and ground-based observation to better estimate energy and water fluxes. One recent result GEWEX's Radiation panel has assessed data on rainfall for the last 25 years and determined that global rainfall is 2.61&amp;nbsp;mm/day with a small [[statistic]]al variation. While the study period is short, after 25 years of measurement regional trends are beginning to appear.&lt;ref name="Precip"&gt;Gruber A and Levizzani V. [http://wcrp.wmo.int/documents/AssessmentGlobalPrecipitationReport.pdf Assessment of Global Precipitation Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718163512/http://wcrp.wmo.int/documents/AssessmentGlobalPrecipitationReport.pdf |date=2008-07-18 }} A project of the [[World Climate Research Programme]] Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Radiation Panel, WCRP-128 WMO/TD-No. 1430, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The GEWEX Modeling and Prediction Panel takes current models and analyzes the models when [[climate forcing]] phenomena occur (global warming as an example of a 'climate forcing' event). GEWEX is now the core project of WCRP.&lt;ref name =  "GEWEX"/&gt;

==Goals and design==
[[Image:Solar-cycle-data.png|thumb|right|To determine energy budget and flux, scientists need to know the amount of radiation reaching the Earth.]]
Predicting weather change requires [[accurate]] data that is collected over many years, and the application of [[computational model|model]]s. GEWEX was conceived to respond to the need for observations of the Earth's [[radiation]] budget and clouds. Many preexisting techniques were limited to observations taken from land and populated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kandel R.S.  |title= Satellite observation of the Earth Radiation Budget and clouds|journal=Space Science Reviews |volume=52 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–32 |date=February 1990|doi=10.1007/BF00704238 |url= |bibcode=1990SSRv...52....1K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ignored the large amount of weather that occurs over the oceans and unpopulated regions, with key data missing from these areas. Since satellites orbiting the earth cover large areas in small time frames, they can better estimate climate where measurements are infrequently taken.  GEWEX was initiated by [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP) to take advantage of environmental satellites such as [[TRMM]], but now uses information from newer satellites as well as collections land based instruments, such as [[Baseline Surface Radiation Network|BSRN]].&lt;ref name = "GEWEX"/&gt; These land based instruments can be used to verify information interpreted from satellite.  GEWEX studies the long-term and regional changes in climate with a goal of predicting important [[seasonal]] weather patterns and climate changes that occurs over a few years.

| '''Sunlight and rain'''
|-
| column width = "350px" | The earth is made of matter, including water, which absorbs and emits energy into space. Should the earth not orbit a star, the water would freeze solid and little precipitation would occur because the rate of evaporation would be very low. If the earth were devoid of water, it would heat to great temperatures in the daytime and cool off more quickly at night. Therefore, water modulates heat energy by transitioning between ice, water, and steam. When heat is applied, ice becomes water and water becomes vapor-steam, absorbing heat energy. When cooling is applied, vapor condenses into water and water freezes into ice, releasing heat. While these are simple examples, rainfall results from a complex set of processes. When '''sunlight''' hits the oceans it forces liquid water into the vapor state at a rate dependent on surface temperatures, humidity, winds and pressure. At equilibration, water reaches 100% humidity, and during the day, the temperature rises, allowing more moisture to accumulate in the air. At night the temperature falls and water tends to form clouds, often resulting in ground fog in coastal areas.

At 100% humidity any loss of radiant energy from water causes vapor to condense into water. Circulation and convection can carry moist air upward in the air column, and this often cools moist air. The air forms water droplets, even in the heat of daytime, creating clouds. As the density of droplets in the clouds increase, the air can no longer support droplets and they fall as '''rain'''. More moist air can be drawn into clouds as energy is released, allowing the development of large thunderstorms. Prevailing winds are a factor in storm formation, particularly when changes occur. Tropical waves that develop in westerly flows around the Earth's semitropical and tropical region can organize into horizontal circles over the water, creating a cyclone. [[Image:Hurricane profile.svg|right|thumb|A cyclone showing the flow of moist air as it dissipates energy into the tropopause]]

A cyclone is a stereotype energy transfer system. It gathers steam off of warm water, and quickly moves it upwards releasing the energy into space. This causes the characteristic rain bands. The energy transferred is so great it gives rise to catastrophic winds, which disturb surface waters, increasing steam release, and also increase the rate at which moisture is drawn into the center. The heat of the water under the storm drops. Cyclones demonstrate how much latent energy is stored in the world's oceans.
&lt;br /&gt;
|-
|'''Fluxes, radiation and aerosols'''
|-
| column width = "350px" | The moisture for a cyclone can be defined as the warm water below the storm. As the cyclone leaves warm water its energy dissipates quickly. Less powerful, long-term rainfall generators can rely on moisture driven by warm waters far from greatest region of rainfall. In the tropics the energy came from, stored heat in ocean currents and moving thermoclines can provide sources far away, such as is seen in El-Nino. [[Image:Mississippi Flood 1993.PNG|thumb|left|Soil moisture as a factor in the great flood of 1993]] Another example is the floods that hit the Midwest U.S. in 1993. The energy that drove moisture into the air occurred in the Gulf, and strong winds and lack of cooling in coastal regions permitted the moisture to travel 1000 miles until conditions were ripe for rain. As the rain fell it cooled the air and dissipated heat, and as new moisture arrived, the process continued. When the sun did come out, it heated wet ground, which created more rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dirmeyer | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Brubaker | first2 = K.L. | year = 1999 | title = Contrasting evaporative moisture          sources during the [[drought of 1988]] and the flood of 1993 | url = | journal = J.

When the air reaches land, which may be warmer, there may be inadequate convection and other processes to create rains, and this can cause droughts. To better see these events progress, scientists need data and models to see what elements of the data are most useful in determining rainfall.

===Research goals===

The research interest of GEWEX is to study [[wikt:flux|fluxes]] of radiation at the Earth's surface, predict seasonal hydration levels of soils and develop accurate models of predicting energy and water budgets around the world. The project sets its goal as to improve, by an order of magnitude, the ability to model and therefore prediction hydration (rainfall and evaporation) patterns&lt;ref name =  "GEWEX"/&gt; GEWEX is linked to other WCRP projects such as Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC) Project, and the Climate and Cryosphere Project through WCRP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/SPARC/index.html Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clic.npolar.no/ Climate and Cryosphere (CliC)] World Climate Research Program and Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research&lt;/ref&gt; and thus shares information and goals with other WCRP projects. The goal becomes more important with the newer WCRP project, the [[Coordinated Observation and Prediction of the Earth System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcrp.ipsl.jussieu.fr/ WCRP STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK 2005-2015] World Climate Research Program,      WCRP Strategic Support Unit, Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complexity of the experiment====
Aside from fluctuations of solar radiation, the sunlight that is transformed by the earth can vary greatly, some have concluded for instance, that ice-ages self-perpetuate once enough ice has accumulated in the polar regions to reflect enough radiation at high elevations to lower the global average temperature, whereas it takes an unusually warm period to reverse this state. Water usage by plants, herbivore activities can change albedo in the temperate and tropical zones. These trends in reflection are subject to change. Some have proposed extrapolating pre-GEWEX information using new information and measurements taken with pre-GEWEX technology.&lt;ref name="ams.allenpress.com"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kinter III JL and Shukla, J | title = The global hydrologic and energy cycles: suggestions for studies in the Pre-GEWEX period | journal = Bull.

There are oscillations in oceanic currents, such as El-Niño and North Atlantic Oscillation, which alter the parts of the Earth's ice mass and land water availability. The experiment takes a sampling of climate, with some trends lasting a million years, and as paleo-climatology shows, can abruptly change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/abrupt/index.html|title=A Paleo Perspective Abrupt Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
GEWEX is being implemented in phases. The first phase comprises information gathering, modeling, predictions, and advancement of observation techniques and is complete. The second phase addresses several scientific questions such as prediction capacity, changes in Earth's water cycle, and impact on water resources.

====First phase====
Phase I (1990–2002), also called the "Build-Up Phase", was designed to determine the hydrological cycle and energy fluxes by means of global measurements of atmospheric and surface properties. GEWEX was also designed to model the global hydrological cycle and its impact on the atmosphere, oceans and land surfaces. Phase I processes were to develop the ability to predict the variations of global and regional hydrological processes &amp; water resources, and their response to environmental change. It was also to advance the development of observing techniques, data management, and assimilation systems for operational application to long-range weather forecasts, hydrology, and climate predictions.

During Phase I GEWEX projects were divided into the three overlapping sectors.
# '''GEWEX Radiation Panel''' ('''GRP''') used satellite and ground-based sensing over long periods to determine to delineate natural variation and climate changing forces.
# '''GEWEX Modelling and Prediction Panel''' ('''GMPP'''): Model the energy and water budget of the earth and determine the predictability. Apply modeling to determine climate forcing events, or respond to climate forcing events by analysis of predictions.
# '''GEWEX Hydrometeorology Panel''' ('''GHP''') - Modeled and predicted changes in water cycle events on longer time scales (up to annual) using intensive regional studies to determine efficacy of data gathering and predictions. The Continental-Scale Experiments (CSEs) relied heavily on the following study areas that would eventually form the basis of the  '''Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period''' ('''CEOP'''):
::* Canada - Mackenzie river basin study area (MAGS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Special Issue on the Mackenzie Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Studies 1994/95 Water Year|journal=Atmosphere-Ocean |volume=40 |issue=2– (Special Issue) |pages=91–278 |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; -completed
::* United States - North American study area or GEWEX American Prediction Project(GAPP).
::* Brazil - Large-Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA)
::* Scandinavia - Baltic Sea Experiment (BALTEX)
::* Southern Africa - African Monsoon Multidisciplinary  Analysis  Project (AMMA)
::* Indopacific and Asia - GEWEX Asian Monsoon Experiment (GAME) - completed in 2005
::* Australia - Murray-Darling Basin Water Budget Project (MDB)
::But also:
::* Continental-scale - International Project (GCIP)
::* International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP)
CEOP projects interacted with other non-GEWEX projects like CLIVAR and CLiC

=====Results=====
The results of the build-up phase include 15 to 25 years of study, measured the indirect effects of [[aerosol]]s, compiled a correlated data set, some reductions in uncertainty&lt;ref name = "PI_res_Overview"&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/GEWEXAccompBroc.pdf GEWEX Phase I Overview] GEWEX, WCRP&lt;/ref&gt;  GEWEX claims the following accomplishments:  A long period data set of [[cloud]]s, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rain fall]], [[water vapor]], surface radiation, and aerosols with no indication of large global trends, but with evidence of regional variability, models showing increased precipitation, and showed the importance of regional factors, such as water and soil conservation in regional climate change. The Phase I also claims to have produced over 200 publications and 15 review articles.

The Mississippi watershed was part of the GEWEX Continental scale International Projects and as a result was well situated for the  analysis of the Great Flood of 1993 ([[Mississippi River]] and [[Red River Valley|Red River]] water sheds). The coordination between ground sensing observations and satellite information allowed more thorough analysis of events that led up to the flood. Researchers at the [[Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies]] (COLA) found that upstream [[soil moisture]] and a multifold increase of [[humidity|moist]] air flow from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the flooded regions was a major factor in excessive rainfall. The Global Land/Atmosphere System Study (GLASS) gave GEWEX investigators the ability to observe soil wetness over much of the worlds surface by correlating observations on the ground with information obtained by satellites. While the ability to show cause is important, the different conditions (soil wetness, global patterns) that were permissive for weather anomalies are the focus of Phase I, gathering information and learning how to use satellite information better.

[[Image:Aerosol mod 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Aerosol map from 2006 showing increased aerosols, likely fires, in developing countries]]

One of the biggest impact of the Aerosol analysis has been the demonstration of the fairly large impact of anthropogenic aerosols, smoke patterns, even daily ripples of aerosols can be observed off the coasts of some developing nations and extend hundreds of miles over surrounding oceans. Some have questioned whether this aerosol pollution is partly to blame for long-term drought in places like the African [[Sahel]].

=====Critique=====
One critique of the Build-up Phase data and predictions is that there needs to be better error descriptions. The global estimate of rainfall indicates that the [[confidence interval|confidence range]] is large relative to possible [[Trend estimation|trend]]s. The number of ground sensing stations (currently around 40) in the [[#Baseline Surface Radiation Network|BSRN]] is rather limited for global observation this affected the measurement of aerosols which are regionally dominant. The best measurements of aerosol pollution are obtained when cloud types are identified properly by satellite observation, therefore better cloud sensing strategies and models are need to provide the clearest real time data. Certain projects like GCIP allow have focused on continental scale observations provide better prediction for project areas; however, areas outside these project areas may lag in receiving forecasting improvements. Many of the deficiencies in Phase I are improvement areas within the objectives of Phase II of the project.&lt;ref name = "PI_res_Overview"/&gt; Currently scientist use NASA Aqua's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) to evaluation soil moisture from space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2004/0729soilshowdown.html  ''Scientists' showdown with soil moisture at the O.K. corral''] Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA, July 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, except for focused observations the satellites data is not useful for global weather prediction. The proposed [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite]] would provide the detail of soil moisture information on a daily basis may provide the data needed for real time forecasting.&lt;ref name = "EGU2008-A-01922"&gt;Mecklenburg S, Kerr Y, Font J and Hahne A.

Geophysical Research Abstracts, Vol. 10, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second phase====
Phase II, "Full Implementation" (2003–2012) of GEWEX is to "exploit new capabities" developed during phase I such as new satellite information and, increasingly, new models. These include changes in the Earth's energy budget and water cycle, contribution of processes in climate feedback, causes of natural variability, predicting changes on a seasonal or annual  timescales, and how changes impact water resources. Phase II of is designed to be active models that have use to regional resource managers in real time. Some phases, such as the GAME (GEWEX Asia Monsoon Experiment) are already completed .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyarc.nagoya-u.ac.jp/game/ GEWEX Asia Monsoon Experiment]&lt;/ref&gt; GEWEX has become an umbrella program for the coordination of studies and experiments around the world. Reports from the phase I are still being produced and it will be some time before the results of the second phase are available. The experiment is still in progress.

==Panels==
There are three panels in GEWEX: The Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project(CEOP), GEWEX Radiation Panel(GRP), and GEWEX Modeling and Prediction Panel(GMPP)

==Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project==
The Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project ('''CEOP''') is the largest of the panel projects. There are several regional project areas  most of these are now covered by CEOP

===Areas===
For CEOP which survey the hydroclimate for southern African (AMMA), Baltic Sea area (BALTEX), North America (CPPA), Eastern Amazonia (LBA), La Plate Basin (LBB), Asia (MAHASRI), Australia (MDB), and Northern Eurasia (NEEPSI).&lt;ref name = "CEOP"/&gt; In addition, CEOP coordinates the study of region types, such as cold, high altitude, monsoon, and semiarid climates&lt;ref name = "CEOP"/&gt; and collects and formulates modeling on global, regional scale including land surface and surface hydrology  modeling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/islscp.html International Satellite Land         Surface Climatology Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Since GEWEX is an international cooperation it can utilize information from existing and planned satellites.

===Objectives===
The CEOP project has a number of energy budget and water cycle objectives. First is to produce more consistent research with better error definitions. Second is to better determine how energy flux and water cycles involve in feedback mechanisms. Third is to the predictability of important variables and improved parametric analysis to better model these processes. Forth, to collaborate with other hydrological science projects to create tools for assessing the water-system consequences of predictions and global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceop.net/ See Objectives CEOP/GEWEX]&lt;/ref&gt;

===GEWEX Radiation Panel===
GEWEX Radiation panel ('''GRP''') is a collaborative organization with a goal of reviewing theoretical and experimental knowledge of radiative processes within the climate system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grp.giss.nasa.gov/objectives.html  Objectives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705113459/http://grp.giss.nasa.gov/objectives.html |date=2008-07-05 }} Gewex Radiation Panel&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty percent of the energy that comes to Earth from the Sun is transformed by the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ Background] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515125716/http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ |date=2008-05-15 }} Baseline Surface Radiation Network&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiehl, J.

Bull. Amer. Met. Soc., 78, 197-208&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of this collaboration is to determine how energy is transformed as it inevitably is radiated back into space.

====Global precipitation climatology project====
GPCP task was to estimate precipitation using satellites that was global including places where people were not present to take measurements. Secondarily the project was tasked with studying regional precipitation on seasonal to between year time scales. As the study period of the project increased past 25 years a third objective was added analyze long-term variation, such as that caused by [[global warming]]. Also, in a renewed effort for better data and with more observation satellites, the GPCP, hopes to gain insights to rainfall variation on 'weather'-scale, or 4-hour periods to daily time scales.&lt;ref name = "Precip" /&gt;

=====Precipitation Assessment Group=====
The Precipitation Assessment Group was assigned by the panel to evaluate data on precipitation emphasizing data in the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) product (GRP project).  The GRP prepares to assimilate data from GPCP diurnal variation data for better estimation of the global precipitation products.&lt;ref name="Precip" /&gt; The result of 25 years of measurement the global average precipitation rate is 2.61&amp;nbsp;mm per/day (about 0.1&amp;nbsp;inch/day) with about 1% uncertainty. The finding suggests there is no significant variation in mean annual rainfall.&lt;ref name="Precip" /&gt; Regional variation was separated from land and ocean and the land variation of received precipitation was greater than the ocean. Satellites used to train the dataset analysis have the flaw of not having inaccurate measurements of drizzle and snow, and lack measurements in isolated places and over oceans. The rainfall maps show the greatest absolute rainfall error over the tropical oceans in regions with the highest estimated rainfall. The report self-critiques two aspects: the lack of polar-crossing satellites at the beginning of the study and the inability to correlate new information and older information (ground-based measurements). The noticeable trends in the dataset were deemed insignificant with regard to issues like global warming, but some stand-out positive trends over the Indopacific region were notable (Bay of Bengal and Indochina) and negative trends over South Central [[Africa]].
[[Image:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|350px|left|A goal of GEWEX is to monitor radiation that is released at the '''top of the atmosphere''' and model how energy flows from earth surfaces back into space.]]

====Surface Radiation Budget project====
The SRB project under NASA/GEWEX took global radiation measurements to determine radiative energy fluxes. The energy that comes from the sun strikes the atmosphere and scatters, clouds and is reflected, the earth or water where heat and light are radiated back into the atmosphere or space. When water is struck heated surface water can evaporate carrying energy back into space through cloud formation and rain. The SRB project measured these processes by measuring fluxes at the Earth's surface, top-of-atmosphere with shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiation.

====Baseline Surface Radiation Network====
At the onset of GEWEX there was inadequate information on how radiation redistributed, both horizontally and vertically.

[[Baseline Surface Radiation Network|BSRN]] is a global system of less than 40 widely spread radiation measuring devices designed to measure changes in radiation at the Earth's surface. The information obtained is stored at the World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) at the ETH (Zurich).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ Baseline Surface Radiation Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515125716/http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ |date=2008-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Aerosol Climatology Project====
Established by Radiation Sciences Program(NASA) and GEWEX in 1998 to analyze satellite and field data to determine the distribution of aerosols, how they are formed, transformed and transported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gacp.giss.nasa.gov/ Global Aerosol Climatology Project] Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA&lt;/ref&gt;

====GEWEX Cloud Assessment Project====
The GEWEX cloud assessment was initiated by the GEWEX Radiation Panel (GRP) in 2005 to evaluate the reliability of available, global, long-term cloud data products, with a special emphasis on ISCCP.

===GEWEX Modeling and Prediction Panel===
The GEWEX modeling and prediction panel ('''GMPP''') is charged with the task of finding better ways to use the data by other projects and other agencies. It oversees GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS), GEWEX Cloud System Study (GCSS),  and  Global Land/Atmosphere System Study(GLASS).  Climate forcing is a process of study which observes the contribution of irregular events, such a volcano eruption, greenhouse warming, solar variation, fluctuations in the Earth's orbit, long-term variation in the oceans circulation. The GMPP exploits these natural perturbations to test models developed that should predict what happens to global energy and water budgets with the perturbations.

====GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study====
GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study ('''GABLS''') is a more recent addition to GEWEX. The study is tasked with understanding the physical properties of the atmospheric boundary layers for better models which include representation of boundary layers.

====GEWEX Cloud System Study====
GEWEX Cloud System Study ('''GCSS''') task is to individualize modeling for different types of cloud systems. GCSS identifies 5 types of cloud systems:boundary layer, cirrus, extra tropical layer, precipitating convective, and polar. These cloud systems are generally too small to be rationalized in large scale climate modeling, this results in inadequate development of equations resulting in greater statistical uncertainty in results. In order to rationalize these process the study observes cloud systems at single fixed positions on earth in order to better estimate their parameters. These four areas are: Azores and Madeira Islands, Barbados, Equatorial Western Pacific, and Atlantic Tropics. The initial data collection is complete, methods developed for land and aircraft based observations can be compared with satellite observations to that better models of cloud system identification can be made at smaller scales.

====Global Land/Atmosphere System Study====
Global Land/Atmosphere System Study('''GLASS''') tries to understand the impact on land surface parameters on atmosphere.  Changes in land as a result of natural and man-made activities results in the ability to alter local climate and affect wind and cloud formation.

===Critique===
 [[File:Winter-NAO-Index.svg|thumb|left|350px|The period of the North Atlantic Oscillation lasts several times longer than the length of the proposed time frame of the GEWEX study]]
The study period for GEWEX is 22 years, and while some climate oscillations are short, such as El-Nino, some climate oscillations last for decades, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation.&lt;ref&gt;''The North Atlantic Oscillation Climate Significance and Environmental Impacts'', J.W. Hurrell, Y. Kushnir, G. Ottersen, and M. Visbeck (Eds), Geophysical Monograph Series, 134, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Some have proposed extrapolating pre-GEWEX information using new information and measurements taken with pre-GEWEX technology.&lt;ref name="ams.allenpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940030849_1994030849.pdf ''Production of Global Long-Term Water data. Annual report'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The MAGS project, located in Northwestern Canada utilized indigenous peoples traditional experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Woo M  | title = Science Meets Traditional Knowledge: Water and Climate in the Sahtu (Great Bear Lake) Region, Northwest Territories, Canada | journal = Arctic | issue = 1 | pages = 37–46 | date = 2007 | pmid =  | doi = 10.14430/arctic263 |name-list-format=vanc| author2 = Modeste P | author3 = Blondin  | url = http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3143/Arctic60-1-37.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in other parts of the GEWEX study, these oscillations are an aspect of climate forcing, which allow testing of predictions and models. This modeling may be complicated by the fact that the North Atlantic Oscillation in switching state (see graph) as the effects of global warming are becoming more prominent. For example, 2006 and 2007 saw one of the most dramatic declines in Arctic Sea ice, a decline that was largely unpredicted and can shift the late summer albedo in the northern hemisphere. In 2008, sea ice extent decline has backed off from the previous years' trend, and researchers had forecast a strong La Nina event for late 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climate.the-environmentalist.org/2008/01/2008-temperature-prediction.html ''2008 Temperature Prediction''] Climate on The Environmentalist. The Environmentalist&lt;/ref&gt; However, unexpectedly the surface temperatures in the Eastern Pacific have already begun to rise to El-Nino temperature ranges, indicating the La Nina event may terminate unexpectedly. With this the loss of Northern Polar sea ice has begun to accelerate back toward the earlier trend. Such rapid and unexpected changes in climate-forcing events eventually suggest that modelers need to include parameters such as ocean temperature thermoclines, energy accumulation in the tropical oceans, sea ice extents in the polar regions, land glacial ice retraction in Greenland, and sheet ice and shelf ice remodeling in Antarctica. When multiple climate-forcing influences are acting simultaneously in which one of the events will eventually take dominance, lack of precedents from the past study of similar confluences of events, as well as knowledge of the uncertainty of sensitive 'switches' in the oceanic/atmospheric switches may affect the ability to provide accurate models and predictions. In addition, sampling points may be spread to monitor leading indicators in one common scenario may be useless during an oscillation where the pool of energy shifts to an unmonitored region so that the magnitude of the shift avoids computation.

[[Image:La Nina and Pacific Decadal Anomalies - April 2008.png|thumb|right|350px|Anomalies in April 2008. Note while the central Pacific tropics are under La-Nina, the Eastern Pacific is warming]] 
An example of climate-forcing anomalies might be used to describe the events of 1998 to 2002, a strong El-Nino/La Nina cycle. The onset of the cycle can be influenced by global warming, which facilitated a larger increase of warm water in the tropics, rapidly enough that the thermocline was tolerant. A thermocline is a sharp temperature drop at depth; it varies during the year, with location, and over long periods of time. As the thermocline depth increases El-Nino events are more likely; however, during the peak of the event energy is dissipated and the thermocline decreases depth, possibly to below normal levels so the a strong La-Nina event can results. The world's oceans, particularly the depths of the Atlantic, are believed to be a sink for {{CO2}} that is adsorbed at the polar regions, as this builds into the Pacific the upwelling and warming of water can bring {{CO2}}-rich waters trapped in the cold pressurized bottom layers to the surface. Local increases of {{CO2}} occur which allow more heat trapping; the La-Nina may be mild or aborted early in the process. However, if the return of the thermocline has enough momentum it could propel a strong La-Nina event that last for a few years. However, rapid cooling in the Arctic can allow for more {{CO2}} trapping and offset release of {{CO2}} during La-Nina in a specific area. The Pacific Decadal Anomaly (PDA See image) may influence the source, direction or momentum of rise of the cold water component of the thermocline.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=18012 La Nina and Pacific Decadal Oscillation Cool the Pacific] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602054936/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=18012 |date=2008-06-02 }} Earth Observatory Newsroom, NASA&lt;/ref&gt; The extent and duration of the PDA are yet unpredictable, and its modulating effects on El-Nino/La-Nina patterns can only be speculated. These unknowns affect the ability for climate modelers to predict and indicate climate-forcing models need to accurate a wider sampling of data to be predictive.

[[Image:Milankovitch Variations.png|thumb|left|350px|Scientist still don't know which of these cycles determines the onset of ice-ages and interglacial, were we headed into an ice-age or 50,000 years from now, see [[Milankovitch cycles]]]] There are also longer term cycles, the [[mini ice-age]] that preceded the [[medieval warm period]] may have been a transition to an ice age, the last ice-age lasted from ~130,000 years ago until the onset of the Holocene. This ice-age may have been aborted by other factors including global warming. Such a stalling of long-term cycles is believed to be a factor in the Dryas period, a warming interrupted by surface impacts of extraterrestrial origin may have occurred over hundreds of years.  But the anthropogenic greenhouse effects and changing insolation patterns may have unpredictable long-term effects. Reductions of glacial ice on land masses can cause isotatic rebounds, and may affect earthquakes and volcanism over a wide range. Rising sea levels can also affect patterns, and was seen in Indonesia, simply drilling a gas well in the wrong place may have touched off a mud volcano and there are some signs that this may precede a new caldera formation for a volcano. Over the very long term, the change in temperature of the Earth's crust on geothermal and volcanic processes is unknown. How this plays into climate-forcing events with magnitudes that are unpredictable is unknown.

The critiques at GEWEX can only be thrust at current results, which have added much more information about climate modeling that have created critiques, the major thrust of modeling was originally intended to be part of Phase II which will, after 4 years, produce its results. One of the major critiques of GEWEX phase I was land based measurements, which are now increasing. The other major critique is the inability to capture decadal rainfall events, events that frequently occur over a few hours. Therefore, more measurements documenting shorter time frames may provide essential data for almost continuous data set. Therefore, Phase II is mainly modeling with addition of more data as deemed lacking in Phase I. Many of the critiques above may be compensated for with better data requiring better models including insolation and changes in reflection. The problem with variation in ocean currents, particular with respect to thermocline depths requires more oceanography as part of the project, as with losses of ice and changes of climate on the ice edges.

'''Greenwave''' is a mass [[science]] [[experiment]] involving primary schools across [[Ireland]]. It examines and records how spring arrives in [[Ireland]]. This is an educational and science initiative of the [[Irish Government]]’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) awareness programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2008/0202/1201821933083.html Article in The Irish Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish students observe and record when certain plants and animals react to the longer days and warmer temperatures, in order to find out whether the "green wave" of spring moves from south to north across [[Ireland]] or inland from the coast to the centre of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sligoweekender.ie/news/story/?trs=mhgbauauid Article in the Sligo Weekender]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/news/tipp-schools-take-part-in-experiment-on-spring-season-1288914.html Article in The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forfas.ie/publications/forfas_annrpt06/developing/dis.html Forfás Annual Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking part in Greenwave is a practical way to support the teaching of Social Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE) part of the Irish Primary School Curriculum. The students develop their skills in:
*Observing
*Classifying
*Recognising patterns
*Estimating and measuring
*Recording and communicating

Schools registered in the [[Discover Primary Science]] programme, another initiative of DSE, can also earn credit towards their Award of Science Excellence by taking part in Greenwave.

DSE runs numerous other initiatives, including [[Science Week Ireland]], [[Discover Primary Science]] and [[Science.ie]].

== History ==
The project originated as The [[Wellcome Trust]]'s History of Twentieth Century Medicine Group, and later functioned as the Academic Unit of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine. It was originally established at the Royal College of Physicians in 1990 and comprised Sir [[Christopher Booth]] (the Harveian Librarian) and Professor [[Tilli Tansey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aronson|first1=Jeff |title=Wellcome witnesses to twentieth-century medicine |journal=Cambridge Journal Medical History |date=July 1998 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=404–405 |pmc=1044055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to devise ways of stimulating historians, scientists &amp; clinicians to discuss, preserve and write the history of recent biomedicine. The Group's activities were originally overseen by a Programme Committee, which included professional historians of medicine, practising scientists and clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pickstone|first1=John V.|title=A brief history of medical history|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/history_of_medicine.html |publisher=Making History|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2010 it was a constituent part of the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London. In October 2010 it moved to the School of History, Queen Mary’s University, London.

An archive of oral and written history, plus videoed interviews, has been compiled by the HoMBRG and consists of three projects: Witness Seminars, Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History and SAD at 30. All material and documentation related to the project is deposited with the Wellcome Library.  The resultant publications are open access,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Medical Humanities|first1=Centre for|title=New Open Access Publication – The Development of Narrative Practices in Medicine c.1960–c.2000|url=http://centreformedicalhumanities.org/new-open-access-publication-the-development-of-narrative-practices-in-medicine-c-1960-c-2000/ |publisher=[[Durham University]] |accessdate=31 May 2015|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made freely available online via the HoMBRG website, a partnership with the Medical Heritage Library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library|first1=Medical History|title=The MHL Welcomes a New Content Contributor|url=http://www.medicalheritage.org/2013/03/the-mhl-welcomes-a-new-content-contributor-2/|website=Medical History Library|publisher=Medical History Library|accessdate=29 May 2015|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; and iTunes.&lt;ref name="apple.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/todays-neuroscience-tomorrows/id557520467?mt=10|title=Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History - Professor Sir Peter Mansfield - Free Podcast by Queen Mary University of London on Apple Podcasts|website=Apple Podcasts|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History ===

The Group's 'Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History' initiative (2006-2008) was funded by a Wellcome Trust Public Engagement grant. It recorded interviews on three themes, [[neuropharmacology]], [[psychiatry]]/[[neuropsychology]], and [[neuroimaging]], with twelve neuroscientists, including [[Geoffrey Burnstock]], [[Salvador Moncada]], [[Michael Rutter]] and [[Uta Frith]].&lt;ref name="TNTH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histmodbiomed.org/article/about-todays-neuroscience-tomorrows-history|title=About Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History|publisher=HoMBRG|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Witness Seminars ===

A series of [[witness seminar]]s began in 1993, with regular meetings being held, about four per year.  These recorded the voices of those who have contributed, in diverse ways, to the development of modern [[biomedicine]], using oral history methodology.  The aim is to make the series widely available for education, research and outreach purposes.&lt;ref name=JonesEM&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=E.M.|editor2-last=Tansey|editor2-first=E.M.|title=Monoclonal Antibodies to Migraine: Witnesses to Modern Biomedicine, An A-Z|date=2014|publisher=Queen Mary, University of London|location=London|isbn=978 0 90223 895 4|pages=223|ref=none|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patient.info/forums/discuss/migraine-diagnosis-treatment-and-understanding-270038|title=Migraine: Diagnosis, Treatment and Understanding  - Migraine - Patient|website=patient.info|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Emma M.|year=2016|title=A witness seminar on the history of the Human Gene Mapping Workshops|journal=Gene|volume=589|issue=2|pages=123–126|issn=0378-1119|doi=10.1016/j.gene.2016.02.030|pmc=4925380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Messenger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://waste-management-world.com/a/an-oral-history-of-waste-management-by-university-historians-in-london|title=An Oral History of Waste Management by University Historians in London|last=Messenger|first=Ben|date=15 January 2016|work=Waste Management World|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tansey2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tansey|first1=T  |first2=A. |last2=Wilkinson |first3=A. |last3=Yabsley |first4=A. |last4=Zarros |year=2016|title=Physiology at the heart of modern biomedicine: Evidence through oral testimonies|journal=Proceedings of the Physiological Society|publisher=[[The Physiological Society]]|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are published online,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-134-70170-4| last1 = McConville| first1 = Sean| last2 = Bryson| first2 = Anna| title = The Routledge Guide to Interviewing: Oral History, Social Enquiry and Investigation |year=2013 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; with most edited transcripts appearing within 18 months.&lt;ref name=JonesEM/&gt;

The first two volumes were reviewed in ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' in 1999, with the comment, "Few books are so intellectually stimulating or uplifting."&lt;ref name="BlauJN"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blau|first=J N|year=1999|title=Wellcome Witnesses to Twentieth Century Medicine, Vols 1 and 2|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=92|pages=206–8}} &lt;!--PMC1297150 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the series in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 2002, medical historian [[Irvine Loudon]] wrote, "This is oral history at its best...all the volumes make compulsive reading...they are, primarily, important historical records&lt;ref name="Loudon2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loudon|first=I.|year=2002|title=Book: Wellcome Witnesses to Twentieth Century Medicine|journal=BMJ|volume=325|issue=7372|pages=1119a–1119|issn=0959-8138|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7372.1119/a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a seminar, chaired by Professor Sir Brian Follett, with [[Norman Rosenthal]] and [[Alfred Lewy]], entitled 'The Recent History of [[Seasonal Affective Disorder]] (SAD): 30 Years of SAD' was undertaken on the topic of Seasonal Affective Disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Association|first1=SAD|title=Wellcome Trust Wtness Seminar:An Important New Publication|url=http://www.sada.org.uk/sada_get_news_item.php?action=show&amp;id=34-3-News |publisher=SAD Association|accessdate=31 May 2015|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a number of podcasts,&lt;ref name="apple.com"/&gt; and Volume 51 of the Witness Seminar publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Overy|editor1-first=C|editor2-last=Tansey|editor2-first=E.M.|title=The Recent History Of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)|date=2014|publisher=Queen Mary, University of London|location=London|isbn=978 0 90223 897 8|url=http://ischronobiology.org/Joomla_1.5.26-Stable-Full_Package/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=109:the-recent-history-of-seasonal-affective-disorder&amp;catid=45:books&amp;Itemid=68|accessdate=29 May 2015|ref=none|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clips and Conversations ===

In 2015 the Group began producing oral history interviews with notable scientists and clinicians. This material is made freely available on YouTube (in the case of video interviews) and the Group’s website, as are the transcripts of both audio and video interviews.&lt;ref name="OHHEN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ohhen.wordpress.com/2017/01/29/makers-of-modern-biomedicine-testimonies-and-legacy/|title=Makers of Modern Biomedicine: Testimonies and Legacy|publisher=Oral History in Higher Education Network|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5386">'''IEC 61162''' is a collection of [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards for "Digital interfaces for navigational equipment within a ship".

The 61162 standards are developed in Working Group 6 (WG6) of Technical Committee 80 (TC80) of the IEC.

==Sections of IEC 61162==
Standard ''IEC 61162'' is divided into four parts:
* Part 1: Single talker and multiple listeners (Also known as [[NMEA 0183]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design challenges and decisions for a new ship data network|url=http://www.mits-forum.org/resources/lwe-paper-isis-v9.pdf|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part 2: Single talker and multiple listeners, high-speed transmission
* Part 3: Serial data instrument network (Also known as [[NMEA 2000]])
* Part 450:  Multiple talkers and multiple listeners–Ethernet interconnection (Also known as Lightweight Ethernet)
* Part 460:  Multiple talkers and multiple listeners - Ethernet interconnection - Safety and security
 
The 61162 standards are all concerning the transport of [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]] sentences, but the IEC
does not define any of these. This is left to the [http://www.nmea.org/ NMEA Organization].

==IEC 61162-1==
Single talker and multiple listeners
is an international standard

==IEC 61162-2==
Single talker and multiple listeners, high-speed transmission

==IEC 61162-3==
Serial data instrument network

==IEC 61162-450==
Multiple talkers Multiple listeners

This subgroup of TC80/WG6 has specified the use of Ethernet for shipboard navigational networks. The
specification describes the transport of NMEA sentences as defined in 61162-1 over IPv4. Due to
the low amount of protocol complexity it has been nicknamed Lightweight Ethernet or LWE in short.

The historical background and justification for LWE was presented at the ISIS2011 symposium.&lt;ref&gt;Ø.J. Rødseth, et al. "Overview of the IEC 61162-450 “Light Weight Ethernet” Ship Bridge Data Network", ISIS2011&lt;/ref&gt; An overview article of LWE was
given in the December issue of "Digital Ship"&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Christensen, et al. ''Lightweight Ethernet - a new standard for shipbord networks" [http://issuu.com/mortenjc/docs/digital_ship_december_2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard was published in the first edition 06/2011 . The second edition is in progress(state 05/2016). 

==IEC 61162-460==
IEC 61162-460:2015(E) is an add-on to the IEC 61162-450 standard where higher safety and security standards are needed, e.g. due to higher exposure to external threats or to improve network integrity. This standard provides requirements and test methods for equipment to be used in an IEC 61162-460 compliant network as well as requirements for the network itself and requirements for interconnection from the network to other networks. This standard also contains requirements for a redundant IEC 61162-460 compliant network. This standard extends the informative guidance given in Annex D of IEC 61162-450:2011. It does not introduce new application level protocol requirements to those that are defined in IEC 61162-450. 

The first edition was published in 08/2015.

'''Jeffrey "Jeff" Weld''' (born August 17, 1960 in Glendale, California) is a science educator serving as Senior Policy Advisor in STEM Education for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, on leave from his post as executive director of the Iowa Governor's [[STEM fields|STEM]]&lt;ref name="Oppenhuizen20120330"/&gt; Advisory Council which he's occupied since its launch in July, 2011.&lt;ref name="Oppenhuizen20121026"/&gt; He is an Associate Professor of Biology at the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) in Cedar Falls, Iowa.&lt;ref name="TC"/&gt;

Weld is a prolific author, focusing on surmounting impediments to high quality science teaching.&lt;ref name="TC"/&gt; His latest publication, the book Creating a STEM Culture for Teaching and Learning (NSTA Press), examines all aspects of the nation's STEM (science-technology-engineering-mathematics) movement.&lt;ref name="Creating"/&gt; Formerly a secondary school science teacher he was awarded as Ciba-Geigy 1993 Life Science Teacher of the Year in Iowa,&lt;ref name="TC"/&gt; the 1994 Pella Corporation Focus on Teaching Excellence award,&lt;ref name="TC"/&gt; and in 1995 a national Access Excellence Fellowship of the [[Genentech]] corporation.&lt;ref name="TC"/&gt; As a college professor Weld was named national collegiate biology teacher of the year, four-year institutions in 2007 by the National Association of Biology Teachers.&lt;ref name="nabt"/&gt; In 2013, Weld received an ''Outstanding Service'' award from the [[Iowa Academy of Science]]&lt;ref name="SII"/&gt; and an ''Alumni Accomplishment Honor'' from his alma mater, the [[University of Iowa]].&lt;ref name="Spangler"/&gt; In 2014, he received a ''STEM Champion'' award from the Triangle Coalition.&lt;ref name="TCB"/&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Weld is the fifth of six offspring (Vicki, Douglas, Rhonda, Sandra, Eric) of single parent Aileen (Feany) Weld, a career government servant, first for the FBI then for the Veterans Administration, now retired. Weld’s father Don had served in the Marine Corp and written for newspapers. Weld spent his early school years, 1969 to 1977, in Iowa City, Iowa, before relocating to Northampton, Massachusetts, and graduating from Northampton High School in 1978. A first-generation collegian, he attended Greenfield Community College in Massachusetts before transferring to the University of Iowa in 1980. He earned a bachelor of science degree in secondary education from the University of Iowa in 1983. After serving Camp Fire youth camps in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], followed by ski lodge maintenance at Millers Inn, [[Winter Park, Colorado]], he returned to the University of Iowa for graduate study, completing an endorsement in science education (biology) in 1985. From 1990 to 1992 Weld enrolled in the master’s program in biology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. He completed a master's degree in Science Education at the University of Iowa in 1994. In 1998, Weld completed the doctoral program in Science Education at the University of Iowa under [[John Penick]] and Robert Yager, earning competencies in ecology for work in predator-prey aquatic population regulation, and endocrinology for work on molt hormone synthesis in ''Cancer antennarius''.&lt;ref name="Spaziani"/&gt;

== Career ==
In December, 2017, Dr. Weld commenced an appointment to the White House Office of Science And Technology Policy as Senior Policy Advisor for STEM Education. His main responsibility at the OSTP is to lead the development of an updated 2018-2023 Federal STEM Education 5-Year Strategic Plan.&lt;ref name="2013FedSTEM-Plan"/&gt; He is on leave from directing the Iowa Governor’s STEM Advisory Council, a role he has occupied since the Council's inception in July, 2011.&lt;ref name="InnovationIowa"/&gt; Under Weld's directorship, Iowa showed annual gains in test scores, elective enrollments, post-secondary enrollments, and public support for STEM education.&lt;ref name="AnnualReport"/&gt; Weld previously directed the inter-university collaborative program the Iowa Mathematics and Science Education Partnership from 2008 to 2011.&lt;ref name="LSA"/&gt; Weld has hosted an annual Midwest STEM Leaders Forum and served on the Boards of the national organizations the Triangle Coalition for STEM Education and the National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity Education Foundation.
From 2000 to 2008 Dr. Weld occupied a faculty line in the department of biology at the University of Northern Iowa &lt;ref name="RMP"/&gt; where he created a minor in Natural History Interpretation, taught courses in teacher preparation, published in scholarly and popular press including the popular textbook The Game of Science Education.&lt;ref name="Game"/&gt; During his faculty service Weld won $7.2 million in external funding, operated a teachers-in-research program, conducted faculty workshops on interdisciplinarity through Carver Trust grants, presided over the Iowa science teachers association, chaired the campus chapter of the scientific research society [[Sigma Xi]], and served as Provost’s Administrative Fellow for the university’s central administration.  
From 1998 to 2000, Dr. Weld was an assistant professor in science education at Oklahoma State University.
From 1985 to 1996 Weld taught high school sciences in Mission, Texas (1985-1988), Kirkwood, Missouri (1988 to 1992), and Pella, Iowa (1992-1996) and coached football, wrestling, baseball, basketball, and soccer. During that time he wrote columns for Educational Leadership and Phi Delta Kappan, among others.&lt;ref name="EdLead"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PDK"/&gt;

[[File:Land drains near Halsham - geograph.org.uk - 1733463.jpg|thumb|Land drains near [[Halsham]], England]]
The purpose of a '''land drain''' is to allow water in wet or swampy ground to rapidly drain away or to relieve [[hydrostatic pressure]]. They are subterranean linear structures which are laid to a fall which should be as steep as practicable. They are used in agriculture and in building construction sites. Modern land drains take the form of a perforated or discontinuous (i.e. open-jointed) pipe. Typically, the land drains conduct the surplus water to an open ditch or natural water source.

==In agriculture==
Traditionally, land drains were formed in [[clay]] soils and [[peat]]s by excavating a trench and forming a "tunnel" using flat stones. This was very labour-intensive but could be often be done using free materials at hand. Typically they were two to three feet (600mm-900mm) below the surface. Agricultural land drains have to be installed sufficiently deep to avoid [[plough]] damage. In 1843 in England short [[earthenware]] pipes were first used laid edge to edge. The earliest type consisted of a "u" shaped trough onto which a flat lid was placed. Later the extruded clay pipe was developed. These are still used. These can be laid in an excavated trench, or a horizontal hole is formed in the ground using a [[mole plough]] and the pipes are forced in by means of a hand or mechanical press. By this means, heavy wet soils, bogs and swamps could be rendered amendable to agriculture.  Virtually all crops need a well drained soil to grow well.

==Modern land drains==
Many modern land drains are created utilising rigid or flexible plastic pipes pierced with holes,  laid in pea gravel. (The pea gravel is pea-sized pebbles without sharp points to damage the pipe.) [[Geotextile]] material can surround the gravel to keep out silt. This can be installed in an excavated trench. Specialised mole [[plough]]s are available that can form the hole, insert the perforated pipe (and gravel if required), all in one simultaneous and continuous process. An extremely powerful (usually tracked) [[tractor]] is necessary. The flexible pipe is carried as a roll on the back of the machine. There is a sometimes a [[hopper (particulate collection container)|hopper]] for gravel which is kept topped up by an adjacent machine. The pipe and gravel go down apertures in the plough blade as the tractor proceeds along the desired route.

==In building construction==
The purpose of land drains in building construction is somewhat different. If voids are created in the ground for any reason they tend to fill with water. Also the static loads on any subterranean structure and retaining walls can be massively increased by the presence of water in the surrounding ground.  Land drains are introduced to relieve this pressure. Traditionally, the drains were created by backfilling behind retaining walls etc. with rubble and allowing the water to drain through the rubble to some suitable point.

==As part of highway construction==
Instead of having open ditches at the side of highways, land drains can be installed. The excavated trenches are completely filled with gravel (i.e., no soil cover). This is far safer than open trenches if a vehicle should run off the highway.

==Problems==
Holes or gaps have to be left in the pipes to allow water to transfer from the subsoil to the pipe and these tend to block with soil or allow silt into the pipe, so blocking it or reducing the flow of water. This can be partially overcome by surrounding the pipes with gravel. However, with time even the gravel becomes choked with soil/silt, so in the latest practice,  the gravel is surrounded with a [[geotextile]] material which filters out soil particles. Ideally, land drains are laid with access points so that high pressure water jetting is possible to clear silt. However, whatever the technology, all land drains have a finite life and eventually become ineffective due to the ingress of silt and/or the blocking of the surrounding filter media.

In [[broadcasting]], '''local insertion''' (known in the [[United Kingdom]] as an '''opt-out''') is the act or capability of a broadcast [[television station]], [[radio station]] or [[cable television|cable]] system to insert or replace part of a [[broadcast network|network]] feed with [[content (media and publishing)|content]] unique to the local station or system. Most often this is a [[station identification]] (required by the [[broadcasting authority]] such as the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]]), but is also commonly used for [[television commercial|television]] or [[radio ad]]vertisements, or a weather or [[traffic report]]. A [[digital on-screen graphic]] ("dog" or "bug"), commonly a translucent [[watermark]], may also be [[keying (graphics)|keyed]] (superimposed) with a television station ID over the network feed using a [[character generator]] using [[genlock]]. In cases where individual broadcast stations carry programs separate from those shown on the main network, this is known as [[regional variation]] (in the [[United Kingdom]]) or an opt-out (in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]).

Automated local insertion used to be triggered with [[in-band signaling]], such as [[DTMF]] tones or [[infrasound|sub-audible sounds]] (such as 25 [[Hertz|Hz]]), but is now done with [[out-of-band signaling]], such as [[analog signal]] [[subcarrier]]s via [[communications satellite]], or now more commonly via [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]]s; [[broadcast automation]] equipment can then handle these automatically.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In an emergency, such as [[severe weather]], local insertion may also occur instantly through command from another network or other source (such as the [[Emergency Alert System]] or [[First Warning]]). In this case, the most urgent warning messages may interrupt without delay, while others may be worked into a normal break in programming within 15 minutes of their initial issuance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Within individual programs==
In the [[United States]], insertion can easily be heard every evening on the nationally [[broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|syndicated]] radio show ''[[Delilah Rene|Delilah]]'', where the host does a pre-recorded station-specific [[voiceover]] played over a [[music bed]] from the network. When host Delilah Rene says "this is Delilah", her voice (often in a slightly different tone or mood than what she has just been speaking) then identifies the [[moniker|branding]] or identification for the specific station (for example, "on B98.5 FM" when heard on [[WSB-FM]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]). Because of this slight difference in vocal quality, many syndicated radio networks suggest using only one voice for local station IDs 24/7; this way, the difference in vocal intonation is lessened. Insertion is made conspicuous when, due to carelessness, or even abuse—e.g. to squeeze in one more ad—the network program is already underway by the time the insert closes.

The other more prominent example is during [[Broadcasting of sports events|live sports programming]] carried over radio and television networks, where close to the top of the hour, a [[play-by-play announcer]] will say "we pause ten seconds for station identification; this is the (team name) (radio network branding)", or a close equivalent. On most stations, this is a basic [[station identification]], as required by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), with the call letters and [[city of license]] relayed, while on others a quickly-read five second advertisement or program promotion is read before the identification, or a [[breaking news]] event or weather warning occurring during the event is relayed, followed by the station ID. Due to many sports rights deals for televised sports moving to [[regional sports network]]s which are not required to identify themselves under FCC guidelines, or network sports coverage where the station is identified through an on-screen display by the local station rather than speech, this is more prominent on radio rather than television.

Local commercial (and some non-commercial) broadcast television stations also insert local commercial breaks during programming each half-hour while network-supplied or syndicated content is being broadcast. Television networks and syndication distributors give their [[network affiliate|affiliate]]s either 60, 90 or 120 seconds each half-hour (typically totaling about four minutes per hour) to run local station breaks, including [[promo (media)|promos]] for the station and advertisements for national and local area businesses (and on a few stations, local news updates – which were particularly common during the 1970s through the 1990s, especially as the "24 Hour News Source" format became commonplace in the United States during the latter decade – current time and temperature information, or a brief local weather forecast), over network programming. Typically, these networks air a blank feed showing the network's logo (such as with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[NBC]] and [[The CW]]) or a series of [[public service announcements]] (as with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and CBS), while stations air local commercials. [[PBS]] member stations and other [[non-commercial educational]] stations also insert promos for network series and/or syndicated or locally produced programming during promo breaks; as these station are non-commercial, breaks are typically not featured during the programs themselves, instead promos are inserted in-between shows, even – in the case of PBS members – if the station is carrying the national network feed.

Various [[Breakfast television|television morning news shows]] (such as ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'') also allocate five minutes of programming time each half-hour for stations to carry a local news update (which sometimes run as little as three minutes) at :25 and :55 minutes past the hour; however the national feed continues for stations that do not wish to "break away", either because they do not air a morning newscast or simply do not have a news department (for example, some mid-sized and smaller market NBC affiliates, such as [[KTEN]] in [[Ada, Oklahoma]], do not air news cut-ins during the weekend edition of ''Today'' if they do not have a weekend morning newscast, but cut-ins are shown during the weekday telecasts where ''Today'' follows a morning newscast). This also occurs with news on [[NPR]]'s ''[[Morning Edition]]'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]'', which respectively air during the morning and evening rush hours.

Starting in the early 1990s, some cable television systems began carrying a local insert called "[[Local Edition]]", a segment featuring local news inserts (which are produced by area television stations or local cable operators) that air at :24 and :54 minutes past the hour during [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]]'s rolling daytime news block, usually during the network's non-essential features news block. This has been discontinued as that network has switched to a general news/talk format beginning in 2005.

==Transmitter identification==
[[Broadcast translator|Translator stations]] may also have local insertion, though this is generally limited to identifying the repeating station's [[callsign]] and [[city of license|community of license]] separate from its parent station. In the United States, the FCC also allows up to 30 seconds each hour for fundraising to keep the translator service on the air.

==Pay television==
Local insertion is also used by cable and [[telephone company]] television providers, in which cable and telco [[cable headend|headends]] insert advertisements for the system, promotions for programs on other cable channels carried by the provider and commercials for local area businesses (such as car dealerships or furniture stores) at least twice each hour; unlike most commercial broadcast stations, however, cable channels often run only 60 seconds of local commercial inserts each half-hour near the end of the first or second commercial break and are aired in place of national ads or network promos that air during that given time. [[Direct-broadcast satellite]] services cannot locally insert content during commercial breaks, so viewers are either able to see ads or promos that are covered up by the local content on cable or see a DBS provider's own promotions.

Local insertion on cable television is used especially on [[The Weather Channel]] in the U.S. and [[The Weather Network]]/[[MétéoMédia]] in Canada, where systems like the [[WeatherStar]], [[IntelliStar]] and [[PMX (technology)|PMX]] have been used to show regularly scheduled local [[weather forecast]]s (known as "[[Local on the 8s]]" on The Weather Channel in the U.S.), and well as the lower display line (LDL) or [[lower third|lower-third]] graphic that is shown at other times. The Weather Channel, in particular also airs ads during national breaks at the end of some advertisements allowing its WeatherSTAR or IntelliSTAR systems to insert selected locations for certain businesses operating in the area, such as restaurants or auto rental dealers; though The Weather Channel has not done this as much in recent years as they have in the past. This only applies to the cable systems, although in the U.S. direct-broadcast satellite services have shown an LDL of the current conditions and 12-hour forecast for select major cities. This is not seen on older [[Television receive-only|TVRO]] or "[[big ugly dish]]" systems, as this is intended as a [[backhaul (telecom)|backhaul]] and has very few [[end-user]]s, and is used as a [[clean feed (TV)|clean feed]].

===Set-top boxes===
In place of the IntelliSTAR, a hyperlocal form of insertion is now done on [[DirecTV]] (and possibly other DBS services), whereby the first half of the local forecast is generated by the [[set-top box]]. A "cutout" at the upper right corner of the picture allows the sponsor's advertising logo to be shown live from the main video feed, while a [[datacast]] on the satellite (like that which provides the [[electronic program guide]]) sends simple forecast and conditions data for the entire country every couple of minutes. Graphics are stored on the receiver, and displayed according to the forecast, which is selected by [[ZIP code]] or city according to user settings.

Additionally, starting in 2011, DirecTV users with [[digital video recorder]]s will have commercials [[download]]ed to their boxes, which will play according to their [[demographic]] information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DirecTV Will Launch First Targeted TV Commercials|url=http://www.newsamen.com/101807/directv-will-launch-first-targeted-tv-commercials|work=NewsAmen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; likely commanding higher [[revenue]] from [[advertiser]]s. This may eventually lead to or merge with [[interactive television]], which may find more success on cable and telco television because of the lack of a [[return channel]] on satellite and broadcast. [[Internet-connected TV]]s may erode this barrier as well, however, with only their embedded [[flash memory]] chip necessary to hold short video clips.

'''Metabolic rift''' is  [[Karl Marx| Karl Marx's]] notion of the "irreparable rift in the interdependent process of [[social metabolism]],"&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. 1981. ''Capital, vol. III''. New York: Vintage, p. 949.&lt;/ref&gt;—Marx's key conception of [[ecological crisis]] tendencies under [[capitalism]].  Marx theorized a rupture in the metabolic interaction between humanity and the rest of nature emanating from capitalist production and the growing division between town and country.

Metabolic rift, according to [[John Bellamy Foster]] who coined the term, is the development of Marx's earlier work in the [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts'']] on [[species-being]] and the relationship between humans and nature. Metabolism is Marx's "mature analysis of the alienation of nature,"&lt;ref&gt;Foster, John Bellamy (2000) [http://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb0122/ ''Marx's Ecology: Materialism and Nature''], New York: Monthly Review Press, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; and presents "a more solid—and scientific—way in which to depict the complex, dynamic interchange between human beings and nature, resulting from human labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = John Bellamy | year = 1999 | title = 'Marx's Theory of Metabolic Rift: Classical Foundations for Environmental Sociology' | jstor =10.1086/210315 | journal = The American Journal of Sociology | volume = 105 | issue = 2| page = 381 | doi=10.1086/210315| citeseerx = 10.1.1.534.2551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to those who have attributed to Marx a disregard for nature and responsibility for the environmental problems of the [[Soviet Union]] and other purportedly [[communist state]]s, Foster sees in the theory of metabolic rift evidence of Marx's [[Ecology|ecological]] perspective. The theory of metabolic rift "enable[ed] [Marx] to develop a critique of environmental degradation that anticipated much of present-day ecological thought,"&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; including questions of [[sustainability]].

== Origins ==

=== Soil exhaustion and agricultural revolutions ===
Marx's writings on metabolism were developed during England's "second" [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] (1815–1880), a period which was characterized by the development of [[soil chemistry]] and the growth of the use of chemical [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The depletion of [[Fertility (soil)|soil fertility]], or "soil exhaustion," had become a key concern for capitalist society, and demand for fertilizer was such that Britain and other powers initiated explicit policies for the importation of [[Bone meal|bone]] and [[guano]], including raiding of Napoleonic battlefields&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; and catacombs,&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; British monopolization of Peruvian guano supplies,&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the United States, "the imperial annexation of any [[List of Guano Island claims|islands]] thought to be rich in [guano]"  through the [[Guano Islands Act]] (1856).&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = Brett | last2 = Foster | first2 = John Bellamy | year = 2009 | title = 'Ecological Imperialism and the Global Metabolic Rift: Unequal Exchange and the Guano/Nitrates Trade' | url = | journal = International Journal of Comparative Sociology | volume = 50 | issue = 3–4| pages = 311–334 | doi = 10.1177/0020715209105144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liebig and soil science ===

Marx's theory drew heavily on contemporary advances in agricultural chemistry unknown to earlier classical economists such as [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]]. For them, different levels of soil fertility (and thus [[Economic rent|rent]]) was attributed "almost entirely to the natural or absolute productivity of the soil,"&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; with improvement (or degradation) playing only a minor role.

German agricultural chemist [[Liebig|Justus von Liebig]], in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=p-IMAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Organic+Chemistry+in+its+Application+to+Agriculture+and+Physiology  ''Organic Chemistry in Its Applications to Agriculture and Physiology''] (1840), presented the first convincing explanation of the role of soil nutrients in the growth of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; In [https://books.google.com/books?id=90AQAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Organic+Chemistry+in+its+Application+to+Physiology+and+Pathology 1842], Liebig expanded the use of the term [[metabolism]] (''Stoffwechsel''), from referring to material exchanges in the body, up to the biochemical processes of natural systems.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster argues that Liebig's work became more critical of capitalist agriculture as time went on. From the standpoint of nutrient cycling, the socio-economic relationship between rural and urban areas was self-evidently contradictory, hindering the possibility of sustainability:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If it were practicable to collect, with the least loss, all the solid and fluid excrements of the inhabitants of the town, and return to each farmer the portion arising from produce originally supplied by him to the town, the productiveness of the land might be maintained almost unimpaired for ages to come, and the existing store of mineral elements in every fertile field would be amply sufficient for the wants of increasing populations.&lt;ref&gt;von Liebig, Justus (1863) ''The Natural Laws of Husbandry'', New York: D. Appleton, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Human labor and nature ===

Marx rooted his theory of social-ecological metabolism in Liebig's analysis but connected it to his understanding of the labor process.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx understood that, throughout history, it was through labor that humans appropriated nature to satisfy their needs.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the metabolism, or interaction, of society with nature is "a universal and perpetual condition."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (1996) ''Justice, Nature and the Geography of Difference'', Malden: Blackwell, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', Marx integrated his [[materialist]] conception of nature with his [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Fertility, Marx argued, was not a natural quality of the soil, but was rather bound up with the social relations of the time. By conceptualizing the complex, interdependent processes of material exchange and regulatory actions that link human society with non-human nature as "metabolic relations," Marx allowed these processes to be both "nature-imposed conditions" and subject to human [[Agency (sociology)|agency]],&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; a dynamic largely missed, according to Foster, by the reduction of ecological questions to [[Ecocentrism|issues of value]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writers since Marx ==

The central contribution of the metabolic rift perspective is to locate socio-ecological contradictions internal to the development of capitalism. Later socialists expanded upon Marx's ideas, including [[Bukharin|Nikolai Bukharin]] in ''Historical Materialism'' (1921) and [[Karl Kautsky]] in ''The Agrarian Question'' (1899), which developed questions of the exploitation of the countryside by the town and the "fertilizer treadmill" that resulted from metabolic rift.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary [[Eco-socialism|eco-socialist]] theorists aside from Foster have also explored these directions, including [[James O'Connor (academic)|James O'Connor]], who sees capitalist undervaluing of nature as leading to economic crisis, what he refers to as 
[[Eco-socialism#The "second contradiction" of capitalism|the second contradiction of capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, James (1997) ''Natural Causes: Essays in Ecological Marxism'', New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars from a variety of disciplines have drawn on Marx's metabolic approach and the concept of metabolic rift in analyzing the relation of society to the rest of nature.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://monthlyreview.org/commentary/metabolic-rift Metabolic Rift: A Selected Bibliography]"&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing amounts of [[carbon dioxide]] being released into the environment from capitalist production, the theory of a [[carbon rift]] has also immerged.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Brett, and Richard York. “Carbon Metabolism: Global Capitalism, Climate Change, and the Biospheric Rift.” ''Theory and Society'', vol. 34, no. 4, 2005, pp. 391–428. www.jstor.org/stable/4501730&lt;/ref&gt;

The metabolic rift is characterized in different ways by historical materialists. For [http://www.jasonwmoore.com Jason W. Moore], the distinction between social and natural systems is empirically false and theoretically arbitrary; following a different reading of Marx, Moore views metabolisms as relations of human and extra-human natures. In this view, capitalism's metabolic rift unfolds through the town-country division of labor, itself a "bundle" of relations between humans and the rest of nature. Moore sees it as constitutive of the endless accumulation of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Jason W | year = 2011 | title = Transcending the Metabolic Rift: Towards a Theory of Crises in the Capitalist World-Ecology | url = http://www.jasonwmoore.com/Essays.html | journal = Journal of Peasant Studies | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–46 | doi = 10.1080/03066150.2010.538579 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110510142258/http://www.jasonwmoore.com/Essays.html | archivedate = 2011-05-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's perspective, although also rooted in historical materialism, produces a widely divergent view from that of Foster and others about what makes ecological crisis and how it relates to capital accumulation.

Nine months after Foster's groundbreaking article appeared, Moore argued that the origins of the metabolic rift were not found in the 19th century but in the rise of capitalism during the "long" 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Jason W | year = 2000 | title = Environmental Crises and the Metabolic Rift in World-Historical Perspective | url = | journal = Organization and Environment | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 123–158 | doi=10.1177/1086026600132001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metabolic rift was not a consequence of industrial agriculture but capitalist relations pivoting on the law of value. Moore consequently focuses attention on the grand movements of primitive accumulation, colonialism, and the globalization of town-country relations that characterized early modern capitalism. There were, in this view, not one but many metabolic rifts; every great phase of capitalist development organized nature in new ways, each one with its own metabolic rift. In place of agricultural revolutions, Moore emphasizes recurrent agro-ecological revolutions, assigned the historical task of providing [[cheap food]] and cheap labor, in the history of capitalism, an interpretation that extends the analysis to the food crises of the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Jason W | year = 2010 | title = The End of the Road?

== Environmental contradiction under capitalism ==

=== Town and country ===

Up until the 16th or 17th centuries, cities' metabolic dependency upon surrounding countryside (for resources, etc.), coupled with the technological limitations to production and extraction, prevented extensive urbanization. Early urban centers were [[Ecoregion|bioregionally]] defined, and had relatively light "[[Ecological footprint|footprints]]," recycling city [[nightsoil]]s back into the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, pp. 410-411.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the rise of capitalism, cities expanded in size and population. Large-scale industry required factories, raw material, workers, and large amounts of food. As urban economic security was dependent upon its metabolic support system,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; cities now looked further afield for their resource and waste flows. As spatial barriers were broken down, capitalist society "violated" what were previously "nature-imposed conditions of sustainability."&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, pp. 153-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

With trade and expansion, food and fiber were shipped longer distances. The nutrients of the soil were sent to cities in the form of agricultural produce, but these same nutrients, in the form of human and animal waste, were not returned to the land. Thus there was a one-way movement, a "robbing of the soil" in order to maintain the socio-economic reproduction of society.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, pp. 153-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx thus linked the crisis of pollution in cities with the crisis of soil depletion. The rift was a result of the antagonistic separation of town and country, and the social-ecological relations of production created by capitalism were ultimately unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Jason W. | year = 2000 | title = 'Environmental Crises and the Metabolic Rift in World-Historical Perspective' | url = | journal = Organization &amp; Environment | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 123–158 | doi = 10.1177/1086026600132001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From ''Capital'', volume 1, on "Large-scale Industry and Agriculture":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Capitalist production collects the population together in great centres, and causes the urban population to achieve an ever-growing preponderance. This has two results. On the one hand it concentrates the historical motive force of society; on the other hand, ''it disturbs the metabolic interaction between man and the earth, i.e. it prevents the return to the soil of its constituent elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing; hence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural condition for the lasting fertility of the soil''...But by destroying the circumstances surrounding that metabolism...it compels its systematic restoration as a regulative law of social production, and in a form adequate to the full development of the human race...All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the worker, but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time is a progress toward ruining the more long-lasting sources of that fertility...''Capitalist production, therefore, only develops the techniques and the degree of combination of the social process of production by simultaneously undermining the original sources of all wealth—the soil and the worker''.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1976) ''Capital, vol. I'', New York: Vintage, pp. 637-638. (emphasis added)  Alternate translation: Marx, Karl (1967) ''Capital, vol. I'', New York: International Publishers Co., Inc., pp. 505-506, http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm#S10.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The future socialist society ===

The concept of metabolic rift captures "the material [[Marx's theory of alienation|estrangement]] of human beings within capitalist society from the natural conditions which formed the basis for their existence."&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marx also emphasizes the importance of historical change. It was both necessary and possible to rationally govern human metabolism with nature, but this was something "completely beyond the capabilities of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society."&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In a future [[Free Association of producers|society of freely associated producers]], however, humans could govern their relations with nature via collective control, rather than through the blind power of market relations.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Capital, Volume III|''Capital'', volume 3]], Marx states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Freedom, in this sphere...can consist only in this, that socialized man, the associated producers, govern the human metabolism with nature in a rational way, bringing it under their own collective control rather than being dominated by it as a blind power; accomplishing it with the least expenditure of energy and in conditions most worthy and appropriate for their human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Marx 1981, p. 959.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Marx did not argue that a sustainable relation to the earth was an automatic result of the transition to [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, there was a need for planning and measures to address the division of labor and population between town and country and for the restoration and improvement of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, and Engels, Friedrich (1967) ''The Communist Manifesto'', New York: Monthly Review Press, pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metabolism and environmental governance ==

Despite Marx's assertion that a concept of ecological sustainability was "of very limited practical relevance to capitalist society," as it was incapable of applying rational scientific methods and social planning due to the pressures of competition,&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; the theory of metabolic rift may be seen as relevant to, if not explicitly invoked in, many contemporary debates and policy directions of [[environmental governance]].

There is a rapidly growing body of literature on social-ecological metabolism. While originally limited to questions of soil fertility—essentially a critique of capitalist agriculture—the concept of metabolic rift has since been taken up in numerous fields and its scope expanded. For example, Clausen and Clark (2005) have extended the use of metabolic rift to [[marine ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clausen | first1 = Rebecca | last2 = Clark | first2 = Brett | year = 2005 | title = 'The Metabolic Rift and Marine Ecology: An Analysis of the Ocean Crisis Within Capitalist Production Organization &amp; Environment' | url = | journal = Organization and Environment | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 422–444 | doi = 10.1177/1086026605281187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Moore (2000) uses the concept to discuss the broader concerns of global environmental crises and the viability of capitalism itself.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2000, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer-Kowalski (1998) discusses the application of "the biological concept of metabolism to social systems," tracing it through several contributing scientific traditions, including [[biology]], ecology, [[social theory]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[social geography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer-Kowalski | first1 = Marina | year = 1998 | title = 'Society's Metabolism: The Intellectual History of Materials Flow Analysis, Part I, 1860–1970' | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 61–78 | doi=10.1162/jiec.1998.2.1.61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[social metabolism]] approach has become "one of the most important paradigms for the empirical analysis of the society-nature-interaction across various disciplines,"&lt;ref&gt;Fischer-Kowalski 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the fields of [[industrial metabolism]] and [[material flow analysis]].

=== Urban political ecology ===

[[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] points out that much of the [[Environmentalism|environmental movement]] has held (and in some areas continues to hold) a profound anti-urban sentiment, seeing cities as "the highpoint of plundering and pollution of all that is good and holy on planet earth."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is that such a perspective focuses solely on a particular form of nature, ignoring many people's lived experience of the environment and the importance of cities in ecological processes and as ecological sites in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Erik Swyngedouw]] and other theorists have conceptualized the city as an ecological space through urban [[political ecology]], which connects material flows within cities and between the urban and non-urban.

=== Sustainable cities ===

In city planning policy circles, there has been a recent movement toward [[urban sustainability]]. Hodson and Marvin discuss a "new eco-urbanism" that seeks to integrate environment and infrastructure, "bundling" [[architecture]], ecology and technology in order to "internalize" energy, water, food, waste and other material flows.&lt;ref&gt;Hodson, Mike and Marvin, Simon (2010) 'Eco-urbanism: Transcendent Eco-Cities or Urban Ecological Security?', in: Mostafavi, M. and Doherty, G. (eds)  ''Ecological Urbanism'', Cambridge: Lars Muller Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous efforts to integrate nature into the city, which, according to Harvey, were primarily aesthetic and bourgeois in nature,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; these new efforts are taking place in the context of climate change, resource constraints and the threat of environmental crises.&lt;ref&gt;Hodson &amp; Marvin 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the traditional approach of capitalist urbanization, which sought more and more distant sources for material resources and waste sinks (as seen in the [[California Water Wars|history of Los Angeles water]]), eco-urban sites would re-internalize their own resources and re-circulate wastes. The goal is [[autarky]] and greater ecological and infrastructural self-reliance through "[[Closed ecological system|closed-loop systems]]" that reduce reliance on external networks.&lt;ref&gt;Hodson &amp; Marvin 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Although difficult given the reliance on international supply chains, urban food movements are working to reduce the commodification of food and individual and social forms of alienation from food within cities.&lt;ref&gt;Sbicca, Joshua (2014). 'The Need to Feed: Urban Metabolic Struggles of Actually Existing Radical Projects.' Critical Sociology. 40(3): 817–834.&lt;/ref&gt; This takes place within actually existing conditions of neoliberalization, suggesting that healing metabolic rifts will be a process that requires both social and ecological transformations. 

However, critics link these efforts to "managerial environmentalism,"&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; and worry that eco-urbanism too closely falls into an "urban ecological security" approach,&lt;ref&gt;Hodson &amp; Marvin 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; echoing [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]]' analysis of [[Securitization (international relations)|securitization]] and fortress urbanism. A Marxist critique might also question the feasibility of sustainable cities within the context of a global capitalist system.

'''Metarealism''' is a direction in [[Russian poetry]] and art that was born in the 1970s to the 1980s. The term was first used by [[Mikhail Epstein|Mikhail Epshtein]], who coined it in 1981 and made it public in the Soviet magazine "Voprosy Literatury" in 1983; see below his "Theses on Metarealism and Conceptualism" from 1983 and the following years [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.concept.metareal.html] Also: Third Wave: The New Russian Poetry. Ed. K. Johnson &amp; S. M. Ashby. Preface by M. Epshtein, A. Wachtel, [[Alexei Parshchikov|A. Parshchikov]]. University of Michigan Press, 1992 {{ISBN|0-472-06415-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;10, 53, 184 [https://books.google.com/books?id=czhO4m4yjZUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA173&amp;lpg=RA1-PA173&amp;dq=metarealism+poetry&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9zVPX-rMeG&amp;sig=gKOXtyHheDWHsGEgc15Vh1Gknf4#PPP1,M1], Tom Epstein's essay «Metarealism» in the anthology Crossing Centuries: The New Generations in Russian Poetry. Ed. High, John. NY: Talisman House Pub., 2000 {{ISBN|1-883689-90-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-883689-90-2}}, p.&amp;nbsp;87-89, and [[Marjorie Perloff]] "Russian Postmodernism: An Oxymoron?" in Postmodern Culture, Volume 3, # 2, January 1993 [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/postmodern_culture/v003/3.2perloff.html].

M. Epshtein insists that in its philosophic dimension metarealism is "[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] realism," while "stylistically" metarealism is "[[metaphorical]]" realism. (See the most detailed explanation and exposition of this term in Epshtein's articles "Theses on Metarealism and Conceptualism" [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.concept.metareal.html], "A Catalogue of the New Poetries" (Russian version) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904005720/http://modernpoetry.by.ru/proekt/epshtein.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }} and in its English version [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.catalog.poetry.html] Thus, "meta" means both "through" and "beyond" the reality that we all can see; hence, "metarealism" is the realism of the hyperphysical nature of things. The main expression of its essence is given through a non-visual [[metaphor]] or, according to another Epshtein's term, a "metabola" (rather than [[hyperbole]]), that means "transfer" or "transition," opening many dimensions. [See part 3 in {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904005720/http://modernpoetry.by.ru/proekt/epshtein.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }} "Metabola" is different from the [[symbol]] or a "visual" metaphor, because it assumes the interosculation of realities. See: M.Epshtein. After the Future: the Paradoxes of Postmodernism &amp; Contemporary Russian Culture. [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1995, 416 p.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|0-87023-973-2}}, {{ISBN|0-87023-974-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;40–50. Metarealism has very little to do with [[surrealism]], since it appeals to the [[superconscious]] and not to the [[subconscious]], thus opening up a many-dimensional perception of the world.

Metarealism further gained traction after it became a subject of the House of Artists debate at an exhibition of the [[Hyperreality|Hyperrealists]], where its utility was discussed as a new method of creation to overcome traditional realism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge Communication: Transparency, Democracy, Global Governance|last=Mesaros|first=Caludiu|publisher=Editura Universității de Vest|year=2011|isbn=9789731253497|location=|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==What is metarealism?==

[http://www.metarealism.com Metarealism] is synonymous to metaconscience, which means beyond psychological consciousness, beyond a subjective psychological polarized view of reality. Metarealism seeks to depict the reality which exists beyond that psychological subjective perspective. Metarealism proposes not only to communicate further than the pictorial aspect of the perception of other dimensions of reality, but also the essence of those dimensions and their relation to us as human beings. Metarealism then becomes a tool for the evolution of consciousness; just like in the old days when artists painted sacred art to depict their vision of the reality they perceived, through their spiritual interpretation of other dimensions. Thus, Epstein explained that the entire history of world art is the premise and source of metarealism, particularly its condensed codes, encyclopedic summaries, and extracts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|last2=Genis|first2=Alexander|last3=Vladiv-Glover|first3=Slobodanka|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2016|isbn=9781782388647|location=New York|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, metabola or metabole is derived from the dictionary and a microencyclopedia of culture, compressed and translated from one language to another so that it pertains to a reality consisted of interpenetration of different consubstantial realities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Epstein, metarealism is an attempt to return to the word the fullness of its [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] and transcendent meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After the Future: The Paradoxes of Postmodernism and Contemporary Russian Culture|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1995|isbn=0870239732|location=Amherst|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metarealism could be also considered a sacred art, in that it also tries to depict, through a [metaconscious] perspective, the essence of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind. Meta meaning, a [[holistic]] view of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind, who sees reality as a whole rather than from a subjective personalized intellectually fragmented point of view. Metarealism is the materialization in pictorial form of the reality of other dimensions and their direct effect, and relation upon us. Metarealism tries to depict the relations between those dimensions of reality and how we psychologically interpret them through our sub mental symbolism. As a narrative style, metarealism does not have a clearly defined lyrical hero and focuses instead on the so-called sum of perceptions, which is "the geometrical space constituted by points of view.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Metarealism in visual art==

According to Bernard De Montréal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.psychologie-alternative.com/Bernard%20de%20Montreal.htm |title=Bernard de Montreal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114114543/http://www.psychologie-alternative.com/Bernard%20de%20Montreal.htm |archive-date=2017-01-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most contemporary visual arts are involutionary art that expresses the dissimulated frustrations and struggle of the unconscious self in her search for real identity through the [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]], sub mental symbolism of the art form an [[avocation]] of the soul that has little in common with the interdimensional identity of the self.

Conscious or mental art "metarealism" when created by an metaconscious artist is inspired from the higher self, and is a channel for the dictation of the conscious science of art, instead of being simply a lower form of self-expression, a cultural artefact of relative value.

The mental artist has little need for unconscious expression and directs her creative "expiration" toward the exploration of higher consciousness through her art, rather than simply entertaining a fictitious role. Art in its astral form belongs to our kind of civilization. We still need its contention that there is more to reality than appears at first sight. Art in its higher form is therefore created by a totally new human being.

Poetics of I.Zhdanov, A.Parshchikov, A.Dragomoshchenko, S.Soloviev, V.Aristov, I.Kutik, E.Dayenin is considered in comparison with Russian conceptual and ironic poetry, and also with poetic principles of some foreign authors. The reader is able to get an idea about a peculiar “philosophy of language” of metarealists, constants of their poetic world, metametaphor, “poetic theater” and other things.

In [[civil engineering]], the '''middle-third rule''' states that no tension is developed in a [[wall]] or [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] if the [[resultant force]] lies within the middle third of the structure.

The rule is covered by various standard texts in the field of civil engineering, for instance ''Principles of Foundation Engineering'' by B.M. Das.&lt;ref&gt;Das, B.M. Principles of Foundation Engineering 3rd Ed. PWS Publishing (1995) p.153&lt;/ref&gt;   The application of this rule is limited to foundations that are square or rectangular in [[Plan view|plan]].  (For circular foundations a different rule, known as the Middle Quarter Rule applies).

In [[civil engineering]] and [[construction]], the '''neat volume''' is a theoretical amount of material.

For [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], it can refer to the volume either before native material is disturbed by [[Excavator|excavation]], or after placement and compaction is complete. A percentage is typically added to neat volume to estimate loose (i.e. uncompacted) volumes for [[procurement]] purposes.

With [[concrete]] work, neat volume is calculated assuming there is no bowing in the [[formwork]], or, for cast-in-place concrete, that the surfaces in contact with the concrete have no voids or imperfections that would require a greater volume of concrete to fill.

[[Science fiction]] and popular literature frequently use the term "neutronium" to refer to a highly dense phase of matter composed primarily of neutrons.

==Neutronium and neutron stars==

Neutronium is used in popular literature to refer to the material present in the cores of neutron stars (stars which are too massive to be supported by [[electron degeneracy pressure]] and which collapse into a denser phase of matter). This term is very rarely used in scientific literature, for three reasons: there are multiple definitions for the term "neutronium";  there is considerable uncertainty over the composition of the material in the cores of neutron stars (it could be [[neutron-degenerate matter]], [[strange matter]], [[quark matter]], or a variant or combination of the above);  the properties of neutron star material should depend on depth due to changing pressure (see [[#Properties|below]]), and no sharp boundary between the crust (consisting primarily of [[atomic nuclei]]) and almost protonless inner layer is expected to exist.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

When neutron star core material is presumed to consist mostly of free neutrons, it is typically referred to as neutron-degenerate matter in scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Angelo | first1 = J.

==Neutronium and the periodic table==
The term "neutronium" was coined in 1926 by Andreas von Antropoff for a conjectured form of matter made up of [[neutrons]] with no [[protons]] or [[electron]]s, which he placed as the [[chemical element]] of [[atomic number]] zero at the head of his new version of the [[periodic table]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} It was subsequently placed in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for classifying the chemical elements, such as those of [[Charles Janet]] (1928), E. I. Emerson (1944), [[John Drury Clark|John D. Clark]] (1950) and in Philip Stewart's [[Chemical Galaxy]] (2005).

{{anchor|Isotopes}}Although the term is not used in the scientific literature either for a condensed form of matter, or as an element, there have been reports that, besides the [[free neutron]], there may exist two bound forms of neutrons without protons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Timofeyuk | first = N.

However, these reports have not been further substantiated.

Although not called "neutronium", the National Nuclear Data Center's ''Nuclear Wallet Cards'' lists as its first "isotope" an "element" with the symbol '''n''' and atomic number ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and mass number ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. This isotope is described as decaying to element '''[[hydrogen|H]]''' with a half life of {{val|10.24|.02|u=minutes}}.

== Properties ==
{{see also|Neutron star#Properties}}
Due to the beta (β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) decay of mononeutron and extreme instability of [[#Isotopes|aforementioned heavier "isotopes"]], neutron matter is not expected to be stable under ordinary [[pressure]]s.

Free neutrons decay with a [[half-life]] of 10 minutes and 11 seconds. While this lifetime is long enough to permit the study of neutronium's chemical properties, there are serious practical problems. Having no charge or electrons, neutronium would not interact with ordinary low-energy photons (light) and would feel no electrostatic forces, so it would diffuse into the walls of most containers made of ordinary matter. Certain materials are able to resist diffusion or absorption of [[ultracold neutrons]] due to nuclear-quantum effects, specifically reflection caused by the [[strong interaction]]. In the presence of other elements, low energy (thermal) neutrons readily undergo [[neutron capture]] to form heavier (and often radioactive) isotope of the element. Neutronium is left off most periodic tables.

Neutron matter at standard pressure and temperature is predicted by the [[ideal gas law]] to be less dense than even hydrogen, with a density of only {{val|0.045|ul=kg/m3}} (roughly 27 times less [[density of air|dense than air]]). Similar to helium, neutron matter is predicted to remain gaseous down to absolute zero at normal pressures, as the [[zero-point energy]] of the system is too high to allow condensation. However, neutron matter should in theory, form a degenerate gaseous [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] at these temperatures, composed of neutron pairs called ''dineutrons''. At higher temperatures, neutron matter will condense with sufficient pressure, and solidify with even greater pressure. Such pressures exist in neutron stars, where the extreme pressure causes the neutron matter to become degenerate. However, in the presence of atomic matter compressed to the state of [[electron-degenerate matter|electron degeneracy]], the β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay may be inhibited due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], thus making free neutrons stable. Also, elevated pressures should make neutrons [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] themselves. Compared to ordinary elements, neutronium should be more [[compressibility|compressible]] due to the absence of [[electrically charged]] protons and electrons. This makes neutronium more energetically favorable than (positive-''Z'') [[atomic nuclei]] and leads to their conversion to (degenerate) neutronium through [[electron capture]], a [[Chandrasekhar limit#Applications|process which is believed to occur]] in stellar cores in the final seconds of the lifetime of [[stellar evolution#Massive stars|massive stars]], where it is facilitated by cooling via {{subatomic particle|electron neutrino|link=yes}} emission. As a result, degenerate neutronium can have a density of {{val|4|e=17|u=kg/m{{sup|3}}}}, roughly 13 [[order of magnitude|magnitudes]] denser than the densest known ordinary substances.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} It was theorized that extreme pressures of order {{val|100|ul=MeV/fm3}} may deform the neutrons into a [[cubic honeycomb|cubic symmetry]], allowing tighter packing of neutrons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Felipe J. Llanes-Estrada |author2=Gaspar Moreno Navarro|arxiv=1108.1859|title=Cubic neutrons |journal=[[Modern Physics Letters A]]|volume=27|issue=6|page=1250033|date=2011 |version= |doi=10.1142/S0217732312500332|bibcode = 2012MPLA...2750033L }}&lt;/ref&gt; or cause a [[strange matter]] formation.

== In fiction ==
The term ''neutronium'' has been popular in [[science fiction]] since at least the middle of the 20th century. It typically refers to an extremely dense, incredibly strong form of matter. While presumably inspired by the concept of [[Neutron degeneracy|neutron-degenerate]] matter in the cores of [[neutron star]]s, the material used in fiction bears at most only a superficial resemblance, usually depicted as an extremely strong solid under [[Earth]]-like conditions, or possessing exotic properties such as the ability to manipulate time and space. In contrast, all proposed forms of [[neutron star]] core material are [[fluid]]s and are extremely unstable at [[pressure]]s lower than that found in [[stellar core]]s. According to one analysis, a neutron star with a mass below about 0.2 [[solar mass]]es would explode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= K. Sumiyoshi |author2=S. Yamada |author3=H. Suzuki |author4= W.

"'''On Denoting'''" is an essay by [[Bertrand Russell]]. It was published in the philosophy journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' in 1905. In it, Russell introduces and advocates his theory of denoting phrases, according to which definite descriptions and other "denoting phrases ... never have any meaning in themselves, but every proposition in whose verbal expression they occur has a meaning."&lt;ref name="Russell 480"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Russell  | first = Bertrand  | authorlink = Bertrand Russell   | coauthors =   | title = On Denoting  | journal = Mind  | volume = 14  | issue = 56  | pages = 479-493  | publisher = Oxford University Press on behalf of the Mind Association | location = Oxford  | date = October 1905  | jstor = 2248381 | issn = 0026-4423}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory later became the basis for Russell's [[descriptivist theory of names|descriptivism]] with regard to proper names, and his view that proper names are "disguised" or "abbreviated" [[definite descriptions]].

In the 1920s, [[Frank P. Ramsey]] referred to the essay as "that paradigm of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==The "denoting phrase"==

===Russell's concept of a denoting phrase===

For Russell, a denoting phrase is a singular noun phrase, preceded by a [[quantifier (logic)|quantifier]], whose [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] term is satisfied by some particular. Such phrases do not contribute objects as the constituents of the singular propositions in which they occur. Denotation, in other words, is a semantically inert property, in this view. Whereas [[Frege]] held that there were two distinct parts (or aspects) of the meaning of every term, phrase, or sentence (its [[Sense and reference|''Sinn'' and ''Bedeutung'']]), Russell explicitly rejects the notion of sense (''Sinn'') and replaces it with the idea of a [[propositional function]] (i.e., a function from objects to abstract propositions that are the contents of sentences). This is so because, for Russell, propositions must have concrete, really existing entities as their constituents. Russell provides several clear examples of the sort of thing that he had in mind: "a man, any man, every man, the present [[King of France]]... the centre of mass of the [[Solar System]], ...." So, for Russell, a denoting phrase can be either a definite description (i.e., a singular noun phrase with the determinative article "the" at the beginning), which "does not denote anything" (meaning designate any specific object) or a definite description that does denote a specific object or, finally, an indefinite description that denotes "ambiguously". Russell, as will be shown later, believes that definite descriptions are not [[referring expression]]s but rather, to borrow a term later coined by [[Keith Donnellan]], they have "attributive" uses only. They are to be interpreted as strictly logical quantificational formulas that are "general" in nature. At least this has been the general interpretation of Russell among philosophical logicians for nearly a century.

===Reference to something that does not exist===

However, at the very beginning of the article, Russell distinguishes between cases where "a phrase may be denoting and yet not denote anything (e.g. 'the present King of France')" and cases where they may denote "one definite object (such as '[[:Edward VII|the present King of England]]')". If this passage is interpreted as saying that descriptions may "refer" to one definite object, then it could be that Russell actually recognised the two distinct uses of definite descriptions (attributive and referential) that Donnellan later proposed.

=== Epistemology ===

In any case, after clarifying the sense of the term "denoting phrase" and providing several examples to illustrate the idea, Russell explains the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] motivations for his theory. Russell believes at this point that there are essentially two modes of knowing: [[knowledge by description]] and [[Knowledge by acquaintance|knowledge by (direct) acquaintance]]. Knowledge by acquaintance is limited to the sense data of the [[phenomenalism|phenomenal]] world and to one's own private inner experiences, while knowledge of everything else (other minds, physical objects, and so on) can only be known by way of general descriptions.

==The theory of descriptions==

=== Mathematical description ===
Russell starts out by defining the "fundamental" notion of a ''[[propositional function]]''. This is basically a modified version of Frege's idea of ''unsaturated concepts''. Hence, "''C''(''x'') stands for a proposition in which ''x'' is a constituent and where ''x'', the variable, is essentially and wholly undetermined." The notions of ''everything'', ''nothing'' and ''something'' ("the most primitive of denoting phrases") can then be defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; C(E) \leftrightarrow \forall x C(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C(N) \leftrightarrow \forall x \lnot C(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C(S) \leftrightarrow \lnot \forall x \lnot C(x) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' stands for everything, ''N'' stands for nothing and ''S'' stands for something. ''All'' is taken as primitive and indefinable and the others are defined in terms of it. Russell emphasises that these notions can have no meaning apart from that which is assigned to them within the propositions in which they occur, all of which are meaningful. This is the foundation of Russell's [[theory of descriptions]] as he proceeds to illustrate.

===Illustration===

The phrase "the [[:Charles I of England|father]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (F) was executed (E)" is interpreted as the following quantificational assertion:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \left( \left( F \left( x \right) \land  \forall y \left( F \left( y \right) \rightarrow x=y \right) \right) \land E \left( x \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, there is one and only one thing x such that x is the father of Charles II and x was executed.

So, if C represents any statement at all about the father of Charles II, the statement 'C (the father of Charles II)' always implies:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \left( F \left( x \right) \land \forall y \left( F \left( y \right) \rightarrow  x=y \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that if there is not one and only one entity that satisfies the above, then every proposition that contains the descriptions in a primary occurrence is false.  (If the mother of Charles II was ‘unfaithful’ the statement may be false.)  In this way, Russell points out, it will turn out that all statements containing non-referring descriptions (e.g. "The present king of [[Samothrace]] is
a great writer") are false. Russell's theory reduces all propositions that contain definite descriptions into forms that do not.

==Meinong==
He then criticises [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]]'s theory of objects which, according to Russell, is ontologically promiscuous and self-contradictory. Both of these criticisms stem from Meinong's theory that there is an object, whether it exists or subsists, for every set of properties. Therefore, there is an object that is both round and not round, or round and square. Russell argues that Meinong's theory entails conclusions such as "the present King of France" both exists and does not exist. However, Meinong does not attribute existence (or any other sort of being) to ''non-existent objects''. Russell also accuses Meinong of violating the law of non-contradiction by asserting that the "round square" is both round and not round. Meinong, on the other hand, maintains that the laws of logic do not apply to such phenomena as "impossible" objects that have no being.&lt;ref&gt;Grossmann, Reinhardt. "Alexius Meinong". ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (ed.) Ted Honderich. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolving the problem of negative existentials==
One of the fundamental puzzles that Russell hopes to resolve with the theory of descriptions is the problem of non-referring expressions or, as they are now called, negative [[Existential clause|existentials]]. He finally explains how his theory resolves this problem after invoking a distinction between what he calls ''primary'' and ''secondary'' occurrences of denoting phrases.

===Statements about concepts where the object does not exist===

Since definite descriptions are just quantificational devices on Russell's view they can enter into scope relations with other logical operators. In the case of negative existentials, there is an ambiguity between two different (primary and secondary) readings of the quantificational assertion. For example, Russell uses the case of "the present King of France is not bald." Here the two possible readings are:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x (K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow y=x)) \land \lnot B(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lnot \exists x (K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow y=x)) \land B(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

In the first case, the statement is false because it quantifies over non-existent entities. In the second case, the statement is true because it is not the case that there is a present King of France. "Thus all propositions in which 'the King of France' has a primary occurrence are false: the denials of such propositions are true, but in them 'the King of France' has a secondary occurrence." Contemporarily, it is customary to discuss Russell's primary/secondary distinction in the more logically exact terms of wide and narrow scope. The scope distinction regards the operator that, on one reading, modifies ''only'' the subject, and on the other, modifies the entire sentence.

===Ambiguity===

Russell resolves the problem of ambiguity in propositional attitude reports in a similar manner. He refers to an example similar to Frege's puzzle about identity: "[[:George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] wondered whether [[Walter Scott|Scott]] is the author of ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]''." In this case, it is obvious that King George is not wondering whether Scott is identical to Scott. Russell rejects Frege's solution of distinguishing between sense and reference. Quantificational descriptions are sufficient for him to handle the ''de dicto'' / ''de re'' ambiguities. So, for example, in the general case, the sentence "George IV wondered whether Scott is Sir Walter" can be interpreted as:

:''George IV wondered whether the x that... is identical to the y that....''

where "..." stands for some definite description such as "the clever fellow who wrote Ivanhoe" and ....stands for something like "the elegant gentleman seated next to the Princess". In the ''de re'' case, the above sentence can be interpreted as follows instead:

:''the x that... is such that King George wondered whether x is identical to the y that....''

===Fictional names===

Finally, Russell suggests that fictional names such as "[[Apollo]]" can be treated as abbreviated definite descriptions that refer to nothing. All propositions that contain names of such fictional entities are to be treated in the same manner as the negative existentials described above.

==Criticisms==
In his essay, "On Referring", [[P. F. Strawson]] criticised Russell's characterisation of statements where the object does not exist, such as "the present King of France", as being false. Such statements, Strawson held, are neither true nor false but, rather, absurd. Strawson believed that, contrary to Russell, use does determine the meaning of a sentence. To give the meaning of an expression is to "give general directions for its use."&lt;ref name="Strawson 327"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Strawson  | first = P. F.  | authorlink = P. F. Strawson   | coauthors =   | title = On Referring  | journal = Mind  | volume = 59  | issue = 235  | pages = 327  | publisher = Oxford University Press on behalf of the Mind Association | location = Oxford  | date = July 1950  | jstor = 2251176 | issn = 0026-4423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Strawson argued that, were someone to say the King of France was wise, we would not say their statement is true or false, but, rather, decide they must be under a misapprehension since, normally, the question would not arise as there is no King of France.&lt;ref name="Strawson 330"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Strawson  | first = P.

Strawson also argued that we often need to know the use of a word to understand its meaning, such as in statements of the form, "The table is covered with books." In normal use, the expression would be referring to one particular table. It is false, Strawson believed, to think, as Russell, that the phrase will only have meaning insofar as there is only one table and no more. The phrase has application in virtue of the fact that one table and no more is what is being referred to, and it is understood that the table is what is being referenced.&lt;ref name="Strawson 332"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Strawson  | first = P.

'''''Parable of the Sower''''' is a science fiction novel by American writer [[Octavia E. Butler]], the first in a two-book series. It was published in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Octavia E. Butler, Science Fiction Writer, Dies at 58|author=Fox, Margalit|date=March 1, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/books/01butler.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Set in the 2020s where society has largely collapsed due to climate change, growing wealth inequality, and corporate greed, ''Parable of the Sower'' centers on a young woman named Lauren Oya Olamina who possesses what Butler dubbed hyperempathy or "sharing" – the ability to feel pain and other sensations she witnesses. As a teenager growing up in the remnants of a [[gated community]] near Los Angeles, she begins to develop a new belief system, which she comes to call Earthseed. When the community's security is compromised, her home is destroyed and her family is murdered, and she travels north with other survivors. Society outside the community walls has reverted to chaos due to resource scarcity and poverty, and mixed race relationships are stigmatized amid attacks against religious and ethnic minorities. Lauren believes that humankind's destiny is to travel beyond Earth and live on other planets, forcing humankind into its adulthood, and that Earthseed is preparation for this destiny. She gathers followers along her journey north and founds the first Earthseed community, Acorn, in Northern California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Proposed third ''Parable'' novel==
Butler had planned to write a third ''Parable'' novel, tentatively titled ''Parable of the Trickster'', which would have focused on the community's struggle to survive on a new planet. She began this novel after finishing ''[[Parable of the Talents (novel)|Parable of the Talents]]'', and mentioned her work on it in a number of interviews, but at some point encountered [[writer's block]]. She eventually shifted her creative attention, resulting in ''[[Fledgling (novel)|Fledgling]]'', her final novel. The various false starts for the novel can now be found among Butler's papers at the [[Huntington Library]], as described in an article at the ''Los Angeles Review of Books''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/theres-nothing-new-sun-new-suns-recovering-octavia-e-butlers-lost-parables | title="There's Nothing New / Under The Sun, / But There Are New Suns": Recovering Octavia E.

==Adaptations==

''Parable of the Sower'' was adapted as ''Parable of the Sower: The Concert Version'', a work-in-progress opera written by American folk/blues musician [[Toshi Reagon]] in collaboration with her mother, singer and composer [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]]. The adaptation's libretto and musical score combine African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[rock and roll]], and [[folk music]] into rounds to be performed by singers sitting in a circle. It was performed as part of [[The Public Theater]]'s [[Under the Radar Festival]] in New York City in 2015&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Grace.

==In popular culture==
''Parable of the Sower'' was referred to in hip-hop artist [[Talib Kweli]]'s song "Ms. Hill" off his mixtape ''[[Right About Now: The Official Sucka Free Mix CD]]''. In the song, which is about [[Lauryn Hill]], Kweli references how Lauryn Hill used to come into [[Nkiru]] (a bookstore Kweli owns in [[Brooklyn]], New York) and liked to buy [[Octavia Butler]] books, namely ''Parable of the Sower''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} "We used to chill at Nkiru / her moms was a customer / she used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler / Parable of the Sower, the main character's name was Lauren".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ms. Hill|work=Anysonglyrics.com|url=http://www.anysonglyrics.com/lyrics/t/talib/Ms-Hill-Lyrics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Lauren Beukes]]' 2013 novel ''[[The Shining Girls]]'', the body of one of the victims, Jin-Sook Au, a social worker, is found with a copy of ''Parable of the Sower''.

Part of the central verse of [[Earthseed]], "All that you touch you change, all that you change changes you", is included in track 2 and 6 of Sugar Candy Mountain's album ''666''.

The work of hip hop/R&amp;B duo [[THEESatisfaction]] was influenced by Octavia Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://fryemuseum.org/blog/?p=845#more |title=Attention Earthlings! |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher =|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third track from their 2012 album ''[[awE NaturalE]]'', "Earthseed", contains themes from the ''Parable'' series: "Change there are few words / That you can say / We all watch things morphing everyday."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://genius.com/Theesatisfaction-earthseed-lyrics| title=Earthseed - lyrics |last=| first=| date=| website=| publisher=| access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Post-War Building Studies''' are a set of [[technical report]]s published by the British [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] starting in 1944.  The Directorate of Post-War Building was established in 1941 under Sir [[James Grey West|James West]]. The Directorate was charged with coordinating solutions for construction of housing to replace homes that had been destroyed as well as homes that had been deferred due to war. The Directorate reported to the Minister of Works, initially [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]] then later [[Lord Portal]].   The publications were produced by various committees  (such as the [[Burt Committee]]) composed of architects, engineers, and representatives from the building industry.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bullock ''Building the Post-War World'' Routledge, 2002 ;{{ISBN|041522179X}}  page 195&lt;/ref&gt; The studies standardized non-traditional methods of building construction including the use of pre-fabricated elements and [[poured concrete]]. A new standard system for wiring homes for electricity was described in report no. 11. The reports had a significant impact on the design and construction of buildings in the UK after the war and continue to be cited as references, though their recommendations on [[fire safety]] were later found to be insufficient as apartment buildings became taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highrisefire.co.uk/leg.html |title= Building Legislation|last= Fishlock |first= Mark |date=10 March 2013 |website= HIGH-RISE Fire Fighting: Developing better responses to fires in tower bocks and high-rise buildings |publisher=Net-Gen |access-date=17 November 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[BS 1363]] [[power socket]] (another product of the studies) has proved long-lasting and is still in use in British homes today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iconeye.com/opinion/icon-of-the-month/item/12383-the-british-plug |title=Icon of the Month: The British plug|last=Jervis |first=John |date=29 January 2016 |website=ICON |publisher=Iconeye |access-date= 17 November 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Damon |date=25 November 2014 |title=Plugging in: Power sockets, standards and the valencies of national habitus |url=http://eprints.brighton.ac.uk/13388/1/Plugging%20In%20-%20Damon%20Taylor%202014.pdf |journal=Journal of Material Culture |volume=20|issue=1 |pages=1-17 |doi=10.1177/1359183514557765 |access-date= 17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While not made part of mandatory building codes and regulations, the reports provided technical guidance and information on application of non-traditional building techniques and materials while overcoming material and labour shortages.

Based on the experience following World War I, it was expected that housing construction demand would be very high after WWII ended, both due to pent-up demand that had not been fulfilled and also due to replacement or repair of housing that had been bombed during the war. Labour and material were expected to be in short supply.  Interest in industrial methods, pre-fabrication and new materials was high during the period between the wars, and such publications as the ''[[Tudor Walters Report]]'' of 1918 gave details on new methods of construction and new materials, including recommendations to improve construction efficiency by better site organisation, increased accuracy of cost accounting, and keeping building trade workers regularly employed. The Directorate of Post-War Building and the Directorate of Building Materials were established by the Ministry of Works.  These groups took on research into new methods and published the ''Post War Building Studies'' in 33 volumes between 1944 and 1946. Experimental work was carried out at the [[Building Research Establishment|Building Research Station]] and reported in the series.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Wall, ''An Architecture of Parts: Architects, Building Workers and Industrialisation in Britain 1940 - 1970'',	Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1135091072}}, pp 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Music eras}}
'''''Prehistoric music''''' (previously '''''primitive music''''') is a term in the [[history of music]] for all [[music]] produced in [[literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Geological history of the Earth|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in different parts of the world, but still exists in isolated areas. However, it is more common to refer to the "prehistoric" music which still survives as [[folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. Prehistoric music is studied alongside other periods within [[music archaeology]]. 

Findings from [[Paleolithic]] archaeology sites suggest that prehistoric people used carving and piercing tools to create instruments. Archeologists have found [[Paleolithic flutes]] carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced. The [[Divje Babe flute]], carved from a [[cave bear]] [[femur]], is thought to be at least 40,000 years old. Instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of [[String instrument|stringed instruments]], such as the [[Ravanahatha]], have been recovered from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN8170173329&amp;id=yySNDP9XVggC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=seven+holed+flute+and+various+types+of+stringed+instruments&amp;sig=0baqFLb6KItfPYLoCdFWFTCD8Sk ''The Music of India''] By Reginald MASSEY, Jamila MASSEY.

==Origins==
{{Tone|section|date=August 2013}}

Some cultures have certain instances of their [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|music intending to imitate natural sounds]]. In some instances, this feature is related to [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|shamanistic beliefs or practice]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt; It may also serve entertainment (game)&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; or practical functions (for example, luring animals in hunt)&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;.

Another possible origin of music is [[motherese]], the vocal-gestural communication between mothers and infants. This form of communication involves melodic, rhythmic and movement patterns as well as the communication of intention and meaning, and in this sense is similar to music.&lt;ref&gt;Dissanayake, E. (2000). Antecedents of the temporal arts in early mother-infant interaction. In The origins of music. Edited by Nils Wallin, Bjorn Merker and Steven Brown, pp. 389-410. Cambridge, MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pg 389-410&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller suggests musical displays play a role in "demonstrating fitness to mate". Based on the ideas of [[honest signal]] and the [[handicap principle]], Miller suggested that music and dancing, as energetically costly activities, were to demonstrate the physical and psychological fitness of the [[singing]] and [[dancing]] individual to the prospective mates.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. (2000). Evolution of human music through sexual selection. In The origins of music. Edited by Nils Wallin, Bjorn Merker and Steven Brown, pp. 329-360. Cambridge, MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pg. 389-410&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistoric musical instruments==

It is likely that the first [[musical instrument]] was the [[human voice]] itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from [[singing]], [[Hum (sound)|hum]]ming and [[whistling]] through to [[Click consonant|click]]ing, [[cough]]ing and [[yawn]]ing. (See Darwin’s ''[[Origin of Species]]'' on music and speech.) The oldest known [[Neanderthal]] [[hyoid]] bone with the modern human form has been dated to be 60,000 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B. Arensburg |author2=A. M. Tillier |author3=B.

Most likely the first rhythm instruments or [[percussion instruments]] involved the [[clapping]] of hands, stones hit together, or other things that are useful to create [[rhythm]] and there are examples of musical instruments which date back as far as the [[paleolithic]], although there is some ambiguity &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk/dcrr/dcrr002.pdf http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705110132/http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk/dcrr/dcrr002.pdf |date=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; over archaeological finds which can be variously interpreted as either musical or non-musical instruments/tools. Examples of paleolithic objects which are considered unambiguously musical are bone flutes or pipes; paleolithic finds which are open to interpretation are pierced [[phalanges]] (usually interpreted as "phalangeal [[whistle]]s"), objects interpreted as [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarers]], and [[rasp]]s.

Music can be theoretically traced to prior to the [[Paleolithic]] age, the [[anthropological]] and [[archaeological]] designation suggests that music first arose (among humans) when stone tools first began to be used by [[Hominidae|hominid]]s. The [[noise]]s produced by work such as pounding seed and roots into meal is a likely source of rhythm created by early humans.

In 2008, archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the [[Hohle Fels]] cave near [[Ulm]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilford | first = John N. | title = Flutes Offer Clues to Stone-Age Music | journal = Nature| volume = 459| issue = 7244| pages = 248–52| publisher = The New York Times | location = | date = June 24, 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/science/25flute.html |accessdate=June 29, 2009| doi = 10.1038/nature07995 | id = | pmid = 19444215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epoc.de/artikel/999323&amp;_z=798890&lt;/ref&gt; The five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone.

The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered in [[Wicklow]], [[Ireland]], in the winter of 2003. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50&amp;nbsp;cm long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://Flutopedia.com/dev_flutes_euroasia.htm#Wicklow_Pipes |title=The Wicklow Pipes / The Development of Flutes in Europe and Asia|author=Clint Goss |year=2012 |work=Flutopedia |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, several [[Gudi (instrument)|gudi]] (literally "bone flutes") were found in [[Jiahu]] in Henan Province, China. They date to about 6000 BCE. They have between 5 and 8 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird, the [[red-crowned crane]]. At the time of the discovery, one was found to be still playable. The bone flute plays both the five- or seven-note scale of [[Xia Zhi]] and six-note scale of [[Qing Shang]] of the ancient [[Chinese musical system]].

==Archaeoacoustic methodology==
The use of the term 'music' is problematic within prehistory. It may be that, as in the traditional music of much of sub-Saharan Africa, the concept of 'music' as we understand it was somewhat different. Many languages traditionally have terms for music that include dance, religion or cult. The context in which prehistoric music took place has also become a subject of much study, as the sound made by music in prehistory would have been somewhat different depending on the acoustics present. The field of [[archaeoacoustics]] uses acoustic techniques to explore prehistoric sounds, soundscapes and instruments, and has included the study of ringing rocks and lithophones, of the acoustics of ritual sites such as chamber tombs and stone circles, and the exploration of prehistoric instruments using acoustic testing. Such work has included acoustic field tests to capture and analyse the impulse response of archaeological sites; acoustic tests of lithophones or 'rock gongs'; and reconstructions of soundscapes as experimental archaeology.

An academic research network, the [http://ambpnetwork.wordpress.com/ Acoustics and Music of British Prehistory Research Network], has explored this field.

==Cycladic culture==

{{Further|Music of ancient Greece|Cycladic culture}}
On the island of [[Keros]] (Κέρος), two marble statues from the late [[Neolithic]] culture called [[Early Cycladic culture]] (2900-2000 BCE) were discovered together in a single grave in the 19th century. They depict a standing [[aulos|double flute]] player and a sitting musician playing a triangular-shaped [[lyre]] or [[harp]]. The harpist is approximately {{convert|23|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} high and dates to around 2700-2500 BCE. He expresses concentration and intense feelings and tilts his head up to the light. The meaning of these and many other figures is not known; perhaps they were used to ward off evil spirits or had religious significance or served as toys or depicted figures from [[mythology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3971">'''''Profanum''''' is the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for "profane".  The distinction between [[the sacred and the profane]] was considered by [[Émile Durkheim]] to be central to the social reality of human [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile (1976). ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', p. 37. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin (originally published 1915, English translation 1915).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred/profane==

The profane world consists of all that we can know through our senses; it is the natural world of everyday life that we experience as either comprehensible or at least ultimately knowable — the ''[[Lebenswelt]]'' or lifeworld.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1973) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the sacred, or ''sacrum'' in Latin, encompasses all that exists beyond the everyday, natural world that we experience with our senses. As such, the sacred or [[numinous]] can inspire feelings of awe, because it is regarded as ultimately unknowable and beyond limited human abilities to perceive and comprehend. Durkheim pointed out however that there are degrees of sacredness, so that an [[amulet]] for example may be sacred yet little respected.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitions==

[[Rites of passage]] represent movements from one state — the profane – to the other, the sacred; or back again to the profanum.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion is organized primarily around the sacred elements of human life and provides a collective attempt to bridge the gap between the sacred and the profane.

==Profane progress==
Modernization and the [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]] project have led to a [[secularisation]] of culture over the past few centuries – an extension of the profanum at the (often explicit) expense of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fredric Jameson]], ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 180-1&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant 21st-century global world view is as a result empirical, sensate, contractual, this-worldly – in short profane.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] expressed the same thought more subjectively when he wrote that “I know – and here I am expressing what countless other people know – that the present time is the time of God's disappearance and death”.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter reaction==

The advance of the profane has led to several countermovements, attempting to limit the scope of the profanum. [[Modernism]] set out to bring [[Mythology|myth]] and a sense of the sacred back into secular reality&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, p. 180-2&lt;/ref&gt; — [[Wallace Stevens]] speaking for much of the movement when he wrote that “if nothing was divine then all things were, the world itself”.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Stevens, ''Collected Poems'' (1984) p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fundamentalism]] – Christian, Muslim, or other – set its face against the profanum with a return to sacred writ.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco. ''Turning Back the Clock'' (2007) pp. 218–20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychology]] too has set out to protect the [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] of the individual self from profane intrusion,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''The Psychology of Human Destiny'' (1974) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; establishing ritual places for inward work&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly, ''Iron John'' (1991) p. 194 and p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to the [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] loss of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Eco, p. 77-88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

'''Quality of service''' ('''QoS''') is the description or measurement of the overall performance of a service, such as a [[telephony]] or [[computer network]] or a [[cloud computing]] service, particularly the performance seen by the users of the network. To quantitatively measure quality of service, several related aspects of the network service are often considered, such as [[packet loss]], [[bit rate]], [[throughput]], [[transmission delay]], [[availability]], [[jitter]], etc.

In the field of [[computer networking]] and other [[packet-switched]] telecommunication networks, quality of service refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to provide different priority to different applications, users, or data [[Flow (computer networking)|flows]], or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow.

Quality of service is particularly important for the transport of traffic with special requirements. In particular, developers have introduced [[Voice over IP]] technology to allow computer networks to become as useful as telephone networks for audio conversations, as well as supporting new applications with even stricter network performance requirements.

==Definitions==
In the field of [[telephony]], quality of service was defined by the [[ITU]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="E.800"/&gt; Quality of service comprises requirements on all the aspects of a connection, such as service response time, loss, signal-to-noise ratio, [[crosstalk]], echo, interrupts, frequency response, loudness levels, and so on. A subset of telephony QoS is [[grade of service]] (GoS) requirements, which comprises aspects of a connection relating to capacity and coverage of a network, for example guaranteed maximum [[blocking probability]] and outage probability.&lt;ref name="itu-t-2"&gt;[http://www.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf Teletraffic Engineering Handbook] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111000000/http://www.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf |date=January 11, 2007 }} ITU-T Study Group 2 (350 pages, 4·48[[MiB]])(It uses abbreviation GoS instead of QoS)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[computer networking]] and other [[packet-switched]] telecommunication networks, [[teletraffic engineering]] refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to provide different priority to different applications, users, or [[Flow (computer networking)|data flows]], or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow. For example, a required [[bit rate]], [[network delay|delay]], [[Packet delay variation|delay variation]], [[packet loss]] or [[bit error rate]]s may be guaranteed. Quality of service is important for real-time [[streaming multimedia]] applications such as [[voice over IP]], [[multiplayer online game]]s and [[IPTV]], since these often require fixed bit rate and are delay sensitive. Quality of service is especially important in networks where the capacity is a limited resource, for example in cellular data communication.

A network or protocol that supports QoS may agree on a [[traffic contract]] with the application software and reserve capacity in the network nodes, for example during a session establishment phase. During the session it may monitor the achieved level of performance, for example the data rate and delay, and dynamically control scheduling priorities in the network nodes. It may release the reserved capacity during a [[Clearing (telecommunications)|tear down]] phase.

A [[best-effort]] network or service does not support quality of service. An alternative to complex QoS control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication over a best-effort network by [[Overprovisioning (networking)|over-provisioning]] the capacity so that it is sufficient for the expected peak traffic load. The resulting absence of [[network congestion]] reduces or eliminates the need for QoS mechanisms.

QoS is sometimes used as a quality measure, with many alternative definitions, rather than referring to the ability to reserve resources. Quality of service sometimes refers to the level of quality of service, i.e. the guaranteed service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.future.2008.11.001 | volume=25 | issue=7 | title=Real-time reconfiguration for guaranteeing QoS provisioning levels in Grid environments | year=2009 | journal=Future Generation Computer Systems | pages=779–784 | author=Menychtas Andreas}}&lt;/ref&gt; High QoS is often confused with a high level of performance, for example high [[bit rate]], low [[latency (engineering)|latency]] and low bit error rate.

QoS is sometimes used in application layer services such as telephony and [[streaming video]] to describe a metric that reflects or predicts the subjectively experienced quality. In this context, QoS is the acceptable cumulative effect on subscriber satisfaction of all imperfections affecting the service. Other terms with similar meaning are the [[quality of experience]] (QoE), [[mean opinion score]] (MOS), [[perceptual speech quality measure]] (PSQM) and [[perceptual evaluation of video quality]] (PEVQ). See also [[Subjective video quality]].

==History==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}
A number of attempts for [[layer 2]] technologies that add QoS tags to the data have gained popularity in the past. Examples are [[frame relay]], [[asynchronous transfer mode]] (ATM) and [[multiprotocol label switching]] (MPLS) (a technique between layer 2 and 3). Despite these network technologies remaining in use today, this kind of network lost attention after the advent of [[Ethernet]] networks. Today Ethernet is, by far, the most popular layer 2 technology. Conventional [[Internet router]]s and [[LAN switch]]es operate on a [[best effort]] basis. This equipment is less expensive, less complex and faster and thus more popular than earlier more complex technologies that provide QoS mechanisms. 

Ethernet optionally uses [[802.1p]] to signal the priority of a frame. 

There were four ''[[type of service]]'' bits and three ''precedence'' bits originally provided in each [[IPv4 Header|IP packet header]], but they were not generally respected.  These bits were later re-defined as [[Differentiated services code point]]s (DSCP).

With the advent of [[IPTV]] and [[IP telephony]], QoS mechanisms are increasingly available to the end user.

==Qualities of traffic==
In [[packet-switched network]]s, quality of service is affected by various factors, which can be divided into human and technical factors. Human factors include: stability of service quality, availability of service, waiting times and user information. Technical factors include: reliability, scalability, effectiveness, maintainability and [[network congestion]].&lt;ref name="peuhkuri"&gt;{{cite paper |author=Peuhkuri M. |title=IP Quality of Service |publisher=Helsinki University of Technology, Laboratory of Telecommunications Technology |url=https://www.netlab.tkk.fi/~puhuri/htyo/Tik-110.551/iwork.ps |date=1999-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many things can happen to packets as they travel from origin to destination, resulting in the following problems as seen from the point of view of the sender and receiver:

; [[Goodput]]: Due to varying load from disparate users sharing the same network resources, the maximum throughput that can be provided to a certain data stream may be too low for real-time multimedia services.
; [[Packet loss]]: The network may fail to deliver (''drop'') some packets due to [[network congestion]]. The receiving application may ask for this information to be retransmitted, possibly resulting in [[congestive collapse]] or unacceptable delays in the overall transmission.
; Errors: Sometimes packets are corrupted due to [[bit error]]s caused by noise and interference, especially in wireless communications and long copper wires. The receiver has to detect this and, just as if the packet was dropped, may ask for this information to be retransmitted.
; [[Network delay|Latency]]: It might take a long time for each packet to reach its destination because it gets held up in long queues, or it takes a less direct route to avoid congestion. In some cases, excessive latency can render an application such as VoIP or online gaming unusable.
; [[Packet delay variation]]: Packets from the source will reach the destination with different delays. A packet's delay varies with its position in the queues of the routers along the path between source and destination and this position can vary unpredictably. Delay variation can be absorbed at the receiver but in so doing increases the overall latency for the stream.
; [[Out-of-order delivery]]: When a collection of related packets is routed through a network, different packets may take different routes,  each resulting in a different delay.  The result is that the packets arrive in a different order than they were sent.  This problem requires special additional protocols for rearranging out-of-order packets. The reordering process requires additional buffering ant the receiver and as with packet delay variation increases the overall latency for the stream.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

==Applications==
A defined quality of service may be desired or required for certain types of network traffic, for example:
* [[Streaming media]] specifically
** [[Internet protocol television]] (IPTV)
** [[Audio over Ethernet]]
** [[Audio over IP]]
* [[IP telephony]] also known as [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP)
* [[Videoconferencing]]
* [[Telepresence]]
* Storage applications such as [[iSCSI]] and [[FCoE]]
* [[Circuit Emulation Service]]
* [[Safety-critical system|Safety-critical]] applications such as [[remote surgery]] where [[availability]] issues can be hazardous
* Network [[operations support systems]] either for the network itself, or for customers' business critical needs
* [[Online games]] where real-time [[lag]] can be a factor
* [[Industrial control systems]] protocols such as [[Ethernet/IP]] which are used for real-time control of machinery

These types of service are called ''inelastic'', meaning that they require a certain minimum bit rate and a certain maximum latency to function. By contrast, ''elastic'' applications can take advantage of however much or little [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] is available. Bulk file transfer applications that rely on [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] are generally elastic.

==Mechanisms==
Circuit switched networks, especially those intended for voice transmission, such as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) or [[GSM]], have QoS in the core protocol and do not need additional procedures to achieve it. Shorter data units and built-in QoS were some of the [[unique selling point]]s of ATM for applications such as [[video on demand]].

When the expense of mechanisms to provide QoS is justified, network customers and providers can enter into a contractual agreement termed a [[service level agreement]] (SLA) which specifies guarantees for the ability of a network/protocol to give guaranteed performance/throughput/latency bounds based on mutually agreed measures, usually by prioritizing traffic.
In other approaches, resources are reserved at each step on the network for the call as it is set up.

===Over-provisioning===
An alternative to complex QoS control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication by generously over-provisioning a network so that capacity is based on peak traffic load estimates. This approach is simple for networks with predictable peak loads. The performance is reasonable for many applications. This might include demanding applications that can compensate for variations in bandwidth and delay with large receive buffers, which is often possible for example in video streaming. Over-provisioning can be of limited use, however, in the face of transport protocols (such as [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]) that over time exponentially increase the amount of data placed on the network until all available bandwidth is consumed and packets are dropped. Such greedy protocols tend to increase latency and packet loss for all users.

Commercial VoIP services are often competitive with traditional telephone service in terms of call quality even though QoS mechanisms are usually not in use on the user's connection to their ISP and the VoIP provider's connection to a different ISP. Under high load conditions, however, VoIP may degrade to cell-phone quality or worse. The mathematics of packet traffic indicate that network requires just 60% more raw capacity under conservative assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;

The amount of over-provisioning in interior links required to replace QoS depends on the number of users and their traffic demands. This limits usability of over-provisioning. Newer more bandwidth intensive applications and the addition of more users results in the loss of over-provisioned networks. This then requires a physical update of the relevant network links which is an expensive process. Thus over-provisioning cannot be blindly assumed on the Internet.

===IP and Ethernet efforts===
Unlike single-owner networks, the [[Internet]] is a series of exchange points interconnecting private networks.&lt;ref name="KAHNVID"&gt;[http://archive.computerhistory.org/lectures/an_eveninig_with_robert_kahn.lecture.2007.01.09.wmv An Evening With Robert Kahn] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219124325/http://archive.computerhistory.org/lectures/an_eveninig_with_robert_kahn.lecture.2007.01.09.wmv |date=December 19, 2008 }}, from [[Computer History Museum]], 9 Jan 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the Internet's core is owned and managed by a number of different [[network service provider]]s, not a single entity. Its behavior is much more [[stochastic]] or [[predictability|unpredictable]]. Therefore, research continues on QoS procedures that are deployable in large, diverse networks.

There are two principal approaches to QoS in modern packet-switched IP networks, a parameterized system based on an exchange of application requirements with the network, and a prioritized system where each packet identifies a desired service level to the network.
*[[Integrated services]] ("IntServ") implements the parameterized approach. In this model, applications use the [[Resource Reservation Protocol]] (RSVP) to request and reserve resources through a network.
*[[Differentiated services]] ("DiffServ") implements the prioritized model. DiffServ marks packets according to the type of service they desire. In response to these markings, routers and switches use various [[scheduling algorithm|queueing strategies]] to tailor performance to expectations. Differentiated services code point (DSCP) markings use the first 6 bits in the [[Type of service|ToS]] field (now renamed as the DS Byte) of the [[IPv4 header|IP(v4) packet header]].

Early work used the integrated services (IntServ) philosophy of reserving network resources. In this model, applications used the [[Resource reservation protocol]] (RSVP) to request and reserve resources through a network. While IntServ mechanisms do work, it was realized that in a broadband network typical of a larger service provider, Core routers would be required to accept, maintain, and tear down thousands or possibly tens of thousands of reservations. It was believed that this approach would not scale with the growth of the Internet, and in any event was antithetical to the notion of designing networks so that Core routers do little more than simply switch packets at the highest possible rates.

In response to these markings, routers and switches use various queuing strategies to tailor performance to requirements. At the IP layer, DSCP markings use the 6 bits in the IP packet header. At the MAC layer, [[VLAN]] [[IEEE 802.1Q]] and [[IEEE 802.1p]] can be used to carry essentially the same information.

Routers supporting DiffServ configure their [[network scheduler]] to use multiple queues for packets awaiting transmission from bandwidth constrained (e.g., wide area) interfaces. Router vendors provide different capabilities for configuring this behavior, to include the number of queues supported, the relative priorities of queues, and bandwidth reserved for each queue.

In practice, when a packet must be forwarded from an interface with queuing, packets requiring low jitter (e.g., [[VoIP]] or [[videoconferencing]]) are given priority over packets in other queues. Typically, some bandwidth is allocated by default to network control packets (such as [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] and routing protocols), while best effort traffic might simply be given whatever bandwidth is left over.

At the [[Media Access Control]] (MAC) layer, [[VLAN]] [[IEEE 802.1Q]] and [[IEEE 802.1p]] can be used to distinguish between Ethernet frames and classify them. Queueing theory models have been developed on performance analysis and QoS for MAC layer protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=840210&amp;tag=1|title=Performance analysis of the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function|last1=Bianchi|first1=Giuseppe|year=2000|doi=10.1109/49.840210|journal=IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications|volume=18|issue=3|pages=535–547|citeseerx=10.1.1.464.2640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166531609000236|title=Analytical Models for Understanding Misbehavior and MAC Friendliness in CSMA Networks|last1=Shi|first1=Zhefu|last2=Beard|first2=Cory|last3=Mitchell|first3=Ken|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.peva.2009.02.002|journal=Performance Evaluation|volume=66|issue=9–10|pages=469|citeseerx=10.1.1.333.3990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One compelling example of the need for QoS on the Internet relates to [[congestion collapse]]. The Internet relies on congestion avoidance protocols, as built into [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), to reduce traffic under conditions that would otherwise lead to "meltdown". QoS applications, such as [[VoIP]] and [[IPTV]], require largely constant bitrates and low latency, therefore they cannot use TCP and cannot otherwise reduce their traffic rate to help prevent congestion. QoS contracts limit traffic that can be offered to the Internet and thereby enforce traffic shaping that can prevent it from becoming overloaded, and are hence an indispensable part of the Internet's ability to handle a mix of real-time and non-real-time traffic without meltdown.

==End-to-end quality of service==
End-to-end quality of service can require a method of coordinating resource allocation between one [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]] and another.
The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) defined the [[Resource Reservation Protocol]] (RSVP) for bandwidth reservation, as a proposed standard in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) |rfc=2205 |author= [[Bob Braden]] ed. L. Zhang, S. Berson, S. Herzog, S. Jamin |date= September 1997 |publisher= [[IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
RSVP is an [[end-to-end principle|end-to-end]] bandwidth reservation protocol. The traffic engineering version, [[RSVP-TE]], is used in many networks to establish traffic-engineered [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]] (MPLS) label-switched paths.{{Citation needed |date= October 2011}}
The IETF also defined [[Next Steps in Signaling]] (NSIS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/nsis/charter/ "Next Steps in Signaling" Charter]&lt;/ref&gt; with QoS signalling as a target. NSIS is a development and simplification of RSVP.

Research consortia such as "end-to-end quality of service support over heterogeneous networks" (EuQoS, from 2004 through 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= EuQoS - End-to-end Quality of Service support over heterogeneous networks |work= Project website |date= 2004–2006 |url= http://www.euqos.eu/ |deadurl= yes |archivedate= April 30, 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070430123408/http://www.euqos.eu/ |accessdate= October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fora such as the [[IPsphere Forum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmforum.org/ipsphere/ IPSphere: Enabling Advanced Service Delivery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113060748/http://www.tmforum.org/ipsphere/ |date=January 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed more mechanisms for handshaking QoS invocation from one domain to the next. IPsphere defined the [[Service Structuring Stratum]] (SSS) signaling bus in order to establish, invoke and (attempt to) assure network services.
EuQoS conducted experiments to integrate [[Session Initiation Protocol]], [[Next Steps in Signaling]] and IPsphere's SSS with an estimated cost of about 15.6 million Euro and published a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= End-to-end quality of service support over heterogeneous networks |work= Project description |publisher= European Community Research and Development Information Service |url= http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&amp;PJ_LANG=EN&amp;PJ_RCN=6903468 |accessdate=October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Torsten Braun |author2=Thomas Staub |title=End-to-end quality of service over heterogeneous networks |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajnpzZOOVUgC&amp;pg=PA161 |year=2008 |publisher= Springer |isbn=978-3-540-79119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research project Multi Service Access Everywhere (MUSE) defined another QoS concept in a first phase from January 2004 through February 2006, and a second phase from January 2006 through 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Multi Service Access Everywhere (MUSE) |work= Project website |url= http://www.ist-muse.org/ |deadurl=no |accessdate= October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Multi Service Access Everywhere |work= Project description |publisher= European Community Research and Development Information Service |url= http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&amp;PJ_LANG=EN&amp;PJ_RCN=12052357 |accessdate=October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Multi Service Access Everywhere |work= Project description |publisher= European Community Research and Development Information Service |url= http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&amp;PJ_LANG=EN&amp;PJ_RCN=9151777 |accessdate=October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another research project named PlaNetS was proposed for European funding circa 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= PlaNetS QoS Solution |work= Project website |url= http://www.medea-planets.eu/QoSsolution.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091112202614/http://www.medea-planets.eu/QoSsolution.php? |archivedate=November 12, 2009 |accessdate= October 12, 2011  |date= 2017-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not in Cordis, so not funded? --&gt;
A broader European project called "Architecture and design for the future Internet" known as 4WARD had a budget estimated at 23.4 million Euro and was funded from January 2008 through June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 4WARD: Architecture and design for the future Internet |work= Project description |publisher= European Community Research and Development Information Service |url= http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=PROJ_ICT&amp;ACTION=D&amp;CAT=PROJ&amp;RCN=85316 |accessdate=October 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It included a "Quality of Service Theme" and published a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Going 4WARD |work= Project newsletter |date= June 2010 |url= http://www.4ward-project.eu/index.php?s=file_download&amp;id=90 |format= PDF|accessdate=October 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Luís M.

==Circumvention==
[[Strong cryptography]] network protocols such as [[Transport Layer Security|Secure Sockets Layer]], [[I2P]], and [[virtual private network]]s obscure the data transferred using them.  As all [[electronic commerce]] on the Internet requires the use of such strong cryptography protocols, unilaterally downgrading the performance of encrypted traffic creates an unacceptable hazard for customers.  Yet, encrypted traffic is otherwise unable to undergo [[deep packet inspection]] for QoS.

Protocols like [[Independent Computing Architecture|ICA]] and [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]] may encapsulate other traffic (e.g. printing, video streaming) with varying requirements that can make optimization difficult.

==Doubts about quality of service over IP==
The [[Internet2]] project found, in 2001, that the QoS protocols were probably not deployable inside its [[Abilene Network]] with equipment available at that time.&lt;ref name="failure"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://qbone.internet2.edu/papers/non-architectural-problems.txt |deadurl= no |title=Why Premium IP Service Has Not Deployed (and Probably Never Will) |author=Benjamin Teitelbaum, [[Stanislav Shalunov]] |date= May 3, 2002 |publisher=Internet2 QoS Working Group |work= Draft Informational Document |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5shCiXna8 |archivedate= September 12, 2010 |accessdate= October 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Equipment available at the time relied on software to implement QoS. The group also predicted that “logistical, financial, and organizational barriers will block the way toward any bandwidth guarantees” by protocol modifications aimed at QoS.&lt;ref name="Oram"&gt;{{cite web |author=Andy Oram |title= A Nice Way to Get Network Quality of Service? |work= Platform Independent column |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5shCWW1GT |archivedate= September 12, 2010 |url= http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/06/11/platform.html |deadurl=no |date= June 11, 2002 |publisher= O'Reilly |accessdate= October 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They believed that the economics would encourage network providers to deliberately erode the quality of best effort traffic as a way to push customers to higher priced QoS services. Instead they proposed over-provisioning of capacity as more cost-effective at the time.&lt;ref name="failure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oram"/&gt;

The Abilene network study was the basis for the testimony of Gary Bachula to the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|US Senate Commerce Committee]]'s hearing on [[Network Neutrality]] in early 2006. He expressed the opinion that adding more bandwidth was more effective than any of the various schemes for accomplishing QoS they examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Gary Bachula |title=Testimony of Gary R. Bachula, Vice President, Internet2 |url=http://commerce.senate.gov/pdf/bachula-020706.pdf |pages=2–3 |date= February 7, 2006  |accessdate= October 15, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachula's testimony has been cited by proponents of a law banning quality of service as proof that no legitimate purpose is served by such an offering. This argument is dependent on the assumption that over-provisioning isn't a form of QoS and that it is always possible. Cost and other factors affect the ability of carriers to build and maintain permanently over-provisioned networks.

==Mobile (cellular) QoS==
{{main|Mobile QoS}}
Mobile cellular service providers may offer [[mobile QoS]] to customers just as the fixed line [[PSTN]] services providers and Internet Service Providers (ISP) may offer QoS. QoS mechanisms are always provided for [[circuit switched]] services, and are essential for non-elastic services, for example [[streaming multimedia]].

Mobility adds complication to the QoS mechanisms, for several reasons:
* A phone call or other session may be interrupted after a [[handover]], if the new [[base station]] is overloaded. Unpredictable handovers make it impossible to give an absolute QoS guarantee during a session initiation phase.
* The pricing structure is often based on per-minute or per-megabyte fee rather than [[flat rate]], and may be different for different content services.
* A crucial part of QoS in mobile communications is [[Grade of Service]], involving outage probability (the probability that the mobile station is outside the service coverage area, or affected by co-channel interference, i.e. crosstalk), [[blocking probability]] (the probability that the required level of QoS can not be offered) and [[scheduling starvation]]. These performance measures are affected by mechanisms such as [[mobility management]], [[radio resource management]], [[admission control]], [[fair scheduling]], [[channel-dependent scheduling]] etc.

==Standards==
Quality of service in the field of [[telephony]], was first defined in 1994 in the [[ITU-T]] Recommendation E.800. This definition is very broad, listing 6 primary components: Support, Operability, Accessibility, Retainability, Integrity and Security.&lt;ref name="E.800"&gt;{{cite web |title= E.800: Terms and definitions related to quality of service and network performance including dependability |date= August 1994 |work= ITU-T Recommendation |url= http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.800/en |accessdate= October 14, 2011 }} Updated September 2008 as ''Definitions of terms related to quality of service''&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1995 recommendation X.902 included a definition is the [[OSI reference model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= X.902:Information technology – Open Distributed Processing – Reference model: Foundations |work=ITU-T Recommendation |date= November 1995 |url= http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.902/en |accessdate= October 14, 2011 }} Updated October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1998 the ITU published a document discussing QoS in the field of data networking. X.641 offers a means of developing or enhancing standards related to QoS and provide concepts and terminology that will assist in maintaining the consistency of related standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= X.641: Information technology - Quality of service: framework |work=ITU-T Recommendation |date= December 1997 |url= http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.641/en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some QoS-related IETF [[Request For Comments]] (RFC)s are {{citation |title= Definition of the Differentiated services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers |rfc=2474}}, and {{citation |title=Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) |rfc=2205}}; both these are discussed above. The IETF has also published two RFCs giving background on QoS: {{citation |rfc=2990 |title= Next Steps for the IP QoS Architecture}}, and {{citation |rfc=3714 |title=IAB Concerns Regarding Congestion Control for Voice Traffic in the Internet}}.

The IETF has also published {{citation |rfc=4594 |title=Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes}} as an informative or "best practices" document about the practical aspects of designing a QoS solution for a [[DiffServ]] network. They try to identify which types of applications are commonly run over an IP network to group them into traffic classes, study what treatment do each of these classes need from the network, and suggest which of the QoS mechanisms commonly available in routers can be used to implement those treatments.

'''Renaissance studies''' (also ''Renaissance and Early Modern Studies'') is the interdisciplinary study of [[the Renaissance]] and [[early modern period]]. The field of study often incorporates knowledge from history, art history, literature, music, architecture, history of science, philosophy, classics, and medieval studies.

==Centers and Universities with Renaissance studies==
Renaissance studies programs exist at several universities, ether an independent field of study or as a subset of [[medieval studies]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3256">[[File:Rumford_oven.svg|thumb| Cross section of a Rumford furnace, with the fuel chamber at the left]]

A '''Rumford furnace''' is a [[kiln]] for the industrial scale production in the 19th century of [[calcium oxide]], popularly known as quicklime or burnt lime. It was named after its inventor, Benjamin Thompson, also known as [[Count Rumford]], and is sometimes called a [[Rüdersdorf]] furnace after the location where it was first built and from where the design rapidly spread throughout Europe.

==Technology==
Rumford’s innovation was to separate the combustion chambers for the limestone and the fuel. In previous designs, the fuel (traditionally wood or charcoal, later coal) was mixed with the limestone before burning, which meant that the quicklime end product was contaminated with ash and had to be laboriously cleaned. By separating the two it was possible to produce large quantities of high-quality quicklime for the booming 19th-century European construction industry. 

[[File:MP Rüdersdorf Rumfordofen 1.jpg|thumb| A Rumford furnace at the Rüdersdorf Museum Park near Berlin]]

In a Rumford furnace, fuel compartments surround the actual combustion chamber, each one being connected to it by a single transverse channel through which the hot air produced by the burning fuel flows into the stack and moves upward through the pile of limestone. The fuel ash waste falls into a separate chamber, from which it can be removed.
The limestone in the central shaft collapses as it burns to quicklime, making space for new limestone to be added to the top of the stack. The quicklime cools down as it slowly descends through the space below the channel connecting the stack to the firing compartment and is finally removed through an outlet at the bottom of the shaft. 
The upper part of the limestone shaft extends above the fuel compartments and its walls contain separate cavities filled with coal dust. This insulation supports the prewarming of the limestone before it moves into the vicinity of the hot air source.

==Historical development==
The first Rumford kiln was constructed in 1802&lt;ref&gt;750 Jahre Kalksteinbergbau in Rüdersdorf, Rüdersdorfer Zement GmbH, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; in Rüdersdorf near Berlin, and one of them can still be explored at the Museumspark Rüdersdorf. The innovation rapidly spread throughout Europe because it made it possible to produce quicklime far more efficiently than predecessor technologies. These required either batch production, waiting for each load to be assembled, burn and cool before removal, or carefully mixing the fuel and limestone in the appropriate proportions, burning them together, and then cleaning the contaminated limestone afterward.
In a Rumford kiln continuous operation was possible for the first time, since the addition of fuel and limestone as well as the removal of ash and quicklime could be separately optimized according to need, and all these operations could take place simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Vom Bergbau zu Industriereivier, Enzo Baraldi, Ekkehard Westermann, 1993, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">The '''semantic feature comparison model''' is used "to derive [[prediction]]s about [[categorization]] times in a situation where a subject must rapidly decide whether a test item is a member of a particular target category".&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, E. E., Shoben. E. J., and Rips, L. J. (1974). Structure and Process in Semantic Memory: A Feature Model for Semantic Decisions. Psychological Review, 81(3), 214–241.&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[semantic model]], there is an assumption that certain occurrences are categorized using its features or attributes of the two subjects that represent the part and the group. A statement often used to explain this model is "a [[European robin|robin]] is a bird". The meaning of the words ''robin'' and ''bird'' are stored in the memory by virtue of a list of features which can be used to ultimately define their categories, although the extent of their association with a particular category varies.

==History==
This model was conceptualized by Edward Smith, Edward Shoben and Lance Rips in 1974 after they derived various observations from semantic verification experiments conducted at the time. Respondents merely have to answer "true" or "false" to given sentences. Out of these experiments, they observed that people respond faster when (1) statements are true, (2) nouns are members of smaller categories, (3) items are "typical" or commonly associated with the category (also called prototypes), and (4) items are primed by a similar item previously given ([[University of Alaska Anchorage]], n.d.). In the latter item, respondents will respond faster to the latter statement since the category bird has been primed. Based on the previous observations, the proponents were able to come up with the semantic feature comparison model.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

==Theory==
The cognitive approach consists of two concepts: [[information processing]] depends on [[Mental representation|internal representations]], and that mental representations undergo transformations. For the first concept, we could describe an object in a number of ways, with drawings, equations, or verbal descriptions, but it is up to the recipient to have a background understanding of the context to which the object is being described in order to fully comprehend the deliverable. The second concept explains how memory can alter the way we perceive representations of something, by determining the sequence in which the information is processed based on previous experiences.

==Features==
The main features of the model, as discussed by Smith et al. (1974), are the defining features and the characteristic features. Defining features refer to the characteristics that are essential elements of the category, the non-negotiable, so to speak. For example, the 'bird' category includes such defining features as 'they have wings', 'feathers', 'they lay eggs', etc. Characteristic features refer to the elements usually found or inherent to category members but are not found in all, or non-essentials. For example, birds 'fly', – that is characteristic because while most birds fly, there are some who cannot.

The model has two stages for [[decision making]]. First, all features of the two concepts (bird and robin, in our example) are compared to find out how alike they are. If the decision is that they are very [[similarity (psychology)|similar]] or very dissimilar, then a true or false decision can be made. Second, if the characteristics/features are in-between then the focus shifts to the defining features in order to decide if the example possesses enough features of the category, thus, categorization depends on similarity and not on the size of the category.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4417">A '''shut down valve''' (also referred to as '''SDV''' or '''Emergency Shutdown Valve''', '''ESV''', '''ESD''', or '''ESDV''') is an [[actuated]] [[valve]] designed to stop the flow of a hazardous fluid upon the detection of a dangerous event.  This provides protection against possible harm to people, equipment or the environment.
Shutdown valves form part of a [[Safety Instrumented System]].  The process of providing automated safety protection upon the detection of a hazardous event is called [[Functional Safety]]

Shutdown valves are primarily associated with the [[petroleum industry]] although other industries may also require this type of protection system.  ESD valves are required by law on any equipment placed on an offshore drilling rig to prevent catastrophic events like the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|BP Horizon]] explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

==Types of valve==
For fluids, metal seated [[ball valve]]s are used as shut-down valves (SDV's). Use of [[metal]] seated ball valves leads to overall lower costs when taking into account lost [[List of topics in industrial organization|production]] and [[inventory]], and valve repair costs resulting from the use of soft seated ball valves which have a lower initial cost.

Straight-through flow valves, such as rotary-shaft ball valves, are typically high-recovery valves. High recovery valves are valves that lose little energy due to little flow [[turbulence]]. Flow paths are straight through. Rotary control valves, [[butterfly valve]] and ball valves are good examples.

For air intake shut down, two distinct types are commonly utilized, i.e. [[butterfly valves]] and swing gate or guillotine valves.  Because diesel engines ignite fuel using compression instead of an electronic ignition, shutting off the fuel source to a diesel engine will not necessarily stop the engine from running.  When an external hydrocarbon, such as methane gas, is present in the atmosphere, it can be sucked into a diesel engine causing [[Overspeed (engine)|overspeed]] or [[Diesel engine runaway|over revving]], potentially leading to a catastrophic failure and explosion.  When actuated, ESD valves stop the flow of air and prevent these failures.

==Types of actuation==
[[File:Pneumatically actuated Shutdown valve.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Pneumatically actuated shut down valve]]
As shutdown valves form part of a SIS it is necessary to operate the valve by means of an actuator.  These actuators are normally [[fail safe]] [[fluid power]] type.  Typical examples of these are:
:*'''[[Pneumatic cylinder]]'''
:*'''[[Hydraulic cylinder]]'''
:*'''Electro-hydraulic actuator'''

In addition to the fluid type, actuators also vary in the manner in which the energy is stored to operate the valve on demand as follows:
:*'''[[single-acting cylinder]]'''  - Or spring return where the energy is stored by means of a compressed spring
:*'''[[double-acting cylinder]]'''  - Energy is stored using a volume of compressed fluid

The type of actuation required depends upon the application, site facilities and also the physical space available although the majority of actuators used for shutdown valves are of the spring return type due to the fail safe nature of spring return systems

==Measuring performance==
For shutdown valves used in safety instrumented systems it is essential to know that the valve is capable of providing the required level of safety performance and that the valve will operate on demand.  The required level of performance is dicated by the [[Safety Integrity Level]] (SIL).  In order to adhere to this level of performance it is necessary to test the valve.  There are 2 types of testing methods available being
*'''Proof test''' - A manual test that allows the operator to determine whether the valve is in the "as good as new" condition by testing for all possible failure modes and requires a plant shutdown
*'''Diagnostic Test''' - An automated on-line test that will detect a percentage of the possible failure modes of the shutdown valve.  An example of this for a shutdown valve would be a [[partial stroke testing|partial stroke test]]. An example of a mechanical partial stroke test device can be found [http://www.c-a-m.com/Forms/Product.aspx?prodID=3da2f6d9-dfad-408a-9863-b2cdf266f49c here].

[[Image:North Fork Mountain - Nelson Sods.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Nelson Sods''' on [[North Fork Mountain]], West Virginia]]

'''Sods''' is a term used in the [[Allegheny Mountains]] of eastern [[West Virginia]] for a mountain top [[meadow]] or [[bog]], in an area that is otherwise generally forested. The term is similar (perhaps identical) to that of a "[[grass bald]]", a more widespread designation applied throughout the central and southern [[Appalachia|Appalachian region]].

The best known example of a sods is [[Dolly Sods]], a federally designated [[National Wilderness Preservation System|wilderness area]] in [[Tucker County, West Virginia]] and popular destination for recreationalists. Other examples include [[North Fork Mountain|Nelson Sods]] ([[Pendleton County, West Virginia|Pendleton County]]) and Baker Sods ([[Randolph County, West Virginia|Randolph County]]).

==Ecology==
[[West Virginia University]] botanist [[Earl L. Core]] addressed the origin of the "sods" in 1973:
&lt;blockquote&gt;How did it happen that these grassy tracts were originally [prior to white settlement] treeless, when all the surrounding areas were covered with trees? No one really knows. Although the "sods" and "balds" have been the subject of much speculation, discussion, and research, no generally-accepted explanation has yet been proposed for their existence. Perhaps there is not really any one cause; the treelessness may be the result of a complex situation which may vary from place to place. Factors suggested may be classified as natural or artificial. Among the natural have been listed climatic, edaphic (soil), topographic, biotic and pyric (fire).&lt;ref&gt;Core, Earl L. (1973), "Allegheny Flyback at Dahle Sods", ''[[Charleston Gazette-Mail]]'', 29 July; Reprinted in the same author's 1975 book ''The Wondrous Year: West Virginia Through the Seasons'', [[Grantsville, West Virginia]]: [[Seneca Books]], pp 87-92.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dominant grass is [[Danthonia compressa|Allegheny flyback]] (''Danthonia compressa''), a grass so light in weight that it would "fly back" against the scythe of the mower.&lt;ref&gt;Core, Earl L. (1974), ''The Monongalia Story: A Bicentennial History, Vol. I: Prelude'', [[Parsons, W.Va.]]: [[McClain Printing Co.]], pp 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6176">'''Soil ecology''' is the study of the interactions among [[soil biology]], and between biotic and abiotic aspects of the [[soil]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;Access Science: [http://www.accessscience.com/Encyclopedia/6/63/Est_631825_frameset.html?doi Soil Ecology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312193834/http://www.accessscience.com/Encyclopedia/6/63/Est_631825_frameset.html?doi |date=2007-03-12 }}.  Url last accessed 2006-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly concerned with the [[biogeochemistry|cycling of nutrients]], formation and stabilization of the [[porosity|pore structure]], the spread and vitality of [[pathogen]]s, and the [[biodiversity]] of this rich [[soil life|biological community]].

== Overview ==
[[Soil]] is made up of a multitude of [[soil physics|physical]], [[soil chemistry|chemical]], and [[soil biology|biological]] entities, with many interactions occurring among them.  Soil is a variable mixture of broken and weathered minerals and decaying organic matter.  Together with the proper amounts of air and water, it supplies, in part, sustenance for plants as well as mechanical support.

The diversity and abundance of [[soil life]] exceeds that of any other [[ecosystem]].  Plant establishment, competitiveness, and growth is governed largely by the ecology below-ground, so understanding this system is an essential component of plant sciences and terrestrial ecology.

==Features of the ecosystem==
*[[Moisture]] is a major limiting factor on land. Terrestrial organisms are constantly confronted with the problem of [[dehydration]]. Transpiration or [[evaporation]] of water from plant surfaces is an energy dissipating process unique to the terrestrial environment.
*Temperature variations and extremes are more pronounced in the air than in the water medium.
*On the other hand, the rapid circulation of air throughout the globe results in a ready mixing and remarkably constant content of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
*Although soil offers solid support, air does not. Storing skeletons have been evolved in both land plants and animals and also special means of locomotion have been evolved in the latter.
*Land, unlike the ocean, is not continuous; there are important geographical barriers to free movement.
*The nature of the substrate, although important in water is especially vital in terrestrial environment. Soil, not air, is the source of highly variable nutrients; it is a highly developed ecological subsystem.

== Soil food web ==
{{main|soil food web}}

An incredible diversity of organisms make up the soil [[food web]]. They range in size from the tiniest one-celled [[bacteria]], [[algae]], [[fungi]], and [[protozoa]], to the more complex [[nematode]]s and micro-[[arthropod]]s, to the visible [[earthworm]]s, [[insect]]s, small [[vertebrate]]s, and [[plant]]s.  As these organisms eat, grow, and move through the soil, they make it possible to have clean water, clean air, healthy plants, and moderated water flow.

There are many ways that the soil food web is an integral part of landscape processes. [[Soil life|Soil organisms]] decompose organic compounds, including [[manure]], plant residues, and [[pesticide]]s, preventing them from entering water and becoming pollutants.  They sequester nitrogen and other nutrients that might otherwise enter groundwater, and they fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, making it available to plants.  Many organisms enhance soil aggregation and [[porosity]], thus increasing [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and reducing [[surface runoff]].  Soil organisms prey on crop pests and are food for above-ground animals.

== Research ==
Research  interests span many aspects of soil ecology and [[microbiology]], Fundamentally, researchers are interested in understanding the interplay among [[microorganisms]], [[fauna]], and plants, the [[biogeochemical]] processes they carry out, and the physical environment in which their activities take place, and  applying this knowledge to address environmental problems.

Example research projects are to examine the [[biogeochemistry]] and microbial ecology of [[septic drain field]] soils used to treat domestic [[wastewater]], the role of [[anecic]] [[earthworm]]s in controlling the movement of water and [[nitrogen cycle]] in [[agricultural soil science|agricultural soils]], and the assessment of soil quality in turf production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uri.edu/cels/nrs/seml/ Laboratory of Soil Ecology and Microbiology]. Url last accessed 2006-04-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Of  particular interest {{As of|2006|lc=on}} is to understand the roles and functions of [[arbuscular mycorrhiza|arbuscular]] [[mycorrhizal fungi]] in natural ecosystems.  The effect of [[Terra preta|anthropic soil conditions]] on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and the production of [[glomalin]] by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are both of particular interest due to their roles  in [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide]].

'''''The Last Heathen: Encounters with Ghosts and Ancestors in Melanesia''''' is a book by [[Charles Montgomery (writer)|Charles Montgomery]], published in Canada by [[Douglas and McIntyre]] in 2004. In 2006 it was published in the United States by [[HarperCollins]] as ''The Shark God''.

''The Last Heathen'' is the autobiographical account of the author in his journey to [[Melanesia]], following in the footsteps of his great-grandfather, [[Henry Montgomery (bishop)|Henry Montgomery]], [[Bishop of Tasmania]], and to study the effect of his great-grandfather's religion on the people. Montgomery traveled to Melanesia expecting to find a volatile mixture of the tribal, pagan religion and Christianity. He found a comfortable hybrid instead, the two religions living in harmony. The book details his journey as well as his discoveries, from an atheistic point of view.

The book won the [[Charles Taylor Prize]] for Literary Non-fiction in 2005. The book has also won the [[Hubert Evans Non-Fiction Prize]].

'''The curse of expertise''' is a psychological concept&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Choke: What the Secrets of the Brain Reveal About Getting It Right When You Have To|author= Sian beilock |isbn=978-1416596189|date=2011-09-09|publisher=Atria Publishing Group/Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/choke/201103/the-curse-expertise The curse of Expertise]&lt;/ref&gt; where the intervention of experts may be counterproductive for [[Learning|learners]] acquiring new skills.

This is important because the predictions  of  experts can  influence  [[educational equity]] and [[training]]  as well as the  [[personal development]] of [[young people]], not to mention the allocation  of  time and  resources  to scientific research and crucial design decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Journal  of Experimental &amp; applied Psychology,1999,  Vol. 5, No. 2,205-221|title=The Curse of Expertise: The Effects  of Expertise and Debiasing Methods on Predictions of Novice Performance|author=Pamela J. Hinds, Stanford  University|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
A [[curse]] (from the Latin ''cursos'') in this case means a [[habit]] formed by practices that were once successful [[tactic (method)|tactic]]s that have become [[Social intuitionism|socially intuitive]] in reality are [[counterproductive norms]].

Effective teachers must predict the issues and misconceptions that people will face when [[learning]] a complex new [[skill]] or understanding an unfamiliar [[concept]]. This should also encompass the teachers’ recognizing their own or each other's [[bias blind spot]]s.

==History==
The difficulty experienced people may encounter is exemplified fictionally by [[Dr Watson]] in discourses with the [[insight]]ful detective [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160107-what-sherlock-holmes-tells-us-about-the-mind BBC Future:What Sherlock Holmes can teach us about the mind]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedy==
[[Steven Pinker]] a Canadian-born American cognitive scientist, psychologist,speaking at [[Harvard University]] tried to identify exactly what was wrong with so much academic English:&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/11/exorcising-the-curse-of-knowledge/ Harvard Gazette, 2012-11-08 Exorcising the curse of knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Abstract and concrete|abstract language]] unrelated to reality;
* [[Transitions (linguistics)|clumsy transitions]] between related topics;
* [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|inept interpretations]] of external sources;
* Using [[cliché]]s and [[catchphrase]]s whose true meaning is obscure;
* creating "[[Nominalization|zombie nouns]]", from verbs or adjectives (e.g. “verb+ization”);
* compulsive "[[Hedge (linguistics)|hedging]]" by use of expressions such as "somewhat", "comparatively", and "to a certain degree".

==Prevention==
[[Quality assurance]] (QA) is a way of circumventing the curse of experience by applying comprehensive [[quality management]] techniques.
===Professionals===
[[Professional]]s by definition get paid for technically well defined work so that [[quality control]] procedures may be required which encompass the processes employed, the training of the expert and the [[Action (philosophy)|ethos]] of the trade or profession of the expert. Some experts (lawyers, medical practitioners etc.) require a licence which may include a requirement to undertake ongoing [[professional development]] (i.e. obtain OPD credits issued by [[collegiate university|collegiate universities]] or [[professional association]]s – see also ''[[Safety#Normative_safety|normative safety]].''
===Academics===
[[Faculty (academic staff)|Academics]] are usually employed in [[research and development ]] activities that are less well understood than those of professionals, and therefore submit themselves to [[peer review]] assessment by other appropriately qualified individuals. See also ''[[Safety#Perceived_safety|perceived safety.]]''
===Amateurs===
Amateurs work for love of their craft and therefore the [[safety]] and reliability of an amateur intervention lacks any external reference and must therefore rely on the individual’s [[moral responsibility]].
* '''[[Bodging|Bodgers]]''' are very often either [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]] or former professionals who are competent to [[Improvisation|improvise]] or  [[Innovation|innovate]] in a way that is ''[[Safety#Substantive_safety|substantially safe.]]''
*'''[[:Wikt:botch#Verb|Botshers]]''' or '''[[:Wikt:blunder|blunder]]ers''' are persons who are '''''not yet competent''''' and whose interventions may therefore  be [[hazard]]ous. Often people driven by economic reasons to try to copy professionals but who lack the essential technical understanding. For example a great many [[structure fire]]s are caused by [[electrical wiring]] modified [[Competence (human resources)|incompetently]] by [[household]]ers who are not trained [[electrician]]s.

The '''UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies (STS)''' is an academic department in [[University College London]], [[London]], England. It is part of UCL's Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Sciences. The department offers academic training at both undergraduate and graduate (MSc and MPhil/PhD) levels.

The department received its current name in 1994. It had been the "Department of History and Philosophy of Science" from 1938 to 1994, and the "Department of History and Method of Science" from 1921 to 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Smeaton, William A. "History of science at University College London: 1919–47", ''[[The British Journal for the History of Science]]'', 30: 25–28, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

University College London was the first UK university to offer single honours undergraduate degrees in this interdisciplinary subject, launching its BSc in history and philosophy of science in 1993. Two related BSc degrees followed shortly thereafter. At UCL, science and technology studies (abbreviated "STS") includes three specialist research clusters: "history of science," "philosophy of science," and "science, culture, and democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/research|title=STS Research|website=www.ucl.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department offices are located in [[Gordon Square]], [[Bloomsbury]], London.

A '''vegetable box scheme''' is an operation that delivers fresh fruit and vegetables, often locally grown and [[Organic food|organic]], either directly to the customer or to a local collection point. Typically the produce is sold as an ongoing weekly [[subscription]] and the offering may vary week to week depending on what is [[Seasonal food|in season]].

The first organic box scheme was created by [[Guy Watson]] in 1987,{{cn|date=October 2017}} who delivered fresh produce locally from [[Riverford]] farm. These schemes are usually operated by the grower or a small [[co-operative]]. There are approximately 600 such schemes operating in the UK&lt;ref name="BBC Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcgreen.com/Travel/UK-Holidays/Food/Organic/organic-box-schemes |title=Boxes of delight |publisher=BBC Green |accessdate=2008-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614075148/http://www.bbcgreen.com/Travel/UK-Holidays/Food/Organic/organic-box-schemes |archivedate=June 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by early 2007, according to the [[Soil Association]], retail sales via such schemes were in excess of £100 million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/%0Bb0062cf005bc02c180256a6b003d987f/fb6952fe3232ff4d8025729f0052b8ce!OpenDocument |title=How to set up a vegetable box scheme |year=2007 |publisher=The Soil Association |accessdate=2008-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517015208/http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/%0bb0062cf005bc02c180256a6b003d987f/fb6952fe3232ff4d8025729f0052b8ce%21OpenDocument |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many schemes are run on a local or regional basis, delivering food direct from the producer to the consumer. Other schemes offer a nationwide delivery, with produce supplied by a network of growers, co-operatives and wholesalers negating the [[local food]] affiliation of these schemes. Some British [[supermarket]]s have also begun offering vegetable boxes.&lt;ref name="BBC Green" /&gt;

==How a vegetable box scheme works==
A box scheme usually works by subscription. A customer signs up to a weekly or fortnightly delivery of fresh vegetables and/or fruit. The contents will vary week to week as selected by the box scheme provider on the basis of [[seasonality]] and availability. Some schemes offer the option of purchasing extra goods to be delivered along with the vegetable box, such as dairy produce and meat.&lt;ref name="Timesonline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/real_food/article1380105.ece|title=Top 35 organic box schemes in the UK|date=March 3, 2008|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2008-08-11 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Wyke}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2014}}

By March 2007 it was estimated that over 200 universities or academic institutions were involved in [[Second Life]] (Cooke-Plagwitz, p.&amp;nbsp;548).&lt;ref&gt;Cooke-Plagwitz, Jessamine (2008) "New Directions in CALL: An Objective Introduction to Second Life", ''CALICO Journal'' 25, 3: https://www.calico.org/memberBrowse.php?action=article&amp;id=716&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Miller, Linden Lab Vice President of Platform and Technology Development, claimed in 2009 that "Language learning is the most common education-based activity in Second Life".&lt;ref&gt;Team Engage, "8D taps language learners, bots, microtransactions", ''EngageDigital'', 20 May 2009: http://www.engagedigital.com/2009/05/29/out-of-stealth-8d-taps-language-learners-bots-microtransactions/&lt;/ref&gt; Many mainstream language institutes and private language schools are now using 3D [[virtual environment]]s to support language learning.

==History==
[[Virtual worlds]] date back to the adventure games and simulations of the 1970s, for example [[Colossal Cave Adventure]], a text-only simulation in which the user communicated with the computer by typing commands at the keyboard. These early adventure games and simulations led on to [[MUDs]] (Multi-user domains) and [[MOO]]s (Multi-user domains object-oriented), which language teachers were able to exploit for teaching foreign languages and intercultural understanding (Shield 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Shield L. (2003) "MOO as a language learning tool". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-dimensional virtual worlds such as ''Traveler'' and [[Active Worlds]], both of which appeared in the 1990s, were the next important development. ''Traveler'' included the possibility of audio communication (but not text chat) between avatars represented as disembodied heads in a three-dimensional abstract landscape. Svensson (2003) describes the Virtual Wedding Project, in which advanced students of English made use of ''Active Worlds'' as an arena for constructivist learning.&lt;ref&gt;Svensson P. (2003) "Virtual worlds as arenas for language learning". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adobe Atmosphere]] software platform was also used to promote language learning in the Babel-M project (Williams &amp; Weetman 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Williams C. &amp; Weetman C. (2003) Babel-M: A virtual environment for the promotion of language learning, [http://www.parapal-online.co.uk/prof/atmosphere_design.html ''Paragraph PAL''], 23 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3D world of [[Second Life]] was launched in 2003. Initially perceived as another [[role-playing game]] (RPG), it began to attract the attention of language teachers. 2005 saw the first large-scale language school, [[Languagelab.com]], open its doors in Second Life. By 2007, Languagelab.com's custom [[VoIP]] (audio communication) solution was integrated with Second Life. Prior to that, teachers and students used separate applications for voice chat.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Erard M. (2007) "A Boon to Second Life Language Schools: New Technology will Allow High-Quality Audio in a Virtual World", ''Technology Review'', 10 April 2007: http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18510/page1/&lt;/ref&gt;

Many universities, such as Monash University,&lt;ref&gt;Monash University: http://www.monash.edu.au/international/dvc/virtualworlds/monashsecondlife.html&lt;/ref&gt; and language institutes, such as [[British Council|The British Council]], [[Confucius Institute]], [[Instituto Cervantes]] and the Goethe-Institut,&lt;ref&gt;Goethe-Institut: http://www.goethe.de/frm/sec/enindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; have islands in Second Life specifically for language learning. Many professional and research organisations support virtual world language learning through their activities in Second Life. [[EUROCALL]] and [[CALICO (consortium)|CALICO]], two leading professional associations that promote language learning with the aid of new technologies, maintain a joint Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group (VW SIG) and a headquarters in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds SIG: http://virtualworldssig.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent examples of creating sims in virtual worlds specifically for language education include VIRTLANTIS, which has been a free resource for language learners and teachers and an active community of practice since 2006,&lt;ref&gt;VIRTLANTIS: Free Virtual World Language Learning - Come speak with the world!: http://www.virtlantis.com&lt;/ref&gt; the EU-funded NIFLAR project,&lt;ref&gt;Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research (NIFLAR): http://niflar.ning.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930093225/http://niflar.ning.com/ |date=30 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the EU-funded AVALON project,&lt;ref&gt;Access to Virtual and Action Learning live ONline (AVALON): http://avalon-project.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and the EduNation Islands, which have been set up as a community of educators aiming to provide information about and facilities for language learning and teaching.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;EduNation Islands wiki: http://edunation-islands.wikispaces.com/&lt;/ref&gt; NIFLAR is implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;NIFLAR (Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research): http://niflar.ning.com/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930093225/http://niflar.ning.com/ |date=30 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other examples are described by Molka-Danielsen &amp; Deutschmann (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Molka-Danielsen J. &amp; Deutschmann M. (eds.) (2009) ''Learning and teaching in the virtual world of Second Life'', Tapir Academic Press, Trondheim, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; and Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Walker R., Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2012) Introduction to the Internet. Section 14.2.1 (Second Life) of Module 1.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-5.htm#secondlife&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007 a series of conferences known as SLanguages have taken place, bringing together practitioners and researchers in the field of language education in Second Life for a 24-hour event to celebrate languages and cultures within the 3D virtual world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slanguages.net/home.php|title=slanguages.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the decline of second life due to increasing support for open source platforms&lt;ref&gt;Karlov, Maria (2012) "OpenSim gains record-breaking 2,177 regions",http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/09/opensim-gains-record-breaking-2177-regions/&lt;/ref&gt; many independent language learning grids such as English Grid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishgrid.com|title=keating.me Secure Email|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chatterdale&lt;ref&gt;Trombly, Anastasiahave (2012): http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/05/virtual-worlds-offer-variety-less-stress-for-language-learners/&lt;/ref&gt; have emerged.

==Approaches to language education in virtual worlds==
Almost all virtual world educational projects envisage a [[blended learning]] approach whereby the language learners are exposed to a 3D virtual environment for a specific activity or time period.  Such approaches may combine the use of virtual worlds with other online and offline tools, such as 2D virtual learning environments (e.g. [[Moodle]]) or physical classrooms. SLOODLE. for example, is an open-source project which integrates the multi-user virtual environments of Second Life and/or [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]] with the Moodle learning-management system.&lt;ref&gt;SLOODLE is a free and open source project which integrates the multi-user virtual environments of Second Life and/or OpenSim with the Moodle learning-management system: http://www.sloodle.org/moodle/&lt;/ref&gt; Some language schools offer a complete language learning environment through a virtual world, e.g. [[Languagelab.com]] and [http://www.avatarlanguages.com/home.php Avatar Languages].

Virtual worlds such as Second Life are used for the [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Canfield |title=Using Immersive Learning Environments in Foreign Language Classes: Second Life |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessamine |last=Cooke-Plagwitz |title=Conversing in the Metaverse: Language Teaching and Learning in Second Life |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and task-based, game-like&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Chan |title=Developing a Meaning-focused and Task-based Virtual Learning Reality |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; opportunities they offer language learners.  As such, virtual world language learning can be considered to offer distinct (although combinable) learning experiences.

* '''Immersive''': Immersive experiences draw on the ability to be surrounded by a certain (real or fictitious) environment that can stimulate language learning.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery A. &amp; Collins, M. (2008). Immersive Learning and Role Plays in Second Life. In K. McFerrin et al. (Eds.), Proceedings of Society for Information Technology &amp; Teacher Education International Conference 2008 (pp. 2628-2632). Chesapeake, VA: AACE: Retrieved from http://www.editlib.org/p/27616, 2011-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Social''': Almost all 3D virtual spaces are inherently social environments where language learners can meet others, either to informally practice a language or to participate in more formal classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Laurence |last=Johnson|title=Virtual Worlds: Inherently Immersive, Highly Social Learning Spaces |url=http://immersiveeducation.org/library/Immersive_Learning-Johnson_and_Levine.pdf |work=The Immersive Education Initiative |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Creative''': A less-developed approach to language learning in virtual worlds is that of constructing objects as part of a language learning activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gavin |last=Dudeney |title=A Coffee with Gavin Dudeney |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLpb7f06LmI |work= Recording of live event at EduNation in Second Life |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is currently little documentation of such activities.

===Six learnings framework===
The "Six learnings framework" is a pedagogical outline developed for virtual world education in general. It sets out six possible ways to view an educational activity.&lt;ref&gt;Lim K. (2009) "Pedagogy, Education and Innovation in 3-D Virtual Worlds", '' Journal of Virtual Worlds Research 2,1'': http://journals.tdl.org/jvwr/article/view/424/466&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Exploring''': learners explore a virtual world's locations and communities as fieldwork for class.
* '''Collaborating''': learners work together within a virtual world on collaborative tasks.
* '''Being''': learners explore themselves and their identity through their presence in a virtual world, such as through role-play.
* '''Building''': learners construct objects within a virtual world.
* '''Championing''': learners promote real life causes through activities and presentations in a virtual world.
* '''Expressing''': learners represent activities within a virtual world to the outside world, through blogs, podcasts, presentations and videos.

===Learning in 3D worlds===
*''The 7 Sensibilities of Virtual Worlds for Learning'' presentation by Karl Kapp and Tony O'Driscoll illustrates how a 3D environment makes learning fundamentally different.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl &amp; O'Driscoll, Tony (2010) ''The 7 Sensibilities of Virtual Worlds for Learning'', Webinar presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3amL-BXZRk&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''3D Virtual Worlds Learning Archetypes'' presentation by Karl Kapp and Tony O'Driscoll describes 14 archetypes of how people learn in virtual worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl &amp; O'Driscoll, Tony (2010) ''14 archetypes of how people learn in virtual worlds'', Webinar presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNjV8Fvre4U&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivist approaches===
3D virtual worlds are often used for [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] learning because of the opportunities for learners to explore, collaborate and be immersed within an environment of their choice.  Some virtual worlds allow users to build objects and to change the appearance of their avatar and of their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tuncer |last=Can |title=Learning and Teaching Languages Online: a Constructivist Approach |url=http://www.novitasroyal.org/Vol_3_1/can.pdf |work=Novitas-ROYAL |date=April 2009 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivist approaches such as [[#Task-based language learning|task-based language learning]] and [[#Dogme language teaching|Dogme]] are applied to virtual world language learning because of the scope for learners to socially co-construct knowledge, in spheres of particular relevance to the learner.

===Task-based language learning===
[[Task-based language learning]] (TBLL) has been commonly applied to virtual world language education. Task-based language learning focuses on the use of authentic language and encourages students to do real life tasks using the language being learned.&lt;ref&gt;Nunan D. (2004) ''Task-based language teaching'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Tasks can be highly transactional, where the student is carrying out everyday tasks such as visiting the doctor at the Chinese Island of Monash University in Second Life. Incidental knowledge about the medical system in China and cultural information can also be gained at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Island is an initiative by the Chinese Studies Program at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia designed to compliment traditional classroom-based learning with context-based, hands on learning in the virtual environment of Second Life: http://www.virtualhanyu.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tasks may focus on more interactional language, such as those that involve more social activities or interviews within a virtual world.

===Dogme language teaching===
[[Dogme language teaching]] is an approach that is essentially communicative, focusing mainly on conversation between learners and teacher rather than conventional textbooks. Although Dogme is perceived by some teachers as being anti-technology, it nevertheless appears to be particularly relevant to virtual world language learning because of the social, immersive and creative experiences offered by virtual worlds and the opportunities they offer for authentic communication and a learner-centred approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Vickers |title=Dogme 2.0: What "Teaching 2.0" Can Learn from Dogme ELT |url=http://www.avatarlanguages.com/blog/dogme-elt-web20-dogme20 |work= Avatar Languages Blog |date=2009-03-15 |accessdate = 2009-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WebQuests===
Virtual world WebQuests (also referred to as SurReal Quests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Vickers |title=SurReal Quests: Enriched, purposeful language learning in Second Life |url=http://kt.flexiblelearning.net.au/tkt2007/edition-15/surreal-quests-enriched-purposeful-language-learning-in-second-life |work=The Knowledge Tree |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2009-06-22 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120605045109/http://kt.flexiblelearning.net.au/tkt2007/edition-15/surreal-quests-enriched-purposeful-language-learning-in-second-life/ |archive-date=5 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) combine the concept of 2D WebQuests with the immersive and social experiences of 3D virtual worlds.  Learners develop texts, audios or podcasts based on their research, part of which is within a virtual world.

===Language villages===
The concept of real-life [[English village|language villages]] has been replicated within virtual worlds to create a language immersion environment for language learners in their own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ton |last=Koenraad |title=How can 3D Virtual Worlds contribute to language education? |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/71947093/worldcallpdf-2 |work= Paper presented at WorldCALL 2008 |accessdate = 2011-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Digitale School has built two virtual language villages, Chatterdale (English) and Parolay (French), for secondary education students on the OpenSim grid.&lt;ref&gt;3DLES (3D Learning Experience Services): http://www.3dles.com/en/projects.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual classrooms===
Hundsberger (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;18)&lt;ref&gt;Hundsberger S. (2009) ''Foreign language learning in Second Life and the implications for resource provision in academic libraries'', Arcadia Fellowship Programme, Cambridge University Library: http://arcadiaproject.lib.cam.ac.uk/docs/second_life.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; defines a virtual classroom thus:

"A virtual classroom in SL sets itself apart from other virtual classrooms in that an ordinary classroom is the place to learn a language whereas the SL virtual classroom is the place to practise a language. The connection to the outside world from a language lab is a 2D connection, but increasingly people enjoy rich and dynamic 3D environments such as SL as can be concluded from the high number of UK universities active in SL."

To what extent a virtual classroom should offer only language practice rather than teaching a language as in a real-life classroom is a matter for debate. Hundsberger's view (p.&amp;nbsp;18) is that "[...] SL classrooms are not viewed as a replacement for real life classrooms. SL classrooms are an additional tool to be used by the teacher/learner."

===Virtual tourism===
Language learning can take place in public spaces within virtual worlds. This offers greater flexibility with locations and students can choose the locations themselves, which enables a more constructivist approach.

The wide variety of replica places in Second Life, e.g. Barcelona, Berlin, London and Paris, offers opportunities for language learning through virtual tourism. Students can engage in conversation with native speakers who people these places, take part in conducted tours in different languages and even learn how to use Second Life in a language other than English.

The Hypergrid Adventurers Club is an open group of explorers who discuss and visit many different OpenSim virtual worlds. By using ''hypergrid'' connectivity, avatars can jump between completely different OpenSim grids while maintaining a singular identity and inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Hypergrid Adventurers Club: http://becunningandfulloftricks.com/hypergrid-adventurers-club/&lt;/ref&gt;

The TAFE NSW-Western Institute Virtual Tourism Project commenced in 2010 and was funded by the Australian Flexible Learning Framework's eLearning Innovations Project. It is focused on developing virtual worlds learning experiences for TVET Tourism students and located on the joycadiaGrid.&lt;ref&gt;TAFE-NSW Virtual Tourism Project: http://jokaydia.com/2010/07/20/wit-jokaydiagrid/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomous learning===
Virtual worlds offer exceptional opportunities for [[Self-paced instruction|autonomous learning]]. The video ''Language learning in Second Life: an Introduction'' by Helen Myers (Karelia Kondor in SL) is a good illustration of an adult learner's experiences of her introduction to SL and in learning Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Myers H. ''Language learning in Second Life: an Introduction'': http://kareliakondor.blip.tv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tandem learning (buddy learning)===
[[Tandem learning]], or buddy learning, takes autonomous learning one step further. This form of learning involves two people with different native languages working together as a pair in order to help one another to improve their language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Little D. (2001) "Learner autonomy and the challenge of tandem language learning via the Internet". In Chambers A. &amp; Davies G. (eds.) ''Information and Communications Technology: a European perspective'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger&lt;/ref&gt; Each partner helps the other through explanations in the foreign language. As this form of learning is based on communication between members of different language communities and cultures, it also facilitates [[intercultural learning]]. A tandem learning group, Teach You Teach Me (Language Buddies), can be found in Second Life.

===Holodecks===
The term [[holodeck]] derives from the ''Star Trek'' TV series and feature films, in which a holodeck is depicted as an enclosed room in which simulations can be created for training or entertainment. Holodecks offer exciting possibilities of calling up a range of instantly available simulations that can be used for entertainment, presentations, conferencing and, of course, teaching and learning. For example, if students of hospitality studies are being introduced to the language used in checking in at a hotel a simulation of a hotel reception area can be generated instantly by selecting the chosen simulation from a holodeck ''rezzer'', a device that stores and generates different scenarios. Holodecks can also be used to encourage students to describe a scene or to even build a scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nergiz |last=Kern |title=Holodecks and language learning |url=http://slexperiments.edublogs.org/2009/04/22/holodecks-and-language-learning  |work=Teaching in Second Life - Reflections of a language teacher |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate = 2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Holodecks are commonly used for a range of role-plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Lim |title=Pedagogy, Education and Innovation in 3-D Virtual Worlds |url=http://journals.tdl.org/jvwr/article/view/424/466 |work= Journal of Virtual Worlds Research |date=April 2009 |accessdate = 2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CAVE technology===
A [[cave automatic virtual environment]] (CAVE) is an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment where projectors are directed to three, four, five or six of the walls of a room-sized cube. The CAVE is a large theatre that sits in a larger room. The walls of the CAVE are made up of rear-projection screens, and the floor is made of a down-projection screen. High-resolution projectors display images on each of the screens by projecting the images onto mirrors which reflect the images onto the projection screens. The user will go inside the CAVE wearing special glasses to allow the 3D graphics that are generated by the CAVE to be seen. With these glasses, people using the CAVE can actually see objects floating in the air, and can walk around them, getting a realistic view of what the object would look like when they walk around it.

O'Brien, Levy &amp; Orich (2009) describe the viability of CAVE and PC technology as environments for assisting students to learn a foreign language and to experience the target culture in ways that are impossible through the use of other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, M., Levy R. &amp; Orich, A. (2009) "Virtual Immersion: The Role of CAVE and PC Technology", ''CALICO Journal'' 26, 2: https://www.calico.org/memberBrowse.php?action=article&amp;id=746&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice chat===
Earlier virtual worlds, with the exception of ''Traveler'' (1996), offered only text chat. Voice chat was a later addition.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Kathleen (2006) "Voice Chat Comes to Online Games", ''Wired'', 7 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Second Life did not introduce voice capabilities until 2007. Prior to this, independent [[VoIP]] systems, e.g. [[Ventrilo]], were used. Second Life's current internal voice system has the added ability to reproduce the effect of distance on voice loudness, so that there is an auditory sense of space amongst users.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Other virtual worlds, such as ''[[Twinity]]'', also offer internal voice systems. Browser-based 3D virtual environments tend to only offer text-chat communication, although voice chat seems likely to become more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Seiler, Joey (2009) "Vivox Launches Toolbar For Browser-Based Voice Chat", ''EngageDigital'', 18 March 2009: http://www.engagedigital.com/blog/2009/03/18/vivox-launches-toolbar-for-browserbased-voice-chat/&lt;/ref&gt; Vivox&lt;ref&gt;Vivox online communications services: http://www.vivox.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the leading integrated voice platform for the social web, providing a Voice Toolbar for developers of virtual worlds and multiplayer games. Vivox is now spreading into OpenSim at an impressive rate, e.g. Avination is offering in-world Vivox voice at no charge to its residents and region renters, as well as to customers who host private grids with the company.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2011) "Avination first with Vivox voice on OpenSim", ''Hypergrid Business'', 11 March 2011: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2011/03/avination-first-opensim-grid-to-offer-vivox-voice/&lt;/ref&gt; English Grid began offering language learning and voice chat for language learners using Vivox in May, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2011)"English learning grid launched" May 7, 2012: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/05/english-learning-grid-launched/&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of voice chat in Second Life in 2007 was a major breakthrough. Communicating with one's voice is the ''sine qua non'' of language learning and teaching, but voice chat is not without its problems. Many Second Life users report on difficulties with voice chat, e.g. the sound being too soft, too loud or non-existent – or continually breaking up. This may be due to glitches in the Second Life software itself, but it is often due to individual users' poor understanding of how to set up audio on their computers and/or of inadequate bandwidth. A separate voice chat channel outside Second Life, e.g. [[Skype]], may in such cases offer a solution.

==Owning and renting land in virtual worlds==
Owning or renting land in a virtual world is necessary for educators who wish to create learning environments for their students. Educators can then use the land to create permanent structures or temporary structures embedded within [[#Holodecks|holodecks]], for example the EduNation Islands in Second Life.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The land can also be used for students undertaking building activities. Students may also use public sandboxes, but they may prefer to exhibit their creations more permanently on owned or rented land.

Some language teaching projects, for example NIFLAR, may be implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The Immersive Education Initiative revealed (October 2010) that it would provide free permanent virtual world land in OpenSim for one year to every school and non-profit organization that has at least one teacher, administrator, or student in attendance of any Immersive Education Initiative Summit.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2010) "Initiative: free land for educators migrating from Second Life", ''Hypergrid Business'', 15 October 2010:
http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2010/10/initiative-free-land-for-educators-migrating-from-second-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative 3D worlds==
Many islands in Second Life have language- or culture-specific communities that offer language learners easy ways to practise a foreign language (Berry 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Berry C. D (2009) [http://news.rutgers.edu/focus/issue.2009-04-06.1814922901/article.2009-04-07.1692917645 "Virtual reality and high-tech simulations breathe second life into language classes"], ''Focus'', Rutgers University: USA, NJ. Retrieved 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Second Life is the widest-used 3D world among members of the language teaching community, but there are many alternatives. General-purpose virtual environments such as Hangout and browser-based 3D environments such as ExitReality and 3DXplorer offer 3D spaces for social learning, which may also include language learning. [[Google Street View]] and [[Google Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Language Resource Center at UNC Charlotte |title=Google Earth Activities for Foreign Language Classes |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2496396767023982994&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=true |work=Presentation at Instructional Technology Showcase |date=2007-10-11 |accessdate = 2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also have a role to play in language learning and teaching.

''Twinity'' replicates the real life cities of Berlin, Singapore, London and Miami, and offers language learners virtual locations with specific languages being spoken. Zon has been created specifically for learners of Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Zon: A multiplayer, online learning environment designed to teach Chinese language and culture through gameplay: http://enterzon.com/&lt;/ref&gt; English Grid&lt;ref&gt;English Grid: http://englishgrid.com&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed by education and training professionals as a research platform for delivering English language instruction using opensim.

[[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]] is employed as free open source standalone software, thus enabling a decentralized configuration of all educators, trainers, and users. Scott Provost, Director at the Free Open University, Washington DC, writes: "The advantage of Standalone is that Asset server and Inventory server are local on the same server and well connected to your sim. With Grids that is never the case. With Grids/Clouds that is never the case. On OSGrid with 5,000 regions and hundreds of users scalability problems are unavoidable. We plan on proposing 130,000 Standalone mega regions (in US schools) with Extended UPnP Hypergrid services. The extended services would include a suitcase or limited assets that would be live on the client".&lt;ref&gt;Immersive Worlds Tool Ranking: http://immersive-worlds-tool-ranking.grouply.com/message/474&lt;/ref&gt; Such a standalone sim offers 180,000 prims for building, and can be distributed pre-configured together with a virtual world viewer using a USB storage stick or SD card. Pre-configured female and male avatars can also be stored on the stick, or even full-sim builds can be downloaded for targeted audiences without virtual world experience. This is favorable for introductory users who want a sandbox on demand and have no clue how to get started.

There is no shortage of choices of virtual world platforms. The following lists describe a variety of different virtual world platforms, their features and their target audiences:

==Beyond virtual worlds==
Virtual World Language Learning is a rapidly expanding field and it converges with other closely related areas, such as the use of MMOGs, SIEs and Augmented Reality Language Learning (ARLL).

===Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs)===
MMOGs (massively multiplayer online games) are also used to support language learning, for example the World of Warcraft in School project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wowinschool.pbworks.com/w/page/5268731/FrontPage|title=World of Warcraft in School / FrontPage|publisher=WoWinSchool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic immersive environments (SIEs)===
SIEs are engineered 3D virtual spaces that integrate online gaming aspects.  They are specifically designed for educational purposes and offer learners a collaborative and constructionist environment. They also allow the creators/designers to focus on specific skills and pedagogical objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes J., Oskoz A. &amp; Thorne S. (2008) "Web 2.0, Synthetic Immersive Environments, and Mobile Resources for Language Education", ''CALICO Journal'' 25, 3: pp. 528-546: https://calico.org/html/article_715.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augmented reality language learning (ARLL)===
[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is the combination of real-world and computer-generated data so that computer generated objects are blended into real time projection of real life activities. Mobile AR applications, such as Blippar, [[Layar]] and [[Wikitude]] enable immersive and information-rich experiences in the real world and are therefore blurring the differences between real life and virtual worlds. This has important implications for m-Learning ([[Mobile Assisted Language Learning]]), but hard evidence on how AR is used in language learning and teaching is difficult to come by.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers H. (2009) "Augmented Reality Language Learning – virtual worlds meet m-learning", Avatar Languages Blog: http://www.avatarlanguages.com/blog/arll/&lt;/ref&gt;

The main aim is to promote social integration among users located in the same physical space, so that multiple users may access to a shared space which is populated by virtual objects while remaining grounded in the real world. In other words, it means:
*Communication
*Locked view
*Keep control
*Security

Several units of volume are used in [[petroleum engineering]].

==Units==

{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="2"|Unit!!Thousand!!Million!!Billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;)
|-
|[[cubic meter]]||m3||E3m3 (sometimes referred to as a "dec") ||E6m3||
|-
|[[Barrel (volume)|barrel]]||bbl||Mbbl||MMbbl||
|-
|[[Standard cubic feet]]||scf||Mscf||MMscf||Bcf
|}

==Conversion factors==
*Oil conversion factor from m³ to bbl (or stb) is 6.28981100
*Gas conversion factor from standard m³ to scf is 35.314666721

Note that the m³ gas conversion factor takes into account a difference in the standard temperature base for measurement of gas volumes in metric and imperial units. The standard temperature for metric measurement is 15&amp;nbsp;degrees Celsius (i.e. 59&amp;nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit) while for English measurement the standard temperature is 60 °F. Gas undergoes a slight expansion when the temperature is raised from 15 °C (59 °F) to 60 °F and this expansion is built into the above factor for gas.

The ''standard'' temperature and pressure (STP) for gas varies depending on the particular code being used.&lt;ref&gt;A good discussion can be found on http://www.chemeurope.com/lexikon/e/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure/&lt;/ref&gt; It is just as important to know the standard pressure as the temperature. Formerly, OPEC used 101.325 kPa (14.696 psia) but now the standard is 101.560 kPa (14.73 psia).

'''The Wexner Graduate Fellowship Program''' supports [[Postgraduate education|graduate student]]s planning a career related to [[Judaism]].   The program selects 20 students preparing for careers in the [[Rabbi|rabbinate]], the cantorate, academic Jewish studies, and Jewish communal service.  Wexner Graduate Fellowships are given to students who are strongly committed to the Jewish community, have exceptional academic records, and show potential to become [[Leadership|leader]]s.  

Each fellow receives $20,000 a year for up to three years to finance their education. Fellows participate in annual institutes where leadership seminars enhance the skills of emerging Jewish professionals.  Graduate Fellowship Alumni continue meeting and building a network throughout their careers.

Applicants for Wexner Graduate Fellowships represent an [[Elite|elite group]] within the [[American Jews|American Jewish community]].  They are the most accomplished candidates for professional Jewish leadership training in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.policyarchive.org/bitstream/handle/10207/10368/RoadToLeadership.pdf?sequence=1 "The Road To Jewish Leadership" by Jonathan D.

The '''Wildenstein Institute''' is a French art institute that publishes [[Catalogue raisonné|catalogues raisonnés]] and scholarly inventories.  

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1970 by [[Daniel Wildenstein]] as the ''Fondation Wildenstein'', and it was renamed the Wildenstein Institute in 1990. It is an offshoot of the art dealing company ([[Wildenstein &amp; Co.]]) owned by the Wildenstein family for five generations.

It houses the historic documents and photographic archives assembled by Nathan Wildenstein (the company founder) and his son [[Georges Wildenstein|Georges]], which have been added to by subsequent generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/special_sites/wildenstein/printer.asp?page=3|title=The Wildenstein Institute|publisher=Christies|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Wildenstein established the [[Wildenstein Index Number]] used by the Institute to identify paintings.

It publishes catalogues raisonnés and scholarly inventories of impressionists such as Monet, and other modern artists such as Gauguin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-buying-art-dealer-wildenstein8217s-manhattan-headquarters-1391049030?tesla=y|title=Qatar Buying Art Dealer Wildenstein's Manhattan Headquarters|last=Maloney|first=Jennifer|date=29 January 2014|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes itself as a center for research in art history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=accueil&amp;lang=en Institute web site]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently headed by [[Guy Wildenstein]].

==Controversy==
The Institute publishes a Monet catalogue raisonné and is regarded as the "official" authenticator of Monet paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tom-flynn.blogspot.com/2011/07/exclusive-more-on-monet-rejected-by.html|title=More on the Monet rejected by the Wildenstein Institute|last=Flynn|first=Tom|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance of a Monet by the Institute significantly increases the commercial value of a painting. The Institute controversially refused to authenticate ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' after an investigation by [[Fiona Bruce]] (a journalist) and [[Philip Mould]] (an art dealer and historian) in the BBC television programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'', which first aired on 19 June 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF"&gt;{{Cite episode

In 2011, a police raid discovered and seized 30 paintings valued at tens of millions of pounds from the Institute's Paris headquarters (see: [[Guy Wildenstein#Criticism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8301627/Artworks-worth-millions-seized-from-Wildenstein-Institute.html|title=Artworks worth millions seized from Wildenstein Institute|last=Samuel|first=Henry|date=2 February 2011|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
