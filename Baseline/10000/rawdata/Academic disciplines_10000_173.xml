The '''Research School of Physics and Engineering''' (RSPE) was established with the creation of the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) in 1947. Located at the ANU's main campus in [[Canberra]], the school is one of the four founding research schools in the ANU's [[Australian National University#The Institute of Advanced Studies|Institute of Advanced Studies]].

As part of the Institute of Advanced Studies it is primarily a research school with limited interaction with the ANU's undergraduate students. With a total of around 200 employees the school has approximately 60 PhD students and 70 academic staff. The school is divided into separate research departments although PhD students can often be based in more than one department.&lt;ref name=webpage&gt;{{cite web

==Research==
RSPE is one of the leading physics research institutions in Australia. Major research facilities at the school include the '''[[14UD]]''' [[NEC]] [[Pelletron]] [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]] and associated modular [[superconducting]] [[linac]] run by the Department of Nuclear Physics, the [[H-1NF]] flexible [[Stellarator]] [[Heliac]] run by the Plasma Research Laboratory plus an extensive range of smaller experimental and computational equipment. 

Research ranges from the fundamental to the applied, including both experimental and theoretical work. The school's primary research areas are: materials science and engineering; lasers, nonlinear optics and photonics; nanotechnology and mesoscopic physics; physics of atoms, molecules and the nucleus; plasma physics and surface science; physics and the environment.&lt;ref name=webpage/&gt;

The nuclear physics 14UD is one of a handful of large [[Van de Graaff generator|Van de Graaff]] accelerators in the world. It was the largest machine of its type when installed in 1974. After many upgrades the 14UD is capable of running terminal voltage of up 16.7 MV. Charging is via three inductive charging chains. In 1996 a superconducting RF linac was installed that is used as an energy booster for the 14UD enabling higher energies to be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[Image:Homopolar anu-MJC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The remains of the RSPhysSE 500MJ homopolar generator]]
[[Image:2mv accelerator-MJC01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|2 MeV "High Voltage" Van de Graaff linear accelerator built in 1960]]
[[Mark Oliphant|Sir Mark Oliphant]] was the founder of the School and its first Director from 1950 to 1963. The school was originally called the "Research School of Physical Sciences" with "Engineering" being added to its title in 1990 to highlight the large amount of engineering work that is undertaken in the school. The name was again changed in 2008 to the "Research School of Physics and Engineering" to coincide with the merger with ANU's undergraduate physics teaching department.

For much of the early years the focus of a large part of the school was designing, re-designing and building a cyclo-synchrotron that in its final intended form was to produce a beam of 10.6 [[GeV]] protons for nuclear physics research. Designed to be a world class research machine it was referred to within the school as "The Big Machine". Due to shifting goalposts and huge costs the cyclo-synchrotron was never completed. The small 7.7 [[MeV]] [[cyclotron]] designed to function as the proton injector was completed in 1955, and the large [[homopolar generator]] intended to power the system was first operated in 1962, but by this time work on "The Big Machine" itself had been abandoned.

The homopolar generator, the largest ever built, was capable of supplying [[Current (electricity)|currents]] of over 2 [[megaampere]]s. Even though it was never used for its intended purpose it ended up being used for numerous research projects requiring an extremely high current source until its disassembly in 1986. One of these projects was the invention and development of the [[railgun]] by John Barber and [[Richard Marshall (physicist)|Richard Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Richard (2001). "Railgunnery: Where Have We Been? Where Are We Going?".  ''IEEE Transactions on Magnetics'', '''37''' (1), 440–444.&lt;/ref&gt;  The school also benefited in an indirect way from the construction of the massive generator, the accumulated engineering experience and techniques where later used to build other research equipment around the school including the Plasma Physics [[H-1NF|H1NF Heliac]]. Some parts of the homopolar generator are now on permanent display on the lawn outside the research school.

The school has been home to many different particle accelerators over the years. The first accelerator installed was a 1.25 MV Cockcroft-Walton known as HT1, this was in use from 1952 until 1967 when it was sold to the [[University of New South Wales]]. A second smaller 600 kV Cockcroft-Walton machine (HT2) was assembled in house using many spare parts acquired for HT1. In 1955 the UK government supplied a 33 MeV electron synchrotron as a gift. It was moved to the [[University of Western Australia]] in 1961. During 1960–1980 a HVEC EN tandem accelerator was used by nuclear physics for light ion research. 1975 saw the school's 14UD accelerator come online, which has since been augmented with a [[superconducting]] [[linear accelerator]].

On 5 July 1960 a fire during the night destroyed much of the eastern end of the Cockcroft Building. The damage included the drawing office, many student's and staff's results and files and the control room for the 600 kV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator. The 600 kV accelerator though only water damaged had to be scrapped. Refurbishment of the burnt out area was completed in September 1961.

Early departments that have now been spun off into research schools of their own include the departments of ''Astronomy'' and ''Geophysics and Geochemistry''. Geophysics and Geochemistry separated into the Research School of Earth Sciences in 1973. [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]] became part of the Department of Astronomy in 1957. While part of the school, the Department of Astronomy developed [[Siding Spring Observatory]] and installed many new [[telescope]]s at [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]]. It separated into the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="85961">An '''arbuscular mycorrhiza''' (plural ''mycorrhizae'' or ''mycorrhizas'', a.k.a. ''endomycorrhiza'') is a type of [[mycorrhiza]] in which the [[fungus]] (''AM fungi'', or AMF) penetrates the [[Cortex (botany)|cortical]] cells of the roots of a [[vascular plant]]. 
(Not to be confused with [[ectomycorrhiza]] or [[ericoid mycorrhiza]].)
 
Arbuscular mycorrhizas are characterized by the formation of unique structures, arbuscules and [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s by fungi of the phylum [[Glomeromycota]]. AM fungi help plants to capture [[nutrient]]s such as [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], [[nitrogen]] and micronutrients from the soil. It is believed that the development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis played a crucial role in the initial colonisation of land by plants and in the evolution of the vascular plants.&lt;ref name=brundrett2002&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brundrett, M.C.|year= 2002|title= Coevolution of roots and mycorrhizas of land plants|journal= New Phytologist|volume= 154|pages= 275–304|doi= 10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00397.x|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that it is quicker to list the plants that do not form endomycorrhizae than those that do.&lt;ref name="Barbour1980"&gt;{{cite book | last=Barbour | first=M.G. | last2=Burk | first2=J.H. | last3=Pitts | first3=W.D. | title=Terrestrial plant ecology |page=118 | publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company | series=Frontiers in Physics | year=1980 | isbn=978-0-8053-0540-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[symbiosis]] is a highly evolved mutualistic relationship found between fungi and plants, the most prevalent plant symbiosis known,&lt;ref name=simon&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Simon, L. |author2=Bousquet, J. |author3=Levesque, C. |author4=Lalonde, M. |year=1993 |title=Origin and diversification of endomycorrhizal fungi and coincidence with vascular land plants |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=363 |pages=67–69 |doi=10.1038/363067a0 |issue=6424 |bibcode=1993Natur.363...67S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AMF is found in 80% of [[vascular plant]] families in existence today.&lt;ref name=schuessler&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schüßler, A. | year=2001 | title=A new fungal phylum, the ''Glomeromycota'': phylogeny and evolution | journal=Mycol.

The tremendous advances in research on mycorrhizal [[physiology]] and [[ecology]] over the past 40 years{{when|date=October 2015}} have led to a greater understanding of the multiple roles of AMF in the ecosystem. This knowledge is applicable to human endeavors of [[ecosystem management]], [[ecosystem restoration]], and [[agriculture]].

==Evolution of mycorrhizal symbiosis==

===Paleobiology===
Both [[paleobiological]] and molecular evidence indicate that AM is an ancient symbiosis that originated at least 460 million years ago. AM symbiosis is ubiquitous among land plants, which suggests that mycorrhizas were present in the early ancestors of extant land plants. This positive association with plants may have facilitated the development of land plants.&lt;ref name="simon"/&gt;

The [[Rhynie chert]] of the lower [[Devonian]] has yielded fossils of the earliest land plants in which AM fungi have been observed.&lt;ref name=remy&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Remy, W. |author2=Taylor, T. |author3=Hass, H. |author4=Kerp, H. |year=1994 |title=Four hundred-million-year-old vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume= 91 |pages=11841–11843 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.25.11841 |pmid=11607500|issue=25|pmc=45331 |bibcode=1994PNAS...9111841R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fossilized plants containing mycorrhizal fungi were preserved in silica.

The [[Early Devonian]] saw the development of terrestrial flora. Plants of the Rhynie chert from the Lower Devonian (400 m.yrs ago) were found to contain structures resembling vesicles and spores of present ''Glomus'' species. Colonized fossil roots have been observed in ''[[Aglaophyton major]]'' and ''[[Rhynia]]'', which are ancient plants possessing characteristics of vascular plants and [[bryophyte]]s with primitive [[protostele|protostelic]] [[rhizome]]s.&lt;ref name=remy /&gt;

Intraradical [[mycelium]] was observed in root intracellular spaces, and arbuscules were observed in the layer thin wall cells similar to palisade [[parenchyma]]. The fossil arbuscules appear very similar to those of existing AMF.&lt;ref name=remy/&gt; The cells containing arbuscules have thickened walls, which are also observed in extant colonized cells.

Mycorrhizas from the [[Miocene]] exhibit a vesicular morphology closely resembling that of present [[Glomerales]]. This conserved morphology may reflect the ready availability of nutrients provided by the plant hosts in both modern and Miocene mutualisms.&lt;ref name=kar&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Kar, R.K., Mandaokar, B.D., Kar, R.|year= 2005|title= Mycorrhizal fossil fungi from the Miocene sediments of Mirozam, Northeast India|journal= Current Science|volume= 89|pages=257–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can be argued that the efficacy of signaling processes is likely to have evolved since the Miocene, and this can not be detected in the fossil record. A finetuning of the signaling processes would improve coordination and nutrient exchange between [[symbiont]]s while increasing the fitness of both the fungi and the plant symbionts.

The nature of the relationship between plants and the ancestors of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is contentious. Two hypotheses are:
* Mycorrhizal symbiosis evolved from a [[parasite|parasitic]] interaction that developed into a mutually beneficial relationship.
* Mycorrhizal fungi developed from [[saprobe|saprobic]] fungi that became endosymbiotic.&lt;ref name=remy/&gt;
Both saprotrophs and biotrophs were found in the Rhynie Chert, but there is little evidence to support either hypothesis.

There is some fossil evidence that suggests that the parasitic fungi did not kill the host cells immediately upon invasion, although a response to the invasion was observed in the host cells. This response may have evolved into the chemical signaling processes required for symbiosis.&lt;ref name=remy/&gt;

In both cases, the symbiotic plant-fungi interaction is thought to have evolved from a relationship in which the fungi was taking nutrients from the plant into a symbiotic relationship where the plant and fungi exchange nutrients.

=== Molecular evidence ===

Increased interest in mycorrhizal symbiosis and the development of sophisticated molecular techniques has led to the rapid development of genetic evidence.  Wang ''et al.'' (2010) investigated plant genes involved in communication with order [[Glomales]] fungal partners (DMI1, DMI3, IPD3).&lt;ref name=wang&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wang, B. |author2=Yeun, L.H. |author3=Xue, Y. |author4=Liu, Y. |author5=Ane, J.M. |author6=Qiu, Y.L. |year=2010 |title=Presence of three mycorrhizal genes in the common ancestor of land plants suggests a key role of mycorrhizas in the colonization of land by plants|journal=[[New Phytologist]]|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03137.x| volume= 186 |pages=514–525 |pmid=20059702|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These three genes could be sequenced from all major clades of modern land plants, including [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, the most basal group, and phylogeny of the three genes proved to agree with then current land plant phylogenies. This implies that mycorrhizal genes must have been present in the common ancestor of land plants, and that they must have been vertically inherited since plants colonized land.&lt;ref name="wang" /&gt;

=== AM fungi and cyanobacteria symbiosis?===

It was revealed that AM fungi have the bacterial type core enzyme (ribonuclease III) of sRNA processing mechanism possibly related with symbiosis, by the result of horizontal gene transfer from cyanobacterial ancestor.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1093/gbe/evy002|pmid=29329439|pmc=5786227|title=Conserved Proteins of the RNA Interference System in the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare Provide New Insight into the Evolutionary History of Glomeromycota|journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|volume=10|issue=1|pages=328–343|year=2018|last1=Lee|first1=Soon-Jae|last2=Kong|first2=Mengxuan|last3=Harrison|first3=Paul|last4=Hijri|first4=Mohamed}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding of genetic fossil inside AM fungi raises the hypothesis of the intimate relationship between AM fungi and cyanobacterial ancestors. At the same time, Geosiphon-Nostoc symbiosis was reported previously.&lt;ref&gt;Alexopolous C, Mims C, Blackwell M. 2004. Introductory mycology, 4th ed . Hoboken (NJ): John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Circadian clock evolution in AM fungi? ===

Surprisingly, despite their long time evolution as underground partner of the plant root of which environment is far from light or temperature fluctuation, AMF still have conserved circadian clock with its activation of fungal circadian oscillator (''frq'') by the blue light, similar to the case of the model circadian fungus ''Neurospora crassa''.&lt;ref name="Lee, SJ. 2018"&gt;Lee, SJ., Kong, M., Morse, D. et al. Expression of putative circadian clock components in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare. Mycorrhiza (2018) https://doi.org/10.1007/s00572-018-0843-y&lt;/ref&gt; The proved conservation of circadian clock and output genes in ''R. irregulare'' opens the door to the study of circadian clocks in the fungal partner of AM symbiosis. The characterized AMF ''frq'' gene by same research &lt;ref name="Lee, SJ. 2018"/&gt; is the first ''frq'' gene identified outgroup of Dikarya, which suggest the ''frq'' gene evolution in fungal kingdom is much older than previously investigated.

== Physiology ==

=== Presymbiosis ===
The development of AM fungi prior to root colonization, known as presymbiosis, consists of three stages: spore germination, hyphal growth, host recognition and [[appressorium]] formation.
;Spore germination
Spores of the AM fungi are thick-walled multi-nucleate resting structures.&lt;ref name=wright/&gt; The germination of the spore does not depend on the plant, as spores have been germinated under experimental conditions in the absence of plants both ''[[in vitro]]'' and in soil. However, the rate of germination can be increased by host root [[exudate]]s.&lt;ref name=douds/&gt; AM fungal spores germinate given suitable conditions of the soil matrix, temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, pH, and phosphorus concentration.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite book | author= Wright S.F.| title=  Management of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi | year=2005 | editors= "Roots and Soil Management: Interactions between roots and the soil." R.W. Zobel &amp; S.F. Wright | location=USA | publisher= American Society of Agronomy | pages= 183–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Hyphal growth
The growth of AM [[hypha]]e through the soil is controlled by host root exudates known as [[strigolactone]]s, and the soil phosphorus concentration.&lt;ref name=akiyama05/&gt;
Low-phosphorus concentrations in the soil increase hyphal growth and branching as well as induce plant exudation of compounds that control hyphal branching intensity.&lt;ref name=douds&gt;Douds, D.D. and Nagahashi, G. 2000. Signalling and Recognition Events Prior to Colonisation of Roots by Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi. In Current Advances in Mycorrhizae Research. Ed. [[G. K. Podila|Podila, G.K.]], Douds, D.D. Minnesota: APS Press. Pp 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nagashi&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nagahashi, G |author2=Douds, D. D. |author3=Abney, G.D.|year= 1996|title= Phosphorus amendment inhibits hyphal branching of VAM fungus Gigaspora margarita directly and indirectly through its effect on root exudation|journal= Mycorrhiza|volume= 6|pages= 403–408|doi= 10.1007/s005720050139|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The branching of AM fungal hyphae grown in phosphorus media of 1 mM is significantly reduced, but the length of the germ tube and total hyphal growth were not affected. A concentration of 10 mM phosphorus inhibited both hyphal growth and branching. This phosphorus concentration occurs in natural soil conditions and could thus contribute to reduced mycorrhizal colonization.&lt;ref name=nagashi/&gt;
&lt;!--comment: this data cannot be correct!--&gt;
;Host recognition
Root exudates from AMF host plants grown in a liquid medium with and without phosphorus have been shown to affect hyphal growth. Spores of [[Gigasporaceae|Gigaspora margarita]] were grown in host plant exudates. Hyphae of fungi grown in the exudates from roots starved of phosphorus grew more and produced tertiary branches compared to those grown in exudates from plants given adequate phosphorus. When the growth-promoting root exudates were added in low concentration, the AM fungi produced scattered long branches. As the concentration of exudates was increased, the fungi produced more tightly clustered branches. At the highest-concentration arbuscules, the AMF structures of phosphorus exchange were formed.&lt;ref name=nagashi/&gt;

This chemotaxic fungal response to the host plants exudates is thought to increase the efficacy of host root colonization in low-phosphorus soils.&lt;ref name=douds/&gt; It is an adaptation for fungi to efficiently explore the soil in search of a suitable plant host.&lt;ref name=nagashi/&gt;

Further evidence that arbuscular mycorrhizal  fungi exhibit host-specific [[chemotaxis]], that enable hyphal growth toward the roots of a potential host plant: Spores of [[Glomus (fungus)|Glomus mosseae]] were separated from the roots of a host plant, nonhost plants, and dead host plant by a membrane permeable only to hyphae. In the treatment with the host plant, the fungi crossed the membrane and always emerged within 800&amp;nbsp;µm of the root, but not in the treatments with nonhost plants and dead plants.&lt;ref name=sbrana&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sbrana, C. |author2=Giovannetti, M.|year= 2005|title= Chemotropism in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae|journal= Mycorrhiza|pmid=16133246|volume= 15|issue=7|pages= 539–545|doi= 10.1007/s00572-005-0362-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecular techniques have been used to understand the signaling pathways between arbuscular mycorrhizae and plant roots. In 2003 it was shown how the AM undergoes physiological changes in the presence of exudates from potential host plant roots, to colonize it. Host plant root exudates trigger and turn on AM fungal genes required for the respiration of spore carbon compounds. In experiments, transcription rate of 10 genes increased half-hour after exposure and at an even greater rate after 1 hour. after 4 hours exposure AM respond with morphological growth. Genes isolated from that time are involved in mitochondrial activity and enzyme production. The fungal respiration rate, measured by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption rate, increased by 30% 3 hours after exposure to root exudates, indicating that host plant root exudates stimulate AMF spore mitochondrial activity. It may be part of a fungal regulatory mechanism that conserves spore energy for efficient growth and the hyphal branching upon receiving signals from a potential host plant.&lt;ref name=tamasloukht&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Tamasloukht, M., Sejalon-Delmas, N., Kluever, A., Jauneau, A., Roux., C., Becard, G., Franken, P.|year= 2003|title= Root Factors Induce Mitochondrial-Related Gene Expression and Fungal Respiration during the Developmental Switch from Asymbiosis to Presymbiosis in the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus Gigaspora rosea|journal= Plant Physiology|volume= 131| pages=1468–1478|doi= 10.1104/pp.012898|pmid= 12644696|issue=3|pmc=166906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Appressorium
When arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae encounter the root of a host plant, an appressorium or 'infection structure' forms on the root epidermis. From this structure hyphae can penetrate into the host's [[parenchyma]] cortex.&lt;ref name=gp&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gianinazzi-Pearson, V.|year= 1996|title= Plant Cell Responses to Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi: Getting to the Roots of the Symbiosis|journal= The Plant Cell|volume= 8|pages= 1871–1883| pmid=12239368|issue=10 |pmc=161321|doi=10.1105/tpc.8.10.1871|jstor=3870236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AM need no chemical signals from the plant to form the appressoria. AM fungi could form appressoria on the cell walls of “ghost” cells in which the [[protoplast]] had been removed to eliminate signaling between the fungi and the plant host. However, the hyphae did not further penetrate the cells and grow in toward the root cortex, which indicates that signaling between symbionts is required for further growth once appressoria are formed.&lt;ref name=douds/&gt;

===Symbiosis===
Once inside the parenchyma, the fungus forms highly branched structures for nutrient exchange with the plant called "arbuscules".&lt;ref name=gp/&gt; These are the distinguishing structures of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus. Arbuscules are the sites of exchange for phosphorus, carbon, water, and other nutrients.&lt;ref name=wright/&gt;  There are two forms: [[Paris type|''Paris'' type]] is characterized by the growth of [[hyphae]] from one cell to the next; and [[Arum type|''Arum'' type]] is characterized by the growth of hyphae in the space between plant cells.&lt;ref name="armstrong" &gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3761710 | title = The Interface between the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus Glomus intraradices and Root Cells of Panax quinquefolius: A Paris-Type Mycorrhizal Association | year = 2002 |author1=Lara Armstrong |author2=R.

The host plant exerts a control over the intercellular hyphal proliferation and arbuscule formation. There is a decondensation of the plant's [[chromatin]], which indicates increased transcription of the plant's [[DNA]] in arbuscule-containing cells.&lt;ref name=gp/&gt; Major modifications are required in the plant host cell to accommodate the arbuscules. The [[vacuole]]s shrink and other cellular [[organelle]]s proliferate. The plant cell [[cytoskeleton]] is reorganized around the arbuscules.

There are two other types of hyphae that originate from the colonized host plant root. Once colonization has occurred, short-lived runner hyphae grow from the plant root into the soil. These are the hyphae that take up phosphorus and micronutrients, which are conferred to the plant. AM fungal hyphae have a high surface-to-volume ratio, making their absorptive ability greater than that of plant roots.&lt;ref name=tuomi&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tuomi, J. |author2=Kytoviita, M. |author3=Hardling, R.|year= 2001|title = Cost efficiency of nutrient acquisition of mycorrhizal symbiosis for the host plant|journal= Oikos | volume = 92| pages = 62–70|doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.920108.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMF hyphae are also finer than roots and can enter into pores of the soil that are inaccessible to roots.&lt;ref name=bolan&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bolan, N.S.|year= 1991|title= A critical review of the role of mycorrhizal fungi in the uptake of phosphorus by plants|journal= Plant and Soil|volume= 134|pages= 189–207|doi= 10.1007/BF00012037|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third type of AMF hyphae grows from the roots and colonizes other host plant roots. The three types of hyphae are morphologically distinct.&lt;ref name=wright/&gt;

===Nutrient uptake and exchange===
AM fungi are [[obligate symbiont]]s. They have limited [[saprobic]] ability and depend on the plant for their carbon nutrition.&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley, J.L., Smith , S.E., 1983. Mycorrhizal Symbiosis. Academic Press: London.&lt;/ref&gt; AM fungi take up the products of the plant host's photosynthesis as [[hexose]]s.

Carbon transfer from plant to fungi may occur through the arbuscules or intraradical hyphae.&lt;ref name=pfeffer&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pfeffer, P. |author2=Douds D. |author3=Becard, G. |author4=Shachar-Hill, Y.|year= 1999|title= Carbon Uptake and the Metabolism and Transport of Lipids in an Arbuscular Mycorrhiza|journal= Plant Physiology|volume= 120|pages= 587–598|doi= 10.1104/pp.120.2.587|pmid= 10364411|issue=2|pmc=59298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary synthesis from the hexoses by AM occurs in the intraradical [[mycelium]]. Inside the mycelium, hexose is converted to [[trehalose]] and [[glycogen]]. Trehalose and glycogen are carbon storage forms that can be rapidly synthesized and degraded and may buffer the intracellular sugar concentrations.&lt;ref name=pfeffer /&gt; The intraradical hexose enters the oxidative [[pentose phosphate pathway]], which produces [[pentose]] for nucleic acids.

[[Lipid]] biosynthesis also occurs in the intraradical mycelium. Lipids are then stored or exported to extraradical hyphae where they may be stored or metabolized. The breakdown of lipids into hexoses, known as [[gluconeogenesis]], occurs in the extraradical mycelium.&lt;ref name=pfeffer /&gt; Approximately 25% of the carbon translocated from the plant to the fungi is stored in the extraradical hyphae.&lt;ref name=hamel /&gt; Up to 20% of the host plant's carbon may be transferred to the AM fungi.&lt;ref name=pfeffer /&gt; This represents the host plant's considerable carbon investment in [[mycorrhizal network]] and contribution to the below-ground organic carbon pool.

Increasing the plant's carbon supply to the AM fungi increases uptake and transfer of phosphorus from fungi to plant &lt;ref&gt;H. Bücking and Y.Shachar-Hill (2005). ''Phosphate uptake, transport and transfer by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices is stimulated by increased carbohydrate availability'' New Phytologist 165:899–912&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, phosphorus uptake and transfer is lowered when the [[Photosynthesis|photosynthate]] supplied to the fungi is decreased. Species of AMF differ in their abilities to supply the plant with phosphorus.&lt;ref name=smith2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, S. |author2=Smith, A. |author3=Jakobsen, I.|year= 2003|title= Mycorrhizal Fungi Can Dominate Phosphate Supply to Plants Irrespective of Growth Responses|journal= Plant Physiology |volume =133|pages= 16–20|doi= 10.1104/pp.103.024380|pmid= 12970469|issue=1|pmc=1540331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, arbuscular mycorrhizae are poor symbionts, providing little phosphorus while taking relatively high amounts of carbon.&lt;ref name=smith2003 /&gt;

The main benefit of mycorrhizas to plants has been attributed to increased uptake of nutrients, especially phosphorus. This may be due to increased surface area in contact with soil, increased movement of nutrients into mycorrhizae, a modified root environment, and increased storage.&lt;ref name=bolan /&gt; Mycorrhizas can be much more efficient than plant roots at taking up phosphorus. Phosphorus travels to the root or via diffusion and hyphae reduce the distance required for diffusion, thus increasing uptake. The rate of phosphorus flowing into mycorrhizae can be up to six times that of the root hairs.&lt;ref name=bolan /&gt; In some cases, the role of phosphorus uptake can be completely taken over by the mycorrhizal network, and all of the plant's phosphorus may be of hyphal origin.&lt;ref name=smith2003 /&gt; Less is known about the role of [[nitrogen nutrition in the arbuscular mycorrhizal system]] and its impact on the symbiosis and community. While significant advances have been made in elucidating the mechanisms of this complex interaction, much investigation remains to be done.

Mycorrhizal activity increases the phosphorus concentration available in the [[rhizosphere]]. Mycorrhizae lower the root zone [[pH]] by selective uptake of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ([[ammonium]]-ions) and by releasing  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Decreased soil pH increases the solubility of phosphorus precipitates. The hyphal NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake also increases the [[nitrogen]] flow to the plant as the soil's inner surfaces absorb ammonium and distribute it by diffusion.&lt;ref name=hamel&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hamel, C.|title= Impact of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi on N and P cycling in the root zone|journal= Canadian Journal of Soil Science|volume= 84|pages = 383–395|doi=10.4141/S04-004|year=2004|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==

=== Biogeography ===
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are most frequent in plants growing on mineral soils, and are of extreme importance for plants growing in nutrient-deficient substrates such as in [[volcanic soil]] and [[sand dune ecology|sand dune environments]]. The populations of AM fungi is greatest in plant communities with high diversity such as [[tropical rainforest]]s and temperate grasslands where they have many potential host plants and can take advantage of their ability to colonize a broad host range.&lt;ref name=smithread02&gt;Smith, S.E., Read D.J. Mycorrhizal Symbiosis. 2002. Academic Press: London.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lower incidence of mycorrhizal colonization in very arid or nutrient-rich soils. Mycorrhizas have been observed in [[aquatic habitat]]s; however, waterlogged soils have been shown to decrease colonization in some species.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt;
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are found in 80% of plant species &lt;ref name="Smith, Read 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith, Read|first=Sally, DJ|title=Mycorrhizal symbiosis|year=2008|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been surveyed on all continents except Antarctica.&lt;ref name="Opik 2010 233–241"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Opik|first=M|author2=Vanatoa A|author3=Vanatoa E|author4=Moora M|author5=Davidson J|author6=Kalwij JM|author7=Reier U|author8=Zobel M|title=The online database MaarjAM reveals global and ecosystemic distribution patterns in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota)|journal=New Phytologist|year=2010|volume=188|issue=1|pages=233–241|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03334.x|pmid=20561207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kivlin_SBB /&gt; The biogeography of [[glomeromycota]] is influenced by dispersal limitation,&lt;ref name="Lekberg 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lekberg|first=Y|author2=Koide RT |author3=Rohr JR |author4=Aldirch-Wolfe L |author5=Morton JB |title=Role of niche restrictions and dispersal in the composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities|journal=Journal of Ecology|year=2007|volume=95|pages=95–100|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01193.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; environmental factors such as climate,&lt;ref name="Opik 2010 233–241"/&gt; soil series and soil pH,&lt;ref name=Kivlin_SBB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kivlin| first=Stephanie| author2=Christine V.

=== Response to plant communities ===
The specificity, host range, and degree of colonization of mycorrhizal fungi are difficult to analyze in the field due to the complexity of interactions between the fungi within a root and within the system. There is no clear evidence to suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi exhibit specificity for colonization of potential AM host plant species as do fungal [[pathogen]]s for their host plants.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt; This may be due to the opposite selective pressure involved.

In pathogenic relations, the host plant benefits from mutations that prevent colonization, whereas, in a mutualistic symbiotic relationship, the plant benefits from mutation that allow for colonization by AMF.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt; However, plant species differ in the extent and dependence on colonization by certain AM fungi, and some plants may be facultative [[mycotroph]]s, while others may be obligate mycotrophs.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt; Recently, mycorrhizal status has been linked to plant distributions,&lt;ref name="Hempel 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hempel|first=Stefan|author2=Gotzenberger L|author3=Kuhn I|author4=Michalski SG|author5=Rillig M|author6=Zobel M|author7=Moora M|title=Mycorrhizas in the Central European flora – relationships with plant life history traits and ecology|journal=Ecology|year=2013|doi=10.1890/12-1700.1|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1389–1399}}&lt;/ref&gt; with obligate mycorrhizal plants occupying warmer, drier habitats while facultative mycorrhizal plants occupy larger ranges of habitats.

The ability of the same AM fungi to colonize many species of plants has ecological implications. Plants of different species can be linked underground to a common mycelial network.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt; One plant may provide the photosynthate carbon for the establishment of the mycelial network that another plant of a different species can utilize for mineral uptake. This implies that arbuscular mycorrhizae are able to balance below-ground intra–and interspecific plant interactions.&lt;ref name=smithread02 /&gt;

Since Glomeromycota fungi live inside plant roots, they can be influenced substantially by their plant host and in return affect plant communities as well. Plants can allocate up to 30% of their photosynthate carbon to AM fungi &lt;ref name="Drigo 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drigo|first=B|last2=Pijl |first2=AS |last3=Duyts |first3=H |last4=Kielak |first4=AM |last5=Gamper |first5=HA |last6=Houtekamer |first6=MJ |last7=Boschker |first7=HTS |last8=Bodelier |first8=PLE |last9=Whiteley |first9=AS |last10=Veen |first10=JAV |last11=Kowalchuk |first11=GA|title=Shifting carbon flow from roots into associated microbial communities in response to elevated atmospheric CO2|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2010|volume=107|issue=24|pages=10938–10942|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10710938D |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0912421107 |pmid=20534474 |pmc=2890735}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in return AM fungi can acquire up to 80% of plant phosphorus and nitrogen.&lt;ref name="Smith, Read 2008"/&gt; The diversity of AM fungal communities has been positively linked to plant diversity,&lt;ref name="van der Heijden 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Heijden|first=MG|author2=Boller AT|author3=Wiemken A|author4=Sanders IR|title=Different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species are potential determinants of plant community structure|journal=Ecology|year=1998|volume=79|issue=6|pages=2082–2091|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2082:damfsa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; plant productivity&lt;ref name="van der Heijden 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Heijden|first=MGA|author2=Bardgett RD|author3=Van Straalen NM|title=The unseen majority: soil microbes as drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems|journal=Ecology Letters|year=2008|volume=11|pages=296–310|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01139.x|pmid=18047587|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and herbivory.&lt;ref name="Vannette 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vannette|first=RL|author2=Rasmann S|title=Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi mediate below-ground plant–herbivore interactions: a phylogenetic study|journal=Functional Ecology|year=2012|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1033–1042|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02046.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can be influenced by small scale interactions with the local plant community.

=== AM fungi and plant invasion ===

=== Interactions between AM fungi and other plant symbionts ===
All symbionts within a plant host interact, often in unpredictable ways. A 2010 meta-analysis indicated that plants colonized by both AM fungi and vertically transmitted endophytes often are larger than plants independently colonized by these symbionts.&lt;ref name="Larimer 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larimer|first=AL|author2=Bever JD|author3=Clay K|title=The interactive effects of plant microbial symbionts: a review and meta-analysis| journal=Symbiosis|year=2010| volume=51|issue=2|pages=139–148|doi=10.1007/s13199-010-0083-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this relationship is context-dependent as AM fungi can interact synergistically with fungal endophytes inhabiting the leaves of their host plant,&lt;ref name="Novas 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Novas|first=MV|author2=Iannone LJ|author3=Godeas AM|author4=Cabral D|title=Positive association between mycorrhiza and foliar endophytes in a Poa bonariensis|journal=Mycological Progress| year=2009| volume=8| pages=75–81|doi=10.1007/s11557-008-0579-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larimer 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larimer|first=AL|author2=Bever JD|author3=Clay K|title=Consequences of simultaneous interactions of fungal endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi with a shared host grass|journal=Oikos|year=2012|volume=121|issue=12|pages=2090–2096|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20153.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or antagonistically.&lt;ref name="Omacini 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Omacini|first=M|author2=Eggers T|author3=Bonkowski M|author4=Gange AC|author5=Jones TH|title=Leaf endophytes affect mycorrhizal status and growth of co-infected and neighboring plants|journal=Functional Ecology|year=2006|volume=20|issue=2|pages=226–232|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2006.01099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mack 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mack|first=KML|author2=Rudgers JA|title=Balancing multiple mutualists: asymmetric interactions among plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and fungal endophytes|journal=Oikos| year=2008|volume=117|issue=2| pages=310–320| doi=10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15973.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.722.4169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=QH| author2=Parsons AJ| author3=Xue H|author4=Fraser K|author5=Ryan GD|author6=Newman JA|author7=Rasmussen S|title=Competition between foliar Neotyphodium lolii endophytes and mycorrhizal Glomus spp. fungi in Lolium perenne depends on resource supply and host carbohydrate content|journal=Functional Ecology| year=2011| volume=25|issue=4| pages=910–920| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01853.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ranges of interactions can occur between AM fungi and [[ectomycorrhizal fungus|ectomycorrhizal fungi]] and [[dark septate endophytes]].&lt;ref name="Reininger 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reininger|first=V|author2=Sieber TN|title=Mycorrhiza reduces adverse effects of dark septate endophytes (DSE) on growth of conifers|journal=PLOS One|year=2012|volume=7|issue=8|pages=1–10|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0042865|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...742865R|pmid=22900058|pmc=3416760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Response to environmental gradients ===
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many [[environmental gradient]]s. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa.&lt;ref name="Klironomos 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klironomos|first=JN|author2=Hart MM|author3=Gurney JE|author4=Moutoglis P|title=Interspecific differences in the tolerance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to freezing and drying|journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|year=2001|volume=79|issue=10|pages=1161–1166|doi=10.1139/cjb-79-10-1161}}&lt;/ref&gt; AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations,&lt;ref name="Auge 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auge|first=RM|title=Water relations, drought and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis| journal=Mycorrhiza| year=2001|volume=11|pages=3–42|doi=10.1007/s005720100097}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=NC|author2=Rowland DL |author3=Corkidi L |author4=Egerton-Warburton LM |author5=Allen EB |title=Nitrogen enrichment alters mycorrhizal allocation at five mesic to semiarid grasslands|journal=Ecology|year=2003|volume=84|issue=7|pages=1895–1908|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1895:neamaa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=NC|author2=Wilson GWT|author3=Bowker MA|author4=Wilson JA|author5=Miller RM|title=Resource limitation is a driver of local adaptation in mycorrhizal symbioses|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2010|volume=107|issue=5|pages=2093–2098|bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.2093J |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0906710107|pmid=20133855|pmc=2836645}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
AM composition often becomes less diverse on mountain tops than at lower elevations, which is driven by the composition of plant species.&lt;ref name="Gai 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gai|first=JP|author2=Tian H|author3=Yang FY|author4=Christie P|author5=Li XL|author6=Klironomos JN|title=Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal diversity along a Tibetan elevation gradient|journal=Pedobiologia|year=2012|volume=55|issue=3|pages=145–151|doi=10.1016/j.pedobi.2011.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AM fungi have been shown to improve plant tolerance to abiotic environmental factors such as [[salinity]]. They alleviate salt stress and benefit plant growth and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Porcel | first1 = R | last2 = Aroca | first2 = R | last3 = Ruiz-Lozano | first3 = JM | year = 2012 | title = stress alleviation using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

===Rhizosphere ecology===
The [[rhizosphere]] is the soil zone in the immediate vicinity of a root system.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis affects the community and diversity of other organisms in the soil. This can be directly seen by the release of exudates, or indirectly by a change in the plant species and plant exudates type and amount.&lt;ref name=marschner&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marschner, P. |author2=Timonen, S.|year= 2004|title= Interactions between plant species and mycorrhizal colonization on the bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere|journal= Applied Soil Ecology|volume= 28|pages= 23–36|doi= 10.1016/j.apsoil.2004.06.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mycorrhizae diversity has been shown to increase plant species diversity as the potential number of associations increases. Dominant arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can prevent the invasion of non-mycorrhizal plants on land where they have established symbiosis and promote their mycorrhizal host.&lt;ref name=eriksson&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eriksson, A.|year= 2001|title= Arbuscular mycorrhizae in relation to management history, soil nutrients and plant diversity|journal= Plant Ecology|volume= 155|pages=129–137|doi= 10.1023/A:1013204803560|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has shown that AM fungi release an unidentified diffusional factor, known as the '''myc factor''', which activates the [[Nod factor|nodulation factor]]'s inducible gene MtEnod11. This is the same gene involved in establishing symbiosis with the [[Diazotroph|nitrogen fixing]], [[Rhizobia|rhizobial bacteria]] (Kosuta ''et al.'' 2003). When rhizobium bacteria are present in the soil, mycorrhizal colonization is increased due to an increase in the concentration of chemical signals involved in the establishment of symbiosis (Xie ''et al.'' 2003). Molecules similar to Nod factors were isolated from AM fungi and were shown to induce MtEnod11, lateral root formation and enhance mycorrhization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?WO=2010049751 | title=Lipochitooligosaccharides Stimulating Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective mycorrhizal colonization can also increase the [[Root nodule|nodulations]] and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in mycorrhizal legumes.&lt;ref name=hamel /&gt;

The extent of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and species affects the bacterial population in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref name="Schrey-et-al-2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schrey | first1=Silvia D. | display-authors=etal | year=2012 | title=Production of fungal and bacterial growth modulating secondary metabolites is widespread among mycorrhiza-associated streptomycetes | journal=BMC Microbiology | volume=12 | issue=1| pages=164 | doi=10.1186/1471-2180-12-164| pmid=22852578 | pmc=3487804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial species differ in their abilities to compete for carbon compound root exudates. A change in the amount or composition of root exudates and fungal exudates due to the existing AM mycorrhizal colonization determines the diversity and abundance of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref name=marschner /&gt;

The influence of AM fungi on plant root and shoot growth may also have indirect effect on the rhizosphere bacteria. AMF contributes a substantial amount of carbon to the rhizosphere through the growth and degeneration of the hyphal network. There is also evidence to suggest that AM fungi may play an important role on mediating the plant species' specific effect on the bacterial composition of the rhizosphere.&lt;ref name=marschner /&gt;

=== Glomeromycota and global climate change ===
Global climate change is affecting AM fungal communities and interactions between AM fungi and their plant hosts. While it is generally accepted that interactions between organisms will affect their response to global climate change, we still lack the ability to predict the outcome of these interactions in future climates.&lt;ref name="Van der Putten 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van der Putten|first=WH|title=Climate change, Aboveground-belowground interactions and species' range shifts|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|year=2012|volume=43|pages=365–383|doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110411-160423|hdl=20.500.11755/0f7d61b9-e435-4da3-b3d6-3ca115bdbdb5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent meta-analyses, AM fungi were found to increase plant biomass under drought conditions and decrease plant biomass under simulated nitrogen deposition studies.&lt;ref name=Worchel_MicroEcol&gt;{{cite journal|last=Worchel|first=Elise|first2=Hannah E. |last2=Giauque |first3=Stephanie N. |last3=Kivlin|title=Fungal symbionts alter plant drought response|journal=Microbial Ecology|year=2013|volume= 65|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s00248-012-0151-6 |pmid=23250115|pages=671–678}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kivlin 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kivlin|first=SN|author2=Emery SM|author3=Rudgers JA|title=Fungal symbionts alter plant response to global change|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=2013|doi=10.3732/ajb.1200558|pmid=23757444|volume=100|issue=7|pages=1445–1457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi themselves have been shown to increase their biomass in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 &lt;ref name="Treseder 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Treseder|first=KK|title=A meta-analysis of mycorrhizal responses to nitrogen, phosphorus, and atmospheric CO2 in field studies|journal=New Phytologist|year=2004|volume=164|issue=2|pages=347–355|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01159.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants lacking arbuscular mycorrhizae===
Members of the mustard family ([[Brassicaceae]]), such as cabbage, cauliflower, canola, and [[crambe]], do not establish arbuscular mycorrihizal fungi on their roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glomalin | title = Hiding Place for a Third of the World's Stored Soil Carbon | url = | journal = Agricultural Research Journal | volume = | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular genetic analyses of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi==
In the past ten years there have been spectacular advances in molecular genetic technologies and tools. These advances allow microbial and mycorrhizal ecologists to ask new and exciting questions about the ecological and evolutionary roles of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi as individuals, in communities and ecosystems. Genetic analyses of AM fungi have been used to explore the genetic structure of single spores using multilocus genotyping,&lt;ref name=Stukenbrock&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stukenbrock|first=Eva|author2=Rosendahl, Soren|title=Clonal diversity and population genetic structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( Glomus spp.) studied by multilocus genotyping of single spores|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=2005|volume=14|issue=3|pages=743–752|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2005.02453.x|pmid=15723666}}&lt;/ref&gt; AM fungal diversity and adaptation across multiple grassland communities,&lt;ref name=Baoming&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baoming|first=Ji|title=Patterns of diversity and adaptation in Glomeromycota from three prairie grasslands|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=2013|volume=22|issue=9|pages=2573–2587|doi=10.1111/mec.12268|display-authors=etal|pmid=23458035}}&lt;/ref&gt; all the way up to a global investigation of AM fungal diversity, which greatly increased the described molecular diversity within the phylum Glomeromycota.&lt;ref name="Opik 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Opik|first=Maarja|title=Global sampling of plant roots expands the described molecular diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|journal=Mycorrhiza|year=2013|volume=23|issue=5|pages=411–430|doi=10.1007/s00572-013-0482-2|pmid=23422950|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the recent advances in molecular genetics clearly permit the analysis of microbial communities at much finer and functional scales and potentially with more confidence than previous methods. The classical AM fungal identification method of spore extraction from soil and further spore morphological analysis&lt;ref name="johnson 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Nancy|last2=Zak|first2=D.R. |last3=Tilman |first3=D. |last4=Pfleger |first4=F.L|title=Dynamics of vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae during old field succession|journal=Oecologia|year=1991|volume=86|issue=3|pages=349–358|doi=10.1007/bf00317600|pmid=28312920|bibcode=1991Oecol..86..349J}}&lt;/ref&gt; is fraught with complicating issues due to the various strategies and forms of AM fungi, e.g., lack of sporulation in certain species, seasonality, high unculturability, possible misidentification (human error), and new evidence of multi-nucleate spores&lt;ref name="marleau 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marleau|first=Julie|author2=Dalpé, Y.|authorlink2=Yolande Dalpé|author3=St-Arnaud, M.|author4=Hijri, M.|title=Spore development and nuclear inheritance in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=51|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-51|pmid=21349193|pmc=3060866}}&lt;/ref&gt; and high genetic variation within clonal AM species.&lt;ref name=ehinger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehinger|first=Martine O.|author2=Daniel Croll|author3=Alexander M.

Additionally, by following the traditional extraction, culture and microscopic identification methods, there is no way to determine active/functioning AM fungal populations, which are likely the most important when attempting to relate plant-AM symbiotic interactions and mechanisms to ecological or ecosystem function. This is especially true in the case of root colonization analyses, which can determine percentage of roots colonized by AM fungi. The major problem with this analysis is in field soils, which contain multiple species of AM fungi in association with a target plant at the same time (see Ecology of AM). The identification of the associated fungal symbionts is impossible without the use of molecular methods. Though genetic analysis of AM fungal communities has advanced a great deal in the past decade, the methodology is not yet completely refined. Below is an overview of the methods used in molecular genetic analyses of AM fungi, along with applications to research, future directions and some of their problems.

===Overview of methods===

====DNA/RNA====
Genetic analyses of AM fungi from soil and root samples range in their applicability to answer ecological or phylogenetic questions. DNA analyses utilize various nuclear markers to describe AM fungi and represent different regions of the nuclear [[Ribosomal RNA|ribosomal]] operon ([[18S ribosomal RNA|18S rRNA]]) found in all eukaryotic organisms. The DNA analysis of AM fungi using these markers began in the early 1990s&lt;ref name="simon 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=L|author2=Lalonde, M.|author3=Bruns, T.D|title=Specific amplification of 18S fungal ribosomal genes from vesicular-arbuscular endomycorrhizal fungi colonizing roots|journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol.|year=1992|volume=58|pages=291–295}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are continuing to be developed today. The small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, the internal transcribed spacer ([[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS]]) gene, and the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene are currently the most common DNA markers used. The SSU region has been used most frequently in ecological studies,&lt;ref name="helgason 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helgason|first=Thorunn|author2=Fitter, A.H.|author3=Young, J.P.W|title=Molecular diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonising Hyacinthoides non-scripta (bluebell) in a seminatural woodland|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=1999|volume=8|issue=4|pages=659–666|doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.1999.00604.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ITS and LSU regions have been predominantly used in taxonomic constructions of the phylum Glomeromycota.&lt;ref name="redecker 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redecker|first=Dirk|author2=Arthur Schüßler|author3=Herbert Stockinger|author4=Sidney L. Stürmer|author5=Joseph B. Morton|author6=Christopher Walker|title=An evidence-based consensus for the classification of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota)|journal=Mycorrhiza|year=2013|volume=23|issue=7|pages=515–531|doi=10.1007/s00572-013-0486-y|pmid=23558516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====General procedure====
The first step of all molecular genetic analyses is the preparation and/or preservation of a sample. In the case of AM fungi, samples typically come in the form of soil or roots that will contain AM spores, hyphae and/or various AM colonization structures. Sample preservation will vary depending on the desired analysis (DNA or RNA). For analysis of DNA, samples should either be processed immediately or kept frozen prior to nucleic acid extraction. For analysis of RNA, samples should be [[Cryopreservation|cryogenically frozen]] (−196&amp;nbsp;°C) almost immediately upon collection, or stored in an RNA stabilization and preservation reagent (e.g. RNAlater). The next step is to extract the desired nucleic acids from the sample, which can be performed manually using various published extraction methods or by using one of the many commercially available DNA/RNA extraction kits. Due to the labile nature of RNA, synthesis of complementary DNA ([[Complementary DNA|cDNA]]) using extracted RNA as a template is performed for further analysis. For most molecular genetic sequencing methods of AM fungi a PCR step is required to increase the total amount of target DNA/RNA/cDNA. There are many PCR conditions proposed for analysis of AM fungi and some of the most accessible are briefly summarized below.

=====Primer selection for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi=====
One difficulty with the genetic analysis of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has been the selection of ideal, comprehensive, and repeatable primers or primer sets.&lt;ref name=Kohout&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohout|first=Petr|title=Comparison of commonly used primer sets for evaluating arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities: Is there a universal solution?|journal=Soil Biology &amp; Biogeochemistry|date=January 2014|volume=68|pages=482–493|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071713003027|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.08.027|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are four common AM fungal specific markers/primers used in genetic sequencing to describe AM fungal communities in a sample, ideally to species level identification. These sequence markers are designed for the nuclear ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the 18S region and are either used individually or in some combination.&lt;ref name=stockinger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stockinger|first=Herbert|first2=Manuela |last2=Kruger |first3=Arthur |last3=Schüßler|title=DNA barcoding of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|journal=New Phytologist|year=2010|volume=187|issue=2|pages=461–474|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03262.x|pmid=20456046}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partial small subunit (SSU), the partial large subunit (LSU), and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2) are the regions used for genetic sequencing of AMF. Additionally, there are 'primer sets' that incorporate a combination of these different regions into one target primer for AMF, these include the "Krüger&lt;ref name="Kruger 2009" /&gt; " and the "Redecker&lt;ref name=Redecker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redecker|first=Dirk|title=Specific PCR primers to identify arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi within colonized roots|journal=Mycorrhiza|year=2000|volume=10|issue=2|pages=73–80|doi=10.1007/s005720000061}}&lt;/ref&gt;" primers. The "Krüger" primer utilizes the partial SSU, the ITS, and the partial LSU regions, while the "Redecker" primer utilizes the partial SSU and the ITS.

Currently, there is no consensus as to which primers or primer sets, being used with varying degrees of success, repeatability and species-level resolution, are best for molecular genetic analysis of AMF. Additionally, the current advances and coming changes in genetic sequencing technology, e.g. [[Sanger sequencing|Sanger]], to 454 [[pyrosequencing]], to [[Illumina dye sequencing|Illumina]] HiSeq/MiSeq, can force researchers to only use certain primers. The large size of the "Krüger" (~1500bp) and "Redecker" (~900bp) primer sets prohibit use with newer sequencing technology (e.g. Illumina MiSeq) as opposed to 454 pyrosequencing that is capable of these long read lengths. Though Roche Diagnostics has announced the discontinuation of the 454 platform for 2016,&lt;ref name=pyro&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Years After Acquisition, Roche Quietly Shutters 454|date=16 October 2013|website=Bio-IT World|url=http://www.bio-itworld.com/BioIT_Article.aspx?id=131053|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is still commonly used in genetic analyses. Perhaps new 'all-inclusive' AM specific primers should be created to support the new technologies for as descriptive a molecular analysis from the "Kruger" primer set using 454 pyrosqeuncing, as shown below. The reverse may also be true, where molecular technologies should be developed with both long read lengths (which would allow for large primer sets) as well as [[deep sequencing|sequencing depth]].

Kohout et al.&lt;ref name=Kohout /&gt; present a study using all of the aforementioned primers/primer sets on identical plant samples using 454 sequencing analysis. Results of their experiment are summarized below.

**"Kruger" primers yielded relatively higher diversity parameters than other comparable primers (LSU, ITS2)
**"Kruger" primers showed significantly higher Shannon diversity measures than did SSU primer
**"Redecker" primers yielded the most different, but maybe most descriptive community composition of all primers tested. This may be explained by the ability of the "Redecker" primers to find less abundant AMF lineages such as the Claroideoglomeraceae or the Paraglomeraceae
**LSU primers had a strong bias towards Glomeraceae, excluding other families
**SSU primers had a bias towards Glomeraceae and underestimated the presence of different families within the Glomeromycota, including the Claroideoglomeraceae, Diversisporaceae and Paraglomeraceae

MOTU = Molecular operational taxonomic unit, synonymous with OTU or phylotype.

====qPCR and qRT-PCR====
[[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|Real-time PCR]] or quantitative PCR (qPCR), is becoming a well-established method to quickly amplify and simultaneously quantify targeted AM fungal DNA from biological samples (plant roots or soils). Fairly recent developments in qPCR markers allow researchers to explore the relative abundance of AM fungal species within roots in greenhouse experiments as well as in the field to identify local AM fungal communities.

qPCR markers for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi will consist of AM specific primers and fluorescently labeled hydrolysis probes. These AM specific primers (discussed above) can be chosen by the researcher and this decision is typically guided by the question at hand, resources available, and willingness to troubleshoot in the lab.

====Microarray====
[[DNA microarray]] analysis is currently being used in AM fungal research to simultaneously measure the expression of many genes from target species or experimental samples. The most common tool or method is to use functional gene array (FGA) technology, a specialized microarray that contains probes for genes that are functionally important in microbial processes such as carbon, nitrogen or phosphorus cycling. FGAs have the ability to simultaneously examine many functional genes.&lt;ref name="he 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Zhili|author2=Joy D. VAN NOSTRAND|author3=Ye DENG|author4=Jizhong ZHOU|title=Development and applications of functional gene microarrays in the analysis of the functional diversity, composition, and structure of microbial communities|journal=Front. Environ. Sci. Eng. China|year=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1007/s11783-011-0301-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is typically used for general analysis of functional microbial genes, but when complemented with genetic sequencing, inferences can be made about the connection between fungal community composition and microbial functionality.

====[[Phospholipid-derived fatty acids|PLFA]]/NLFA====
Specific organismal chemical signatures can be used to detect biomass of more cryptic organisms, such as AM fungi or soil bacteria. Lipids, more specifically phospholipids and neutral lipids, contain fatty acids connected to a glycerol backbone. The fatty acid composition of organisms varies, and the proportions of specific fatty acids can be organism specific. For example, in AM fungi the proportion of the fatty acids, 16:1ω5 and 18:1ω7, in the phospholipid portion account for approximately 58% of total fatty acid composition.&lt;ref name="olsson 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olsson|first=Pal Axel|title=Signature fatty acids provide tools for determination of the distribution and interactions of mycorrhizal fungi in soil|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|year=1999|volume=29|issue=4|pages=303–310|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.1999.tb00621.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fatty acid, 16:1ω5 is the most commonly used acid to characterize AM fungi in soils and can be used as a strong indicator of mycelial biomass in soil sample.&lt;ref name="olsson 1999" /&gt;

Neutral lipid fatty acid analysis of AM fungi is typically looked upon as a method to indicate energy storage, but most importantly, the ratio of NLFA (16:1ω5) to PLFA (16:1ω5) can potentially be used to indicate nutritional status of AM fungi in soils. Energy is mainly stored in AM fungi as neutral lipids in storage structures like spores and vesicles. Because of this NLFA correlates quite well with the number of spores in a given volume of soil.&lt;ref name="olsson 1999" /&gt; The ratio of NLFA concentration to PLFA concentration (active mycelia) can then give the proportion of carbon allocated to storage structures (spores, measured as NLFA).

Problems with lipid fatty acid analyses include the incomplete specificity of fatty acids to AM fungi, the species- or genera-specific variation in fatty acid composition can complicate analysis in systems with multiple AM fungal species (e.g. field soil), the high background levels of certain fatty acid concentration in soils, and that phospholipids are correlated to an organism's membrane area, and the surface to volume ratio can vary widely between organisms such as bacteria and fungi.&lt;ref name=schnurer&gt;{{cite journal|last=J.|first=Schnürer|author2=Clarholm, M.|author3=Rosswall, T|title=Microbial biomass and activity in an agricultural soil with different organic matter contents|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|year=1985|volume=17|issue=5|pages=611–618|doi=10.1016/0038-0717(85)90036-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; More work must be done to identify the efficacy of this method in field soils with many genera and species of AM fungi to discern the methods ability to discriminate between many varying fatty acid compositions.

===Future research directions with AM fungi===
An exciting prospect for future analysis of AM fungi is the use of stable isotope probes. Stable isotope probing ([[Stable isotope|SIP]]) is a technique that can be used to determine the active metabolic function of individual taxa within a complex system of microbes. This level of specificity, linking microbial function and phylogenetics, has not been achieved previously in microbial ecology. This method can also be used independently of classical culture methods in microbial ecology, allowing for ''in situ'' analysis of functional microbes.

====Stable Isotope Probing (SIP)====
SIP, more explicitly DNA/RNA-based SIP, uses stable-isotope enriched substrates, such as &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, and then analyzes the 'labeled' markers using species specific DNA or RNA markers.&lt;ref name="dumont 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dumont|first=Marc G.|author2=Murrell, Colin J.|title=Stable isotope probing – linking microbial identity to function|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|year=2005|volume=3|issue=6|pages=499–504|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1162|pmid=15886694}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of labeled DNA is performed by separating unlabeled and labeled DNA on a cesium chloride gradient formed in an ultra centrifuge.&lt;ref name="schwartz 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Egbert|title=Characterization of growing microorganisms in soil by stable isotope probing with H218O|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2007|volume=73|issue=8|pages=2541–2546|doi=10.1128/AEM.02021-06|pmid=17322324|pmc=1855593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because all microbial organisms are capable of importing water into their cells, the use of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O stable isotope probing is a very exciting new method that can shed light on questions microbial ecologists and biologists have struggled with answering for years, in particular, what are the '''active''' microbial organisms in my system? The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, or heavy water method will target all organisms that are actively growing, and induce little influence on growth itself. This would be especially true with most greenhouse experiments with arbuscular mycorrhizas because plants must be watered anyway, and water does not directly select for organisms with specific metabolic pathways,&lt;ref name="schwartz 2007" /&gt; as would happen when using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N.

Little has been done with this method in arbuscular mycorrhizal experiments, but if proven to work in a controlled experiment, and with further refinement of DNA/RNA fungal community analyses techniques, this may be a viable option to very specifically determine the actively growing portion of AM fungal species across growing seasons, with different plant hosts or treatments, and in the face of climate change.

====sRNA and sRNA processing mechanism to understand AM symbiosis====
sRNAs have been reported to take crucial role in the crosstalk between host and symbiont.&lt;ref&gt;Formey D, et al.   2016. Regulation of small RNAs and corresponding targets in Nod factor-induced Phaseolus vulgaris root hair cells. Int J Mol Sci . 176:887.&lt;/ref&gt; sRNAs processing mechanism is thus, important for understanding AM symbiosis. It seems that AM fungi have their unique features to have bacterial type core enzyme as well as the large number of Argonaute proteins in their sRNA processing system (or RNAi system).&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; sRNA and sRNA processing mechanism research is also exciting topic to understand AM fungi symbiosis.

==Phytoremediation==
{{Main|Phytoremediation}}
Disturbance of native plant communities in [[desertification]]-threatened areas is often followed by degradation of physical and biological soil properties, soil structure, nutrient availability, and organic matter. When restoring disturbed land, it is essential to replace not only the above ground vegetation but also biological and physical soil properties.&lt;ref name=jeffries2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jeffries, P. |author2=Gianinazzi, S. |author3=Perotto, S. |author4=Turnau, K. |author5=Barea, J. |year= 2003|title= The Contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in sustainable maintenance of plant health and soil fertility|journal= Biology and Fertility of Soils|volume= 37|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively new approach to restoring land is to inoculate soil with AM fungi when reintroducing vegetation in ecological restoration projects (phytoremediation). It has enabled host plants to establish themselves on degraded soil and improve soil quality and health. Soils' quality parameters were significantly improved long-term when a mixture of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species was introduced compared to noninoculated soil and soil inoculated with a single exotic species of AM fungi.&lt;ref name=jeffries2003 /&gt; The benefits were increased plant growth, increased phosphorus uptake and soil nitrogen content, higher soil organic matter content, and soil aggregation, attributed to higher legume nodulation in the presence of AMF, better water infiltration, and soil aeration due to soil aggregation.&lt;ref name=jeffries2003 /&gt;

==Agriculture==
Many modern agronomic practices are disruptive to mycorrhizal symbiosis. There is great potential for low-input agriculture to manage the system in a way that promotes mycorrhizal symbiosis.

Conventional agriculture practices, such as [[tillage]], heavy fertilizers and [[fungicide]]s, poor crop rotations, and selection for plants that survive these conditions, hinder the ability of plants to form symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

Most agricultural crops can perform better and are more productive when well-colonized by AM fungi. AM symbiosis increases the phosphorus and micronutrient uptake and growth of their plant host (George ''et al.'' 1992).

Management of AM fungi is especially important for organic and low-input agriculture systems where soil phosphorus is, in general, low, although all [[agroecosystem]]s can benefit by promoting arbuscular mycorrhizae establishment.

Some crops that are poor at seeking out nutrients in the soil are very dependent on AM fungi for phosphorus uptake. For example, [[flax]], which has poor chemotaxic ability, is highly dependent on AM-mediated phosphorus uptake at low and intermediate soil phosphorus concentrations (Thingstrup ''et al.'' 1998).

Proper management of AMF in the agroecosystems can improve the quality of the soil and the productivity of the land. Agricultural practices such as reduced tillage, low phosphorus fertilizer usage, and perennialized cropping systems promote functional mycorrhizal symbiosis.

===Tillage===
[[Tillage]] reduces the inoculation potential of the soil and the efficacy of mycorrhizaes by disrupting the extraradical hyphal network (Miller ''et al.'' 1995, McGonigle &amp; Miller 1999, Mozafar ''et al.'' 2000).

By breaking apart the soil macro structure, the hyphal network is rendered non-infective (Miller ''et al.'' 1995, McGonigle &amp; Miller 1999). The disruption of the hyphal network decreases the absorptive abilities of the mycorrhizae because the surface area spanned by the hyphae is greatly reduced. This, in turn, lowers the phosphorus input to the plants that are connected to the hyphal network (Figure 3, McGonigle &amp; Miller 1999).

In reduced-tillage system, heavy phosphorus fertilizer input may not be required as compared to heavy-tillage systems. This is due to the increase in mycorrhizal network, which allows mycorrhizae to provide the plant with sufficient phosphorus (Miller ''et al.'' 1995).

===Phosphorus fertilizer===
The benefits of AMF are greatest in systems where inputs are low. Heavy usage of phosphorus fertilizer can inhibit mycorrhizal colonization and growth.

As the soil's phosphorus levels available to the plants increases, the amount of phosphorus also increases in the plant's tissues, and carbon drain on the plant by the AM fungi symbiosis become non-beneficial to the plant (Grant 2005).

A decrease in mycorrhizal colonization due to high soil-phosphorus levels can lead to plant deficiencies in other micronutrients that have mycorrhizal-mediated uptake such as copper (Timmer &amp; Leyden 1980).

===Perennialized cropping systems===
Cover crops are grown in the fall, winter, and spring, covering the soil during periods when it would commonly be left without a cover of growing plants.

Mycorrhizal cover crops can be used to improve the mycorrhizal inoculum potential and hyphal network (Kabir and Koide 2000, Boswell ''et al.''1998, Sorensen et al. 2005).

Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell ''et al.'' 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.

===Soil quality===
Restoration of native AM fungi increases the success of ecological restoration project and the rapidity of soil recovery.&lt;ref name=jeffries2003 /&gt; AM fungi enhance  soil aggregate stability is due to the production of extraradical hyphae and a soil protein known as [[glomalin]].

Glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSP) have been identified using a [[monoclonal]] [[antibody]] (Mab32B11) raised against crushed AMF spores. It is defined by its extraction conditions and reaction with the antibody Mab32B11.

There is other circumstantial evidence to show that glomalin is of AM fungal origin. When AM fungi are eliminated from soil through incubation of soil without host plants, the concentration of GRSP declines. A similar decline in GRSP has also been observed in incubated soils from forested, afforested, and agricultural land&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rillig, M. |author2=Ramsey, P. |author3=Morris, S. |author4=Paul, E.|year= 2003|title= Glomalin, an arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungal soil protein, responds to land-use change|journal= Plant and Soil |volume=253|pages= 293–299|doi= 10.1023/A:1024807820579|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grasslands treated with fungicide.&lt;ref name=rillig2004 /&gt;

Glomalin is hypothesized to improve soil aggregate water stability and decrease [[soil erosion]]. A strong correlation has been found between GRSP and soil aggregate water stability in a wide variety of soils where organic material is the main binding agent, although the mechanism is not known.&lt;ref name=rillig2004 /&gt; The protein glomalin has not yet been isolated and described, and the link between glomalin, GRSP, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is not yet clear.&lt;ref name=rillig2004&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rillig, M.|year= 2004|title= Arbuscular mycorrhizae, glomalin and soil aggregation|journal= Canadian Journal of Soil Science|volume= 84|pages= 355–363|doi=10.4141/S04-003|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also notes that autofellatio was performed during rituals as a result of the sun god Ra’s. . .|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021215552/http://www.sexinfo101.com/as_autofellatio.shtml|archivedate=21 October 2006|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lorton, in the [[List of ancient Egyptian papyri|Papyrus Bremner-Rhind]] 28, 20–24, in a document called "Book of Overthrowing Apophis", there is a poem narrating how the sun god [[Ra]] had created the god [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and goddess [[Tefnut]] by fellating himself and spitting out his own semen onto the ground.&lt;ref name="lorton1"/&gt; In ancient Egyptian texts, this act is usually performed by the god [[Atum]], and most texts depict only the spitting of the semen or only the masturbation, but not both.&lt;ref name="lorton1" /&gt;

[[Michel Foucault]] cites [[Artemidorus]]' ''[[Oneirocritica]]'' as identifying the act of "taking [one's] sex organ into one's [own] mouth" as one of three ways to commit "relations with oneself." Artemidorus thought that dreams of this "unnatural" act [[portend]]ed the death of one's children, loss of one's mistresses, or extreme poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1984). ''The History of Sexuality: The Care of the Self'', vol.3, p. 24. Translation by Robert Hurley. Pantheon Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical aspects==
Few men possess sufficient flexibility and penis length to safely perform the necessary [[frontbend]].&lt;ref name="DS"/&gt; However, increased flexibility achieved via gravity-assisted positions, and physical training such as [[gymnastics]], [[contortion]], or [[yoga]] may make it possible for some. American biologists [[Kinsey Reports|Craig Bartle]] and [[Alfred Charles Kinsey]] reported that fewer than 1% of males can successfully orally contact their own penis and that only 2 or 3 men in a thousand could perform a full autofellatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Psychoanalytic Review]] | issue = 41 | pages = 354–358 | title = A Review of Autofellatio: A Psychological Study of Two New Cases | author = William Guy, Michael H. P. Finn | year = 1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, autofellatio was considered by [[Behaviorism|behavioristic science]] a problem rather than as a variety in sexual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Cavenar JO Jr, Spaulding JG, Butts NT. "Autofellatio: a power and dependency conflict.", [[Journal of Nervous &amp; Mental Disease]]. November 1977; p. 356-360.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brian W. Aldiss]]' 1970 semi-autobiographical novel ''The Hand-Reared Boy'', he describes group masturbation practices at a [[United Kingdom|British]] boys' [[boarding school]]. One boy with an especially large penis is capable of fellating himself, a fact which the narrator, Horatio Stubbs, verifies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian W. Aldiss]], ''The Hand-Reared Boy''; Weidenfeld &amp; Aldiss, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Bill Hicks]] elaborated an oft-quoted riff on the subject of [[fellatio]], "A woman one night yelled out, 'Yeah, you ever try it?' I said 'Yeah. Almost broke my back.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007213805/http://www.centripedus.com/bhpage.html It's Just a Ride] Transcribed by Elspeth Fahey&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Smith]] later developed a similar theme ("He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick") in his 1994 debut film ''[[Clerks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|title=Clerks |url=http://www.allmoviescripts.com/scripts/19858343303f343410b98d9.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20050207033537/http://www.allmoviescripts.com/scripts/19858343303f343410b98d9.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 February 2005 |format=txt |medium=Script |people=Kevin Smith |accessdate=27 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer/director [[Larry David]], in his 1998 film ''[[Sour Grapes (film)|Sour Grapes]]'', used autofellatio as a recurring plot device with several mentions and muted shots of a lead actor fellating himself (back trouble allowing) throughout the movie. In the [[Saturday Night Live (season 26)|26th season]] (2000–2001) of the popular ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' comedy show [[Will Ferrell]] plays a character who joins a [[yoga]] class with the sole purpose to be able to fellate himself as a part of reaching [[Samadhi]].&lt;ref name="snla"&gt;''Yoga Journal''; Sep-Oct 2000, pp. 26, ISSN 0191-0965, Published by Active Interest Media, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In the skit the character is shown to have been successful after three years of efforts.&lt;ref name="snla"/&gt; In the 2001 film ''[[Scary Movie 2]]'', Professor Dwight Hartman ([[David Cross]]) performs autofellatio after rebuffing Theo's ([[Kathleen Robertson]]) offer to perform oral sex on him while she attempts to seduce him to steal keys. She ultimately knocks him unconscious with a telephone and steals the keys.

The opening sequence of the 2006 film ''[[Shortbus]]'' shows James ([[Paul Dawson (actor)|Paul Dawson]]) fellating himself on videotape; like all of ''Shortbus''{{'}}s sexual content, the scene was [[unsimulated sex|unsimulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tiff/features/tiffshortbus.html| title=Naughty but Nice | first=Katrina | last=Onstad | authorlink=Katrina Onstad

The term may be insulting to a man's masculinity, implying that someone performs autofellatio due either to extremely high self-regard or inability to get someone else to do it for him. This was the sense in which the term was used by President [[Donald Trump]]'s former [[White House Communications Director]] [[Anthony Scaramucci]], when he said of strategist [[Steve Bannon]], "I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own cock."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/anthony-scaramucci-called-me-to-unload-about-white-house-leakers-reince-priebus-and-steve-bannon |title=Anthony Scaramucci Called Me to Unload About White House Leakers, Reince Priebus, and Steve Bannon |date=27 July 2017 |accessdate=29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3423">A '''biological pathway''' is a series of interactions among molecules in a cell that leads to a certain product or a change in a cell. Such a pathway can trigger the assembly of new molecules, such as a fat or   protein. Pathways can also turn genes on and off, or spur a cell to move.&lt;ref name=g&gt;http://www.genome.gov/27530687&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common biological pathways are involved in [[metabolism]], the [[regulation of gene expression]] and the [[Cell signaling|transmission of signals]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">'''Bourgeois tragedy''' (German: ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'') is a form of [[tragedy]] that developed in 18th-century Europe. It is a fruit of the [[the Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeois|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.

==In England and France==
There are a few examples of tragic plays with middle-class protagonists from 17th century England (see [[domestic tragedy]]), but only in the 18th century did the general attitude change. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play: [[George Lillo]]'s ''[[The London Merchant]]; or, [[the History of George Barnwell]]'', which was first performed in 1731. In France, the first ''tragédie bourgeoise'' was ''Sylvie'' by [[Paul Landois]], which came out in 1741. Years later came two plays by [[Denis Diderot]]: ''Le fils naturel'' was first staged in 1757 and ''Le père de famille'' in the following year; while these plays were not strictly tragedies, they treat bourgeois lives in a serious manner atypical of contemporary comedy and provided models for more genuinely tragic works.

==Heroes in classical tragedy==
While ordinary people had always been the subject of [[comedy|comedies]], classical and neo-classical theorists asserted that tragic heroes should always be men of noble rank. [[Aristotle]] articulates this idea in ''ars poetica'' (''The Poetics'') and it figures prominently in later ancient writings on drama and poetics. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century critics, including the influential German [[Martin Opitz]], perpetuated the theory that only members of the higher classes were capable of suffering harm serious enough to deserve dramatic reenactment. This rule was followed throughout Europe for centuries: usually, princes and members of the nobility, such as [[Andreas Gryphius]]' Carolus Stuardus (i.e. King [[Charles I of England]]), [[Jean Racine]]'s [[Phèdre]] (the wife of [[Theseus]], a mythical king of [[Athens]]) or [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]], serve as tragic protagonists.

==In Germany==
In Germany, where the new genre was called ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'', it was especially successful.  Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany. However, [[Christian Leberecht Martini]]'s drama ''Rhynsolt und Sapphira'' is slightly older. Lessing's ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'' of 1771 is a classic example of the German Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. Lessing also offered a thorough theoretic justification for his disregard of the old rules in his ''Hamburgische Dramaturgie''. Other important examples of German Bürgerliche Trauerspiele are ''Die Soldaten'' by [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]] (1776) and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Kabale und Liebe]]'' (1784). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/503446347|title=Exemplarity and mediocrity : the art of the average from bourgeois tragedy to realism|last=1968-|first=Fleming, Paul,|date=2009|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804769983|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=503446347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
Bourgeois tragedies tend to propagate the values of the bourgeois class to which their heroes belong. Their ideal is the virtuous citizen, who is excluded from state affairs and whose intentions are focused on his private life and the life of his family. Values like virtue, humanity, individuality and true feelings are cherished in bourgeois tragedies.

The '''Camelford water pollution incident''' involved the accidental contamination of the drinking water supply to the town of [[Camelford]], [[Cornwall]], in July 1988. Twenty [[tonne]]s of [[aluminium sulphate]] was inadvertently added to the water supply, raising the concentration to 3,000 times the admissible level. As the aluminium sulphate broke down it produced several tonnes of [[sulphuric acid]] which "stripped a cocktail of chemicals from the pipe networks as well as lead and copper piping in people’s homes."&lt;ref name="cross"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Boiling water: Will a new inquiry on the Camelford poisoning get any nearer to the truth?|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=22 August 2001|first=Doug|last=Cross|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irwin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irwinmitchell.com/ClientStories/Pages/Camelford-Water-Pollution-Case.aspx|title=Camelford Water Pollution Case|work=IrwinMitchell LLP|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who came into contact with the contaminated water experienced a range of short-term health effects,&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Still thirsting for justice|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/1999/jun/09/guardiansocietysupplement14|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=9 June 1999|first=Geoffrey|last=Gibbs|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many victims suffered long-term effects whose implications remained unclear {{As of|2012|lc=on}}.

Immediately after the contamination the authorities said that the water was safe to drink, possibly with juice to cover the unpleasant taste. In an inquest in 2012 into the death of one of the victims, the [[coroner]] stated that [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] had been "gambling with as many as 20,000 lives" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable.&lt;ref name="BBC-gambled"/&gt; In the aftermath of the contamination the public were reassured that there was no risk to health. There were allegations of a [[cover-up]] and West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose stated: "I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner attacks former water authority 'cover-up'|work=The West Briton|date=22 March 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30983330.html|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an investigation by the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, [[Michael Meacher]], the former Environment Minister, claimed that "various associated bodies tried to bury the inquiry from the start." Meacher told one newspaper: "This has become a tug of war between the truth and an attempt to silence the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford: The truth will out|work=[[The Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=26 January 2007|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ministers accused of Camelford cover-up|first=Ben|last=Russell|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=17 August 2001|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2013 report by the Lowermoor subgroup of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment concluded that exposure to the chemicals was unlikely to cause "delayed or persistent harm" and was also unlikely to cause future ill health.&lt;ref name="bbc_2013"&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-22200035&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cot_2013"&gt;http://cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/lwpiapp811.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013 the government admitted that there had been a "manifest failure to give prompt appropriate advice and information to affected consumers" and offered an unreserved apology.&lt;ref name="BBC-24164253"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Camelford water poisoning: Unreserved government apology | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 19 September 2013 | accessdate = 8 May 2016 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-24164253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
On 6 July 1988, John Stephens, a relief tanker driver working for ISC Chemicals, a [[Bristol]]-based subsidiary of [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto Zinc]], arrived at [[Lowermoor Water Treatment Works]] on [[Bodmin Moor]] and found it unmanned.&lt;ref name="wells2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Driver relives day of water poisoning|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|location=Bristol|date=2 November 2010|first=Jeff|last=Wells|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being unfamiliar with the location, he had been given a key by another driver and told simply that "once inside the gate, the aluminium sulphate tank is on the left". However, the key fitted almost every lock used by the [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] (SWWA). After twenty minutes looking for the correct tank he tried the key on a manhole cover and when it unlocked believed he had accessed the correct tank.&lt;ref name=wells2010/&gt; He poured the load of 20 tonnes of [[aluminium sulphate]], used to remove solid particles from raw water, into the tank, which actually held treated water prior to distribution to the consumers in Camelford. This immediately contaminated the water supply to 20,000 local people and up to 10,000 tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/127270.stm|title=Public inquiry calls mark Camelford anniversary|work=[[BBC News]]|date=6 July 1998|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indyscandal"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Lean|first1=Geoffrey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/poisoned-the-camelford-scandal-474373.html|title=Poisoned: The Camelford scandal|work=[[The Independent]]|date=16 April 2006|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum recorded aluminium concentration was 620 milligrams per litre compared with the maximum concentration admissible at the time by the European Community of 0.2 milligrams per litre.&lt;ref name="rowland"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Rowland|first1=A|last2=Grainger|first2=R|last3=Smith|first3=RS|last4=Hicks|first4=N|last5=Hughes|first5=A|title=Water contamination in north Cornwall: a retrospective cohort study into the acute and short-term effects of the aluminium sulphate incident in July 1988|year=1990|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Health|issue=110|pages=166–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
For several days the water authority insisted the water was safe, and should be mixed with orange juice to disguise the taste of the as yet unknown contaminant. One customer who telephoned the authority the day after the contamination was told "there had been some acidity, but the water was perfectly safe to drink," and was no more harmful than lemon juice.&lt;ref name="boggan"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Day that left a bitter taste in the mouth|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|first=Steve|last=Boggan|pages=7|date=24 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 1988 the authority sent a circular letter to all customers "asserting that the water from the treatment works was of the right [[alkalinity]] and was safe to use and drink."&lt;ref name="timeslaw"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Exemplary damages in public nuisance (AB v South West Water Services Ltd [1993] QB 507)|work=The Times|location=London|date=8 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two days, the authority suspected the source of the contamination was the erroneous delivery, which was confirmed on 12 July when the driver was asked to return to the treatment works. However, it was not until ten days later on 22 July that the authority's chairman Keith Court authorised a public notice, containing the first mention of the aluminium sulphate, to be published in the sports section of a local newspaper, the ''[[Western Morning News]]''.&lt;ref name="greenwood2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water bosses too slow to go public over poisoning|work=[[Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=9 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephens stated that after the site meeting where he confirmed he had delivered the chemical to the wrong tank he was told by the authority "not to mention it to anyone else".&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Driver was told to "tell no one" about poisoning|work=[[Cornish Guardian]]|location=Truro|date=3 November 2010|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SWWA district manager, John Lewis, said they had realised within 48 hours that aluminium sulphate was the likely cause of the contamination, but Lewis said he had been instructed by Leslie Nicks, the head of operations, not to tell the public.&lt;ref name="telegraph2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Staff 'silenced' over poisoned water|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=3 November 2010|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="express"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water company's staff 'told to keep poisoning quiet'|work=[[Express and Echo]]|location=Exeter|date=3 November 2010|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Cross, a [[biologist|consultant biologist]] based in Camelford, tested the water and found that it contained "not only aluminium sulphate but other noxious substances, too. As the acidic liquid travelled from the plant into people's homes, it corroded the copper pipes and their soldered joints, made of zinc and lead."&lt;ref name=cross /&gt; Official advice to boil the water before drinking was, according to Cross, "dangerous advice because it concentrates the contaminants. They kept flushing the pipes out for months after the incident. This will have stirred up debris in the bends and only have lengthened the amount of time the water was coming through the taps with all sorts of metals in it."
60,000 [[salmon]] and [[trout]] were killed in the [[River Camel|Camel]] and [[River Allen, Cornwall|Allen]] rivers during the flushing out process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-21771-2|title=The Environment: Principles and Applications|first=Chris|last=Park|pages=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jury"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Claimants consider 11th-hour pollution compensation offer|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=6 May 1994|first=Louise|last=Jury}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contamination was compounded by the failure of the authority to carry out the required six-monthly cleaning of the tank, which had not been cleaned for three years leading to a build up of sludge.&lt;ref name="gerrard"&gt;{{Cite news|title=What's happened to the children?|work=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date =14 July 1996|first=Nicci|last=Gerrard|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after the contamination, Michael Waring at the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] (DH) wrote to every doctor in Cornwall saying that, "although he had no detailed information on what was exactly in the water or how much people might have drunk, he could assure them that no lasting ill effects would result."&lt;ref name="meacher"&gt;{{Cite news|title=A wash out: Lessons must be learned from the notorious Camelford water contamination incident|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=26 April 2006|first=Michael|last=Meacher|pages=8|authorlink=Michael Meacher}}&lt;/ref&gt; GK Matthews, a senior toxicologist at the DH, suggested a team of medical experts should be sent to the area immediately but a month later said he had been "overruled".&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt; The [[National Union of Public Employees]] said that the procedure by which the driver had access to the site was common through the region and that they believed this was connected with reduced staffing levels and [[Water privatisation in England and Wales|privatisation plans]]. They added that they were concerned about the three-week delay in reporting what had happened, and that SWWA district manager John Lewis had been "instructed at a very high level to say nothing". Lewis (not a member of the union) had been dismissed; the union said "To single him out is unfair".&lt;ref name=dennis /&gt;

==Reports and inquiries==
In August 1988 a highly critical report by Dr John Lawrence, a senior [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] scientist and non-executive member of the water authority, blamed lax procedures. He also criticised communication failures which kept information from the public.&lt;ref name="dennis" /&gt;

===Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group report===
The Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group (LIHAG) was set up in January 1989 to provide expert advice to the [[District Health Authority#Authorities in South Western Region|Cornwall and Isles of Scilly District Health Authority]] on the health implications for the population of the Camelford area.&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1989/jul/20/lowermoor-incident-group|journal=[[Hansard]]|date=20 July 1989|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 20 July 1989 (cc298-9W)|volume=157|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the LIHAG reported that there was no convincing evidence of a harmful build-up of aluminium and that there was no increase in ill health from poisoned water. A further enquiry by the same group in 1991 acknowledged the affair had caused "real suffering" in the community.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skytimeline" /&gt; However, Dame Barbara Clayton concluded that this was because of sensational reporting of the incident. She stated that "In our judgment it is likely that these symptoms would have occurred in the normal course of events," and the symptoms were wrongly attributed to the contamination because of "inaccurate and exaggerated" claims of health damage by scientists and the news media.&lt;ref name="rumbelow"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford spill damaged brains, says doctor|work=The Times|location=London|date=24 September 1999|first=Helen|last=Rumbelow|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Clayton report was released in July 1989, it caused "outrage in Camelford and wide disbelief in the scientific community."&lt;ref name="vidal"&gt;{{Cite news|title=New inquiry into water poisoning: Minister promises to look again at Camelford|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=15 August 2001|first=John|last=Vidal|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One section was later amended to read "alarming statements by ''pseudo-''scientists" rather than "...by ''some'' scientists".&lt;ref name=vidal /&gt;

===COT Lowermoor Subgroup report===
In June 2000 [[Environment minister]] [[Michael Meacher]] announced that there would not be an independent public inquiry, and declared "All the facts are fully known and there is no reason to believe that a public inquiry could add to that."&lt;ref name="Guardian-refused"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford inquiry refused|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/13/geoffreygibbs?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=13 June 2000|first=Geoffrey|last=Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000 the [[Environmental Law Centre]] [http://www.elc.org.uk/pages/home.htm]&lt;!--external inline link can be deleted if &amp; when ELC article has been created--&gt; prepared a petition to the [[European Parliament]] calling for a Brussels-based inquiry.&lt;ref name= harris /&gt; On 14 August 2001 the government announced that an investigation – although not a full public inquiry – into the incident would take place.&lt;ref name="graves"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford health inquiry starts: Campaigners denied public hearing into contamination but minister backs 'quick' investigation|first=David|last=Graves|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=15 August 2001|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was to be undertaken by the newly formed Lowermoor Subgroup (LSG) consisting of scientific and health experts and local resident representatives, chaired by Frank Woods, a professor of medicine at the [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;ref name=graves /&gt; Woods was also the head of the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), of which the Lowermoor team was a subgroup.&lt;ref name="woodcock"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Now Camelford waits for justice over 'poisoning'|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|location=Birmingham|date=15 August 2001|first=Andrew|last=Woodcock|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its remit was to advise on whether the incident had caused, or was expected to cause, long-term harm to human health and examine whether the existing programme of monitoring and research into the human health effects was sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/19298.php|title=Draft Report Published into Lowermoor Water Contamination Incident, UK|work=Medical News Today|date=26 January 2005|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2005 draft report====

A draft report, published on 26 January 2005, was inconclusive, saying that the long-term health effects on the population were still unknown and that there was insufficient scientific information available to determine whether the health problems being experienced were caused by the contamination.&lt;ref name="brown2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford inquiry seeks new studies|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=27 January 2005|first=Paul|last=Brown|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods called for further studies and said: "We will be putting the strongest possible case to the minister. I believe carrying out that work is important, it is not something which should be dropped and pushed aside."&lt;ref name=brown2 /&gt;

The following year, Meacher made several criticisms of the group:
*the requirement to examine the DoH's handling of the incident was removed from the terms of reference
*no independent expert on aluminium toxicology was included in the working group
*an attempt was made to include Waring as medical adviser to the group, even though he was the author of the original letter stating that no lasting ill effects would result
*no objective testing of the exposed population was carried out
*too much reliance was placed on the water sample analysis from the South-West Water Authority, the compromised party
*the amount of sludge reported to have been in the contact tank at the time was ignored
*experts were drawn on who had potentially vested interests in the aluminium industry
*the DoH pre-released a highly misleading statement of the findings two days before the draft report was due to be made public
*the executive summary, prepared without the group's approval, and which effectively concluded that the illnesses reported bore no connection with the water poisoning, was "misleading and biased".&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt;

Two members of the LSG committee claimed in December 2007 that the DoH had known from the start that some people were at especially high risk from aluminium poisoning but deliberately suppressed this evidence to protect the government's plans for water privatisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Sturcke|first1=James|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/dec/13/water.pollution1|title=Coroner orders police to reopen Camelford pollution case|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 December 2007|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yorkshire"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police to investigate claims of water poisoning cover-up|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/around-yorkshire/local-stories/police_to_investigate_claims_of_water_poisoning_cover_up_1_2484066|work=[[Yorkshire Post]]|location=Leeds|date=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013 final report====
The final report was published in April 2013, and concluded that it was unlikely that the exposure to chemicals could have caused long-term health problems. Key findings of the report include:

* there is no evidence that the combination of metals which occurred as a result of the incident could have caused delayed health effects
* there was an increase in childhood infections in the area, but this increase occurred before the pollution incident
* a study of cancer incidence and mortality showed that there was no increase in cancer incidence in the area after the pollution incident
* a dermatologist investigated skin and nail problems reported by individuals affected by the incident, and reported that the problems are similar to those experienced by the general population
* there is no evidence that the contaminants can cause joint or muscle pain and/or swelling, and these complaints are common in the general population
* a Camelford resident who died of severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy was found to have higher than normal aluminium concentrations in the brain during an autopsy. However samples from the brain of a patient with similar neuropathology but unknown aluminium exposure found similar higher than usual concentrations. Research commissioned by the coroner compared 60 postmortem brains and found no correlation between aluminium  or iron concentrations and the level of congophilic angiopathy or senile plaques&lt;ref name="bbc_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cot_2013"/&gt;

==Health effects==

===Short-term===
A diverse array of short term health effects was reported by members of the public who either drank the contaminated water or came into contact with it while bathing.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dennis"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Dennis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1988/oct/01/1|title=Official dismissed over contamination: Cornish manager made a scapegoat, says union|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 October 1988|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kent /&gt; These included:
*urinary complaints,
*[[desquamation|blistering and peeling]] of skin,
*hair turning blue or green,
*diarrhoea and vomiting, and
*[[arthralgia|joint pains]].

===Long-term===
A 1999 report in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' concluded that some victims had suffered "considerable damage" to their brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Altmann| first = Paul |author2=John Cunningham |author3=Usha Dhanesha |author4=Margaret Ballard |author5=James Thompson |author6=Frank Marsh | title = Disturbance of cerebral function in people exposed to drinking water contaminated with aluminium sulphate: retrospective study of the Camelford water incident|journal=BMJ|volume=319| issue = 7213|pages=807–811|date=25 September 1999|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/319/7213/807| pmid = 10496822| pmc = 314205| doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7213.807}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicted the [[#Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group report|1991 LIHAG report]] telling residents that their symptoms were due to anxiety. The study was led by a consultant [[nephrology|nephrologist]] at [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], [[Oxford]], and was the first large-scale clinical study of the affected residents. The report stated that their symptoms were similar to those of [[Alzheimer's disease]], which has also been linked with large quantities of aluminium accumulating in the brain.&lt;ref name=rumbelow /&gt; Rejecting the findings of the LIG, the report called for further research to determine the longer term prognosis for the affected individuals and led to fresh calls for a public inquiry into the pollution incident.&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Brain damage found in pollution victims|work=[[The Scotsman]]|location=Edinburgh|date=24 September 1999|first=Chris|last=Court|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the study was carried out in 1991, its publication was delayed by the ongoing litigation between SWWA and the victims.&lt;ref name="laurance"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Contaminated water caused long-term brain damage in Camelford, say doctors study|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=24 September 1999|first1=Jeremy|last1=Laurance|first2=Cherry|last2=Norton|first3=Steve|last3=Boggan|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven months after the contamination, one victim underwent a bone biopsy which "found a ring of aluminium like the rings you see in trees" that could not have resulted from normal aluminium absorption.&lt;ref name=boggan /&gt;&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt;

===Later deaths of victims===
The husband of [[#Carol Cross|Carol Cross]], who died of a rare form of dementia in 2004, said in 2006 that he believed that his wife and twenty other people had died as a result of the disaster, and that more cases were emerging.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt;

Victim Sarah Sillifant, who was in her twenties when she was exposed, hanged herself in 2005 after suffering dementia and other symptoms similar to those experienced by Carol Cross.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt; In June 2007, Irene Neal, who lived in Rock, near Camelford at the time of the incident, died aged 91. A post-mortem found an "unacceptable amount of aluminium in the brain".

====Carol Cross====
In 2006 a post-mortem [[inquest]] into the death of Carol Cross at age 58, who was exposed to the contaminated drinking water aged 44, showed that her brain contained 23 micrograms of aluminium per gram of brain, compared to the normal brain levels of 0–2 micrograms per gram. Her death was caused by a form of early-onset [[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy|beta amyloid angiopathy]], a cerebro-vascular disease usually associated with Alzheimer's, which could be connected to the abnormally high level of aluminium in her brain.&lt;ref name="savill"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Alzheimer's symptoms in toxic water woman's brain|work=Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=16 December 2005|first=Richard|last=Savill|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liverpool"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water link to Alzheimer's|work=[[Liverpool Daily Post|Daily Post]]|location=Liverpool)|date=16 December 2005|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Rose, the West Somerset Coroner, said of the findings: "Further research will be needed before the significance of the elevated brain aluminium concentration in this case can be clarified. A scientific report on the case has been submitted for publication."&lt;ref name=liverpool /&gt; Daniel Perl, of New York's [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] said: "If additional similar cases were to appear among the 20,000 exposed individuals then the implications of this incident would become extremely important. Only time will tell. At the very least, increased efforts towards surveillance of individuals exposed in Camelford is certainly warranted."&lt;ref name="hawkes"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Alzheimer's linked to aluminium pollution in tap water|work=The Times|location=London|date=20 April 2006|first=Nigel|last=Hawkes|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose had adjourned the inquests for Cross and Neal pending further studies, but in 2008 said the Government had refused "to either finance or assist" research to test the hypothesis of a link between exposure to aluminium and [[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy|congophilic amyloid angiopathy]]. He said this research was necessary to determine the consequences of the deceased having such a high level of aluminium. He later sought support from [[Somerset County Council]] so that the work could go ahead and once more adjourned the inquest into the death of Carol Cross, although Neal's inquest went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Inquests: Camelford coroner attacks lack of state cash|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|first=Steven|last=Morris|pages=8|date=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 Rose announced that the inquest into Cross's death would resume in November 2010.&lt;ref name="greenwood"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner to quiz ex-water chief|work=Western Morning News|location=Plymouth|date=31 July 2009|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose said that "ongoing medical research would not be completed until late summer" 2010. He explained "This research is necessary to prove whether or not the high level of aluminium in Mrs Cross's brain causing her death through beta amyloid angiopathy (a form of cerebrovascular disease) on February 19, 2004, could be attributed to the aluminium sulphate placed in the public water supply at Lowermoor treatment works on July 6, 1988. This is the last adjournment I am able to agree and the inquest will commence on Monday November 1, 2010 at Taunton."&lt;ref name=greenwood /&gt;

When the inquest was reconvened Dr. Chris Exley, a reader in [[bioinorganic chemistry]] at [[Keele University]], said "The brain aluminium concentration was so high that it is highly likely that it contributed to her brain pathology, probably being responsible for the aggressive form and very early onset of the disease." [[Neuropathology|Neuropathologist]] Prof. Margaret Esiri, from the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], said "I have never seen a case such as this at this age. I have seen one case in a woman who died aged 81 but the literature shows only a handful of cases worldwide."&lt;ref name="greenwood4"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Experts: Highly likely that polluted water caused death|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|location=Bristol|date=10 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of their evidence the inquest was again adjourned to allow South West Water Authority time to seek its own expert evidence.&lt;ref name="greenwood5"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poison in water 'led to death'|work=[[Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=10 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol Cross's inquest was finally completed in March 2012. The coroner returned a [[narrative verdict]] recording the circumstances without attributing the cause, in which he said the water supply company, [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] had been "gambling with as many as 20,000 lives" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable. An expert said at the inquest that the levels of aluminium in her brain were "beyond belief".&lt;ref name="BBC-gambled"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-17367243 |title=BBC News – Camelford water poisoning: Authority 'gambled with lives'|work=bbc.co.uk |date=14 March 2012|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose stated: "I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident," and that "[T]he failure of the authority to visit every house after the incident to advise them to thoroughly flush their systems [w]as a serious dereliction of duty. I can say that the incident may either have contributed to or possibly caused Mrs Cross's death, but I do not have sufficient evidence to say so conclusively."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner attacks former water authority 'cover-up'|work=[[The West Briton]]|date=22 March 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30983330.html|location=Truro|accessdate=24 September 2012}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal actions against South West Water Authority==
In 1991 the South West Water Authority was fined £10,000 and ordered to pay £25,000 costs at [[Exeter]] Crown Court for supplying water likely to endanger public health. The authority paid at least £123,000 to settle almost 500 initial compensation claims and in 1997 a further 148 victims accepted out-of-court damages totalling almost £400,000, approved by a High Court judge sitting in [[Truro]]. The settlements ranged from £680 to £10,000.&lt;ref name=jury /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1908534.stm|title=Camelford poisoning hearings begin|work=BBC News|date=3 April 2002|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water claims settled|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4650262.html|date=11 May 1994|accessdate=24 September 2011}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some later claimed they were "railroaded" into accepting the out-of-court settlements after being told that their [[Legal aid#Legal aid in England and Wales|legal aid]] funding would be withdrawn if they continued with the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice" /&gt; The judge, Mr Justice Wright, said: "If the case had been contested, there would have been awesomely complex argument over how much [water] they consumed" and that they were "extraordinarily well advised to accept the offer."&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Residents accept pounds 400,000 from water company for pollution|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=11 May 1994|first=Paul|last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross later said: "The official medical claim from the health authority was that there was no known pathway for aluminium to be absorbed into the body. I would argue that this was a misrepresentation of scientific facts, however it was accepted by the judge [and he] instructed the jury that medical damages could not be awarded. The victims therefore received negligible compensation. This alone is adequate reason for a judicial review, since it resulted in a miscarriage of justice for the victims."&lt;ref name=cross /&gt;

==Allegations of a cover-up==
On 13 December 2007 Michael Rose announced that, in light of "a possible attempt to initially suppress the seriousness of the incident, I am asking the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall to hand me evidence gathered at the time of the original investigation," and for the chief constable to appoint a senior detective "to look into the allegations of a possible cover-up."&lt;ref name="bruxelles"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner fears toxic water was covered up|work=The Times|location=London|date=14 December 2007|first=Simon|last=de Bruxelles|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the incident the [[Water privatisation in England and Wales|water industry was about to be privatised]] by the Conservative government of the day; a letter written from a water official to [[Michael Howard]], then Minister of State for Water and Planning, emerged which stated that a police investigation into the poisoning incident was viewed as "very distracting" and that any subsequent prosecution of South West Water would also "be totally unhelpful to privatisation... and render the whole of the water industry unattractive to the City".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=A Lethal Cover-up|work=Daily Mail|location=London|date=15 December 2007|page=36|first=Sue|last=Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Western Morning News]]'', using a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] request, uncovered a briefing note to the then Environment Minister, [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], warning: "Those of the South West board with a commercial background are deeply concerned by the investigation."&lt;ref name=bnet /&gt;
There was speculation in the news media that commercial concerns were given priority over public health.

The former North Cornwall [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Member of Parliament (MP) [[Paul Tyler, Baron Tyler|Paul Tyler]] also uncovered documents contradicting the water authority's claim that it had advised consumers not to drink the water, and that this advice had been given in a radio broadcast at 6{{nbsp}}am on 7 July 1988 and subsequently. The documents, relating to the prosecution of South West Water, alleged that this "was not the advice given to the public on the 6th, 7th, 8th, or indeed on the 12th," and added that the prosecution would say that the authority "misled Mr Healey (the head of the drinking water division at the Department of Environment)... There is evidence that a deliberate decision was made to conceal the truth from the public."&lt;ref name="bnet"&gt;Western Morning News, Was there a Camelford cover-up?, 14 December 2007. [http://western-morning-news.vlex.co.uk/vid/was-there-camelford-cover-up-77051283 Available over the Internet] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130505152742/http://western-morning-news.vlex.co.uk/vid/was-there-camelford-cover-up-77051283 |date=5 May 2013 }} by subscription&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler said "I can't think of any comparable accident or mistake anywhere in Britain, particularly one involving what was a government agency, where there was no attempt to investigate what went wrong and why."&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice" /&gt;

In 2001 Environment Minister Michael Meacher claimed that the Government feared what an unrestricted inquiry might find, and that "There was then a great deal of shenanigans about the terms of reference and fighting at all levels in order to limit the ambit of the committee to get the result they wanted. This inquiry was always potentially hugely damaging and hugely worrying to the establishment in terms of the way they handled the incident and clearly there are elements that want to shut it down." No named individuals were ever prosecuted.
The national water industry was sold, under the Conservative government, for £3.59 billion, with the sale of South West Water Authority raising around £300 million.&lt;ref name=bnet /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10280">'''Combustion models for CFD''' refers to combustion models for [[computational fluid dynamics]]. 
[[Combustion]] is defined as a chemical reaction in which a hydrocarbon fuel reacts with an oxidant to form products, accompanied with the release of energy in the form of heat. Being the integral part of various engineering applications like: [[internal combustion engine]]s, [[aircraft engine]]s, [[rocket engine]]s, [[furnace]]s, and [[power station combustor]]s, combustion manifests itself as a wide domain during the design, analysis and performance characteristics stages of the above-mentioned applications.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;“An introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics-- the finite volume method” H.K. Versteeg and W.Malalasekara Pearson Education limited.p.357&lt;/ref&gt; With the added complexity of chemical kinetics and achieving reacting flow mixture environment, proper modeling physics has to be incorporated during [[Computational fluid dynamics|computational fluid dynamic (CFD)]] simulations of combustion. Hence the following discussion presents a general outline of the various adequate models incorporated with the Computational fluid dynamic code to model the process of combustion.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;An introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics-- the finite volume method” H.K. Versteeg and W. Malalasekera Longman Group limited.p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Computational fluid dynamics modeling of combustion calls upon the proper selection and implementation of a model suitable to faithfully represent the complex physical and chemical phenomenon associated with any combustion process. The model should be competent enough to deliver information related to the species concentration, their volumetric generation or destruction rate and changes in the parameters of the system like enthalpy, temperature and mixture density. The model should be capable of solving the general transport equations for fluid flow and heat transfer as well as the additional equations of combustion chemistry and [[Chemical kinetics]] incorporated into that as per the simulating environment desired&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

==Critical considerations in combustion phenomenon==
The major consideration during any general combustion process includes the mixing time scale and the reacting time scale elapsed for the process. The flame type and the type of mixing of flow streams of the constituents also have to be taken into account. Apart from that as far as the kinetic complexity of the reaction is concerned, the reaction proceeds in multiple steps and what appears as a simple one line reaction actually completes after a series of reactions.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Also the transport equations for mass fractions of all the species as well as the enthalpy generated during the reaction have to be solved. Hence even the simplest combustion reaction involves very tedious and rigorous calculation if all the intermediate steps of the combustion process, all transport equations and all flow equations have to be satisfied simultaneously. All these factors will have a significant effect on the computational speed and time of the simulation. But with proper simplifying assumptions Computational fluid dynamic modeling of combustion reaction can be done without substantial compromise on the accuracy and convergence of the solution.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The basic models used for the same are covered in the following paragraphs.

==Simple chemical reacting system model==
This model takes into consideration only the final concentration of species and takes into account only the global nature of combustion process where the reaction proceeds infinitely fast as a single step process without much stress on the detailed kinetics involved.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; The reactants are assumed to react in stoichiometric proportions. The model also deduces a linear relationship between the mass fractions of fuel, oxidant and the non dimensional variable mixture fraction.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The model also takes into account an additional assumption that the mass diffusion coefficients of all species are equal.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;http://www.cham.co.uk/phoenics/d_polis/d_lecs/general/combust.htm#2&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to this additional assumption the model only solves one extra partial differential equation for mixture fraction and after solving the transport equation for the mixture fraction the corresponding mass fractions for fuel and oxidant are calculated. This model can very well be applied to a combustion environment where laminar diffusion effects are dominant and the combustion proceeds via non premixed fuel and oxidant streams diffusing into each other giving rise to a laminar flame.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;


== Eddy break–up model ==
{{main|Eddy break-up model for combustion}}
[[File:Combustor-Temp-Plane.png|300px|right|thumb|Simulation of can combustor using eddy dissipation model.]]

This model is used when [[turbulent mixing]] of the constituents has to be taken into consideration. The k/Ɛ turbulent time scale is used to calculate the reaction rate. A comparison between the turbulent dissipation rates of the fuel, oxidant and products is done and the minimum amongst all is taken as the rate of the reaction. The transport equations for the mass fractions of the constituents are solved using this rate of reaction.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Apart from this a mean enthalpy equation is also solved and temperature, density and viscosity are calculated accordingly. The model can also be implemented when finite rate kinetically controlled reaction is to be simulated. In such situation while deciding the rate of the reaction the Arrhenius kinetic rate expression is also taken into account and the rate of reaction is taken as minimum amongst the turbulent dissipation rates of all the constituents and the Arrhenius kinetic rate expression.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Since turbulent mixing governs the characteristics of this model, there exists a limit to the quality of the combustion simulation depending upon the type of the turbulent model implemented to represent the flow. The model can also be modified to account for mixing of fine structures during the turbulent reaction. This modification of the model results in the eddy dissipation model which consider the mass fraction of fine structures in its calculations.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

==Laminar flamelet model==
{{main|Laminar flamelet model}}
This model approximates the turbulent flame as a series of laminar flamelet regions concentrated just around the stoichiometric surfaces of the reacting mixture.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; This model exploits the use of experimental data for determining relations between the variables considered like mass fraction, temperature etc. The nature and type of dependence of the variables is predicted through experimental data obtained during laminar diffusion flame experiment and laminar flamelet relationship is deduced based on the same. These relationships are then used to solve the transport equations for species mass fraction and mixture composition.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The model can very well be implemented for situations where concentration of minor species in the combustion is to be computed like quantifying the generation of pollutants.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; A simple enhancement to the model results in the flamelet time scale model which takes finite rate kinetics effect into consideration. The flamelet time scale model produces steady laminar flamelet solution when reaction proceeds very fast and captures the finite rate effects when reaction chemistry is dominant.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;9-rao-rutland.pdf---“A Flamelet Time Scale combustion model for turbulent combustion in KIVA” Shrikanth Rao and Christopher J. Rutland( Engine Research Center, UW Madison.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presumed probability distribution function model==
This model takes into account a statistical approach for calculating the variables like species mass fractions, temperature and density while the mixture composition is calculated at the grids.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Then these all variables are calculated as functions of the mixture fraction around a presumed probability distribution function.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Pope_NACM_91.pdf—“combustion modeling using probability density function methods” S.B.Pope.&lt;/ref&gt; The model can produce satisfactory results for turbulent reactive flows where convection effects due to mean and fluctuating components of velocity are dominant.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Pope_ACAC_97.pdf---“Turbulence Combustion Modelling: fluctuations and chemistry (advanced computation and analysis of combustion: 310-320)” S.B.Pope (Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Cornell University,Ithaca NY).&lt;/ref&gt; The model can be extended for adiabatic as well as non adiabatic conditions.

== Conditional Moment Closure ==

Conditional moment closure (CMC) is an advanced combustion model. The basic idea is to model the chemical source based on [[Conditional expectation|conditional averages]]. The model was first introduced for non-premixed flows and hence the conditioning is done in the mixture fraction.&lt;ref name="Cant_Mastorakos_2007"&gt;Cant, R.S. &amp; Mastorakos, E. ''An Introduction to Turbulent Reacting Flows''. Imperial College Press, London. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other models==
The following are some of the other relevant models used for computational fluid dynamic modeling of combustion.

* The [[chemical equilibrium model]]
* The [[Flamelet generated manifold]] model
* The [[flame surface density model]]
* The [[large eddy simulation model]]

The chemical equilibrium model considers the effect of intermediate reactions during turbulent combustion.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; The concentration of species is calculated when the combustion reaction reaches equilibrium state. The species concentration is calculated as a function of mixture fraction by deploying certain equilibrium calculation programs available to serve the purpose. The conditional closure model solves the transport equations for the mean components of the flow properties without considering the fluctuating composition of the reaction mixture.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;

Efforts to save endangered species may, paradoxically, lead to '''conservation-induced extinction''' of other species. This mostly threatens the parasite and pathogen species that are highly host-specific to critically endangered hosts. When the last individuals of a host species are captured for the purpose of captive breeding and reintroduction programs, they typically undergo anti-parasitic treatments to increase survival and reproductive success. This practice may unintentionally result in the extinction of the species antagonistic to the target species, such as certain parasites. It has been proposed that the parasites should be reintroduced to the endangered population. A few cases of conservation-induced extinction have occurred in parasitic [[lice]].&lt;ref name="Rózsa2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rózsa | first=Lajos | last2=Vas | first2=Zoltán | title=Co-extinct and critically co-endangered species of parasitic lice, and conservation-induced extinction: should lice be reintroduced to their hosts? | journal=Oryx | volume=49 | issue=01 | date=2014-08-22| doi=10.1017/s0030605313000628 | pages=107–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* Parasite: ''[[Colpocephalum californici]]'' – host: [[California condor]]&lt;ref name = Dunn&gt;Dunn RR 2009. Coextinction: anecdotes, models, and speculation. In Holocene Extinctions (ed. S.T. Turvey), pp. 167–180. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
:The parasite most probably became extinct when the last individuals of its only host species were captured for a captive-breeding program; all parasites found were deliberately killed in an attempt to assist the host's survival.&lt;ref name="Stringer2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stringer |first1=Andrew Paul |last2=Linklater |first2=Wayne |title=Everything in Moderation: Principles of Parasite Control for Wildlife Conservation |journal=BioScience |date=2014 |volume=64 |issue=10 |pages=932–937 |doi=10.1093/biosci/biu135 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parasite: ''Rallicola (Aptericola) pilgrimi'' – host: [[little spotted kiwi]]&lt;ref name = Buckley&gt;Buckley TR, Palma RL, Johns PM, Gleeson DM, Heath ACG, Hitchmough RA, Stringer IAN 2012. The conservation status of small or less well known groups of New Zealand terrestrial invertebrates. ''New Zealand Entomologist'' '''35:''' 137–143.&lt;/ref&gt;
:The parasite most probably became extinct when the last individuals of its only host species were captured and, after routine veterinary antiparasitic treatments, re-introduced into predator-free islands.
* Parasite: ''Rallicola (Rallicola) guami'' – host: [[Guam rail]]
:The only known host species of this parasite exists exclusively in captivity and kept under veterinary control. No information about the fate of the parasite, likely extinct.
* Parasite: ''Linognathus petasmatus'' – host: [[scimitar-horned oryx]]
:The host specificity of this parasite is uncertain. Either it was specific to the scimitar-horned oryx and became extinct during captive breeding of the host, or – alternatively – it may be specific to the [[addax]] and possibly still surviving in the wild.

==Erroneous example==

* “The Trichodectid lice of the [[black-footed ferret]]” has been mentioned in the literature several times&lt;ref name = Gompper&gt;Gompper ME, Williams ES 1998. Parasite conservation and the black-footed ferret recovery program. ''Conservation Biology'' '''12:''' 730–732.&lt;/ref&gt; as a parasite that became extinct during the captive breeding program of the host. However, this parasite most probably never existed as a separate species.&lt;ref name="Rózsa2014"/&gt;

==Current example==

Parasite species that are specific to a single host species are endangered whenever the host is to be saved by captive breeding programs. A current example is the louse ''Felicola isidoroi'', a louse parasitizing the [[Iberian lynx]].&lt;ref name = Felicola&gt;Pérez, J.M.; Sánchez, I. &amp; Palma, R.L. (2013). The dilemma of conserving parasites: the case of ''Felicola (Lorisicola) isidoroi'' (Phthiraptera: Trichodectidae) and its host, the endangered Iberian lynx (''Lynx pardinus''). ''Insect Conservation and Diversity'' '''6:''' 680–686.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9634">'''Cultural history''' combines the approaches of [[anthropology]] and [[history]] to look at [[popular culture|popular cultural]] traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and [[narrative]] descriptions of past matter, encompassing the continuum of events (occurring in succession and leading from the past to the present and even into the future) pertaining to a [[culture]].

Cultural history records and interprets past events involving human beings through the [[social]], [[cultural]], and [[political]] [[Social environment|milieu]] of or relating to [[the arts]] and manners that a group favors. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897) helped found cultural history as a discipline. Cultural history studies and interprets the record of [[human societies]] by denoting the various distinctive ways of living built up by a group of people under consideration. Cultural history involves the aggregate of past cultural activity, such as [[ceremony]], class in practices, and the interaction with locales.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Description==
Cultural history overlaps in its approaches with the French movements of ''[[histoire des mentalités]]'' (Philippe Poirrier, 2004) and the so-called new history, and in the U.S. it is closely associated with the field of [[American studies]]. As originally conceived and practiced by 19th Century Swiss historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] with regard to the [[Italian Renaissance]], cultural history was oriented to the study of a particular historical period in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting, sculpture and architecture, but for the economic basis underpinning society, and the social institutions of its daily life as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Giedion]], ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (6th ed.), p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Echoes of Burkhardt's approach in the 20th century can be seen in [[Johan Huizinga]]'s ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Sean Farrell |last=Moran |title=Johan Huizinga, ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'', and the Writing of History |journal=Michigan Academician |volume=42 |year=2016 |pages=410–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most often the focus is on phenomena shared by non-elite groups in a society, such as: [[carnival]], [[festival]], and public [[ritual]]s; [[performance]] traditions of [[Narrative|tale]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and other verbal forms; cultural evolutions in human relations (ideas, sciences, arts, techniques); and cultural expressions of social movements such as [[nationalism]]. Also examines main historical concepts as [[power (sociology)|power]], [[ideology]], [[Social class|class]], [[culture]], [[cultural identity]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[perception]] and new historical methods as narration of body. Many studies consider adaptations of traditional culture to [[mass media]] (television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, etc.), from [[Printing|print]] to [[film]] and, now, to the [[Internet]] (culture of [[capitalism]]). Its modern approaches come from [[art history]], [[Annales School|Annales]], [[Marxist]] school, [[microhistory]] and new cultural history.

Common theoretical [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]]s for recent cultural history have included: [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s formulation of the [[public sphere]] in ''The Structural Transformation of the Bourgeois Public Sphere''; [[Clifford Geertz]]'s notion of '[[thick description]]' (expounded in, for example, ''The Interpretation of Cultures''); and the idea of [[memory]] as a cultural-historical category, as discussed in [[Paul Connerton]]'s ''How Societies Remember''.

===Historiography and the French Revolution===
The area where new-style cultural history is often pointed to as being almost a [[paradigm]] is the '[[Historical revisionism|revisionist]]' history of the [[French Revolution]], dated somewhere since [[François Furet]]'s massively influential 1978 essay ''Interpreting the French Revolution''. The 'revisionist interpretation' is often characterised as replacing the allegedly dominant, allegedly [[Marxist]], 'social interpretation' which locate the causes of the Revolution in class dynamics. The revisionist approach has tended to put more emphasis on '[[political culture]]'. Reading ideas of political culture through Habermas' conception of the public sphere, historians of the Revolution in the past few decades have looked at the role and position of cultural themes such as [[gender]], [[ritual]], and [[ideology]] in the context of pre-revolutionary French political culture.

Historians who might be grouped under this umbrella are [[Roger Chartier]], [[Robert Darnton]], [[Patrice Higonnet]], [[Lynn Hunt]], Keith Baker, Joan Landes, Mona Ozouf and [[Sarah Maza]]. Of course, these scholars all pursue fairly diverse interests, and perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the paradigmatic nature of the new history of the French Revolution. Colin Jones, for example, is no stranger to cultural history, [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], or Marxism, and has persistently argued that the Marxist interpretation is not dead, but can be revivified; after all, Habermas' logic was heavily indebted to a Marxist understanding. Meanwhile, Rebecca Spang has also recently argued that for all its emphasis on difference and newness, the 'revisionist' approach retains the idea of the French Revolution as a watershed in the history of (so-called) [[modernity]], and that the problematic notion of 'modernity' has itself attracted scant attention.

==Cultural studies==
''[[Cultural studies]]'' is an academic discipline popular among a diverse group of scholars.  It combines [[political economy]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[art history]]/[[art criticism|criticism]] to study [[culture|cultural]] phenomena in various societies.  Cultural studies researchers often concentrate on how a particular phenomenon relates to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].  The term was coined by [[Richard Hoggart]] in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]]. It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who succeeded Hoggart as Director.

A '''curtain wall''' system is an outer covering of a building in which the outer walls are non-structural, utilized to keep the weather out and the occupants in.  Since the curtain wall is non-structural, it can be made of lightweight materials, thereby reducing construction costs.  When [[architectural glass|glass]] is used as the curtain wall, an advantage is that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The curtain wall [[façade]] does not carry any [[dead and live loads|structural load]] from the building other than its own dead load weight.  The wall transfers lateral [[wind engineering|wind loads]] that are incident upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building. A curtain wall is designed to resist air and water infiltration, absorb sway induced by wind and [[earthquake engineering|seismic]] forces acting on the building, withstand wind loads, and support its own dead load weight forces.

Curtain wall systems are typically designed with [[aluminum extrusion|extruded aluminum]] framing members, although the first curtain walls were made with steel frames. The aluminum frame is typically infilled with glass, which provides an architecturally pleasing building, as well as benefits such as [[daylighting]]. However, the effects of light on visual comfort as well as solar heat gain in a building are more difficult to control when using large amounts of glass infill. Other common infills include: stone veneer, metal panels, [[louver|louvres]], and operable windows or vents.

Curtain walls differ from storefront systems in that they are designed to span multiple floors, taking into consideration design requirements such as: thermal expansion and contraction; [[tuned mass damper|building sway]] and movement; water diversion; and thermal efficiency for cost-effective heating, cooling, and lighting in the building.

==History==
Buildings have long been constructed with the exterior walls of the building supporting the load of the entire structure. The development and widespread use of [[structural steel]] and later [[reinforced concrete]] allowed relatively small [[columns]] to support large loads; hence, exterior walls of buildings were no longer required for structural support. The exterior walls could be non-[[load-bearing wall|load bearing]] and thus much lighter and more open than the masonry load-bearing walls of the past.  This gave way to increased use of glass as an exterior façade, and the modern-day curtain wall was born.

Early prototype versions of curtain walls may have existed in buildings of timber construction before the 19th century, should columns have been used to support the building rather than the walls themselves, particularly when large panels of glass infill were involved. When iron began to be used extensively in buildings in late 18th-century Britain such as at [[Ditherington Flax Mill]], and later when buildings of wrought iron and glass such as [[The Crystal Palace]] were built, the building blocks of structural understanding were laid for the development of curtain walls.

[[Oriel Chambers]] (1864) and [[16 Cook Street]] (1866), both built in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], by local architect and [[civil engineer]] [[Peter Ellis (architect)|Peter Ellis]], are characterised by their extensive use of glass in their facades. Towards the courtyards they even boasted metal-framed glass curtain walls, which makes them two of the world's first buildings to include this architectural feature. The extensive glass walls allowed light to penetrate further into the building, utilizing more floor space and reducing lighting costs. Oriel Chambers comprises {{convert|43000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} set over five floors without an [[elevator]], which had only recently been invented and was not yet widespread.&lt;ref name="Oriel Chambers History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orielchambers.co.uk/#/411|title=History|publisher=Oriel Chambers|accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of an all-steel curtain wall used in the classical style is the ''{{lang|de|Kaufhaus Tietz}}'' department store on ''{{lang|de|[[Leipziger Straße]]}}'', [[Berlin]], built in 1901 (since demolished).&lt;ref name="Tietz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/8725928@N02/9416991555/|title=History|publisher= janwillemsen|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the first curtain walls were made with steel [[mullions]], and the [[polished plate glass]] was attached to the mullions with asbestos- or fiberglass-modified glazing compound. Eventually [[silicone]] [[sealant]]s or glazing tape were substituted for the glazing compound. Some designs included an outer cap to hold the glass in place and to protect the integrity of the seals. The first curtain wall installed in [[New York City]], in the [[United Nations Secretariat Building]] building (Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, 1952), was this type of construction. Earlier [[modernist]] examples are the [[Bauhaus]] in [[Dessau]] (1926) and the [[Hallidie Building]] in [[San Francisco]] (1918).

During the 1970s, the widespread use of aluminium [[extrusion]]s for mullions began. [[Aluminum alloy]]s offer the unique advantage of being able to be easily extruded into nearly any shape required for design and aesthetic purposes. Today, the design complexity and shapes available are nearly limitless. Custom shapes can be designed and manufactured with relative ease. The [[Omni San Diego Hotel]] curtain wall in California (developed by JMI Realty, designed by architectural firm Hornberger and Worstel, is an example of a unitized curtain-wall system with integrated sunshades.&lt;ref&gt;Wausau Press Releases, [http://www.wausauwindow.com/resources/pressReleases/Wausau_CA_Omni.pdf "Omni San Diego Hotel offers breathtaking Bay views through Wausau’s curtainwall"], ''Wausau Press Releases'', Retrieved 2 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems and principles==
===Stick systems===
The vast majority of ground-floor curtain walls are installed as long pieces (referred to as ''sticks'') between floors vertically and between vertical members horizontally. Framing members may be fabricated in a shop, but installation and [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] is typically performed at the jobsite.

===Ladder systems===
Very similar to a stick system, a ladder system has mullions which can be split and then either snapped or screwed together consisting of a half box and plate. This allows sections of curtain wall to be fabricated in a shop, effectively reducing the time spent installing the system on site. The drawbacks of using such a system is reduced structural performance and visible joint lines down the length of each mullion.

===Unitized systems===
Unitized curtain walls entail factory fabrication and assembly of panels and may include factory glazing. These completed units are installed on the building structure to form the building enclosure.  Unitized curtain wall has the advantages of: speed; lower field installation costs; and [[quality control]] within an interior climate-controlled environment. The economic benefits are typically realized on large projects or in areas of high field labor rates.

===Rainscreen principle===
A common feature in curtain wall technology, the [[rainscreen]] principle theorizes that equilibrium of air pressure between the outside and inside of the "rainscreen" prevents water penetration into the building. For example, the glass is captured between an inner and an outer gasket in a space called the glazing rebate. The glazing rebate is ventilated to the exterior so that the pressure on the inner and outer sides of the exterior gasket is the same. When the pressure is equal across this gasket, water cannot be drawn through joints or defects in the gasket.

==Design concerns==
Curtain wall systems must be designed to handle all loads imposed on it as well as keep air and water from penetrating the building envelope.

===Loads===
{{main|Structural load}}
The loads imposed on the curtain wall are transferred to the building structure through the anchors which attach the mullions to the building.

;Dead load
''Dead load'' is defined as the weight of structural elements and the permanent features on the structure.&lt;ref&gt;2006 International Building Code, Section 1602.1&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of curtain walls, this load is made up of the weight of the mullions, anchors and other structural components of the curtain wall, as well as the weight of the infill material.  Additional dead loads imposed on the curtain wall may include sunshades or signage attached to the curtain wall.

;Wind load
''Wind load'' is a normal force acting on the building as the result of [[wind]] blowing on the building.&lt;ref&gt;"Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures," American Society of Civil Engineers, 2005; Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Wind pressure is resisted by the curtain wall system since it envelops and protects the building.  Wind loads vary greatly throughout the world, with the largest wind loads being near the coast in [[hurricane]]-prone regions. For each project location, [[building code]]s specify the required design wind loads. Often, a [[wind tunnel]] study is performed on large or unusually-shaped buildings. A scale model of the building and the surrounding vicinity is built and placed in a wind tunnel to determine the wind pressures acting on the structure in question. These studies take into account [[vortex shedding]] around corners and the effects of surrounding topography and buildings.

;Seismic load
''Seismic loads'' in curtain wall system are limited to the interstory drift induced on the building during an earthquake. In most situations, the curtain wall is able to naturally withstand [[seismology|seismic]] and wind induced building sway because of the space provided between the glazing infill and the mullion. In tests, standard curtain wall systems are typically able to withstand up to three inches (75&amp;nbsp;mm) of relative floor movement without glass breakage or water leakage.

;Snow load
''Snow loads'' and [[dead and live loads|live loads]] are not typically an issue in curtain walls, since curtain walls are designed to be vertical or slightly inclined. If the slope of a wall exceeds 20 degrees or so, these loads may need to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;"Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures," American Society of Civil Engineers, 2005; Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

;Thermal load
''Thermal loads'' are induced in a curtain wall system because aluminum has a relatively high [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]. This means that over the span of a couple of floors, the curtain wall will expand and contract some distance, relative to its length and the temperature differential. This expansion and contraction is accounted for by cutting horizontal mullions slightly short and allowing a space between the horizontal and vertical mullions.  In unitized curtain wall, a gap is left between units, which is sealed from air and water penetration by gaskets. Vertically, anchors carrying wind load only (not dead load) are slotted to account for movement.  Incidentally, this slot also accounts for live load deflection and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] in the floor slabs of the building structure.

;Blast load
Accidental explosions and terrorist threats have brought on increased concern for the fragility of a curtain wall system in relation to blast loads. The bombing of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], has spawned much of the current research and mandates in regards to building response to blast loads. Currently, all new federal buildings in the U.S. and all U.S. embassies built on foreign soil must have some provision for resistance to bomb blasts.&lt;ref&gt;"Design of Buildings to Resist Progressive Collapse," UFC 4-023-03, U.S. Department of Defense, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the curtain wall is at the exterior of the building, it becomes the first line of defense in a bomb attack. As such, blast resistant curtain walls are designed to withstand such forces without compromising the interior of the building to protect its occupants. Since blast loads are very high loads with short durations, the curtain wall response should be analyzed in a [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] load analysis, with full-scale [[mock-up]] testing performed prior to design completion and installation.

Blast resistant glazing consists of [[laminated glass]], which is meant to break but not separate from the mullions. Similar technology is used in [[hurricane]]-prone areas for impact protection from wind-borne debris.

===Air Infiltration===
''Air infiltration'' is the air which passes through the curtain wall from the exterior to the interior of the building. The air is infiltrated through the gaskets, through imperfect joinery between the horizontal and vertical [[mullions]], through [[weep hole]]s, and through imperfect sealing. The [[American Architectural Manufacturers Association]] (AAMA) is an industry trade group in the U.S. that has developed voluntary specifications regarding acceptable levels of air infiltration through a curtain wall.&lt;ref&gt;Testing is typically conducted by an independent third party agency using the ASTM E-783 standard.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water penetration===
''Water penetration'' is defined as water passing from the exterior of the building to the interior of the curtain wall system. Sometimes, depending on the building [[specifications]], a small amount of controlled water on the interior is deemed acceptable. Controlled water penetration is defined as water that penetrates beyond the inner most vertical plane of the test specimen, but has a designed means of drainage back to the exterior. AAMA Voluntary Specifications allow for controlled water penetration while the underlying ASTM E1105 test method would define such water penetration as a failure. To test the ability of a curtain wall to withstand water penetration in the field, an ASTM E1105 water spray rack system is placed on the exterior side of the test specimen, and a positive air pressure difference is applied to the system. This set up simulates a wind driven rain event on the curtain wall to check for field performance of the product and of the installation.  Field quality control and assurance checks for water penetration has become the norm as builders and installers apply such quality programs to help reduce the number of water damage litigation suits against their work.

===Deflection===
One of the disadvantages of using aluminum for mullions is that its [[modulus of elasticity]] is about one-third that of steel. This translates to three times more [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] in an aluminum mullion compared to a similar steel section under a given load. Building specifications set deflection limits for perpendicular (wind-induced) and in-plane (dead load-induced) deflections. These deflection limits are not imposed due to strength capacities of the mullions.  Rather, they are designed to limit deflection of the glass (which may break under excessive deflection), and to ensure that the glass does not come out of its pocket in the mullion. Deflection limits are also necessary to control movement at the interior of the curtain wall. Building construction may be such that there is a wall located near the mullion, and excessive deflection can cause the mullion to contact the wall and cause damage. Also, if deflection of a wall is quite noticeable, public perception may raise undue concern that the wall is not strong enough.

Deflection limits are typically expressed as the distance between anchor points divided by a constant number. A deflection limit of L/175 is common in curtain wall specifications, based on experience with deflection limits that are unlikely to cause damage to the glass held by the mullion. Say a given curtain wall is anchored at 12 foot (144&amp;nbsp;in) floor heights.  The allowable deflection would then be 144/175 = 0.823&amp;nbsp;inches, which means the wall is allowed to deflect inward or outward a maximum of 0.823&amp;nbsp;inches at the maximum wind pressure.  However, some panels require stricter movement restrictions, or certainly those that prohibit a torque-like motion.

Deflection in mullions is controlled by different shapes and depths of curtain wall members. The depth of a given curtain wall system is usually controlled by the [[second moment of area|area moment of inertia]] required to keep deflection limits under the specification. Another way to limit deflections in a given section is to add steel reinforcement to the inside tube of the mullion. Since steel deflects at one-third the rate of aluminum, the steel will resist much of the load at a lower cost or smaller depth.

===Strength===
Strength (or maximum usable [[Stress (physics)|stress]]) available to a particular material is not related to its material stiffness (the material property governing deflection); it is a separate criterion in curtain wall [[structural design|design]] and [[structural analysis|analysis]].  This often affects the selection of materials and sizes for design of the system.  The allowable bending strength for certain aluminum alloys, such as those typically used in curtain wall framing, approaches the allowable bending strength of steel alloys used in building construction.

===Thermal criteria===
Relative to other building components, aluminum has a high heat transfer coefficient, meaning that aluminum is a very good [[heat conduction|conductor]] of heat. This translates into high heat loss through aluminum curtain wall mullions.
There are several ways to compensate for this heat loss, the most common way being the addition of thermal breaks. ''[[Thermal break]]s'' are barriers between exterior metal and interior metal, usually made of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC). These breaks provide a significant decrease in the [[thermal conductivity]] of the curtain wall. However, since the thermal break interrupts the aluminum mullion, the overall moment of inertia of the mullion is reduced and must be accounted for in the structural analysis and deflection analysis of the system.

Thermal conductivity of the curtain wall system is important because of heat loss through the wall, which affects the heating and cooling costs of the building. On a poorly performing curtain wall, [[condensation]] may form on the interior of the mullions. This could cause damage to adjacent interior trim and walls.

Rigid [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] is provided in [[spandrel]] areas to provide a higher [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] at these locations.

==Infills==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

''Infill'' refers to the large panels that are inserted into the curtain wall between mullions. Infills are typically glass but may be made up of nearly any exterior building element. Some common infills include metal panels, louvers, a [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] panels.

===Glass===
[[File:Serre cactees JdP.jpg|thumb|left|The Mexican [[greenhouse|hothouse]] at the [[Jardin des Plantes]], built by [[Charles Rohault de Fleury]] from 1834 to 1836, is an early example of metal and glass curtain wall architecture.]]
By far the most common glazing type, [[float glass|glass]] can be of an almost infinite combination of color, thickness, and [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]].
For commercial construction, the two most common thicknesses are 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm) monolithic and 1&amp;nbsp;inch (25&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Insulated glazing|insulating glass]]. Presently, 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch glass is typically used only in [[spandrel]] areas, while insulating glass is used for the rest of the building (sometimes spandrel glass is specified as insulating glass as well). The 1&amp;nbsp;inch insulation glass is typically made up of two 1/4-inch lites of glass with a 1/2&amp;nbsp;inch (12&amp;nbsp;mm) airspace. The air inside is usually atmospheric air, but some [[inert gas]]es, such as [[argon]] or [[krypton]] may be used to offer better [[thermal transmittance]] values.

In residential construction, thicknesses commonly used are 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm) monolithic and 5/8&amp;nbsp;inch (16&amp;nbsp;mm) insulating glass. Larger thicknesses are typically employed for buildings or areas with higher thermal, [[relative humidity]], or [[Acoustic transmission|sound transmission]] requirements, such as laboratory areas or [[recording studio]]s.

Glass may be used which is [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], [[translucent]], or opaque, or in varying degrees thereof. ''Transparent'' glass usually refers to ''vision'' glass in a curtain wall. Spandrel or vision glass may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes.  ''Opaque'' glass is used in areas to hide a column or spandrel beam or shear wall behind the curtain wall. Another method of hiding spandrel areas is through ''shadow box'' construction (providing a dark enclosed space behind the transparent or translucent glass). Shadow box construction creates a perception of depth behind the glass that is sometimes desired.

===Fabric veneer===
Fabric is another type of material which is common for curtain walls. Fabric is often much less expensive and serves as a less permanent solution. Unlike glass or stone, fabric is much faster to install, less expensive, and often much easier to modify after it is installed.
Because of low density of fabrics total weight of structure is very low then strength consideration of structure is not too important.

===Stone veneer===
Thin blocks (3 to 4&amp;nbsp;inches (75–100&amp;nbsp;mm)) of stone can be inset within a curtain wall system. The type of stone used is limited only by the strength of the stone and the ability to manufacture it in the proper shape and size. Common stone types used are: [[calcium silicate]], [[granite]], [[marble]], [[travertine]], and [[limestone]]. To reduce weight and improve strength, the natural stone may be attached to an aluminum honeycomb backing.

===Panels===
Metal panels can take various forms including aluminum plate; [[aluminum composite panels]] consisting of two thin aluminum sheets sandwiching a thin plastic interlayer; [[Copper in architecture#Wall cladding|copper wall cladding]], and panels consisting of metal sheets bonded to rigid insulation, with or without an inner metal sheet to create a sandwich panel. Other opaque panel materials include [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] (FRP), stainless steel, and [[terracotta]]. Terracotta curtain wall panels were first used in Europe, but only a few manufacturers produce high quality modern terracotta curtain wall panels.

===Louvers===
A [[louver]] is provided in an area where mechanical equipment located inside the building requires ventilation or fresh air to operate. They can also serve as a means of allowing outside air to filter into the building to take advantage of favorable climatic conditions and minimize the usage of energy-consuming [[HVAC]] systems. Curtain wall systems can be adapted to accept most types of louver systems to maintain the same architectural sightlines and style while providing the functionality.

===Windows and vents===
Most curtain wall glazing is fixed, meaning there is no access to the exterior of the building except through doors. However, windows or vents can be glazed into the curtain wall system as well, to provide required ventilation or operable windows. Nearly any window type can be made to fit into a curtain wall system.

==Fire safety==
[[File:Curtain wall backpan styrofoam.jpg|thumb|right|Combustible [[polystyrene]] insulation in point contact with [[sheet metal]] backban. Incomplete [[firestop]] in the [[Joint (building)|perimeter slab edge]], made of [[Mineral wool|rockwool]] without topcaulking.]]
[[Firestop]]ping at the ''[[Joint (building)|perimeter slab edge]]'', which is a gap between the floor and the curtain wall, is essential to slow the passage of fire and combustion gases between floors. Spandrel areas must have non-combustible insulation at the interior face of the curtain wall. Some building codes require the mullion to be wrapped in heat-retarding insulation near the ceiling to prevent the mullions from melting and spreading the fire to the floor above. The firestop at the perimeter slab edge is considered a continuation of the [[fire-resistance rating]] of the floor slab. The curtain wall itself, however, is not ordinarily required to have a rating. This causes a quandary as [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)]] is typically based upon ''closed'' compartments to avoid fire and smoke migrations beyond each engaged compartment. A curtain wall by its very nature prevents the completion of the compartment (or envelope). The use of fire sprinklers has been shown to mitigate this matter. As such, unless the building is [[fire sprinkler system|sprinklered]], fire may still travel up the curtain wall, if the glass on the exposed floor is shattered from heat, causing flames to lick up the outside of the building.

Falling glass can endanger pedestrians, firefighters and firehoses below. An example of this is the 1988 [[First Interstate Tower fire]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The fire leapfrogged up the tower by shattering the glass and then consuming the aluminum framing holding the glass.&lt;ref name="TechReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lafire.com/famous_fires/880504_1stInterstateFire/FEMA-TecReport/FEMA-report.htm|title=Technical Report, Interstate Bank Building Fire|publisher=[[United States Fire Administration]]|accessdate=21 November 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lafire.com%2Ffamous_fires%2F880504_1stInterstateFire%2FFEMA-TecReport%2FFEMA-report.htm&amp;date=2010-07-13 |archivedate=2010-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminum's melting temperature is 660&amp;nbsp;°C, whereas building fires can reach 1,100&amp;nbsp;°C. The melting point of aluminum is typically reached within minutes of the start of a fire.

Fireman knock-out glazing panels are often required for venting and emergency access from the exterior. Knock-out panels are generally fully [[Architectural Glass|tempered]] glass to allow full fracturing of the panel into small pieces and relatively safe removal from the opening.

==Maintenance and repair==
Curtain walls and perimeter sealants require maintenance to maximize service life. Perimeter sealants, properly designed and installed, have a typical service life of 10 to 15 years. Removal and replacement of perimeter sealants require meticulous surface preparation and proper detailing.

Aluminum frames are generally painted or [[anodising|anodized]]. Care must be taken when cleaning areas around anodized material as some cleaning agents will destroy the finish. Factory applied [[fluoropolymer]] thermoset coatings have good resistance to environmental degradation and require only periodic cleaning. Recoating with an air-dry fluoropolymer coating is possible but requires special surface preparation and is not as durable as the baked-on original coating. Anodized aluminum frames cannot be "re-anodized" in place but can be cleaned and protected by proprietary clear coatings to improve appearance and durability.

Stainless steel curtain walls require no coatings, and embossed, as opposed to abrasively finished, surfaces maintain their original appearance indefinitely without cleaning or other maintenance. Some specially textured matte stainless steel surface finishes are hydrophobic and resist airborne and rain-borne pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Michael F., "Stainless Steel for Design Engineers", ASM International, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been valuable in the American Southwest and in the Mideast for avoiding dust, as well as avoiding soot and smoke staining in polluted urban areas.

A '''Discourse-Completion Task''' (DCT) is a tool used in [[linguistics]] and [[pragmatics]] to elicit particular [[speech acts]].  A DCT consists of a one-sided role play containing a situational prompt which a participant will read to elicit the responses of another participant.

==Background==
The instrument was originally developed by [[Shoshana Blum-Kulka]] for studying speech act realization comparatively between native and non-native Hebrew speakers, based on the work of E. Levenston.&lt;ref name="blum"&gt;Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., &amp; G. Kasper. (1989). Investigating cross-cultural pragmatics: An introductory overview. In Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., &amp; G. Kasper (Eds.), Cross-cultural pragmatics: Requests and apologies (pp. 1-34). Norwood, NJ: Ablex, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

DCTs are used in pragmatics research to study speech acts and find the medium between naturally occurring speech and scripted speech acts.  In comparing role-plays to DCTs, role-plays are considered to elicit data more similar to naturally occurring speech acts,&lt;ref&gt;Gass, S., &amp; Houck, N. (1999). Interlanguage refusals: a cross-cultural study of Japanese English. Walter de Gruyet, pp. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golato, A. (2003). Studying compliment responses: A comparison of DCTs and recordings of natu-
rally occurring talk. Applied Linguistics, 24(1), 90–121.&lt;/ref&gt; yet are considered harder to score, attributed to the influence of the interlocutors.&lt;ref&gt;Roever, C. (2011). Testing of second language pragmatics: Past and future. Language testing (0265-5322), 28 (4), p. 468&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
A discourse-completion task consists of scripted dialogue representing various scenarios, preceded by a short prompt describing the setting and situation.&lt;ref name="blum" /&gt; The prompt usually includes information on social distance between participants and pre-event background to help the participant construct the scenarios.

'''''Double Helix''''' (2004), a novel by [[Nancy Werlin]], is about 18-year-old Eli Samuels, who works for a famous [[molecular biologist]] named Dr. Quincy Wyatt.  There is a mysterious connection between Dr. Wyatt and Eli’s parents, and all Eli knows about the connection is that it has something to do with his mother, who has [[Huntington's disease]].  Because of the connection between Dr. Wyatt and the Samuels family, Eli's father is strongly against Eli working there.  The job is perfect, and the wages are great, but Eli can't help but notice that Dr. Wyatt seems to be a little ''too'' interested in him.  Later on, as Eli continues to work in the lab, he discovers with the help of Kayla Matheson, Dr. Wyatt's supposed "niece," that he and Kayla are the product of a highly [[unethical]] [[eugenics]] experiment.

==Characters==
* '''Eli Samuels''': Eli is 18 years old, 6′7″ (201 centimeters) tall. He's an A student, and is the salutatorian in high school. His mother has Huntington's disease, which he could have too.
* '''Jonathan Samuels''': Jonathan Samuels is Eli's father, who loved his wife. He has a problem with Eli working at Wyatt Transgenic's, because of things that went down in the past. He is initially completely unwilling to tell Eli anything about his mother's relationships with Dr. Wyatt.
* '''Dr. Quincy Wyatt''': Dr. Quincy Wyatt is a famed geneticist, who is considered to be on par with [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]], [[James Watson|Watson]], and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]. He offers Eli a job. He displays an unexplained interest in Eli.
* '''Vivian Fadiman''': Vivian Fadiman is Eli's girlfriend and [[Valedictorian]] at his high school. All she wants is to be part of his life and she supports him in everything he does. It's hard for her to understand why Eli hides major parts of his life from her. Eli is devoted to her, though they do go through some rough times.
* '''Kayla Matheson''': A year older than Eli, he gets to know her via Dr. Wyatt. He is attracted to her because of her beauty and athleticism.
* '''Ava Samuels''': Ava Samuels was Eli's mother and lived in a nursing home because of her [[Huntington's disease]]. She had a mysterious connection with Dr. Wyatt.

==Themes==
The story addresses a lot of recent scientific breakthroughs, and uses them as plot devices.  For instance, [[Human Genome Project|The Human Genome Project]], which documents all the genes and DNA in the human genetic makeup, is talked about when Dr. Wyatt explains his genetic testing to Eli for the first time.  [[Scientific American]] recently published an article detailing the possible uses for the information gathered from the Human Genome Project.  Modern advancements in gene studies currently can detect and, in some cases, even predict the presence of a genetic abnormality.  In Double Helix, this ability to detect flaws before birth was used to [[genetic engineering|genetically engineer]] a “more perfect son, devoid of flaws and with a proper chance to live free of [[Huntington's Disease|Huntington’s]].”

For some people, the biggest issue with genetic engineering is whether or not to seek out nd act on knowledge about genetic flaws. Double Helix attempts to explore the life saving and life destroying aspects of genetic engineering. The book proposes that, while Eli’s life was saved by avoiding the Huntington’s disease gene, his concept of life and self were destroyed when he found out he was genetically engineered to be a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenicsonline.netfirms.com/issues.htm Eugenics Online Issues&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229144845/http://www.eugenicsonline.netfirms.com/issues.htm |date=December 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nancywerlin.com/aboutwriting.htm :: Nancy Werlin | Resources for Writers ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120907041429/http://www.nancywerlin.com/aboutwriting.htm |date=September 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/014240327X Amazon.com: Double Helix (Puffin Sleuth Novels): Books: Nancy Werlin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''e-Administration''', or [[electronics|electronic]] administration, refers to any of a number of mechanisms which convert what in a traditional office are paper processes into electronic processes, with the goal being to create a [[paperless office]].  This is an ICT tool, with the goal being to improve productivity and performance.

e-Administration can encompass both intra-office and inter-office [[communication]] for any organization.

Its objective is to introduce total [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and [[accountability]] leading to better [[e-Governance]] within any organization.  In [[Germany]], this initiative is especially targeted at [[government]] organizations, where public accountability is of special concern.  Similar processes are being developed in many [[United States|American]] [[corporations]] to aid compliance with the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]].

The implementation of any e-administration solution should be customer centric rather than organization centric, should remove dependence on specific individuals, and should introduce transparent systems of working.  Examples of e-administration include, online timesheets and expense account. These can be used to help reduce costs to an organization.

In [[Sociology|social]], [[Cultural studies|cultural]] and [[religious studies]], the "'''epic of evolution'''" is a [[narrative]] that blends religious and scientific views of [[Cosmology|cosmic]], [[Biological evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution]] in a [[Mythology|mythological]] manner. According to ''Taylor's Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'', an "epic of evolution" encompasses
{{quote|the 14 billion year narrative of cosmic, planetary, life, and cultural evolution—told in sacred ways. Not only does it bridge mainstream science and a diversity of religious traditions; if skillfully told, it makes the science story memorable and deeply meaningful, while enriching one's religious faith or secular outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''The Epic of Evolution'', 2004 [http://www.religionandnature.com/ern/ ''Taylor's Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|thumb|upright|[[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]] coined the phrase "evolutionary epic" in 1978.]]

"Epic of evolution" seems to have originated from the [[Sociobiology|sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]]'s use of the phrase "evolutionary epic" in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;E. O. Wilson coined the term "evolutionary epic"– Teilhard Perspective, Volume 30 #2 Fall 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The evolutionary epic is probably the best myth we will ever have." ''On Human Nature'', [[E. O. Wilson]], 1978, p 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was not the first to use the term but his prominence prompted its usage as the morphed phrase 'epic of evolution'. In later years, he also used the latter term.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|last=Novacek |first=Michael J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/science.medicine/pro.eowilson.html |title=Lifetime achievement: E.O. Wilson |work= |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2006-11-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014091550/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/science.medicine/pro.eowilson.html |archivedate=2006-10-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalistic and liberal religious writers have picked up on Wilson's term and have used it in a number of texts. These authors however have at times used other terms to refer to the idea: ''Universe Story'' ([[Brian Swimme]], [[John F. Haught]]), ''Great Story'' (Connie Barlow, [[Michael Dowd]]), ''Everybody's Story'' ([[Loyal Rue]]&lt;ref&gt;Rue, Loyal.  ''Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution'', SUNY Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7914-4392-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''New Story'' ([[Thomas Berry]], [[Al Gore]], Brian Swimme) and ''Cosmic Evolution'' ([[Eric Chaisson]]&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric. ''Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos'', Columbia University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-231-13560-2}}, paper978-0-231-13561-0&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Alfred K.  ''The Epic of Evolution, Its Etiology and Art: A Study of Vardis Fisher's Testament of Man'', University Microfilms International, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, James B. ''The Epic of Evolution: Science and Religion in Dialogue'', Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2003, {{ISBN|0-13-093318-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Gordon. ''The ''Epic of Evolution'' as a Framework for Human Orientation'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hefner. ''The Evolutionary Epic''. Zygon, vol.44 #1, March 2009, page 3. "An enormous amount of attention has been given to constructing this myth. Such efforts commonly go under the names 'evolutionary epic,' 'epic of evolution,' or 'epic of creation'."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
Evolution generally refers to biological [[evolution]], but here it means a [[process(science)|process]] in which the whole universe is a progression of interrelated phenomena, a gradual process&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Polkinghorne, ''The Work of Love: Creation as Kenosis'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, (Peacocke chapter) page 21, {{ISBN|0-8028-4885-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=fy1-hnYDHGIC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;vq=One+can+only+speak+of+creation+as+a+process&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1]&lt;/ref&gt; in which something changes into a different and usually more complex form ([[emergence]]). It should not be 'biologized' as it includes many areas of science.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley – [https://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity:,epic+of+evolution&amp;ei=TDbOSaGeLJ2EyATUoOmLCg ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''], Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, page 229, {{ISBN|90-04-11695-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, outside of the scientific community, the term evolution is frequently used differently from scientists' usage. Even respected dictionaries may present questionable definitions that are not scientific or only address genetic changes. Unfortunately it is common for the general public to enter into a discussion about evolution with a wrong definition in mind. This often leads to misunderstanding since scientists are viewing evolution from a different perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Moran – What is Evolution, 1993 [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html] retrieved 4-07-09&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies to the use of the term theory as used in the theory of evolution (see references for [[Evolution as theory and fact]]).

This epic is not a long narrative poem but a series of events that form the proper subject for a laudable kind of tale. It is mythic in that it is a story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the worldview of a people and explains a natural phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of myth that has an approach to investigation that is empirical or scientific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthlight.org/interview26.html Epic of Evolution is definitely mythic – Brian Swimme interview]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joseph Campbell myths serve two purposes—provide meaning for a maturing individual (an individuate) and how to be part of a community. This Epic does both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/212-living-dialogues/episodes/2712-michael-dowd-great-story-epic Duncan Campbell in one of his interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The epic as myth==
Dr. [[William Grassie]] of Temple University writes that the word "[[myth]]" in common usage is usually misunderstood. In academia it defines "a story that serves to define the fundamental world view of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society". He suggests that the Greek term ''mythos'' would be a better term to apply to the Epic as it is more all-encompassing. He concluded that there is not yet an interpretive tradition within science and society about this epic of evolution. If anything, there is an anti-interpretation tradition. Consequently, this is dangerous as it is a powerful revelation at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time?[http://www.science-spirit.org/printerfriendly.php?article_id=29]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}- retrieved 3-22-09&lt;/ref&gt; Grassie says the Epic is complex and multifaceted, not simple or easy to understand. It takes a romantic vision, philosophical rigor, and artistic interpretations. It requires a consilience of modern disciplines and acceptance of social diversity. The ancient wisdoms of the world's spiritual traditions must be adapted to make the framework to weave the Epic.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Grassie]], Science and Spirit 1998, 9(1) – page 6 of this ref- [http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf Science and Spirit] retrieved 3-16-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations of the epic==
&lt;!-- Please attempt to keep this to a paragraph per 'interpretation' --&gt;
[[E. O. Wilson]] explained that humans had a need for the epic of evolution because they must have a mythical story or a sublime account of how the world was created and how humanity became part of it. Religious epics fulfill a primal need in this respect as they verify that humans are part of something greater than themselves. The best empirical knowledge that science and history can provide is necessary in order to provide a comparable epic tale that will reliably unite a separated human spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Edward O. Wilson, Foreword of ''Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution'' By Loyal D. Rue, SUNY Press, 1999, page ix and x,{{ISBN|0-7914-4392-2}},&lt;/ref&gt; He believes the evolutionary epic can be as inherently noble as any religious epic when it is expressed in a poetic way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf  Edward O. Wilson, Consilience 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, biologist Ursula Goodenough sees the tale of natural emergence as far more magical than traditional religious miracles. It is a story that people can work with in a  religious way if they elect to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Goodenough – Sacred Depths of Nature, Oxford University Press, USA; 1 edition (June 15, 2000), {{ISBN|0-19-513629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Hefner]] uses the analogy of weaving to describe the Epic. The warp anchors the story and the weft creates the pattern and the tapestry. The Epic, as scientists see it, is the warp and the weft forms the pattern as each of us views it (we are all weavers) but the patterns all have the warp in common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf Classic Quotations – Philip Hefner, 1997 AAAS Epic of Evolution Conference ]&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner writes that stories about the evolutionary epic are redolent with ultimacy.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}  It is not science; it is scientifically informed myth, a myth driven by the refusal to give up on the insistence that the natural world and our lives in the world have meaning and purpose. It is a mythical tale of irony and hope that fills a large space in the domain of religion-and-science.&lt;ref&gt;Hefner – The Evolutionary Epic – Zygon, vol.44 #1, March 2009, page 5,6&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Ursula Goodenough]] also makes use of Hefner's weaving metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Goodenough – ''The Sacred Depths of Nature'', Oxford University Press US, 1998, page 272, {{ISBN|0-19-512613-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connie Barlow and [[Michael Dowd]]'s Great Story divides the epic into 8 phases eons or eras: the [[Big bang|Great Radiance]], the Galactic, [[Hadean]], [[Archean]], [[Proterozoic]], [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Cenozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatstory.org/timeline.html  Great Story Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; Dowd uses the term 'epic of evolution' to help construct his viewpoint of evolution theology (a form of [[theistic evolution]]). His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/node/1128 Evolution Theology: Religion 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt; He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe. Evolution is viewed as a spiritual process that it is not meaningless blind chance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/book Thank God for Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loyal Rue]] states that there is nothing in the core of everybody's story to rule out belief in a personal deity. However belief in God is not an indispensable part of this narrative and here will be both theistic and non-theistic versions of it.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue – Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution, SUNY Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7914-4392-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says it is the fundamental story of matter, created from energy, the organization of that matter into complex conditions, and then via self-organization into diverse life forms. Humans are as other living things—we are by nature star-born, earth-formed, fitness-maximized, biochemical systems. An aspect of the Epic is the evolution of behavior by that biochemical system.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue – ''Religion is not About God'', Rutgers University Press, 2006, Part 1.1, {{ISBN|0-8135-3955-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Swimme]] sees the Epic as a way to gently maneuver a person into the magnificence of the Universe and as an antidote to the unhealthy consciousness of consumerism. It is the way into the future and enabled him to comprehend the cultural significance of this new story of science moving away from a materialistic worldview. It may move science away from its traditional abstractness to the uniqueness found in natural history. To him evolution and creativity are equivalent so it could be the Epic of Creativity (similar to Gordon Kaufman's thinking). Although the Epic is scientific, it is 'definitely mythic'—it has the fundamental nature of being mythic. "You take hydrogen gas, and you leave it alone, and it turns into rosebuds, giraffes and humans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianswimme.org/media/excerpts.asp  Center for the Story of the Universe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801065326/http://www.brianswimme.org/media/excerpts.asp |date=2009-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon D. Kaufman]] sees the Epic as a serendipitous creative process. He states that it is a notion that can interpret the enormous expansion and complexification of the physical universe (from the Big Bang outward), as well as the evolution of life here on earth and the gradual emergence of human historical existence. The whole vast process manifests (in varying degrees) serendipitous creativity, an everflowing coming into being of new modes of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Kaufman  –  ''God, mystery, diversity: Christian theology in a pluralistic world'', Fortress Press, 1996, page 101–102, {{ISBN|0-8006-2959-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uYKDqTUfshQC] retrieved 3-17-09&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''In the beginning—creativity'', he says this creative process is God. Creativity, as metaphor, and as defined in the concept of evolution, has possibilities for constructing a new concept of God. The most foundational kind of creativity is found in that of cosmos/biological evolution—a paradigm that is now the organizing principle of all the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Kaufman – ''In the beginning—creativity'', Fortress Press, 2004, page x,33,57,137, {{ISBN|0-8006-6093-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wMcBvErCX0C] retrieved 3-17-09]&lt;/ref&gt; It would seem as though he was equating God to the evolutionary story. This is similar to Dowd who sees the facts of Nature as God's native tongue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/node/1634 evolutionary evangelist] retrieved 2009-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Chaisson]] orients his view of the epic around an "arrow of time",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html Two movies: Arrow of Time and Cosmic Origins]&lt;/ref&gt; which he divides into 'Seven Ages of the Cosmos': particulate, galactic, stellar, planetary, chemical, biological, and cultural.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson – Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/splash.html Cosmic Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; However, such a thermodynamic arrow is not intended to be directional, a common misunderstanding; he sees no purpose, plan, or design in evolution, which he regards as unceasing, uncaring, and unpredictable. Chaisson’s strictly scientific analysis of evolution in its broadest sense—[[Cosmic Evolution (book)|cosmic evolution)]]—implies an unidirectional, meandering process extending from the big bang to humankind on Earth, and continuing while likely producing increasing complexity, perhaps forever, to ends unknown. As a physicist, he is perhaps best known for attempting to quantify the epic of evolution, using the currently known laws of science and the scientific method (with its insistence on experimental tests of all ideas, principally those of [[energy rate density]]) in order to empirically discriminate between objective sense and subjective nonsense. What emerges is a grand and inspiring ''scientific'' narrative of who we are and whence we came—the most recent and up-to-date version of this work having been summarized in a long peer-review article.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; DOI:10.1155/2014/384912.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation-evolution controversy==
{{Main|Creation-evolution controversy}}
The creation-evolution controversy goes beyond the field of [[evolutionary biology]] and  includes many fields of science (cosmology, geology, paleontology, thermodynamics, physics and sociobiology).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html ''An Index to Creationist Claims''] , Mark Isaak, [[Talkorigins Archive]],Copyright © 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate is sometimes portrayed as being between science and religion. However, as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] states:
{{quote|Today, many religious denominations accept that biological evolution has produced the diversity of living things over billions of years of Earth’s history. Many have issued statements observing that evolution and the tenets of their faiths are compatible. Scientists and theologians have written eloquently about their awe and wonder at the history of the universe and of life on this planet, explaining that they see no conflict between their faith in God and the evidence for evolution. Religious denominations that do not accept the occurrence of evolution tend to be those that believe in strictly literal interpretations of religious texts.|''Science, Evolution, and Creationism'', National Academy of Sciences&lt;ref&gt;

Dr.[[John Haught]],  Roman Catholic theologian, in his ''Science and Religion: from Conflict to Conversation'' suggests a theistic acceptance of the Epic. He says contemporary theology is being changed by evolutionary science. There are many versions undergoing constant revision. He considers evolution to be, at least provisionally, a most appropriate and fruitful scientific framework within which to think about God today and deplores that contemporary theology gets hung up in the creationism controversy.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Haught – ''Science and Religion: from conflict to conversation'', Paulist Press, 1995, page 69, {{ISBN|0-8091-3606-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Y9JMBqvGlMC]&lt;/ref&gt; There are liberal congregations these days that may see the epic of evolution as a history about life and the universe that is both scientific and sacred. The profoundly sacred elements of the story warm up the cold technical facts with awe and reverence, giving Nature an inspiring beauty.&lt;ref&gt;''The Epic of Evolution'' – A sermon by Douglas Taylor {{cite web |url=http://uubinghamton.org/sermons/17sep2006.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509103858/http://uubinghamton.org/sermons/17sep2006.html |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }} retrieved 3-15-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the Epic's advocates are distinguished scientists. Some are Christians who consider it a 'narrative of mythic proportions' that contain religious aspects. They see it as a multifaceted concept that has been in Christian theology implicitly for hundreds of years and is congenial to perspectives that include ultimacy, transcendence, purpose and morality. However, there are both humanists and creationists who dispute this stance, making unclear the many varied theological stories of our world.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley – [https://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity:,epic+of+evolution&amp;ei=TDbOSaGeLJ2EyATUoOmLCg ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''], Wm.

The '''feminist art movement in the United States''' began in the early 1970s and sought to promote the study, creation, understanding and promotion of women's art. 
First-generation feminist artists include [[Judy Chicago]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], [[Judith Bernstein]], [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville|Sheila de Bretteville]], [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], [[Rachel Rosenthal]], and many other women. They were part of the [[Feminist art movement]] in the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thomas Patin  |author2=Jennifer McLerran  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Artwords: A Glossary of Contemporary Art Theory |location=Westport, CT | publisher=Greenwood | year=1997 |page=55 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/27960870 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement spread quickly through museum protests in both New York (May 1970) and Los Angeles (June 1971), via an early network called W.E.B. ([[West-East Bag]]) that disseminated news of feminist art activities from 1971 to 1973 in a nationally circulated newsletter, and at conferences such as the West Coast Women's Artists Conference held at [[California Institute of the Arts]] (January 21–23, 1972) and the [[Conference on Women in the Visual Arts]], at the [[Corcoran School of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (April 20–22, 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Moravec | first = Michelle | title = Toward a history of feminism, art, and social movements in the United States | journal = [[Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies]] | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 22–54 | doi = 10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0022 | date = 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0022 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We examined the content of the history of art, and we began to make different kinds of art forms based on our experiences as women. So it was both social and something even beyond; in our case, it came back into our own studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Fine Art Meets Craft: The Accessible Works of Joyce Kozloff|url=http://www.aauw.org/2013/08/28/kozloff/|publisher=American Association of University Women|date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feminist Art Movement of the 1970s, within the second wave of feminism, "was a major watershed in women's history and the history of art" and "the personal is political" was its slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Power of Feminist Art: The American Movement of the 1970s, History and Impact|year=1996|publisher=Harry N.

===Key activities===

====''Maintenance Art—Proposal for an Exhibition''====
In 1969 [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]] wrote a manifesto entitled ''Maintenance Art—Proposal for an Exhibition'', challenging the domestic role of women and proclaiming herself a "maintenance artist". Maintenance, for Ukeles, is the realm of human activities that keep things going, such as cooking, cleaning and child-rearing and her performances in the 1970s included the cleaning of art galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bird, Michael Newman, ''Rewriting Conceptual Art'', Reaktion Books, 1999, p114-5. {{ISBN|1-86189-052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her first performance called ''Touch Sanitation'' was from 1979-80.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moussemagazine.it/mierle-laderman-ukeles-maintenance-art-queens-museum-new-york/|title=Mierle Laderman Ukeles "Maintenance Art" at Queens Museum, New York •Mousse Magazine|website=moussemagazine.it|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Art Workers' Coalition demands equal representation for women====
A demand for equality in representation for female artists was codified in the [[Art Workers' Coalition]]'s (AWC) Statement of Demands, which was developed in 1969 and published in definitive form in March 1970. The AWC was set up to defend the rights of artists and force museums and galleries to reform their practices. While the coalition sprung up as a protest movement following Greek kinetic sculptor [[Takis|Panagiotis "Takis" Vassilakis]]'s physical removal of his work Tele-Sculpture(1960) from a 1969 exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, it quickly issued a broad list of demands to 'art museums in general'.

Alongside calls for free admission, better representation of ethnic minorities, late openings and an agreement that galleries would not exhibit an artwork without the artist's consent, the AWC demanded that museums 'encourage female artists to overcome centuries of damage done to the image of the female as an artist by establishing equal representation of the sexes in exhibitions, museum purchases and on selection committees'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Charles|title=Art in theory|date=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0-631-16575-4|pages=901–2|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Initial feminist art classes====
The first women's art class was taught in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College, now [[California State University, Fresno]], by artist [[Judy Chicago]]. It became the [[Feminist Art Program]], a full 15-unit program, in the Spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, [[Chris Rush]], Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. 
Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the [[Feminist Art Program]] (FAP) at [[California Institute of the Arts]]. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{refn|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] [[Gallery 25]] with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

The Fresno Feminist Art Program served as a model for other feminist art efforts, such as [[Womanhouse]], a collaborative feminist art exhibition and the first project produced after the Feminist Art Program moved to the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in the fall of 1971. Womanhouse, like the Fresno project, also developed into a feminist studio space and promoted the concept of collaborative women's art.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"/&gt;

The Feminist Studio Workshop was founded in Los Angeles in 1973 by [[Judy Chicago]], [[Arlene Raven]], and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] as a two-year feminist art program. Women from the program were instrumental in finding and creating the [[Woman's Building]], the first independent center to showcase women's art and culture. Galleries existed there for the entire history of the organization and that was a major venue for exhibiting feminist art.

Art historian [[Arlene Raven]] established the Feminist Art Program in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arlene Raven | editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L. Langer |editor3=Joanna Frueh  |chapter=The Last Essay on Feminist Criticism |title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology|location=New York | publisher=Icon Editions | year=1991 |pages=229–230 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/99908276 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?''====

In 1971, the art historian [[Linda Nochlin]] published the article "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" in ''Woman in Sexist Society,'' which was later reprinted in ''ArtNews,'' where she claimed that there were no "great" women artists at that time, nor in history. By omission, this inferred that artists like [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] and [[Mary Cassatt]] were not considered great. She stated why she felt that there were no great women artists and what organizational and institutional changes needed to take place to create better opportunities for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arlene Raven | editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L. Langer |editor3=Joanna Frueh  |chapter=The Last Essay on Feminist Criticism |title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology|location=New York | publisher=Icon Editions | year=1991 |pages=41–42 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/99908276 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

The author [[Lucy Lippard]] and others identified three tasks to further the understanding and promotion of works by women:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arlene Raven | editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L. Langer |editor3=Joanna Frueh  |chapter=The Last Essay on Feminist Criticism |title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology|location=New York | publisher=Icon Editions | year=1991 |page=100 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/99908276 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Find and present current and historic art works by women
* Develop a more informal language for writing about art by women
* Create theories about the meanings behind women's art and create a history of their works.

====Approaches====
In California, the approach to improve the opportunities for women artists focused on creating venues, such as the [[Woman's Building]] and the Feminist Studio Workshop (FSW), located with the Woman's Building.  Gallery spaces, feminist magazine offices, a bookstore, and a cafe were some of the key uses of the Feminist Studio Workshop.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

Organizations like [[A.I.R. Gallery]] and [[Women Artists in Revolution|Women Artists in Revolution (WAR)]] were formed in New York to provide greater opportunity for female artists and protest for to include works of women artist in art venues that had very few women represented, like [[Whitney Museum]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. In 1970 there was a 23% increase in the number of women artists, and the previous year there was a 10% increase, due to [[Whitney Biennial|Whitney Annual]] (later Whitney Biennial) protests.&lt;ref name="Art Story"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-feminist-art.htm# | title=Feminist art movement | publisher=The Art Story Foundation | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Feminist Art Institute]] opened in June 1979 at 325 Spring Street in the Port Authority Building. The founding members and the initial board of directors were [[Nancy Azara]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], Selena Whitefeather, Lucille Lessane, [[Irene Peslikis]] and Carol Stronghilos.&lt;ref name=Rutgers&gt;Fernanda Perrone, Amy Dawson, and Caroline T. Caviness. [http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/ead/manuscripts/nyfaif.html Inventory to the Records of the New York Feminist Art Institute, 1976-1990.] Administrative History. Rutgers. July 2009. Retrieved January 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A board of advisers was established of accomplished artists, educators and professional women.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt; For instance, feminist writer and arts editor at ''Ms. Magazine'' Harriet Lyons was an adviser from its start.&lt;ref name="Love2006"&gt;Barbara J.

====''Three Weeks in May''====
In 1977, [[Suzanne Lacy]] and collaborator Leslie Labowitz, combined performance art with activism in ''[[Three Weeks in May]]'' on the steps of [[Los Angeles City Hall]]. The performance, which included a map of rapes in the city, and [[self-defense]] classes highlighted [[sexual violence]] against women.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Turning Stereotypes Into Artistic Strengths  |author=Karen Rosenberg |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 28, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/arts/design/28toge.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
''[[The Feminist Art Journal]]'' was a feminist art publication that was produced from 1972 to 1977, and was the first stable, widely read journal of its kind. Beginning in 1975 there were scholarly publications about feminism, feminist art and historic women's art, most notably ''Through the Flower: My Struggle as a Woman Artist'' by [[Judy Chicago]]; and ''Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape'' (1975) by [[Susan Brownmiller]]; ''Woman Artists: 1550-1950'' (1976) about [[Linda Nochlin]] and Ann Sutherland Harris's exhibition; ''From the Center: Feminist Essays in Women's Art'' (1976) by [[Lucy Lippard]]; ''Of Woman Born,'' by [[Adrienne Rich]], ''When God Was a Woman'' (1976) by [[Merlin Stone]]; ''By Our Own Hands'' (1978) by [[Faith Wilding]]; ''Gyn/Ecology'' (1978) by [[Mary Daly]]; and ''Woman and Nature'' by [[Susan Griffin]].&lt;ref name="Visions and Re-visions"&gt;{{cite book | author=Moira Roth | chapter=Visions and Re-Visions: Rosa Luxemburg and the Artist's Mother |title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology |editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L.

In 1977, both ''[[Chrysalis (magazine)|Chrysalis]]'' and ''[[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics]]'' began publication.&lt;ref name="Visions and Re-visions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://helios.hampshire.edu/nomorenicegirls/heretics/#index ''Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics''](1977–92), now the subject of a documentary film, [http://helios.hampshire.edu/nomorenicegirls/heretics/#overview The Heretics].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|''Chrysalis Magazine'' (1977–80), was organized out of the Los Angeles [[Woman's Building]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}|group=nb}}

==1980s==
Feminist art evolved during the 1980s, with a trend away from experiential works and social causes. Instead, there was a trend toward works based upon [[Postmodern theory]] and influenced by [[psychoanalysis]]. Inequal representation in the artworld was a continuing issue.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

===Key activities===

====Guerrilla Girls====
[[Guerrilla Girls]] was formed by 7 women artists in the spring of 1985 in response to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s exhibition "An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture", which opened in 1984. The exhibition was the inaugural show in the MoMA's newly renovated and expanded building, and was planned to be a survey of the most important contemporary artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenson|first=Michael|title=A Living Artists Show at the Modern Museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/21/arts/a-living-artists-show-at-the-modern-museum.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guerrilla Girls have researched sexism and created artworks at the request of various people and institutions, among others, the [[Istanbul Modern]], Istanbul, Witte de With Center for Contemporary Arts, Rotterdam and Fundación Bilbao Arte Fundazioa, Bilbao. They have also partnered with [[Amnesty International]], contributing pieces to a show under the organization's "Protect the Human" initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=16632 |title=Press Releases &amp;#124; Amnesty International UK |publisher=Amnesty.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mass communication====
[[Mass communication]] is "the process by which a person, group of people, or large organization creates a message and transmits it through some type of medium to a large, anonymous, heterogeneous audience." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Media and Mass Communication Theories|date=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=624–628|last1=Pearce|first1=K.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women such as [[Barbara Kruger]] and [[Jenny Holzer]] used forms of graphic mass communication such as refined slogans and graphics to increase awareness of the inequity faced by women artists.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

'''Kiki Smith'''

During the 1970s [[Kiki Smith]] was one of the many artists involved in the collaborative projects. As the art scene became more politicized in the 1980s, Kiki Smith's art work also became more political as well. Her work started "involving issues like abortion, race and AIDS." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/16/arts/art-view-kiki-smith-the-body-as-political-battleground.html&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if she considered herself a feminist artist, Smith responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, I would say that generationally I am, and I would say that without the feminist movement I wouldn't exist; and an enormous amount of the artwork that we take for granted wouldn't exist; and a lot of the subject matter that we assume can be encompassed by art wouldn't exist.  The feminist movement exponentially expanded what art is, and how we look at art, and who is considered to be included in the discourse of art-making. I think that it caused a tremendous, radical change. You don't want to have a cultural notion that one specific gender embodies creativity. All humanity – and all aspects of gender and sexuality and how people define themselves – are inherently creative. It's against the interests of the culture at large not to embrace feminism as a model, just like many other models of liberation, because they don't only liberate women, they liberate everybody.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askyfilledwithshootingstars.com/wordpress/?p=1128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Sister Serpents ====
[[Sister Serpents]] was a radical [[Feminism|feminist]] art collective that began as a small group women in Chicago in the summer of 1989, as a direct response to the [[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]] Supreme Court decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SisterSerpents: A Radical Feminist Art Collective|last=Margolin|first=Victor|date=1992|work=AIGA Journal of Graphic Design|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issue=2|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal as a collective was to empower women and to increase awareness of women's issues through radical art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Hissing with anger: SisterSerpents exhibit art|last=George|first=Erika|date=March 12, 1991|work=The Chicago Maroon|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to use art as a weapon to battle misogyny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Serpentine artists hiss at misogyny|last=Bradley|first=Amanda|date=February 26, 1991|work=The Daily Northwestern|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist art curatorial practices===

====History====

Feminist art curating practices are within a museumism genre, which is a deconstructing of the museum space by curator/artist where the museum looks at itself or the artist/curator looks at the museum.

"If artists as curators of their own exhibition is no longer uncommon, neither is the artist-created museum or collection ... These artists use museological practices to confront the ways in which museums rewrite history through the politics of collecting and presentation ... However, their work often inadvertently reasserts the validity of the museum" (Corrin, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;ref&gt;CORRIN, L. G. (1993). Mining the museum: An installation confronting history. [[Curator: The Museum Journal]], 36(4), 302-313. doi:10.1111/j.2151-6952.1993.tb00804.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klebesadel, Helen (2005). Reframing studio art production and critique. In Janet Marstine (Ed.), New museum theory and practice an introduction (pp. 247-265). Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Katy Deepwell]] documents feminist curating practice and feminist art history with a theoretical foundation that feminist curating is not biologically determinate.&lt;ref&gt;Deepwell, Katy (2005). Feminist curatorial strategies and practices since the 1970s. In Janet Marstine (Ed.), New museum theory and practice an introduction (pp. 64-84). Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Characteristics====

Feminist art curatorial practices are collaborative and reject the notion of an artist as an individual creative genius.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, R., &amp; Pollock, G. (1981). Old mistresses: Women, art and ideology. New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curatorial Collectives and Feminist Politics in 21st Century Europe: An Interview with Kuratorisk Aktion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedlin Hayden, Malin &amp; Sjoholm Skrubbe, Jessica (Eds.).

== Feminist Art Movement in 2018 ==

=== #metoo movement represented in Feminist Art Movement ===
Carnegie Mellon art galleries director Elizabeth Chodos and assistant director Margaret Cox put up a gallery for Faith Wilding's artwork, who was a prominent artist who studied art in the 70's when issues like rape and sexual abuse were too taboo to discuss. She learned to be open with her artwork focusing on female bodies working alongside other female art students. She did however, criticize the fact that most art teachers were male.  The ideas explored in her work offered influence for key elements of the #metoo movement but also recognizes that we still have a long way to go in terms of equality and respect. Wilding's artwork addressed social issues relating to sexual assault that are just now beginning to emerge culturally through #metoo.

'''Flammability diagrams''' show the control of flammability in mixtures of fuel, [[oxygen]] and an inert gas, typically [[nitrogen]].  Mixtures of the three gasses are usually depicted in a triangular diagram, known as a [[ternary plot]].  Such diagrams are available in the speciality literature.&lt;ref&gt;for instance in [[Michael George Zabetakis]]' 1965 work, which remains one of the most widely cited sources of flammability data.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mashuga 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowl 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The same information can be depicted in a normal orthogonal diagram, showing only two substances, implicitly using the feature that the sum of all three components is 100 percent.  The diagrams below only concerns one fuel; the diagrams can be generalized to mixtures of fuels.

==Understanding flammability diagrams==
Triangular diagrams are not commonplace.  The easiest way to understand them is to briefly go through three basic steps in their construction.  
#Consider the first triangular diagram below, which shows all possible mixtures of methane, oxygen and nitrogen.  [[Air]] is a mixture of about 21 volume percent oxygen, and 79 volume percent inerts (nitrogen). Any mixture of methane and air will therefore lie on the straight line between pure methane and pure air - this is shown as the blue air-line.  The upper and lower [[flammability limits]] of methane in air are located on this line, as shown.
#The [[stoichiometric]] combustion of methane is: CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  The stoichiometric concentration of methane in oxygen is therefore 1/(1+2), which is 33 percent.  Any stoichiometric mixture of methane and oxygen will lie on the straight line between pure nitrogen (and zero percent methane) and 33 percent methane (and 67 percent oxygen) - this is shown as the red stoichiometric line.  The upper and lower [[flammability limits]] of methane in oxygen are located on the methane axis, as shown.
#The actual envelope defining the flammability zone can only be determined based on experiments.  The envelope will pass through the upper and lower [[flammability limits]] of methane in oxygen and in air, as shown.  The nose of the envelope defines the [[limiting oxygen concentration]] (LOC)).

A term coined by [[Karl Popper]] in his work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' to denote what he regarded as the main problem of [[methodology]] and the [[philosophy of science]], i.e. to explain and promote the further growth of scientific knowledge. To this purpose, Popper advocated his theory of [[falsifiability]], [[testability]] and testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prb.org 3 Population Bulletin Vol. 61, No. 2 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperthecosis''' (or ovarian hyperthecosis) is [[hyperplasia]] of the [[theca interna]] of the [[ovary]].&lt;ref&gt;Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 21st Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperthecosis occurs when an area of luteinization occurs along with stromal hyperplasia. The luteinized cells produce [[androgens]], which may lead to [[hirsutism]] and [[virilization]] (or masculinization) in affected women.&lt;ref&gt;Stead, Stead, Kaufman, Suarez (2009). First Aid for the Obstretrics &amp; Gynecology Clerkship - Second Edition. McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

The term hyperthecosis refers to the presence of nests of luteinized theca cells in the ovarian stroma due to differentiation of the ovarian interstitial cells into steroidogenically active luteinized stromal cells. These nests or islands of luteinized theca cells are scattered throughout the stroma of the ovary, rather than being confined to areas around cystic follicles as in [[Polycystic ovary syndrome|polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)]]. These luteinized theca cells result in greater production of androgens.

Seen as a severe form of PCOS, the clinical features of hyperthecosis are similar to those of PCOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Cunxian|last2=Sung|first2=C. James|last3=Quddus|first3=M.

== Cause ==
The etiology of hyperthecosis is unknown, however evidence suggests a possibility of genetic transmission. Hyperthecosis has been documented in familiar patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21998336_Hyperthecosis_an_inheritable_form_of_polycystic_ovarian_disease|title=Hyperthecosis: an inheritable form of polycystic ovarian disease|last=Wilroy|first=R.S.|date=February 1975|website=ResearchGate|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insulin resistance]] may also play a role in the pathogenesis of hyperthecosis.

== Prognosis ==
Although no large studies showing the long term outcomes for women with hyperthecosis exist, a diagnosis of hyperthecosis may suggest an increased risk for metabolic complications of [[hyperlipidemia]] and [[type 2 diabetes]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Micol S.|last2=Wierman|first2=Margaret E.|date=2011-08-01|title=How should postmenopausal androgen excess be evaluated?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2265.2011.04040.x/abstract|journal=Clinical Endocrinology|language=en|volume=75|issue=2|pages=160–164|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2265.2011.04040.x|issn=1365-2265}}&lt;/ref&gt; In postmenopausal women, hyperthecosis may also contribute to the pathogenesis of endometrial polyp, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrioid adenocarcinoma due to the association of hyperestrinism (excess estrins in the body) and hyperthecosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Cunxian|last2=Sung|first2=C.

'''''In vitro'' [[toxicology testing|toxicity testing]]''' is the [[scientific]] [[Scientific method|analysis]] of the effects of [[toxic]] [[chemical substance]]s on cultured [[bacteria]] or [[mammalian]] [[cell (biology)|cells]].  ''[[In vitro]]'' (literally 'in glass') testing methods are employed primarily to identify potentially hazardous chemicals and/or to confirm the lack of certain toxic properties in the early stages of the development of potentially useful new substances such as therapeutic [[Medication|drugs]], [[agricultural]] chemicals and food additives.

''In vitro'' assays for xenobiotic toxicity are recently carefully considered by key government agencies (e.g. EPA; NIEHS/NTP; FDA), to better assess human risks.  There are substantial activities in using in vitro systems to advance mechanistic understanding of toxicant activities, and the use of human cells and tissue to define human-specific toxic effects.&lt;ref&gt;

==Improvement over animal testing==

Most toxicologists believe that ''in vitro'' toxicity testing methods can be more useful, more time and cost-effective than toxicology studies in living animals (which are termed ''in vivo'' or "in life" methods). However, the [[In vitro to in vivo extrapolation|extrapolation from ''in vitro'' to ''in vivo'']] requires some careful consideration and is an active research area.

Due to regulatory constraints and ethical considerations, the quest for alternatives to animal testing has gained a new momentum. In many cases the in vitro tests are better than animal tests because they can be used to develop safer products.&lt;ref&gt;

==Example cell viability (cytotoxicity) assays used for ''in-vitro'' toxicology==
Many methods of analysis exist for [[assay]]ing test substances for cytotoxicity and other cellular responses.

===MTT===
MTT assay is used often in determining cell [[Viability assay|viability]] and has been validated for use by international organisations.  MTT assay involves two steps of introducing the assay to the chemicals and then a solubilisation step.

===MTS===
The [[colorimetric]] MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium) in vitro assay is an updated version of the validated MTT method, MTS assay has the advantage of being soluble. Hence, no solubilisation step is required.

===ATP===
[[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] assay has the main advantage of providing results quickly (within 15 minutes) and only requires fewer sample cells.  The assay performs lysis on the cells and the following chemical reaction between the assay and ATP content of cells produces luminescence.  The amount of luminescence is then measured by a photometer and can be translated into number cells alive since
*ATP assay assumes alive cells still have ATP inside them, and
*Luminescence level recorded is proportional to the ATP content in the sample cells.

===Neutral Red===
Another cell viability endpoint can be [[Neutral Red]] (NR) uptake.  Neutral Red, a weak cationic dye penetrates cellular membranes by non-diffusion and accumulates intercelluarly in lysosomes.  Viable cells take up the NR dye, damaged or dead cells do not.

===Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)===
[[ELISA]] kits can be used to examine up and down regulation of proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines (IL-1, TNF alpha, PGE2)....

Measurement of these types of cellular responses can be windows into the interaction of the test article on the test models (monolayer cell cultures, 3D tissue models, tissue explants).

== Types of ''in vitro'' studies ==
Broadly speaking, there are two different types of ''in vitro'' studies depending on the type system developed to perform the experiment. The two types of systems generally used are : a) Static well plate system and b) the multi-compartmental perfused systems.

=== Static well plate system ===
The static well plate or layer systems are the most traditional and simplest form of assays widely used for in vitro study. These assays are quite beneficial as they are quite simple and provide a very accessible testing environment for monitoring chemicals in the culture medium as well as in the cell. However the disadvantage of using these simple static well plate assays is that, they cannot represent the cellular interactions and physiologic fluid flow conditions taking place inside the body.

=== Multi-compartmental perfused systems ===
New testing platforms are now developed to solve problems related to cellular interactions. These new platforms are much more complex based on multi-compartmental perfused systems.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

|volume=20
|issue=2-3
|pages=143–148
|doi=10.1016/j.bej.2003.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The main objective of these systems is  to reproduce in vivo mechanisms more reliably by providing cell culture environment close to the in vivo situation. Each compartment in the system represent a specific organ of the living organism and thus each compartment has a specific characteristics and criteria. Each compartment in these systems are connected by tubes and pumps through which the fluid flows thus mimicking the blood flow in the in vivo situation. The draw back behind the use of these perfused systems is that, the adverse effects ( influence of both the biological and non-biological components of the system on the fate of the chemical under study) are more compared to the static systems. In order to reduce the effect of non-biological components of the system, all the compartments are made of glass and the connecting tubes are made up of teflon. A number of kinetic models have been proposed to take care of these non-specific bindings taking place in these in vitro systems.&lt;ref&gt;

To improve the biological difficulties arising from the use of different culture in vitro conditions, the traditional models used in flasks or micro-well plates has to be modified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">[[File:Kussner effect.svg|thumb|right|An airfoil flying into a gust region. The airfoil speed is denoted with ''V'' and is constant, the [[lift (force)|lift force]] on the airfoil is given by ''L'', and its [[pitching moment]] by ''M''. The gust has a transverse (vertical) velocity ''w'', which is assumed to be a constant in the gust region, left of the dashed line.]] 
In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Küssner effect''' describes the [[wikt:unsteady|unsteady]] [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] [[force]]s on an [[airfoil]] or [[hydrofoil]] caused by encountering a transverse [[Wind#Measurement|gust]]. This is directly related to the '''Küssner function''', used in describing the effect. Both the effect and function are named after [[Hans Georg Küssner]] (1900–1984), a German [[aerodynamics]] engineer.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschel, Prem and Madelung (2004) p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Küssner derived an approximate model for an airfoil encountering a sudden step-like change in the transverse gust [[velocity]] — or, equivalently, as seen from a [[frame of reference]] moving with the airfoil: a sudden change in the [[angle of attack]]. The airfoil is modelled as a flat plate in a [[potential flow]], moving with constant horizontal velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Cebeci (2005) pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; For this case he derived the [[impulse response function]] — known as Küssner function&lt;ref&gt;Bisplinghoff, Ashley and Halfman (1996) pp. 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt; — needed to compute the unsteady [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[torque|moment]] exerted by the air on the airfoil.

'''Legal science''' is one of the main components in the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition (after [[Roman law]], [[canon law]], [[commercial law]], and the legacy of the revolutionary period).

Legal science is primarily the creation of German legal scholars of the middle and late nineteenth century, and it evolved naturally out of the ideas of [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]].  Savigny argued that German codification should not follow the rationalist and [[secular natural law]] thinking that characterized the French codification but should be based on the principles of law that had historically been in force in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Merryman et al., The Civil Law Tradition: Europe, Latin America, and East Asia, Cases and Materials 481 (LexisNexis ed., 1994) (reprinted 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is considered to be one of the most notorious metal pollutants present in food, water, air and soil, but the process of eliminating it is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Li B, Zhang Y, Ma D, Shi Z, Ma S. Mercury Nano-Trap for Effective and Efficient Removal of Mercury (II) from Aqueous Solution. Nature Communications 2014 November 20; 5(5537): 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy metals such as mercury are formed on the earth's crust and made into solutions with ground water through certain natural processing and pH changes occurring in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston N. Nanomaterials: Nano-selenium captures mercury. Nature Nanotechnology 2008 09;3(9):527–528.&lt;/ref&gt; There are traditional methods that are used to extract mercury from the natural water sources and industrial waste water, such as [[chemical precipitation]], [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgamation]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[membrane filtration]] and photochemical methods.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker P. Purification at the Nano Scale. The Futurist 2011 Jul;45(4):11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. W. Chang, "Neurotoxic effects of mercury—A review," Environmental Research, vol. 14, no. 3, pp. 329–373, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Q. Wang, D. Kim, D. D. Dionysiou, G. A. Sorial, and D. Timberlake, "Sources and remediation for mercury contamination in aquatic systems—a literature review," Environmental Pollution, vol. 131, no. 2, pp. 323–336, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these methods are expensive, time consuming, and inefficient, hence the need for a nanofiltration technology that overcomes all of these issues.  Nanofiltration technology is very efficient in removal of mercury species due to its characteristics of having high surface area-to-volume and the fact that it's easily chemically functionalized.&lt;ref&gt;Hashim MA, Mukhopadhyay S, Sahu NJ, Sengupta B. Remediation Technologies for Heavy Metal Contaminated Groundwater. Journal of Environmental Management. 2011, June 25; 92(2011): 2355–2388.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Brownian motion of nanomaterials allows them to scan large volume of solvent in short times. There are many copolymer nanoparticles (NPs) that can be used as scavengers to eliminate mercury species via redox reactions such as selenium NPs, manganese dioxide nanowhiskers, carbon nanotube−silverNP composites, silver NPs, silver NP-decorated silicaspheres, gold NP-based materials.  Among these adsorbents, citrate-capped gold NP-based materials have been used intensively to capture mercury species from nature water.

'''Instrumentation'''

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is used to obtain the HRTEM images (FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin working at 200 kV) and double beam UV-visible spectrophotometer is used for the extinction, or removal, of the NPs gold spectra.&lt;ref&gt;Shih YC, Ke CY, Yu CJ, Lu CY, Tseng WL. Combined tween 20-stabilized gold nanoparticles and reduced graphite oxide-Fe3O4 nanoparticle composites for rapid and efficient removal of mercury species from a complex matrix. ACS Applied Mater Interfaces 2014 October 22; 6(20): 17437-17445.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of scanning electron microscope and an energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) for obtaining EDX spectra while sub micrometer particle size analyzer and Delsa nano zeta potential measure the potential of gold NPs. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measures the quantification of mercury species in gold NPs while the linear range of Hg2+ should be between 2.5 and 50 nM. The powder X-ray diffraction is measured using a diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. A superconducting quantum interference device measures the magnetometry while the Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy spectrum is measured by a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer.

'''Removal of mercury species'''
[[File:Mercurynanotrapfigure2.png|thumb|Figure 2: Procedure associated with the removal of Hg2+ by the combination of Tween 20-Au NPs and reduced graphite-Fe3O4 NP composites]]

The application of an external magnetic field helps reduce the Fe3O4 NP compositions and can be used to remove the citrate capped gold NPs or Tween 20- Au NPs. The quantity of the Hg2+ is determined by ICP-MS. Elimination efficiency is calculated as:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;Elimination Efficiency (%) = [(Co – C)/ Co] x 100&lt;/div&gt;

The equilibrium absorption capacity was determined by:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;qe = (Co – Ce) x (V/W)&lt;/div&gt;

where qe is the equilibrium absorption capacity, Ce is the concentration of Hg2+, V is the volume of the solution and W is the weight of Tween 20-Au NPs. Other metals in place of mercury can be used to determine the reusability of the nanofiltration method. A simple nanofiltration process is illustrated in Figure 2.

[[File:Mercurynanotrapfigure3.png|thumb|Figure 3:A highly porous framework such as water is treated with mercury chelating groups, which serve as the "mercury nano trap". These chelating groups hold tightly onto Hg (II) ions, removing it from the water.]]When purifying mercury from sea water, a decrease in the volume to surface area ratio leads to a decline in the efficiency of the elimination.7 Cost efficiency of the nanotrap process is indicated in the fact that the materials can be reused to recycle more water. Tween 20-Au NPs are rapid, efficient and selective in capturing Hg2+ in high salt water concentration when the gold NPs catalyze the citrate ion induced reduction of Hg2+ to Hg0.&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Zhang, J. O. Nriagu, and H. Itoh, "Mercury removal from water using activated carbons derived from organic sewage sludge," Water Research, vol. 39, no. 2–3, pp. 389–395, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; ICP-MS is used to quantify the Hg2+ concentration to determine the level of elimination efficiency. Figure 3 shows an illustration process of the nano trap filtration process.

The use of nanomaterials in removing the mercury from water is advantageous because of the high surface area to volume ratio and the fact that they are easily chemically functionalized. Nanomaterials capture five times more mercury than the maximum mercury captured predicted through the use of previous mercury filtration systems.&lt;ref&gt;Kuriyama M, Haruta K, Dairaku T, Kawamura T, Kikkawa S, Inamoto K, Tsukamoto H, Kondo Y, Torigoe H, Okamoto I, Ono A, Morita EH, Tanaka Y: Hg2+-trapping beads: Hg2+-specific recognition through thymine-Hg(II)-thymine base pairing. Chem Pharm Bull; 2014;62(7):709–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other NP-based methods for Hg2+ removal from high salt matrix, Tween 20-Au NPs is a rapid and selective technique with high efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Ojea-Jiménez, Xicoténcatl López, Jordi Arbiol, and Victor Puntes: Citrate-Coated Gold Nanoparticles As Smart Scavengers for Mercury(II) Removal from Polluted Waters. ACS Nano 2012 6 (3), 2253–60.&lt;/ref&gt; For purification of drinking water, it is advisable to use nano-tablets with the filters because they are easily accessible and cost efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Heidarpour F, Karim WA, Fakhru'l-razi A, Sobri S, Heydarpour V, Zargar M, et al. Complete removal of pathogenic bacteria from drinking water using nano silver-coated cylindrical polypropylene filters. Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy 2011 06;13(3):499–507.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nano-tablet purifies drinking water. Appr Technol 2013 06;40(2):13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==WNZR==
WNZR, operating at a frequency of 90.9 FM MHz, signed on the air in October, 1986. The station is owned and operated by Mount Vernon Nazarene University. The station's studios are located in Founders Hall and are part of the University's Communication Department and the School of Arts and Humanities. WNZR's broadcast tower and transmitter building is located off of Glen Road on the east end of the campus. The station serves a dual purpose as a laboratory for [[radio broadcasting]] classes and a broadcast ministry of MVNU.
 
WNZR is licensed by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] as a [[Non-commercial educational|non-commercial educational (NCE) station]], and is located in the NCE range of the FM bandwidth. WNZR was originally licensed to operate around 140 watts. In May 2008, the station was approved for a power increase up to 1300 watts and went live with a new transmitter on May 21, 2010. WNZR's signal now reaches into bordering counties (Licking, Morrow, and Richland).

== NanoDays ==
[[File:Official logo for NanoDays.png|thumb|left|]]
NISE Network is the originator of the national NanoDays initiative - an annual, nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering, and its potential impact on the future.  NanoDays events take place at more than 200 science and children's museums, research centers, and universities throughout the United States, from Puerto Rico to Hawaii.  NanoDays engages people of all ages in learning about this emerging field of science through hands-on experiments, stage performances, and other programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nisenet.org/nanodays  NISE Network, NanoDays Page, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatisnano.org/nanodays  NanoDays, Public Page, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancastersciencefactory.org/index.php?pID=44 Lancaster Science Factory, NanoDays 2011, March 15, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seattle PI, A Giant Subject is Scaled Down to Kid Size at NanoDays, April 3, 2008, [http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/article/A-giant-scientific-subject-is-scaled-down-to-kid-1269143.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art Daily, Smithsonian Offers Activities and Experiments during NanoDays 2010, 2010 [http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=36930]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first nationwide week of events took place in 2008, with more than 100 institutions participating.  This has grown to more than 250 events annually in the United States nationwide.  A list of   [http://www.nisenet.org/nanodays participating NanoDays organizations] is available.

==''Nano'' mini-exhibition==
[[File:Nano mini exhibition logo.png|thumb|left|upright|Logo for the ''Nano'' mini-exhibition]]
Developed by the NISE Network, [http://www.whatisnano.org/nano-exhibit ''Nano''] is an interactive exhibition that engages family audiences in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. Hands-on exhibits present the basics of nanoscience and engineering, introduce some real world applications, and explore the societal and ethical implications of this new technology.  

''Nano'' was created by the Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE Network) with support from the National Science Foundation. The ''Nano'' exhibition is intended for long-term display in museums across the United States, where it will engage millions of people. Up to seventy copies of ''Nano'' will be fabricated; all copies will be identical and distributed to museum partners free of charge. The exhibition complements NanoDays events and other NISE Network educational experiences.

Exhibit components include: '''What happens when things get smaller?''' - visitors see how magnetite behaves differently when its particles are different sizes; '''What's new about nano?''' - visitors build a model of a giant carbon nanotube; '''Where can you find nano?''' - visitors try a series of interactive challenges, then search a complex image to find examples of real nano products and phenomena; and finally, '''What does nano mean for us?''' - visitors balance blocks on a tippy table, which represents the challenges of working together to build a stable nano future.  There is also a seating area where visitors can learn more about nano through books and reading boards.  

Nano was supported by the National Science Foundation under Award Nos. ESI-0532536 and 0940143.

==Nano Education Materials for K-12 Teachers==

The NISE Network along with other leading Informal Science Education Institutions have developed many [http://www.nisenet.org/community/k-12-teachers curriculum and activity resources] for teachers to use in their classrooms.  Resources include hands-on experiments, videos, and posters, among other materials.

The '''National Council for Educational Technology''' provided advice and support for schools and colleges in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland on [[educational technology]], in particular the use of computers for teaching and learning.

The [[Department for Education and Science]] merged the [[Council for Educational Technology]] and the [[Microelectronics Education Support Unit|MESU]] in 1989. The civil servant Noel Thompson, who promoted this change, became its first Chief Executive. It carried out evaluations of new technologies such as CD-ROMs, laptop computers and researched the effectiveness of different methods and techniques.  It promoted the use of educational technology through publications, events, TV programmes.

==Structure and Governance==
NCET was a charitable trust funded by government and formally a [[Non-Departmental Public Body]].  It had a Council (acting as the organisation's Board of Directors), whose Chairman and Chief Executive were responsible to the Secretaries of State of the Education Departments in England, Northern Ireland and Wales.  Its work was outlined in an annual priorities letter from the Department and a senior civil servant and HMI sat on its Board.

==People==

===Chief Executives===
The Chief Executive was employed by the NCET Council to run the organisation and deliver its programme of work.
* Noel Thompson 1989-91	
* Graham Walters (acting) 1991	 	 
* Margaret Bell 1992-1997
* Mike Littlewood (acting) 1997	 	 
* Owen Lynch 1997

===Chairmen===
The Chairmen were unpaid, except for their expenses, they chaired the Council and met with Ministers to agree the work of the organisation. 
* Don Gratton 1989-90 - was a BBC Executive
* Margaret Parkes 1990-92 - Lady Parkes chaired the original Technology National Curriculum Working Party	 	
* John Richards 1992-95 
* Heather Du Quesnay 1995-97 was Director of Education for Lambeth  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/organisations/ncet.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluations==
With the increased resource being provided to schools for educational technology the NCET took on a role of piloting and evaluating new technologies.  NCET’s role was to provide appropriate evaluative evidence to them to ensure that this money was well spent.  It also looked to help grow viable and appropriate commercial markets for IT products and through a number of NCET managed pilots and procurements it stimulated specific areas, for example, the introduction of CD-ROMs into schools.  Similar initiatives of varying scales and technologies including portable computers for teachers, communications technologies, multimedia desktop computers, satellite technologies and integrated learning systems all contributed to keeping UK schools up to date with the changing pace of the technology during the 1990s.

==Research==
As well as providing equipment and materials it was also part of NCET's brief to collate and disseminate research and case study evidence on the impact of IT on learning and educational institutions and to produce support materials for them.  This included support for the Education Department's Superhighways Initiative from 1995-7 which ran 22 projects-supported by £12 million from commercial sponsors-that focus on the application of electronic communications in schools and colleges.

==Publications==
Managing IT
Inspecting IT

==NCET-TV==
NCET-TV was a series of educational TV programmes aimed at helping the UK's teachers gain relevant IT skills.  As part of BBC 2's The Learning Zone, the programmes will be transmitted on the first Wednesday of each month at 4.00am.

==Renaming to form Becta==
Dennis Stevenson was asked by Tony Blair in 1996 to look at the use of computers in schools.  He set up an independent enquiry, a panel of experts who took evidence from a wide range of bodies and individuals and published his report&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson D. (1997) 'Information and Communications Technology in UK Schools, An Independent Enquiry' March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; in March 1997, just in time for the forthcoming election. Following the election Dennis Stevenson advised the UK Government that NCET could be a useful organisation, but it needed to be more closely aligned to government and should be restructured. The organisation was renamed the [[Becta|British Educational Communications Technology Agency]] (Becta), restructured and given the task of developing  "The National Grid for Learning"  (NGfL).

A '''natural region''' is a basic geographic unit. Usually it is a [[region]] which is distinguished by its common natural features of [[geography]], [[geology]], and [[climate]]. 

From the [[ecology|ecological]] point of view, the naturally occurring flora and fauna of the region are likely to be influenced by its geographical and geological factors, such as [[soil]] and [[water resources|water availability]], in a significant manner. Thus most natural regions are homogeneous [[ecosystem]]s. Human impact can be an important factor in the shaping and destiny of a particular natural region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1739/ UNESCO - Natural and Cultural Landscape of Danube Region]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are 11 major regions in the world.

The concept "natural region" may refer to a large, poor area, or to a large basic geographical unit, like the vast [[boreal forest]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/natural-regions Natural Regions - The Canadian Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also be used generically, like in [[alpine tundra]], or specifically to refer to a particular place.

The term is particularly useful where there is no corresponding or coterminous official region. [[The Fens]] of eastern [[England]], the [[Thai highlands]], and the [[Pays de Bray]] in Normandy, are examples of this. Others might include regions with particular geological characteristics, like [[badlands]], such as the [[Bardenas Reales]], an upland [[massif]] of acidic rock, or [[The Burren]], in [[Ireland]].

'''Necrofauna''' are species that were previously [[extinct]] and have been biologically revived or recreated by the process of [[de-extinction]].

Necrofauna are proxies or imitations of their former species and not identical replicas. Due to a number of technological, biological and environmental factors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/science/revive-restore-extinct-species-dna-mammoth-passenger-pigeon.html|title=We Might Soon Resurrect Extinct Species. Is It Worth the Cost?|last=Yin|first=Steph|date=2017-03-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are considered a new type organism altogether. [[De-extinction|Revive and Restore]], a nonprofit organization that supports pursuing de-extinction research with transparency to the public, describes the creation of necrofauna as a result of “transfer[ing] the [[gene]]s that define the extinct species into the [[genome]] of the related species, effectively converting it into a living version of the extinct creature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reviverestore.org/what-we-do/genetic-rescue/|title=What is Genetic Rescue? – Revive &amp; Restore|date=2013-09-27|work=Revive &amp; Restore|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the existence of necrofauna is still largely [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]], a [[Pyrenean ibex]] was the first and only animal to have undergone the de-extinction process with moderate success.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090210-bucardo-clone_2.html|title=First Extinct-Animal Clone Created|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "unextinct" or revived animal was born, but then died several minutes later due to a lung defect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piña-Aguilar|first=Raul E.|last2=Lopez-Saucedo|first2=Janet|last3=Sheffield|first3=Richard|last4=Ruiz-Galaz|first4=Lilia I.|last5=de J.

Necrofauna and the de-extinction movement are highly [[Controversy|controversial]] within [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and scientific circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minteer|first=Ben|date=2014-05-15|title=Is it right to reverse extinction?|url=https://www.nature.com/news/is-it-right-to-reverse-extinction-1.15212|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=509|issue=7500|pages=261–261|doi=10.1038/509261a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many conservationists argue that creating necrofauna could potentially distract from the urgency of saving [[endangered species]] that are still alive. Concerns have also been raised pertaining to the possible damaging impacts [[ecology]] could face in the wake of introducing a new species into an environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Alexandre|last2=Thévenin|first2=Charles|last3=Princé|first3=Karine|last4=Sarrazin|first4=François|last5=Clavel|first5=Joanne|date=2017-05-01|title=De-extinction and evolution|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12723/abstract|journal=Functional Ecology|language=en|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1031|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12723|issn=1365-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The term ''necrofauna'' is a [[portmanteau]] consisting of two [[morphemes]]. The first morpheme, “necro,” comes from the Greek prefix [[wikt:necro-#Prefix|''necro'']], meaning death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=necro-|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/necr-|website=Merriam Webstar|publisher=Merriam Webster Incorporated|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; “[[Fauna]],” meanwhile, refers to the animals that inhabit a particular time period or environment and is derived from the Greek name [[Fauna (deity)|''Fauna'']], the Roman goddess of earth and fertility.

[[Alex Steffen]] is referred to as the first person to coin the [[neologism]] “necrofauna” in Jason Mark’s ''[[Earth Island Institute|Earth Island Journal]]'' article titled “Back From the Dead.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mark|first1=Jason|title=Back From the Dead|journal=Earth Island Journal|date=September 3, 2013|issue=Autumn 2013|url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/back_from_the_dead/|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was used in the context of describing the phenomenon of "charismatic necrofauna," which expresses the possibility that only certain charismatic species may be chosen as candidates for de-extinction based on human preferences, or that such resurrection efforts could distract from helping less "charismatic" species that are currently endangered.

A '''panicle''' is a much-branched [[inflorescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hickey, M. |author2=King, C. |year=2001  |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors distinguish it from a compound spike, by requiring that the [[flower]]s (and [[fruit]]) be [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicellate]]. The branches of a panicle are often [[raceme]]s. A panicle may have determinate or indeterminate growth.

This type of inflorescence is largely characteristic of grasses such as [[oat]] and [[crabgrass]],&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the inflorescence unit in a grass is the spikelet, but the arrangement of spikelets may be described as a panicle.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other plants such as [[pistachio]] and [[mamoncillo]]. Botanists use the term ''paniculate'' in two ways: "having a true panicle inflorescence" as well as "having an inflorescence with the form but not necessarily the structure of a panicle".

A [[corymb]] may have a paniculate branching structure, with the lower flowers having longer [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]] than the upper, thus giving a flattish top superficially resembling an [[umbel]]. Many species in the subfamily [[Amygdaloideae]], such as [[Crataegus|hawthorn]]s and [[rowan]]s, produce their flowers in corymbs.

'''Philip Layton Barlow'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Summaries of Doctoral Dissertations | journal=[[Harvard Theological Review]] | volume=82 | issue=4 | date=October 1989 | page=477 | jstor=1510113 | doi=10.1017/s0017816000030686}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 1950) is a [[Harvard]]-trained scholar who specializes in [[American Religious History]], religious geography, and [[Mormonism]]. In 2007 he became the country’s first full-time professor of Mormon studies at a secular university by being appointed as the [[Leonard J. Arrington]] Chair of Mormon History and Culture at [[Utah State University]].

==Biography==

Barlow was raised in [[Bountiful, Utah]]. In 1975, he graduated with a B.A. in History from [[Weber State College]]. In 1980 and 1988, respectively, he received his Masters in Theological Studies and Doctorate of Theology (Th.D.) from the [[Harvard Divinity School]]. While in the Boston area, Barlow taught at the local LDS [[Institute of Religion]].  He also served as a counselor in a bishopric to [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865561162/As-a-Mormon-leader-Bishop-Mitt-Romney-grew-learned-from-broadened-experiences.html Erik Schulzke "As a Mormon leader, Romney grew, learned from broadened experiences" ''Deseret News'' Aug 24, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the completion of his education, he served in consecutive years as a Mellon Post-doctoral Fellow at the [[University of Rochester]]. Prior to his arrival at [[Utah State University]], Barlow spent 17 years in the Department of Theological Studies at [[Hanover College]] in Indiana.

In 2017 Barlow held the first fellowship at the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.hjnews.com/allaccess/usu-mormon-scholar-tapped-for-new-byu-fellowship/article_5607c985-6d9e-591e-929d-dd487df85640.html announcement on Barlow's fellowship appointment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==

Barlow's research interests have ranged over American religious and historical geography, concepts of “time” in secular and religious society, the problem of suffering and evil, and Mormon theology and practice.  Barlow's first book, ''[[Mormons]] and the [[Bible]]: The Place of the Latter-day Saints in American Religion'' (Oxford, 1991, 1997) analyzed Latter-day Saint uses of the biblical text, including issues revolving around the LDS Church’s official backing of the King James translation.  In 1992, the [[Mormon History Association]] awarded the volume its Best First Book Award.    His second book, the ''New Historical Atlas of Religion in America'' (co-authored with Edwin Scott Gaustad), examined the implications of religion’s connections with “place” and created hundreds of maps portraying the religious composition of the United States over time.  The Association of American Publishers named the work the “Best Single-volume Reference Book in the Humanities” for 2001.

==The Arrington Chair of Mormon History and Culture==

The establishment in 2007 of the Arrington Chair at Utah State University is one prominent symbol of a new era for the study of the Mormon faith in secular higher education.  It is part of the new Religious Studies Program at the University, the first program in Utah enabling students to major in religion.  Since the establishment in 2007 of the Arrington Chair, [[Richard Bushman]] has been inaugurated as the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at [[Claremont Graduate University]] of Religion, [[Utah Valley University]] has continued to offer its students a minor in Religious Studies, the [[University of Utah]] has recently followed suit, with both programs showing interest in Mormonism, and the [[University of Wyoming]] is working to gather funds for a professorship in Mormon studies.

==Academic service==

In 2006, Philip Barlow was President of the [[Mormon History Association]], and currently serves on the Boards of Directors for the Society for Mormon Philosophy and Theology and the [[Dialogue Foundation]], on the Steering Committee for the [[American Academy of Religion]]’s new Consultation in Mormon Studies, and as a member of the editorial board of the Intermountain West Journal of Religious Studies.

'''Pictorialism''' is the name given to an international style and aesthetic movement that dominated [[photography]] during the later 19th and early 20th centuries. There is no standard definition of the term, but in general it refers to a style in which the photographer has somehow manipulated what would otherwise be a straightforward photograph as a means of "creating" an image rather than simply recording it. Typically, a pictorial photograph appears to lack a sharp focus (some more so than others), is printed in one or more colors other than black-and-white (ranging from warm brown to deep blue) and may have visible brush strokes or other manipulation of the surface. For the pictorialist, a photograph, like a painting, drawing or engraving, was a way of projecting an emotional intent into the viewer's realm of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Daum, p 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Pictorialism as a movement thrived from about 1885 to 1915, although it was still being promoted by some as late as the 1940s. It began in response to claims that a photograph was nothing more than a simple record of reality, and transformed into an international movement to advance the status of all photography as a true art form. For more than three decades painters, photographers and art critics debated opposing artistic philosophies, ultimately culminating in the acquisition of photographs by several major art museums.

Pictorialism gradually declined in popularity after 1920, although it did not fade out of popularity until the end of [[World War II]]. During this period the new style of photographic [[Modernism]] came into vogue, and the public's interest shifted to more sharply focused images. Several important 20th-century photographers began their careers in a pictorialist style but transitioned into sharply focused photography by the 1930s.

==Overview==

[[Image:Watson-Schutze-Rose.jpg|thumb|upright|"The Rose", by [[Eva Watson-Schütze]], 1905]]

Photography as a technical process involving the development of film and prints in a darkroom originated in the early 19th century, with the forerunners of traditional photographic prints coming into prominence around 1838 to 1840. Not long after the new medium was established, photographers, painters and others began to argue about the relationship between the scientific and artistic aspects of the medium. As early as 1853, English painter William John Newton proposed that the camera could produce artistic results if the photographer would keep an image slightly out of focus.&lt;ref&gt;Doty, p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Others vehemently believed  that a photograph was equivalent to the visual record of a chemistry experiment. Photography historian Naomi Rosenblum points out that "the dual character of the medium — its capacity to produce both art and document — [was] demonstrated soon after its discovery&amp;nbsp;... Nevertheless, a good part of the nineteenth century was spent debating which of these directions was the medium's true function."&lt;ref&gt;In Johnson, p 121&lt;/ref&gt;

These debates reached their peak during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, culminating in the creation of a movement that is usually characterized as a particular style of photography: pictorialism. This style is defined first by a distinctly personal expression that emphasizes photography's ability  to create visual beauty rather than simply record facts.&lt;ref&gt;McCarroll, p 17&lt;/ref&gt; However, recently historians have recognized that pictorialism is more than just a visual style. It evolved in direct context with the changing social and cultural attitudes of the time, and, as such, it should not be characterized simply as a visual trend. One writer has noted that pictorialism was "simultaneously a movement, a philosophy, an aesthetic and a style."&lt;ref&gt;Nordström and David Wooters. "Crafting the Art of the Photograph." In Pardon, p 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what some histories of photography portray, pictorialism did not come about as the result of a linear evolution of artistic sensibilities; rather, it was formed through "an intricate, divergent, often passionately conflicting barrage of strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Sternberger, p xi&lt;/ref&gt; While photographers and others debated whether photography could be art, the advent of photography directly affected the roles and livelihoods of many traditional artists. Prior to the development of photography, a painted [[Portrait miniature|miniature portrait]] was the most common means of recording a person's likeness. Thousands of painters were engaged in this art form. But photography quickly negated the need for and interest in miniature portraits. One example of this effect was seen at the annual exhibition of the [[Royal Academy]] in London; in 1830 more than 300 miniature paintings were exhibited, but by 1870 only 33 were on display.&lt;ref&gt;Harker, p 16&lt;/ref&gt; Photography had taken over for one type of art form, but the question of whether photography itself could be artistic had not been resolved.

Some painters soon adopted photography as a tool to help them record a model's pose, a landscape scene or other elements to include in their art. It's known that many of the great 19th-century painters, including [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Gustav Courbet|Courbet]], [[Manet]], [[Degas]], [[Cézanne]], and [[Gauguin]], took photographs themselves, used photographs by others and incorporated images from photographs into their work.&lt;ref&gt;Scharf, p&amp;nbsp;10–12&lt;/ref&gt; While heated debates about the relationship between photography and art continued in print and in lecture halls, the distinction between a photographic image and a painting became more and more difficult to discern. As photography continued to develop, the interactions between painting and photography became increasingly reciprocal.&lt;ref name="Harker, p 19"&gt;Harker, p 19&lt;/ref&gt; More than a few pictorial photographers, including [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[Gertrude Käsebier]], [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]], and [[Sarah Choate Sears]], were originally trained as painters or took up painting in addition to their photographic skills.

It was during this same period that cultures and societies around the world were being affected by a rapid increase in intercontinental travel and commerce. Books and magazines published on one continent could be exported and sold on another with increasing ease, and the development of reliable mail services facilitated individual exchanges of ideas, techniques and, most importantly for photography, actual prints. These developments led to pictorialism being "a more international movement in photography than almost any other photographic genre."&lt;ref&gt;McCarroll, p 10&lt;/ref&gt; Camera clubs in the U.S., England, France, Germany, Austria, Japan and other countries regularly lent works to each other's exhibitions, exchanged technical information and published essays and critical commentaries in one another's journals. Led by [[The Linked Ring]] in England, the [[Photo-Secession]] in the U.S., and the [[Photo-Club de Paris]] in France, first hundreds and then thousands of photographers passionately pursued common interests in this multi-dimensional movement. Within the span of little more than a decade, notable pictorial photographers were found in Western and Eastern Europe, North America, Asia and Australia.

==The impact of Kodak cameras==

For the first forty years after a practical process of capturing and reproducing images was invented, photography remained the domain of a highly dedicated group of individuals who had expert knowledge of and skills in science, mechanics and art. To make a photograph, a person had to learn a great deal about chemistry, optics, light, the mechanics of cameras and how these factors combine to properly render a scene. It was not something that one learned easily or engaged in lightly, and, as such, it was limited to a relatively small group of academics, scientists and professional photographers.

[[Image:Kodak ad 1888.GIF|thumb|left|Ad for a [[Kodak]] camera, 1888 - "No knowledge of photography is necessary."]]
All of that changed in a few years' time span. In 1888 [[George Eastman]] introduced the first handheld amateur camera, the [[Kodak]] camera. It was marketed with the slogan "You press the button, we do the rest."&lt;ref name=PIC&gt;Wilson, p 1&lt;/ref&gt; The camera was pre-loaded with a roll of film that produced about 100 2.5" round pictures exposures, and it could easily be carried and handheld during its operation. After all of the shots on the film were exposed, the whole camera was returned to the Kodak company in Rochester, New York, where the film was developed, prints were made, and new photographic film was placed inside. Then the camera and prints were returned to the customer, who was ready to take more pictures.

The impact of this change was enormous. Suddenly almost anyone could take a photograph, and within the span of a few years photography became one of the biggest [[fad]]s in the world. Photography collector Michael Wilson observed "Thousands of commercial photographers and a hundred times as many amateurs were producing millions of photographs annually&amp;nbsp;... The decline in the quality of professional work and the deluge of snapshots (a term borrowed from hunting, meaning to get off a quick shot without taking the time to aim) resulted in a world awash with technically good but aesthetically indifferent photographs."&lt;ref name=PIC/&gt;

Concurrent with this change was the development of national and international commercial  enterprises to meet the new demand for cameras, films and prints. At the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, which attracted more than 27 million people, photography for amateurs was marketed at an unprecedented scale.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p 24&lt;/ref&gt; There were multiple large exhibits displaying photographs from around the world, many camera and darkroom equipment manufacturers showing and selling their latest goods, dozens of portrait studios and even on-the-spot documentation of the Exposition itself. Suddenly photography and photographers were household commodities.

Many serious photographers were appalled. Their craft, and to some their art, was being co-opted by a newly engaged, uncontrolled and mostly untalented citizenry. The debate about art and photography intensified around the argument that if anyone could take a photograph then photography could not possibly be called art. Some of the most passionate defenders of photography as art pointed out that photography should not and cannot be seen as an "either/or" medium ‒ some photographs are indeed simple records of reality, but with the right elements some are indeed works of art. William Howe Downs, art critic for the ''Boston Evening Transcript'', summed up this position in 1900 by saying "Art is not so much a matter of methods and processes as it is an affair of temperament, of taste and of sentiment&amp;nbsp;... In the hands of the artist, the photograph becomes a work of art&amp;nbsp;... In a word, photography is what the photographer makes it ‒ an art or a trade."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum, p 296&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these elements ‒ the debates over photography and art, the impacts of Kodak cameras, and the changing social and cultural values of the times ‒ combined to set the stage for an evolution in how art and photography, independently and together, would appear at the turn of the century. The course that drove pictorialism was set almost as soon as photographic processes were established, but it wasn't until the last decade of the 19th century that an international pictorialist movement came together.

==Defining pictorialism==

[[Image:Fading Away.jpg|thumb|left|"Fading Away", by [[Henry Peach Robinson]], 1858]]

In 1869 English photographer [[Henry Peach Robinson]] published a book entitled ''Pictorial Effect in Photography: Being Hints On Composition And Chiaroscuro For Photographers.''&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1869&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first common use of the term "pictorial" referring to photography in the context of a certain stylistic element - [[chiaroscuro]] ‒ an Italian term used by painters and art historians that refers to the use of dramatic lighting and shading to convey an expressive mood. In his book Robinson promoted what he called "combination printing", a method he had devised nearly 20 years earlier by combining individual elements from separate images into a new single image by manipulating multiple negatives or prints. Robinson thus considered that he had created "art" through photography, since it was only through his direct intervention that the final image came about. Robinson continued to expand on the meaning of the term throughout his life.

Other photographers and art critics, including [[Oscar Rejlander]], [[Marcus Aurelius Root]], [[John Ruskin]], echoed these ideas. One of the primary forces behind the rise of pictorialism was the belief that [[straight photography]] was purely representational ‒ that it showed reality without the filter of artistic interpretation. It was for, all intents and purposes, a simple record of the visual facts, lacking artistic intent or merit.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnell, p 2&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson and others felt strongly that the "usually accepted limitations of photography had to be overcome if an equality of status was to be achieved.&lt;ref name="Harker, p 19"/&gt;

Robert Demachy later summarized this concept in an article entitled "What Difference Is There Between a Good Photograph and an Artistic Photograph?". He wrote "We must realize that, on undertaking pictorial photography, we have, unwittingly perhaps, bound ourselves to the strict observance of rules hundreds of years more ancient than the oldest formulae of our chemical craft. We have slipped into the Temple of Art by a back door, and found ourselves amongst the crowd of adepts."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Demachy, ''Camera Notes'', Vol 3, No 2, Oct 1899, pp 46. Reprinted in Padon, p 120&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the challenges in promoting photography as art was that there were many different opinions about how art should look. After the Third Philadelphia Salon 1900, which showcased dozens of pictorial photographers, one critic wondered "whether the idea of art in anything like the true sense had ever been heard or thought by the great majority of exhibitors."&lt;ref&gt;Sternberger, p 136&lt;/ref&gt;

While some photographers saw themselves becoming true artists by emulating painting, at least one school of painting directly inspired photographers. During the 1880s, when debates over art and photography were becoming commonplace, a style of painting known as [[Tonalism]] first appeared. Within a few years it became a significant artistic influence on the development of pictorialism.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p 3&lt;/ref&gt; Painters such as [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[George Inness]], [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]] and [[Arnold Böcklin]] saw the interpretation of the experience of nature, as contrasted with simply recording an image of nature, as the artist's highest duty. To these artists it was essential that their paintings convey an emotional response to the viewer, which was elicited through an emphasis on the atmospheric elements in the picture and by the use of "vague shapes and subdued tonalities&amp;nbsp;... [to convey] a sense of elegiac melancholy."&lt;ref name=WHP1&gt;Rosenblum, pp&amp;nbsp;297–299&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stieglitz-SpringShowers.jpg|thumb|upright|"Spring Showers", by [[Alfred Stieglitz]], 1902]]

Applying this same sensibility to photography, [[Alfred Stieglitz]] later stated it this way: "Atmosphere is the medium through which we see all things. In order, therefore, to see them in their true value on a photograph, as we do in Nature, atmosphere must be there. Atmosphere softens all lines; it graduates the transition from light to shade; it is essential to the reproduction of the sense of distance. That dimness of outline which is characteristic for distant objects is due to atmosphere. Now, what atmosphere is to Nature, tone is to a picture."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Stieglitz, "A Plea for Art Photography in America." ''Photographic Mosaics,'' Vol 28, 1892. In Whelan, p 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul L. Anderson, a prolific contemporary promoter of pictorialism, advised his readers that true art photography conveyed "suggestion and mystery", in which "mystery consists in affording an opportunity for the exercise of the imagination, whereas suggestion involves stimulating the imagination by direct or indirect means."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1919), p 90&lt;/ref&gt; Science, pictorialists contended, might answer a demand for truthful information, but art must respond to the human need for stimulation of the senses.&lt;ref name=WHP1/&gt; This could only be done by creating a mark of individuality for each image and, ideally, each print.

For pictorialists, true individuality was expressed through the creation of a unique print, considered by many to be the epitome of artistic photography.&lt;ref name=WHP1/&gt; By manipulating the appearance of images through what some called "ennobling processes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Samuel|last=Morozov|date=October 1977|title=Early Photography in Eastern Europe - Russia|journal=History of Photography|volume=1|issue=4| page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[gum bichromate|gum]] or [[Oil Print Process#Bromoil process|bromoil]] printing, pictorialists were able to create unique photographs that were sometimes mistaken for drawings or lithographs.

Many of the strongest voices that championed pictorialism at its beginning were a new generation of amateur photographers. In contrast to its meaning today, the word "amateur" held a different connotation in the discussions of that time. Rather than suggesting an inexperienced novice, the word characterized someone who strived for artistic excellence and a freedom from rigid academic influence.&lt;ref name=PCC4&gt;Wilson, p 4&lt;/ref&gt; An amateur was seen as someone who could break the rules because he or she was not bound by the then rigid rules set forth by long-established photography organizations like the [[Royal Photographic Society]]. An article in the British journal ''Amateur Photographer'' stated "photography is an art ‒ perhaps the only one in which the amateur soon equals, and frequently excels, the professional in proficiency."&lt;ref name=PCC4/&gt; This attitude prevailed in many countries around the world. At the 1893 Hamburg International Photographic Exhibition in Germany, only the work of amateurs was allowed. Alfred Lichtwark, then director of the [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]] believed "the only good portraiture in any medium was being done by amateurs photographers, who had the economic freedom and time to experiment."&lt;ref name=PCC4/&gt;

In 1948, [[S. D. Jouhar|S.D.Jouhar]] defined a Pictorial photograph as "mainly an aesthetic symbolic record of a scene ''plus'' the artist's personal comment and interpretation, capable of transmitting an emotional response to the mind of a receptive spectator. It should show originality, imagination, unity of purpose, a quality of repose, and have an infinite quality about it"&lt;ref&gt;Royal Photographic Society Journal, August 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years other names were given to pictorialism, including "art photography" and ''Camerawork'' (both by Alfred Stieglitz), "Impressionist photography" (by George Davision), "new vision (''Neue Vision''), and finally "subjective photography" (''Subjektive Fotographie'') in Germany after the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnell, p 1&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain pictorial photographers were sometimes called "interventionists" (''intervencionistas''), although the style itself was not known as "interventionism".&lt;ref&gt;King, p 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition into Modernism==

[[Image:Jane Reece-Spaces.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jane Reece (photographer)|Jane Reece]], ''Spaces'', 1922.]]

The evolution of pictorialism from the 19th century well into the 1940s was both slow and determined. From its roots in Europe it spread to the U.S. and the rest of the world in several semi-distinct stages. Prior to 1890 pictorialism emerged through advocates who were mainly in England, Germany, Austria and France. During the 1890s the center shifted to New York and Stieglitz's multi-faceted efforts. By 1900 pictorialism had reached countries around the world, and major exhibitions of pictorial photography were held in dozens of cities.

A culminating moment for pictorialism and for photography in general occurred in  1910, when the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery|Albright Gallery]] in Buffalo bought 15 photographs from Stieglitz' [[291 (art gallery)|291 Gallery]]. This was the first time photography was officially recognized as an art form worthy of a museum collection, and it signaled a definite shift in many photographers' thinking. Stieglitz, who had worked so long for this moment, responded by indicating he was already thinking of a new vision beyond pictorialism. He wrote, "It is high time that the stupidity and sham in pictorial photography be struck a solarplexus blow&amp;nbsp;... Claims of art won't do. Let the photographer make a perfect photograph. And if he happens to be a lover of perfection and a seer, the resulting photograph will be straight and beautiful - a true photograph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes|title=American Masters - Alfred Stieglitz: The Eloquent Eye|origyear = 2001|others = Perry Miller Adato|type = DVD|publisher = Winstar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Stieglitz began to direct his attention more to modern painting and sculpture, and Clarence H. White and others took over the leadership of a new generation of photographers. As the harsh realities of [[World War I]] affected people around the world, the public's taste for the art of the past began to change. Developed countries of the world focused on more and more in the industry and growth, and art reflected this change by featuring hard-edged images of new buildings, airplanes and industrial landscapes.

Pictorialism had, for the most part, run its course, but in the early part of the 21st century it is now more popular than ever {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.  Adolf Fassbender, a 20th-century photographer who continued to make pictorial photographs well into the 1960s, believed that pictorialism is eternal because it is based upon beauty first. He wrote "There is no solution in trying to eradicate pictorialism for one would then have to destroy idealism, sentiment and all sense of art and beauty. There will always be pictorialism."&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, p 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictorialism by country==

===Australia===

One of the primary catalysts of pictorialism in Australia was [[John Kauffmann]] (1864–1942), who studied photographic chemistry and printing in London, Zurich and Vienna between 1889 and 1897. When he returned to his home country in 1897, he greatly influenced his colleagues by exhibiting what one newspaper called photographs that could be "mistaken for works of art."&lt;ref&gt;Gael Newton, "Australian Pictorial Photography: Seeing the Light", in Padon, pp&amp;nbsp;97–99&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next decade a core of photographer artists, including [[Harold Cazneaux]], [[Frank Hurley]], [[Cecil Bostock]], [[Henri Mallard]], [[Rose Simmonds]]&lt;ref name=queen&gt;[http://www.artmuseum.uq.edu.au/content/rose-simmonds-queensland-pictorial-photographer Rose Simmonds Queensland Pictorial Photographer], Art Museum Queensland, Retrieved 16 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Olive Cotton]], exhibited pictorial works at salons and exhibitions across the country and published their photos in the ''Australian Photographic Journal'' and the ''Australasian Photo-Review''.

===Austria===

In 1891 the Club der Amateur Photographen in Wien (Vienna Amateur Photographers' Club) held the first International Exhibition of Photography in Vienna. The Club, founded by Carl Sma, Federico Mallmann and Charles Scolik, was founded to foster relationships with photographic groups in other countries. After Alfred Buschbeck became head of the club in 1893, it simplified its name to Wiener Camera-Klub (Vienna Camera Club) and began publishing a lavish magazine called ''Wiener Photographische Blätter'' that continued until 1898. It regularly featured articles from influential foreign photographers such as [[Alfred Stieglitz]] and [[Robert Demachy]].&lt;ref name=VCC&gt;Manon Hübscher, "The Vienna Camera Club, Catalyst and Crucible", in Daum, pp&amp;nbsp;125–129&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other countries, opposing viewpoints engaged a wider range of photographers in defining what pictorialism meant. {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Watzek|de|3=Hans Watzek (Fotograf)}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hugo Henneberg|de}} and [[Heinrich Kühn]] formed an organization called Das Kleeblatt (The Trilfolium) expressly to increase the exchange of information with other organizations in other countries, especially, France, Germany and the United States. Initially a small, informal group, Das Kleeblatt increased it influence in the Wiener Camera-Klub through its international connections, and several other organizations promoting pictorialism were created in other cities throughout the region. As in other countries, interest in pictorialism faded after World War I, and eventually most of the Austrian organization slipped into obscurity during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=VCC/&gt;

===Canada===
[[File:Poster for Exhibition of Pictorial Photography.jpg|thumb|120px|1917 Exhibition Poster]]
Pictorialism in Canada initially centered on Sidney Carter (1880–1956), the first of his countrymen to be elected to the Photo-Secession. This inspired him to bring together a group of pictorial photographers in Toronto,  the Studio Club in Toronto, with [[Harold Mortimer-Lamb]] (1872–1970) and fellow Secessionist Percy Hodgins.&lt;ref&gt;Kolton, pp 4‒11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 Carter organized Canada's first major exhibition of pictorial photography at Montreal's Art Association. Carter and fellow photographer [[Arthur Goss]] attempted to introduce pictorialist principles to the members of the [[Toronto Camera Club]], although their efforts were met with some resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Kolton, p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===

As early as 1853 amateur photographer William J. Newton proposed the idea that "a  'natural object', such as a tree, should be photographed in accordance 'the acknowledged principles of fine art'".&lt;ref name=Liddy&gt;Brian Liddy, "The Origins and Development of Pictorial Photography in Britain." In Daum, pp 65‒71&lt;/ref&gt; From there other early photographers, including [[Henry Peach Robinson]] and [[Peter Henry Emerson]], continued to promote the concept of photography as art. In 1892 Robinson, along with [[George Davison (photographer)|George Davison]] and [[Alfred Maskell]], established the first organization devoted specifically to the ideal of photography as art ‒ The Linked Ring. They invited like-minded photographers, including [[Frank Sutcliffe]], [[Frederick H. Evans]], [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Frederick Hollyer]], [[James Craig Annan]], [[Alfred Horsley Hinton]] and others, to join them. Soon The Linked Ring was at the forefront of the movement to have photography regarded as an art form.

After The Linked Ring invited a select group of Americans as members, debates broke out about the goals and purpose of the club. When more American than British members were shown at their annual exhibit in 1908, a motion was introduced to disband the organization. By 1910 The Linked Ring has dissolved, and its members went their own way.

===France===

Pictorialism in France is dominated by two names, [[Constant Puyo]] and [[Robert Demachy]]. They are the most famous members of the Photo-Club de Paris, a separate organization from the [[Société française de photographie]]. They are particularly well known for their use of pigment processes, especially [[gum bichromate]].&lt;ref&gt;Julien Faure-Conorton, ''Characterization, contextualization and reception of Robert Demachy’s photographic work (1859-1936)'' (Ph.D. Thesis - in French), Paris, EHESS, 2015, 1136 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, they published a book on the subject, ''Les Procédés d'art en Photographie''. Both of them also wrote many articles for the ''Bulletin du Photo-Club de Paris'' (1891-1902) and ''La Revue de Photographie'' (1903-1908), a magazine which quickly became the most influential French publication dealing with artistic photography during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Poivert, "An Avant-Garde without Combat: The French Anti-Modernists and the Pre-Modernism of the American Photo-Secession." In Daum, pp&amp;nbsp;31–35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===

The brothers Theodor and Oskar Hofmeister of Hamburg were among the first to advocate for photography as art in their country. At meetings of the Society for the Promotion of Amateur Photography (Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Amateur-Photographie), other photographers, including Heinrich Beck, George Einbeck, and Otto Scharf, advanced the cause of pictorialism. The Homeisters, along with [[Heinrich Kühn]], later formed The Presidium (Das Praesidium), whose members  were instrumental in major exhibitions at the Kunsthalle in Hamburg. Nowadays [[Karl Maria Udo Remmes]] represents the style of pictorialism in the field of theatrical backstage photography.

===Japan===

In 1889 photographers [[Ogawa Kazumasa]], [[W. K. Burton]], [[Kajima Seibei]] and several others formed the Nihon Shashin-kai ([[Japan Photographic Society (19th century)|Japan Photographic Society]]) in order to promote ''geijutsu shashin'' (art photography) in that country. Acceptance of this new style was slow at first, but in 1893 Burton coordinated a major invitational exhibition known as ''Gaikoku Shashin-ga Tenrain-kai'' or the ''Foreign Photographic Art Exhibition''.&lt;ref name=PPJ&gt;Ryūichi Kaneko, "Pictorial Photography in Japan." In Padon, pp&amp;nbsp;81–84&lt;/ref&gt; The 296 works that were shown came from members of the London Camera Club, including important photographs by [[Peter Henry Emerson]] and [[George Davison (photographer)|George Davison]]. The breadth and depth of this exhibition had a tremendous impact on Japanese photographers, and it "galvanized the discourse of art photography throughout the country."&lt;ref name=PPJ/&gt; After the exhibition ended Burton and Kajima founded a new organization, the Dai Nihon Shashin Hinpyō-kai (Greater Japan Photography Critique Society) to advance their particular viewpoints on art photography.

In 1904 a new magazine called ''Shashin Geppo'' (''Monthly Photo Journal'') was started, and for many years it was the centerpiece for the advancement of and debates about pictorialism. The meaning and direction of art photography as championed by Ogawa and others was challenged in the new journal by photographers Tarō Saitō and Haruki Egashira, who, along with Tetsusuke Akiyama and Seiichi Katō, formed a new group known as Yūtsuzu-sha. This new group promoted their own concepts of what they called "the inner truth" of art photography.&lt;ref name=PPJ/&gt; For the next decade many photographers aligned themselves with one of these two organizations.

In the 1920s new organizations were formed that bridged the transition between pictorialism and modernism. Most prominently among these was the Shashin Geijustu-sha (Photographic Art Society) formed by [[Shinzō Fukuhara]] and his brother [[Rosō Fukuhara]]. They promoted the concept of ''hikari to sono kaichō'' (light with its harmony) that rejected an overt manipulation of an image in favor of soft-focused images using silver gelatin printing.&lt;ref name=PPJ/&gt;

===Netherlands===

The first generation of Dutch pictorialists, including Bram Loman, Chris Schuver and Carl Emile Mögle, began working around 1890. They initially focused on naturalistic themes and favored platinum printing. Although initially there was no Dutch equivalent of The Linked Ring or Photo-Secession,  several smaller organizations collaborated to produce the First International Salon for Art Photography in 1904. Three years later Adriann Boer, Ernest Loeb, Johan Huijsen and others founded the Dutch Club for Art Photography (Nederlandsche Club voor Foto-Kunst), which amassed an important collection of pictorial photography now housed at [[Leiden University]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingeborg Th. Leijerzapf, "Pictorialism in The Netherlands." In Daum, pp 139‒147&lt;/ref&gt; A second generation of Dutch pictorialists included Henri Berssenbrugge, Bernard Eilers and Berend Zweers.

===Russia===

Pictorialism spread to Russia first through European magazines and was championed by photography pioneers Evgeny Vishnyakov in Russia and [[Jan Bulhak]] from Poland. Soon after a new generation of pictorialists became active. These included Aleksei Mazuin, Sergei Lobovikov, Piotr Klepikov, Vassily Ulitin, [[Nikolay Andreyev (photographer)|Nikolay Andreyev]], Nikolai Svishchov-Paola, Leonid Shokin and Alexander Grinberg. In 1894 the Russian Photographic Society was established in Moscow, but differences of opinion among the members led to the establishment of a second organization, the Moscow Society of Art Photography. Both were the primary promoters of pictorialsim in Russia for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photographer.ru/cult/history/472.htm|title=Edtudes for the History of Russian Pictorlialism|first=Irina|last=Tchmyreva|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quiet Resistance: Russian Pictorialism of the 1900s‒1930s|first=Olga|last=Sviblova|publisher=Moscoe: Multimedia Complex of Actual Arts|year=2005|pages=182–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

The main centers of pictorial photography in Spain were Madrid and Barcelona. Leading the movement in Madrid was Antonio Cánovas, who founded the Real Sociedad Fotográfica de Madrid and edited the magazine ''La Fotografía''. Cánovas claimed to be the first to introduce artistic photography to Spain, but throughout his career he remained rooted in the allegorical style of the early English pictorialists like Robinson. He refused to use any surface manipulation in his prints, saying that style "is not, cannot be and will never be photography.".&lt;ref&gt;King, p 133&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential photographers in the country were Carlos Iñigo, Manual Renon, Joan Vilatobà and a person known only as the Conde de la Ventosa. Unlike the rest of Europe, pictorialism remained popular in Spain throughout the 1920s and 1930s, and Ventosa was the most prolific pictorialist of that period. Unfortunately very few original prints remain from any of these photographers; most of their images are now known only from magazine reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;King, p 125&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

One of the key figures in establishing both the definition and direction of pictorialism was American [[Alfred Stieglitz]], who began as an amateur but quickly made the promotion of pictorialism his profession and obsession. Through his writings, his organizing and his personal efforts to advance and promote pictorial photographers, Stieglitz was a dominant figure in pictorialism from its beginnings to its end. Following in the footsteps of German photographers, in 1892 Stieglitz established a group he called the [[Photo-Secession]] in New York. Stieglitz hand-picked the members of the group, and he tightly controlled what it did and when it did it. By selecting photographers whose vision was aligned with his, including [[Gertrude Käsebier]], [[Eva Watson-Schütze]], [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Edward Steichen]], and [[Joseph Keiley]], Stieglitz built a circle of friends who had enormous individual and collective influence over the movement to have photography accepted as art. Stieglitz also continually promoted pictorialism through two publications he edited, [[Camera Notes]] and [[Camera Work]] and by establishing and running a gallery in New York that for many years exhibited only pictorial photographers (the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession]]).&lt;ref&gt;Doty, pp&amp;nbsp;5–10&lt;/ref&gt;

While much initially centered on Stieglitz, pictorialism in the U.S. was not limited to New York. In Boston [[F. Holland Day]] was one of the most prolific and noted pictorialists of his time. [[Clarence Hudson White|Clarence H. White]], who produced extraordinary pictorial photographs while in Ohio, went on to teach a whole new generation of photographers. On the West Coast the California Camera Club and Southern California Camera Club included prominent pictorialists [[Annie Brigman]], [[Arnold Genthe]],  [[Adelaide Hanscom Leeson]], Emily Pitchford and William E. Dassonville.&lt;ref&gt;McCarroll, pp 15‒30&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, the [[Seattle Camera Club]] was started by a group of Japanese-American pictorialists, including Dr. Kyo Koike, Frank Asakichi Kunishige and Iwao Matsushita (prominent members later included [[Ella E. McBride]] and [[Soichi Sunami]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, pp&amp;nbsp;10–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
[[Image:M Sherling Portrait A. Golovin.jpg|thumb|right|Miron A. Sherling, ''Portrait Alexander J. Golovin'', 1916.]]

Pictorial photographers began by taking an ordinary glass-plate or film negative. Some adjusted the focus of the scene or used a special lens to produce a softer image, but for the most part the printing process controlled the final appearance of the photograph. Pictorialists used a variety of papers and chemical processes to produce particular effects, and some then manipulated the tones and surface of prints with brushes, ink or pigments. The following is a list of the most commonly used pictorial processes. More details about these processes may be found in Crawford (pp 85‒95) and in Daum (pp 332‒334). Unless otherwise noted, the descriptions below are summarized from these two books.

*[[Oil Print Process#Bromoil process|Bromoil process]]: This is a variant on the oil print process that allows a print to be enlarged. In this process a regular silver gelatin print is made, then bleached in a solution of potassium bichromate. This hardens the surface of the print and allows ink to stick to it. Both the lighter and darker areas of a bromoil print may be manipulated, providing a broader tonal range than an oil print.
*[[Carbon print]]: This is an extremely delicate print made by coating tissue paper with potassium bichromate, [[carbon black]] or another pigment and gelatin. Carbon prints can provide extraordinary detail and are among the most permanent of all photographic prints. Due to the stability of the paper both before and after processing, carbon printing tissue was one of the earliest commercially made photographic products.
*[[Cyanotype]]: One of the earliest photographic processes, cyanotypes experienced a brief renewal when pictorialists experimented with their deep blue color tones. The color came from coating paper with light-sensitive iron salts.
*[[Gum bichromate]]: One of the pictorialists' favorites, these prints were made by applying [[gum Arabic]], [[potassium bichromate]] and one or more artist's colored pigments to paper. This sensitized solution slowly hardens where light strikes it, and these areas remain pliable for several hours. The photographer had a great deal of control by varying the mixture of the solution, allowing a shorter or longer exposure and by brushing or rubbing the pigmented areas after exposure.
*[[Oil Print Process]]: Made by applying greasy inks to paper coated with a solution of gum bichromate and gelatin. When exposed through a negative, the gum-gelatin hardens where light strikes it while unexposed areas remain soft. Artist's inks are then applied by brush, and the inks adhere only to the hardened areas. Through this process a photographer can manipulate the lighter areas of a gum print while the darker areas remain stable. An oil print cannot be enlarged since it has to be in direct contact with the negative.
*[[Platinum print]]: Platinum prints require a two-steps process. First, paper is sensitized with iron salts and exposed in contact with a negative until a faint image is formed. Then the paper is chemically developed in a process that replaces the iron salts with platinum. This produces an image with a very wide range of tones, each intensely realized.

==Pictorial photographers==

Following are two lists of prominent photographers who engaged in pictorialism during their careers. The first list includes photographers who were predominantly pictorialists for all or almost all of their careers (generally those active from 1880 to 1920). The second list includes 20th-century photographers who used a pictorial style early in the careers but who are more well known for pure or [[straight photography]].

[[File:testedlabel.jpg|thumb|right|A common label for certifying that a device has been tested.]]
'''Portable appliance testing''' (commonly known as "PAT", "PAT inspection" or ([[RAS syndrome|redundantly]]) as "PAT testing") is the name of a process in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mrengineers.co.uk/pat-testing|title=PAT Testing {{!}} Gas Safety Certificate from £30 Inc VAT|website=www.mrengineers.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand and Australia by which electrical appliances are routinely checked for safety. The formal term for the process is "in-service inspection &amp; testing of electrical equipment".  Testing involves a [[visual inspection]] of the equipment and any flexible cables for good condition, and also where required, verification of earthing (grounding) continuity, and a test of the soundness of insulation between the current carrying parts, and any exposed metal that may be touched. The formal limits for pass/fail of these electrical tests vary somewhat depending on the category of equipment being tested.

Similar procedures exist in other countries, for example, testing of  equipment according to ''DGUV Vorschrift 3'' in Germany.

==Purpose==
[[Health and safety]] regulations require that electrical appliances are safe and maintained to prevent harm to workers.  Many equipment manufacturers recommend testing at regular intervals to ensure continual safety; the interval between tests depending on both the type of appliance and the environment in which it is to be used. The European Low Voltage Directive governs the manufacture or importation of electrical appliances. Compliance to this has to be declared and indicated by the display of the CE mark on the product. The responsibility for this lies with the manufacturer or the importer and is policed by Trading Standards.

Testing equipment has been specifically developed for PAT inspections, based on the testing equipment used by manufacturers to ensure compliance with the [[British Standard Code of Practice]] and European product standards relevant to that type of appliance. This in turn allows testing and the interpretation of results to be de-skilled to a large extent. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The inspection of the appliances can largely be carried out in-house in many organisations. This can result in cost savings and more flexibility as to exactly when a PAT is carried out.

==Origin of name==
Portable appliance testing is abbreviated as PAT. The correct term for the whole process is "In-service Inspection &amp; Testing of Electrical Equipment" (as defined by IET/IEE and City and Guilds).

In Australia and New Zealand, the common name for PAT is simply 'Test and Tag'. The regulatory guidelines are set out in AS/NZS3760:2010.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==UK legal obligations==

===Appliances===
British law (the [[Health and safety regulations in the United Kingdom|Electricity at Work Regulations 1989]]) requires that all electrical systems (including electrical appliances) are maintained (so far as is reasonably practicable) to prevent danger. Private houses are not covered by this legislation, although [[occupiers' liability in English law|occupiers' liability]] requires householders not to deliberately expose occupants or visitors to unreasonable risks. The HSE and the local authority are responsible for the policing of this legislation.

===Fixed wiring in buildings===
Guidance from the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET, published under the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] brand) and the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) recommends that a competent person must inspect the installation regularly in any public building or a place that people work. They suggest initial intervals for combined inspection and testing that range from three months (for construction equipment) to one year, and in many cases, longer periods for re-testing (certain types of appliance in schools, hotels, offices and shops).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg236.pdf Health and Safety Executive, Electrical safety and you]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Health and safety regulations in the United Kingdom|Electricity at Work Regulations 1989]] is an obligation on UK businesses, there is no obligation to undertake PAT inspection.  In reality neither act nor their corresponding regulations and associated statutory instruments detail PAT inspection as an obligation, but rather impose a requirement of maintenance of safety and evidence of [[planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] for all hand-held, portable and plug-in equipment.

Today a great many private companies and other organizations do meet their legal obligations to protect their workers by an enforced PAT regime, but it is not the only route.

Recent HSE publications have relaxed their tone somewhat to acknowledge this, and now point out that in many situations annual PAT is disproportionate to the risks and is often not required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg236.pdf Maintaining portable electric equipment in low-risk environment]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the HSE reviewed its approach to portable appliance maintenance in its own offices. Thinking about the type of equipment in use, and how it was used, the HSE looked back at the results from its annual testing of portable appliances across its estate over the last five years. Using the results of the previous tests, the HSE decided that further portable appliance tests are not needed within the foreseeable future or at all for certain types of portable equipment. Also, they decided to continue to monitor any faults reported as a result of user checks and visual inspections and review its maintenance system if evidence suggests that it needs revising. Electrical equipment will continue to be maintained by a series of user checks and visual inspections by staff that have had some training.

Annual portable appliance testing is not always necessary in low risk environments.
You do not need to be qualified as an electrician to carry out visual inspections.
Regular user checks and visual inspections can be a good method of maintaining portable electric equipment.
For landlords maintaining legal requirements it is not compulsory for them to have all appliances tested, but they do need to show a "duty of care" and most letting agents recommend that a test certificate is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;http://electricians-portsmouth.co.uk/electrical-landlord-certificates-need-know/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins in UK ==

The earliest formal portable appliance testing and inspection of both electrical installations and high risk equipment was introduced in the UK in government estates.  This was under the control of the [[Property Services Agency]] – prior to 1972 the [[Ministry of Public Building and Works]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In some cases testing was conducted on a three-month (high-risk) and six-month (low-risk) cycle from the early 1960s onwards. Extensive record-keeping was made into log-books and generally the equipment used was an insulation resistance tester, simple hand tools and visual inspection. Evidence of testing was clearly visible to workers in the form of "passed", "tested for electrical safety" and "do not use after..." labels affixed to various parts of the electrical equipment used. This early testing and inspection was done under a planned maintenance scheme and pre-dated both the [[Health and Safety at Work Act 1974]] and the [[Electricity at Work Act 1989]].

==Site and campus requirements, events and contractors==

In the UK there is no legal instrument that requires a sub-contractor to ensure that all tools and equipment are PAT inspected before bringing onto a site of work.  Neither is there any legal instrument which obliges the site owner to ensure third-party equipment is PAT inspected either by themselves or the equipment owner.

The internal policies of many UK businesses and educational establishments make mistaken reference to PAT inspection being a legal requirement under the Electricity at Work Regulations, which is false.  Having such a policy is legitimate for internal reasons, but it is not underwritten by law, it is only their interpretation.  Therefore, it is not a legal requirement to have a PAT inspection sticker or certificate, the obligation is that equipment must be safe.

The HSE recommend policies use phrases such as "Equipment that is brought onto site for an event must be in a safe condition" and refrain from overzealous statements such as "must be PAT inspected" which can be restrictive without improving safety.  Overall it is safer if a competent person makes a visual inspection than if a layman merely observes the presence of a sticker.

==Carrying out PAT ==

This can be done by hiring an external company to test all the electrical products in a business (someone who has had some PAT training, either by an official qualification or by attending a health and safety course offered by some electrical health and safety companies) or it can be done in-house by a competent person.  In a low-risk environment most dangerous defects can be found simply by checking the appliances for obvious signs of damage such as frayed cables.

===User checks===
Advising the user of potential danger signs can result in problems being picked up before they can result in any danger. For example, if the power cable is frayed or the plug is cracked, users need to be advised not to use the appliance and report the fault to a supervisor. This information can be put across, say by the use of a poster or in a memo. User checks are always carried out before operation, and the results are generally not recorded, unless a defect is identified.

===Formal visual inspections===
This is a process of simply inspecting the appliance, the cable and the plug for any obvious signs of damage. According to the HSE, this process can find more than 90% of faults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysafety.govt.nz/about/publications/accident-summaries Faults and electrical safety]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined inspections and PAT ===
At periodic intervals, the portable appliances are tested to measure that the degree of protection to ensure that it is adequate. At these intervals, a formal visual inspection is carried out and then followed by PAT testing. Note the inside of the plug should be checked unless it is moulded or there is an unbroken seal covering the screws (bad internal wiring or an unsuitable fuse would cause the item to be classed as dangerous).

==Testing==

The tests an appliance is required to undergo will depend on the type of appliance, its electrical [[Appliance classes|Class]] and subject to a risk assessment by the technician. e.g. it may not be safe to perform a leakage current test which powers up the appliance, such as a grinder, if it can not be secured to a bench; an insulation resistance test may be a safe option.

===Earth resistance test===
This test shows the resistance offered by the earthing rods with the connection leads. Various testing instruments are available for earthing resistance tests. The earthing resistance should be less than 1Ω.

===Earth continuity test===
The equipment shall have a measured resistance of the [[Protective earth|protective earth circuit]], or the earthing conductor of an extension cord or appliance cord set, which does not exceed 1Ω.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing is performed using an ohmmeter or [[Portable Appliance Test|PAT]] tester;
* Using the ohmmeter to produce a reading;
* Using a PAT tester under the following conditions;
** 12V maximum, test current range 100mA to 200mA - commonly known as "earth continuity test" or "screen test" 
** 12V maximum, test current 10A - commonly known as "routine test" 
** 12V maximum, 1.5 times rated current of appliance or 25A, whichever is greater - commonly known as "type test" or "bond test".

The choice of which of the tests to use is at the operator's discretion as there is merit in each test for given situations.  Later model testers that are battery powered are limited to doing the "screen test". Older mains powered units can do all tests. Even "type testing" may only be testing at a fraction of the operational power of the unit.The power dissipated in the earth is only 300 watts compared to operational power which may be in excess of 2000 watts.

===Insulation resistance test===

A leakage current test performed at rated voltage with values not exceeding 5mA for [[Appliance classes|Class I]] appliances or 1mA for [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliances.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2. 3.3.2(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, measure [[Electrical insulation|insulation resistance]] values are not less than 1MΩ for Class I and Class II appliances at 500 V d.c. or alternatively, to avoid the equipment apparently failing the test because the [[Surge protector|metal oxide varistors]] (MOVs), or electro-magnetic interference (EMI) suppression has triggered, for equipment containing voltage limiting devices such as MOVs, or EMI suppression, at 250 V d.c.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.2(b). General&lt;/ref&gt;

Leakage current testing is performed using a PAT by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a Class I appliance or the external metal parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliance;
* Nominal voltage is 230V AC. (therefore it can not be performed with a digital multimeter)

Insulation resistance testing is performed using an ohmmeter or portable appliance tester by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class I]] appliance or the external metal parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliance;
* Nominal voltage is 500V d.c (250 V d.c. may be used for equipment containing [[Surge protector|MOVs]] / EMI filtering)

A deficiency of the insulation resistance (500V/250V d.c) test is that the d.c voltage will not activate electromagnetic switches or internal relays etc. that are common in many modern power tools, computers, TVs etc. and therefore it can only test the appliance up to that point. Appliances with these components / design should be tested using the leakage current test.

===Polarity check===
In countries where the sockets are polarised, polarity testing is a simple test that can be carried out using a polarity tester to determine whether the active and neutral of the plug end are correctly connected to the corresponding terminals at the socket end.&lt;ref&gt;BS7671 wiring rules OR Best Practices in Testing &amp; Tagging of Electrical Equipment to AS/NZS 3760:2003. (Zahra &amp; Virieux 2007) 5.8.1&lt;/ref&gt; Note: The earth is tested during the [[#Earth continuity test|earth continuity test]]. In the UK, as per BS7671, the phase ('Live' or 'Hot') cable should connect with right hand side terminal of the socket (if we face the socket outlet).

====Plugs====
*The order ([[Electrical polarity|polarity]]) of the pins of a three pin flat pin plug, to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin – green/yellow wire), Neutral (light blue wire) and then Active (brown wire), in a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the plug looking at the pins.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.5(a). General&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cord extension sockets====
*The order ([[Electrical polarity|polarity]]) of the socket apertures of a three pin flat pin socket, to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin – green/yellow wire), Active (brown wire) and then Neutral (light blue wire), in a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the socket looking at the apertures.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.5(b). General&lt;/ref&gt;

===RCDs / ELCBs / Safety Switches===
There are two tests methods to be used;

====Press button====
This test requires specific test equipment RCD tester:

(the TEST button referred to here is the test button on the RCD tester NOT the TEST button on the RCD itself. If the RCD is live, pressing the RCD's own TEST button should ALWAYS trip the RCD).

The RCD tester should be connected with the socket, with earth terminal (must !!) and 
1)select the testing range 'delta' (10mA,30mA,100mA,300mA,500mA).
2)Select half delta range, and press TEST button - the RCD should not operate, this ensures against nuisance tripping.
3)Select delta range, and press TEST button - The RCD should operate, within m Sec for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz,230V system (as per BS 7671)

====Applied current====
This test requires specialised test equipment, knowledge and training;
*A current, equal to the rated tripping current, shall be “suddenly” applied between active and protective earth and the operating time measured&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Appendix D D3&lt;/ref&gt; with maximum trip time 40ms for Type I and 300ms for Type II.

In addition to this, many technicians also test;
*using 1/2 (half) the rated tripping current to detect nuisance tripping.
*using 5 times rated tripping current, with trip times reduced accordingly, to simulate high current exposure.
* under 0 degree and 180 degree phases

Best Practice is to test the RCD under 1/2, 1X and 5X rated tripping current, each at both the 0 degree and 180 degree phases.

===Microwave ovens===
There are two specific extra checks mandated for microwave ovens in the United Kingdom.

The first is that the device immediately ceases production of the microwave radiation when the door is opened, which checks that the safety interlock systems are functional; and the second is that any leakage when operating is less than 5 mWcm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; which indicates that the door and casing are not distorted and any seals are intact so that there is no hazard to those in the vicinity of the equipment.

A piece of calibrated equipment is required for these tests to detect and measure leakage of the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz microwave radiation, it is usually a hand-held device with a sensing antenna that can be scanned over the areas where the door meets the casing to find any radiation ''hot-spots'' whilst the unit is operating.  As Microwave ovens are not normally designed to be operated without a load this will usually take the form of an open container containing a quantity of water which is used to absorb the energy and as it gets warmed gives an indication that a unit not previously examined by a tester is actually producing microwaves.  After checking for leakage the door is required to be opened by whatever means is provided and the measurement device is not to record a level above the given limit.  In some scenarios a known quantity of water is heated for a known period of time and the temperature rise over the period of operation is used to generate an indication of the effective power output of the magnetron. This can be helpful to determine whether the oven is operating at the expected power levels indicated by labelling.

== Class of construction ==
Electrical [[appliance classes]] are differentiated by a series of IEC protection classes.  The protocols for PAT Testing vary by appliance class. 
*'''Class I''' – Single insulated wiring, which requires an earth connection. There is no symbol for a Class I product so if a rating plate has no symbol on it then it is usually Class I.
*'''Class II''' – Double insulated wiring, The earth clamp is still connected during the insulation test even though no earth on appliance. Class II is indicated by double box.
*'''Class III''' – These are appliances that are supplied at a low voltage (usually called Separated Extra Low Voltage) which must be less than 50&amp;nbsp;V. These appliances are supplied with a transformer supply that is also marked.

The earth lead is connected to metal parts on both Class I and Class II appliances. For "Class I" during the earth test to prove continuity between earth pin and metal parts on the appliance. For "Class II" during the insulation test to prove the insulation between active-neutral and the metal parts of the appliance. i.e. there is no leakage from mains coming into the appliance to the metal parts that are exposed.

==PAT training and qualifications==
[[File:PATtest.JPG|right|thumb|PAT testing at a workbench]]

In the UK, there is no requirement to have a formal qualification for persons carrying out PAT Testing.  The Electricity at Work regulations of 1989 simply state that where required, inspecting and testing must be carried out by a competent person, however does not mention a benchmark for competency.  It has become accepted practice, however, for individuals operating as PAT Testers to hold a 2377–22 City and Guilds qualification.  PAT Testers in the UK do not need to be electricians or have a background in the electrical industry. An example of a nationally recognised qualification of competence in PAT is offered by [[City and Guilds of London Institute|City &amp; Guilds]]: 'Code of Practice for In-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment – 4th Edition (No. 2377)'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityandguilds.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-850C2351-18A457AB/cgonline/hs.xsl/1779.html?search_term=2377 City &amp; Guilds 'Code of Practice for In-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment' qualification]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are others provided by EAL available.

In Australia it is a legal requirement to have attended a course or gained a qualification in order to PAT.  Proof of a company’s competence takes the form of a course certificate or qualification. A formal examination process for the topic is operated in collaboration with EAL or city and guilds (the awarding body) under the authority of the QCA (The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority) who validate and authorise the qualification.

==Types of PAT testers==
At the basic level PAT test instruments carry out basic safety checks. Most are equipped with an earth continuity test, insulation resistance test and the ability to check the wiring of detachable mains cords. Many do not however include tests which involve applying mains power to the appliance under test, for example, a protective conductor current or touch current tests. The main kind for businesses are simple PASS/FAIL testers that are easy to use, and are aimed at in-house PAT testing with minimal interpretation of results. Advanced PAT testers can give much more information and testing features but are mainly aimed at more highly skilled users.

===Pass / fail PAT testers===
These are the simple-to-use and comparatively much cheaper portable appliance testers for most businesses who will test in-house to carry out the testing and suitable for a wide range of businesses. They simply say PASS or FAIL when a test is carried out. Mains powered testers require AC power.   Battery operated PAT testers are self-contained and convenient to use. They usually come with rechargeable batteries.

These testers have a simple "lights" system. They have a "Pass" light, a "Fail" light, options for Class I metal / plastic or Class II. They also will show:
*earth continuity
*insulation resistance
*polarity.

===Advanced PAT testers===

These testers display more information than just pass or fail, including:
*Earth continuity resistance (aka Earth Bond) tests with a measurement range of 0 – 1.99&amp;nbsp;Ω at high test currents (usually 8&amp;nbsp;A, 10&amp;nbsp;A or 25&amp;nbsp;A) and lower test currents (in the range 20&amp;nbsp;mA to 200&amp;nbsp;mA), enabling a complete range of appliances including personal computers to be tested;
*Insulation resistance tests at test voltages of 500&amp;nbsp;V DC or 250&amp;nbsp;V DC.
*Protective conductor/touch current measurement (sometimes referred to as "earth leakage tests" on some older PAT units);
*Fuse test;
*Lead polarity.

These readings require interpretation by an electrician or someone with electrical understanding. Advanced PAT testers are effective as facilities management tools because they can record the location and test status of electrical equipment and appliances.

'''RCD testing'''

Some units can also test [[Residual-current device]]s, following the recommendation in the current IEE Code of Practice to test any RCD fitted on an extension lead or multiway adapter. 
[[Image:PrimeTest 250 RCD.jpg|thumb|left|Modern PAT testers include an RCD test]]

===Computerised PAT testers===
Some advanced PAT testers can download information to a computer. Bluetooth enabled computerised PAT testers make the two way transfer of test data between the tester and PC-based record keeping systems much simpler, and can be used with other test accessories such as label printers. Records can be maintained using PAT software such as [https://patorganiser.com.au PATorganiser]

== Calibration of testers ==
As PAT testers are sophisticated instruments, it is important to make sure that they are continuing to measure correctly. If a company fails to check and maintain calibration, it could face difficulty substantiating any measurements in the event of a claim. It is usually recommended that calibration is carried out annually on a PAT testing unit.

When a PAT tester is calibrated it is re-configuring it to match the original specification. This includes:

*Calibrating the unit back to national standards. This is best performed by the product manufacturer (if they offer a calibration service) or a laboratory accredited by [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service]] (UKAS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukas.com/ The United Kingdom Accreditation Service]&lt;/ref&gt;
*If it is mains powered, then a safety test must be carried out.
*A calibration certificate should be issued to prove the PAT unit has been electrically tested.

Dual purpose check boxes (which are essentially known resistances either side of the test limits)have also been introduced which are capable of validating the accuracy of both electrical installation testers and portable appliance testers in the field, reducing the risk of a tester being used when not operating correctly - this also allows the re-calibration interval to be increased.

[[File:Tascam Portastudio 244.jpg|thumb|Tascam Portastudio 244]]

The [[TASCAM]] '''Portastudio''' was the world's first four-track recorder based on a standard [[Compact Cassette|compact audio cassette]] tape. The term ''portastudio'' is exclusive to TASCAM, though it is generally used to describe all self-contained cassette-based multitrack recorders dedicated to music production. The Portastudio, and particularly its first iteration, the Teac 144, is credited with launching the home-recording wave, which allowed musicians to cheaply record and produce music at home,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02X2M-BP2OsC&amp;pg=PA180|page=180|title=The Guitar Player Book: 40 Years of Interviews, Gear, and Lessons from the World's Most Celebrated Guitar Magazine|first=Michael|last=Molenda|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2007|isbn=9780879307820}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is cited as one of the most significant innovations in music production technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhCUBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84|page=84|title=Music in the Marketplace: A Social Economics Approach|first=Samuel|last=Cameron|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781317934738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teac 144 Portastudio made its debut in 1979, at the annual meeting of the [[Audio Engineering Society]]. It was followed by several other models by TASCAM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEK2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207|page=207|title=Japanoise: Music at the Edge of Circulation|first=David|last=Novak|publisher=Duke UP|year=2013|isbn=9780822397540}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually by several other manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reverb.com/news/the-tascam-portastudio-through-the-ages|title=The Tascam Portastudio Through the Ages|website=reverb.com|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time it enabled musicians to record affordably several instrumental and vocal parts on different tracks of the built-in four-track recorder and later blend all the parts together, while transferring them to another standard, two-channel stereo tape deck ([[remix]] and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixdown]]) to form a stereo recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbA-0fAi20cC&amp;pg=PA31|title=TASCAM: 30 Years of Recording Evolution|first=Randy|last=Alberts|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2003|isbn=9780634011566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tascam Portastudio 244, introduced in 1982, improved upon the previous design with overall better sound quality and more features, including: dbx noise reduction, dual/concentric sweepable EQ's, and the ability to record on up to 4 tracks simultaneously. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.muzines.co.uk/articles/tascam-244-portastudio/2770|title=TASCAM Portastudio 244 Review|publisher=Home Studio Recording Magazine, December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, these machines were typically used by musicians to record [[Demo (music)|demos]], although they are still used today in [[lo-fi]] recording. The analog portastudios by TASCAM (a division of [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]]) and similar units by [[Fostex]], [[Akai]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[Sansui Electric|Sansui]], [[Marantz]], and others generally recorded on high-bias cassette tapes. Most of the machines were four-track, but there were also six-track and eight-track units. Some newer digital models record to a [[hard disk]], allowing for digital effects and up to 32 tracks of audio.

==Function==
The Portastudio supported the bouncing of content between tracks, such as creating a mix of three tracks and recording the sum onto the fourth track. By carefully balancing the volume and equalization, this could be done multiple times to create very lush tracks, reminiscent of the complex four-track production of late-sixties Beatle compositions. A limitation was the introduction of tape hiss, which was a particular issue with early models. This was eliminated with more recent digital models.

Unlike standard audio cassette machines that recorded a pair of stereo channels per side, the cassette-based Portastudios recorded four channels in one direction. If you played back a standard two-sided stereo cassette, the second two channels would play in reverse. One interesting (but unpublished) feature was that you could record a track in reverse by flipping the cassette, then flip it back and record additional material. Thanks to the speed control, it was also possible to create a classic flanging effect by recording one track, then recording a second copy of the same track while varying the pitch control, creating a sweeping sound at points where the two tracks converged.

An additional feature was support for external signal processing during recording and on final output.

==Notable usages==
* [[Guided By Voices]] recorded much of their classic-era songs on a Tascam 4-track.
* [[William Reid (musician)|William]] and [[Jim Reid]] of [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] used a TASCAM Portastudio to record their first demos sent to [[Bobby Gillespie]] and [[Alan McGee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Howe|first=Zoë |date=2014 |title=Barbed Wire Kisses |url= http://www.zoehowe.com/|location=United Kingdom |publisher= Polygon |page=10 |isbn=978-1-84697-331-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Lou Reed]] made the working demos for his 1988 ''New York'' album on a cassette multitrack unit. "I had been making these great cassettes at home," he explained to [[Musician (magazine)|''Musician'']] magazine, and Reed chose a recording studio that was able to capture the same sound and spirit, for the album sessions. (A single B-side was drawn directly from a demo cassette.)

* Soviet poet and musician, [[Viktor Tsoi]], frontman of the Soviet rock band [[Kino (band)|Kino]], recorded demos in the late 1980s to early 1990s for their main albums on a Portastudio tape recorder. A few of those albums are ''[[Gruppa krovi]]'' (Blood Type), ''[[Zvezda po imeni Solntse]]'' (The star called Sun) and ''[[Chyorny albom]]'' (The Black Album) in couple with a drum machine.
* [[Travis Meeks]] of [[Days of the New]] recorded "Cling" on a TASCAM four-track in his sessions leading up to [[Days of the New (1997 album)|his debut album]].
* [[John Vanderslice]], an analog recording enthusiast, made ''[[Life and Death of an American Fourtracker]]'', a concept album about home recording, including the song "Me and My 424".

In [[computer aided engineering]] (CAE) a '''preprocessor''' is a [[computer program|program]] which provides a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) to define physical properties. 
This data is used by the subsequent [[computer simulation]].

Steps that are followed in Pre-Processing

1&gt; The geometry (physical bounds) of the problem is defined

2&gt; The volume occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (meshing)

3&gt; The physical modeling is defined - Eg. equations of motion + enthalpy + radiation + species conservation

4&gt; Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behavior and properties at the boundaries of the problem. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined.

5&gt; The simulation is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady state or transient

6&gt; Finally a post-processor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resting solution

Two forms of reticulation can be distinguished: Terminal reticulation and inner reticulation. 
* In a terminal reticulation a single [[taxon]] or next-level-key is keyed out in several locations in the key. This type of reticulation is normally compatible with any printable presentation format of identification keys and normally does not require special precautions in software used for branching keys. 
* In an inner reticulation a couplet with further leads can be reached through more than one path. Depending on the software or printable presentation format, this may be more challenging. For the linked (= "parallel" or "bracketed") format, where each lead points to a numbered couplet, inner reticulations present no special challenge. However, for the nested (= "indented") presentation format, where all following couplets immediately follow their lead, a cross-connection to a different subtree in the key requires a special mechanism.

Reticulations generally improve the usability of a [[Dichotomous key|key]], but may also diminish the overall probability of correct identification averaged over all [[Taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, D.

[[File:Churches in Olomouc.jpg|thumb|The roofs of [[Olomouc]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
[[File:San Cristobal de las Casas.jpg|thumb|The roofs of [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], [[Mexico]]]]
[[File:Antananarivo03.jpg|thumb|Roofs of [[Antananarivo]], [[Madagascar]]]]

A '''roof''' is part of a [[building envelope]]. It is the covering on the uppermost part of a [[building]] or [[Shelter (building)|shelter]] which provides protection from animals and [[weather]], notably [[rain]] or [[snow]], but also [[heat]], [[wind]] and [[sunlight]]. The word also denotes the framing or structure which supports that covering.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William Dwight, and Benjamin E. Smith. ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia'', vol 6. New York: Century Co., 1901. 5,221. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of a roof are dependent upon the purpose of the building that it covers, the available roofing materials and the local traditions of construction and wider concepts of [[architectural design]] and practice and may also be governed by local or national [[legislation]]. In most countries a roof protects primarily against [[rain]]. A [[verandah]] may be roofed with material that protects against sunlight but admits the other elements. The roof of a [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|garden conservatory]] protects plants from cold, wind, and rain, but admits light.
[[File:Neot smadar.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Shack]] made of [[date palm]] branches at [[Neot Semadar]], [[Israel]]]]
A roof may also provide additional living space, for example a [[roof garden]].

==Etymology==

Old English hrof "roof, ceiling, top, summit; heaven, sky," also figuratively, "highest point of something," from Proto-Germanic *khrofam (cf. Dutch roef "deckhouse, cabin, coffin-lid," Middle High German rof "penthouse," Old Norse hrof "boat shed"). 

There are no apparent connections outside the Germanic family. "English alone has retained the word in a general sense, for which the other languages use forms corresponding to OE. þæc thatch" [OED].

==Design elements==
The elements in the design of a roof are:
* the material
* the [[Domestic roof construction|construction]]
* the durability

The '''material''' of a roof may range from [[banana]] leaves, wheaten [[straw]] or [[seagrass]] to [[Architectural glass|laminated glass]], [[copper]] ''(see: [[Copper in architecture#Roofing|copper roofing]])'', [[aluminium]] sheeting and [[pre-cast concrete]]. In many parts of the world [[ceramic]] [[tile]]s have been the predominant roofing material for centuries, if not millennia. Other roofing materials include [[asphalt]], [[Coal tar|coal tar pitch]], [[EPDM rubber]], [[Hypalon]], [[List of polyurethane applications|polyurethane foam]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[slate]], [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon fabric]], [[Thermoplastic olefin|TPO]], and [[Wood shingle|wood shakes and shingles]].

The '''construction''' of a roof is determined by its method of support and how the underneath space is bridged and whether or not the roof is ''pitched''. The ''[[roof pitch|pitch]]'' is the angle at which the roof rises from its lowest to highest point. Most US [[house|domestic architecture]], except in very dry regions, has roofs that are sloped, or ''pitched''. Although modern construction elements such as drainpipes may remove the need for pitch, roofs are pitched for reasons of tradition and aesthetics. So the pitch is partly dependent upon stylistic factors, and partially to do with practicalities.

Some types of roofing, for example [[thatch]], require a steep pitch in order to be waterproof and durable. Other types of roofing, for example [[Pantile (roof material)|pantiles]], are unstable on a steeply pitched roof but provide excellent weather protection at a relatively low angle. In regions where there is little rain, an almost flat roof with a slight run-off provides adequate protection against an occasional downpour. Drainpipes also remove the need for a sloping roof.

A person that specializes in roof construction is called a [[roofer]].

The '''durability''' of a roof is a matter of concern because the roof is often the least accessible part of a building for purposes of repair and renewal, while its damage or destruction can have serious effects.

==Form==
[[File:Roof diagram.jpg|thumb|Terminology of some roof parts]]
{{Main|List of roof shapes}}
The '''shape of roofs''' differs greatly from region to region. The main factors which influence the shape of roofs are the climate and the materials available for roof structure and the outer covering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roofing-materials-to-prot_b_8959516|title=Roofing Materials to Protect You From the Elements|website=HuffPost|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic shapes of roofs are [[flat roof|flat]],    
[[Mono-pitched roof|mono-pitched]], [[gable]]d, [[hip roof|hipped]], [[butterfly roof|butterfly]], [[arch]]ed and [[dome]]d. There are many variations on these types. Roofs constructed of flat sections that are sloped are referred to as [[pitched roof]]s (generally if the angle exceeds 10 degrees).&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Harris,''Dictionary of Architecture &amp; Construction&lt;/ref&gt; Pitched roofs, including gabled, hipped and skillion roofs, make up the greatest number of domestic roofs. Some roofs follow organic shapes, either by architectural design or because a flexible material such as thatch has been used in the construction.

==Parts==
[[File:Star-roof lifted into place.jpg|thumb|Star-roof lifted into the [[ESO]] Supernova Planetarium &amp; Visitor Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESO Supernova Star Roof Complete|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann16024/|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There are two parts to a roof, its supporting structure and its outer skin, or uppermost weatherproof layer. In a minority of buildings, the outer layer is also a self-supporting structure.

The roof structure is generally supported upon walls, although some building styles, for example, [[geodesic dome|geodesic]] and [[A-frame house|A-frame]], blur the distinction between wall and roof.

===Support===
{{main|Domestic roof construction}}
[[File:Linkopings stadsbibliotek roof2.jpg|thumb|The roof of a library in [[Sweden]]]]
The supporting structure of a roof usually comprises beams that are long and of strong, fairly rigid material such as [[timber]], and since the mid-19th century, [[cast iron]] or [[steel]]. In countries that use [[bamboo]] extensively, the flexibility of the material causes a distinctive curving line to the roof, characteristic of [[Japanese architecture|Oriental architecture]].

Timber lends itself to a great variety of roof shapes. The timber structure can fulfil an aesthetic as well as practical function, when left exposed to view.

Stone [[Post and lintel|lintels]] have been used to support roofs since [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], but cannot bridge large distances. The stone arch came into extensive use in the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] period and in variant forms could be used to span spaces up to 140 feet (43 m) across. The stone arch or [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], with or without ribs, dominated the roof structures of major architectural works for about 2,000 years, only giving way to iron beams with the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the designing of such buildings as [[Joseph Paxton|Paxton]]'s [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], completed 1851.

With continual improvements in [[steel girder]]s, these became the major structural support for large roofs, and eventually for ordinary houses as well. Another form of [[girder]] is the [[reinforced concrete]] beam, in which metal rods are encased in concrete, giving it greater strength under [[Tension (physics)|tension]].

===Outer layer===
[[File:Korea-Samcheok-Gulpijip-Bark shingled house-02.jpg|thumb|A bark roof in Korea. See also: [[Birch-bark roof]]]]
{{Main|List of commercially available roofing material}}
This part of the roof shows great variation dependent upon availability of material. In [[vernacular architecture]], roofing material is often vegetation, such as [[Thatching|thatches]], the most durable being [[sea grass]] with a life of perhaps 40 years.  In many Asian countries bamboo is used both for the supporting structure and the outer layer where split bamboo stems are laid turned alternately and overlapped. In areas with an abundance of timber, wooden [[Roof shingle|shingles]] and [[Board roof|boards]] are used, while in some countries the [[Birch-bark roof|bark]] of certain trees can be peeled off in thick, heavy sheets and used for roofing.

The 20th century saw the manufacture of composition [[asphalt shingle]]s which can last from a thin 20-year shingle to the thickest which are limited lifetime shingles, the cost depending on the thickness and durability of the shingle. When a layer of shingles wears out, they are usually stripped, along with the underlay and roofing nails, allowing a new layer to be installed.  An alternative method is to install another layer directly over the worn layer. While this method is faster, it does not allow the roof sheathing to be inspected and water damage, often associated with worn shingles, to be repaired. Having multiple layers of old shingles under a new layer causes roofing nails to be located further from the sheathing, weakening their hold. The greatest concern with this method is that the weight of the extra material could exceed the dead load capacity of the roof structure and cause collapse. Because of this, jurisdictions which use the [[International Building Code]] prohibit the installation of new roofing on top of an existing roof that has two or more applications of any type of roof covering; the existing roofing material must be removed before installing a new roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chapter 9 - Roof Assemblies|url = http://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/icod/irc/2012/icod_irc_2012_9_par135.htm|website = publicecodes.cyberregs.com|accessdate = 2015-08-31|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150903034500/http://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/icod/irc/2012/icod_irc_2012_9_par135.htm|archivedate = 2015-09-03|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slate]] is an ideal, and durable material, while in the [[Swiss Alps]] roofs are made from huge slabs of stone, several inches thick. The slate roof is often considered the best type of roofing. A slate roof may last 75 to 150 years, and even longer. However, slate roofs are often expensive to install – in the USA, for example, a slate roof may have the same cost as the rest of the house. Often, the first part of a slate roof to fail is the fixing nails; they corrode, allowing the slates to slip. In the UK, this condition is known as "nail sickness". Because of this problem, fixing nails made of [[stainless steel]] or [[copper]] are recommended, and even these must be protected from the weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TRADITIONAL ROOFING MAGAZINE - Six Steps to Building a 150 Year Roof by Joseph Jenkins|url = http://www.traditionalroofing.com/TR1-150yearroof.html|website = www.traditionalroofing.com|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asbestos]], usually in bonded corrugated panels,  has been used widely in the 20th century as an inexpensive, non-flammable roofing material with excellent insulating properties. [[Asbestosis|Health]] and [[Asbestos and the law|legal issues]] involved in the mining and handling of asbestos products means that it is no longer used as a new roofing material. However, many asbestos roofs continue to exist, particularly in South America and Asia.

Roofs made of cut turf (modern ones known as [[green roof]]s, traditional ones as [[sod roof]]s) have good insulating properties and are increasingly encouraged as a way of "greening" the Earth. Adobe roofs are roofs of clay, mixed with binding material such as straw or animal hair, and plastered on lathes to form a flat or gently sloped roof, usually in areas of low rainfall.

In areas where clay is plentiful, roofs of baked [[Tile#Roof tiles|tiles]] have been the major form of roofing. The casting and firing of roof tiles is an industry that is often associated with [[brickworks]]. While the shape and colour of tiles was once regionally distinctive, now tiles of many shapes and colours are produced commercially, to suit the taste and pocketbook of the purchaser.

[[Architectural metals|Sheet metal]] in the form of [[copper]] and [[lead]] has also been used for many hundreds of years. Both are expensive but durable, the vast copper roof of [[Chartres Cathedral]], oxidised to a pale green colour, having been in place for hundreds of years. Lead, which is sometimes used for church roofs, was most commonly used as [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]] in valleys and around chimneys on domestic roofs, particularly those of slate. Copper was used for the same purpose.

In the 19th century, iron, electroplated with [[zinc]] to improve its resistance to rust, became a light-weight, easily transported, waterproofing material. Its low cost and easy application made it the most accessible commercial roofing, worldwide. Since then, many types of [[metal roof]]ing have been developed. Steel shingle or standing-seam roofs last about 50 years or more depending on both the method of installation and the moisture barrier (underlayment) used and are between the cost of shingle roofs and slate roofs.
In the 20th century a large number of roofing materials were developed, including roofs based on bitumen (already used in previous centuries), on rubber and on a range of synthetics such as [[thermoplastic]] and on [[fibreglass]].

==Functions==

===Insulation===
Because the purpose of a roof is to protect people and their possessions from climatic elements, the insulating properties of a roof are a consideration in its structure and the choice of roofing material.

Some roofing materials, particularly those of natural fibrous material, such as thatch, have excellent insulating properties. For those that do not, extra [[Building insulation|insulation]] is often installed under the outer layer. In developed countries, the majority of dwellings have a [[ceiling]] installed under the structural members of the roof.  The purpose of a ceiling is to insulate against heat and cold, noise, dirt and often from the droppings and lice of birds who frequently choose roofs as nesting places.

Concrete tiles can be used as insulation. When installed leaving a space between the tiles and the roof surface, it can reduce heating caused by the sun.

Forms of insulation are felt or plastic sheeting, sometimes with a reflective surface, installed directly below the tiles or other material; synthetic foam batting laid above the ceiling and recycled paper products and other such materials that can be inserted or sprayed into roof cavities. So called [[Cool roof]]s are becoming increasingly popular, and in some cases are mandated by local codes.  Cool roofs are defined as roofs with both high [[reflectivity]] and high [[thermal emittance]].

Poorly insulated and ventilated roofing can suffer from problems such as the formation of [[Ice dam (roof)|ice dams]] around the overhanging eaves in cold weather, causing water from melted snow on upper parts of the roof to penetrate the roofing material. Ice dams occur when heat escapes through the uppermost part of the roof, and the snow at those points melts, refreezing as it drips along the shingles, and collecting in the form of ice at the lower points. This can result in structural damage from stress, including the destruction of gutter and drainage systems.

===Drainage===
The primary job of most roofs is to keep out water. The large area of a roof repels a lot of water, which must be directed in some suitable way, so that it does not cause damage or inconvenience.

Flat roof of adobe dwellings generally have a very slight slope. In a Middle Eastern country, where the roof may be used for recreation, it is often walled, and drainage holes must be provided to stop water from pooling and seeping through the porous roofing material.

Similar problems, although on a very much larger scale, confront the builders of modern commercial properties which often have flat roofs. Because of the very large nature of such roofs, it is essential that the outer skin be of a highly impermeable material. Most industrial and commercial structures have conventional roofs of low pitch.

In general, the pitch of the roof is proportional to the amount of precipitation. Houses in areas of low rainfall frequently have roofs of low pitch while those in areas of high rainfall and snow, have steep roofs. The [[longhouse]]s of [[Papua New Guinea]], for example, being roof-dominated architecture, the high roofs sweeping almost to the ground. The high steeply-pitched roofs of Germany and Holland are typical in regions of snowfall. In parts of North America such as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], USA or [[Montreal]], Canada, there is a required minimum slope of 6&amp;nbsp;inches in 12&amp;nbsp;inches, a pitch of 30 degrees.

There are regional building styles which contradict this trend, the stone roofs of the Alpine chalets being usually of gentler incline. These buildings tend to accumulate a large amount of snow on them, which is seen as a factor in their insulation. The pitch of the roof is in part determined by the roofing material available, a pitch of 3/12 or greater slope generally being covered with asphalt shingles, wood shake, corrugated steel, slate or tile.

The water repelled by the roof during a rainstorm is potentially damaging to the building that the roof protects. If it runs down the walls, it may seep into the mortar or through panels. If it lies around the foundations it may cause seepage to the interior, [[rising damp (structural)|rising damp]] or [[dry rot]]. For this reason most buildings have a system in place to protect the walls of a building from most of the roof water. Overhanging [[eaves]] are commonly employed for this purpose. Most modern roofs and many old ones have systems of valleys, gutters, waterspouts, waterheads and [[Drain (plumbing)|drainpipes]] to remove the water from the vicinity of the building. In many parts of the world, roofwater is collected and stored for domestic use.

Areas prone to heavy snow benefit from a metal roof because their smooth surfaces shed the weight of snow more easily and resist the force of wind better than a wood shingle or a concrete tile roof.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Solar roofs===
Newer systems include [[solar shingle]]s which generate [[electricity]] as well as cover the roof. There are also solar systems available that generate hot water or hot air and which can also act as a roof covering.  More complex systems may carry out all of these functions: generate electricity, recover thermal energy, and also act as a roof covering.

Solar systems can be integrated with roofs by:
* integration in the covering of pitched roofs, e.g. [[solar shingle]]s.
* mounting on an existing roof, e.g. [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]] on a [[tile]] roof.
* integration in a flat roof membrane using heat welding, e.g. PVC.
* mounting on a flat roof with a construction and additional weight to prevent uplift from wind.

{{Distinguish|Sanitation engineering}}
'''Sanitary engineering''', also known as '''public health engineering''', is the application of engineering methods to improve [[sanitation]] of human communities, primarily by providing the removal and disposal of human waste, and in addition to the supply of safe [[potable water]]. Traditionally a branch of civil engineering, in the mid-19th century, the discipline concentrated on the reduction of disease, then thought to be caused by [[Miasma theory|miasma]]. This was accomplished mainly by the collection and segregation of sewerage flow in [[London]] specifically, and Great Britain generally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/ablit/britlit/sanitary.html Sanitary Reform of London], The Working Collection of [[Sir Joseph Bazalgette]], British and Commonwealth Literary Studies, [[Green Library]], [[Stanford University]]&lt;/ref&gt;  These and later regulatory improvements were reported in the United States as early as 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/31/news/european-sanitary-reform-the-british-sanitary-legislation.html EUROPEAN SANITARY REFORM.; The British Sanitary Legislation], [[The New York Times]], July 31, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not concerned with environmental factors that do not have an immediate and clearly understood effect on public health.  Areas outside the purview of sanitary engineering include [[traffic]] management, concerns about [[noise pollution]] or [[light pollution]], aesthetic concerns such as [[landscaping]], and [[environmental conservation]] as it pertains to [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.

Skills within this field are usually employed for the primary goal of [[disease]] prevention within [[human beings]] by assuring a supply of healthy [[drinking water]], treatment of waste water, removing [[Waste|garbage]] from inhabited areas, and so on.

Compared to (for example) [[electrical engineering]] or [[mechanical engineering]] which are concerned primarily with [[closed system]]s, sanitary engineering is a very [[interdisciplinary]] field which may involve such elements as [[hydraulics]], constructive modelling, [[information technology]], project design, [[microbiology]], [[pathology]] and the many divisions within [[environmental science]] and [[environmental technology]].  In some cases, considerations that fall within the field of [[social sciences]] and urban planning must be factored in as well.

Although sanitary engineering may be most associated with the design of [[sanitary sewer|sewers]], [[sewage treatment]] and [[waste water treatment]] facilities, [[recycling]] centers, [[landfill|public landfills]] and other things which are constructed, the term applies equally to (for example) a plan of action to reverse the effects of [[water pollution]] or [[soil contamination]] in a specific area.

==History==
{{Further information|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Irrigation systems were invented five to seven thousand years ago as a means of supplying water to agriculture-based societies. Aqueducts and irrigation systems were among the first forms of wastewater engineering.  As population centers became more dense, they were used to remove sewage from settlements. The Romans were among the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of the aqueduct.  The Dark Ages marked a period where progress in water management came to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steinbeck|first1=SG|title=An Abridged History of  Onsite Wastewater: Early Years to Present|url=http://ehs.ncpublichealth.com/oet/docs/cit/oswpmod/HistoryOfOSWW.pdf|website=REHS Onsite Water Protection Branch|publisher=Environmental Health Section, Division of Public Health, NC Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As populations grew, the management of human waste became a growing concern and a public health threat.  By the 1850s in London more than 400,000 tons of sewage were flushed into the Thames River each day - around 150 million tons a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London's Victorian sewer system|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/10092.htm|website=Thames Water|publisher=Tames Water|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases such as smallpox, diphtheria, measles, scarlet fever, typhus, cholera and typhoid  were spread via the contaminated water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardy|first1=Anne|title=Water and the Search for Public Health in London in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|journal=Medical History|date=1984|volume=28|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139446/pdf/medhist00078-0028.pdf|pmc=1139446|pmid=6390024|pages=250–82|doi=10.1017/s0025727300035936}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century major cities started building sewage systems to remove human waste out of cities and into rivers.

During the 1900s the activated sludge process was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matsuo|first1=Tomonori|title=Civil Engineering Vol. I|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c05/E6-37-01-03.pdf|website=Wastewater Management Engineering|publisher=Encyclodedia of Life Support Systems|accessdate=April 3, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The activated sludge process is a form of water purification that uses bacteria to consume human feces.  Chlorine is used to kill off the bacteria.

Over the centuries much has changed in the field of wastewater engineering. Advancements in microbiology, chemistry, and engineering have drastically changed the field. Today wastewater engineers work on the collection of clean water for drinking, chemically treating it, and using UV light to kill off micro-organisms. They also treat [[Water Pollution]] in wastewater (blackwater and greywater) so that this water may be made safe for use without endangering the population and environment around it.

==Municipalities==
Generally, sanitary engineers work for municipalities and are highly trained professionals with a diverse range of engineering skills.  Some are involved with a specific area of concern such as [[waste collection]] or the maintenance of [[waste water]] facilities and  [[storm water]] [[drainage]] systems within a district.

Others cover a broader scope of activities that might include the two just listed as well as such maintenance of the public [[water supply]], collection of residential yard waste program, disposal of  [[hazardous waste]], recycling strategies and even community programs where individuals or businesses "adopt" an area and either maintain it themselves or donate funds for doing so.

==Wastewater==
'''Wastewater engineering''' is not usually its own degree course but a specialization from degrees such as [[civil engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], Bio-chemical engineering or [[chemical engineering]]. Wastewater engineering deals with the transportation and cleaning of [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], [[greywater]], and irrigation water. [[Wastewater treatment]] and [[water reclamation]] are areas of concern in this field.

Wastewater engineers map out topographical and geographical features of Earth to determine the best means of collection, design pipe and pumped collection systems, and design treatment processes for collected wastewater.

===Job description and typical tasks===
Wastewater engineers use a variety of skills and must have knowledge of  mechanical and environmental engineering. They are required to perform tasks and demonstrate knowledge in design, mathematics, English, construction, physics, chemistry, biology, management, and personnel. Wastewater engineers must have skills in complex problem solving, critical thinking, mathematics, active listening, judgement, reading comprehension, speaking, writing, science, and system analysis.&lt;ref name=Onet&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Report for: 17-2081.01 - Water/Wastewater Engineers|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/17-2081.01|website=O*net Online|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical work activities include problem solving, communication with management and staff, gathering information, analyzing data, evaluating standards and complying with them, and communicating with others in the field.

Wastewater engineers perform these activities by combining their knowledge and skills to perform tasks. These tasks are to understand computer-aided design programs, and to conduct studies for the  construction of facilities, water supply systems and collection systems.  They may design systems for wastewater collection machinery, as well as system components.  They may perform water flow analysis, then select designs and equipment based on government and industry standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fairfax County Department of Human Resources|title=Wastewater Plant Operations Manager Classification Specification|url=http://agency.governmentjobs.com/fairfaxcounty/default.cfm?action=viewclassspec&amp;classSpecID=969985&amp;viewOnly=yes|website=Fairfax County Classifications|publisher=Fairfax County, VA|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical employers===
Wastewater engineers work for private companies, state and local governments, and special districts. As of 2012 there were 53,000 wastewater engineers employed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bureau of Labor Statistics|title=Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant and System Operators|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/production/water-and-wastewater-treatment-plant-and-system-operators.htm|website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern challenges: climate change===
Today the wastewater managers confront new challenges and the need for new technology as water levels decrease due to increasingly frequent and extended droughts. Technologies such as sonar mapping are being used in wells to determine the volume of water that they can hold. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the State of New York worked together to map underground aquifers since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ground Water Resource Mapping|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/36118.html|website=New York State Department of Resource Conservation|publisher=State of New York|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they have thorough maps of these aquifers to assist in water management.

Wastewater treatment contributes to global warming in many ways. One of the factors that contributes to global warming is wastewater treatment facilities and their emissions of greenhouse gases. Some of those gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases occur because of the decomposition of organic material from the anaerobic bacteria. These bacteria clean the leftover waste. Even if the anaerobic bacteria decomposition produces these gases, the percentage of greenhouse gases that other equipment produce is still greater than the contribution of the anaerobic bacteria. Also, the power usage from those machinery is very high. That is why many facilities are undergoing renovation to use higher levels of anaerobic bacteria compared to other types of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cakir|first1=FY|title=Greenhouse gas production: A comparison between aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment technology|journal=Water Research|date=September 26, 2005|volume=39|issue=17|pages=4197–4203|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2005.07.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[effects of global warming]] on waste water treatment facilities vary from location to location. In the Northeast there has been increased rainfall causing treatment plants to be too small relative to the amount coming in. In the West there is a lack of rainfall and water sources are being depleted. This means the facilities will need to be updated to meet modern and future environmental changes such as the increased use of recycled and [[reclaimed water]] Climate change also affects piping and increases the rate of corrosion, adding to facility cost.

Desalination plants may be required in the future for those regions hardest hit by [[water scarcity]]. Desalination is a process of cleaning water by means of evaporation. Water is evaporated and it passes through membranes. The water is then cooled and condenses allowing it to flow either back into the main water line or out to sea. Desalination is not completely "green" since the plants require energy to run and due to the fact that the brine waste must managed to avoid ecological damage to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lattemann|first1=Sabine|title=Environmental impact and impact assessment of seawater desalination|journal=Desalination|date=2008|volume=220|issue=1|pages=1–15|accessdate=April 20, 2015
|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Th_Hoepner/publication/222564177_Environmental_impact_and_impact_assessment_of_seawater_desalination/links/54129baa0cf2bb7347daecf2.pdf||display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2007.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education necessary for the job===
Formal education for wastewater engineers begins in high school with students taking classes such as chemistry, biology, physics, and higher mathematics including calculus. After high school most jobs require certification from a state agency. Those wanting to advance in the industry should pursue a civil engineering, [[mechanical engineering]], environmental engineering, or a [[facilities engineering]] degree. Gaining experience through internships and working while in college is a common pathway toward advancement.

Education about waste treatment requires course work in systems design, machinery design principles, water chemistry, and similar coursework. Other classes may include Chemistry of Plant Processes, and various plant operations courses.

Initial employment in wastewater engineering can be obtained by those with and without advanced formal education. The California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), for example, shows how individuals can advance through a progression of certifications as Waste Water Treatment Operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=California Environmental Protection Agency|title=Operator Certification Requirements TABLE|url=http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/operator_certification/docs/ocr_table.pdf|website=State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=State of California|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board uses a five level classification system to classify
water treatment facilities into categories I-V according to the population served
and the complexity of the treatment system.

The Operator Certification requirements for water treatment operators and waste water treatment operators are described in detail by State law. To meet certification requirements, operators must submit an application to SWRCB, have the necessary work experience, meet the educational requirements, and pass an examination based on the knowledge, skill,and abilities described in the regulations. Operators are required to renew their certificates every three years.  To be elibible for renewal, certified operators must complete a specified number of continuing education hours after the previous issuance of a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wastewater Treatment Plant Classification, Operator Certification, and Contract Operator Registration |url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/operator_certification/docs/ocr_clean.pdf|website=State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=State of California|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wastewater engineers may advance in their careers through additional education and experience. With additional knowledge and experience one can become the manager of an entire plant. The accreditation body certifying the education for the degree and license is the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET).  Over time some companies may require the wastewater engineer to continue their education to keep up with any changes in technology.

Obtaining one’s master's degree is encouraged since many companies list it as a preference in selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Engineer|url=http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-engineering-careers/engineering/environmental-engineer#education|website=Science Buddies|publisher=Science Buddies, Inc.|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Engineer: Career Profile|url=http://study.com/articles/Environmental_Engineer_Career_Profile.html|website=Study.com|publisher=Study.com, Mountain View, CA|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this field 76 percent of those employed have a bachelor's degree, 17 percent have a master's degree and three percent have a post-doctoral degree as of 2013.&lt;ref name="Onet"/&gt;  The average annual salary is approximately $83,360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wages and Employment Trends|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/17-2081.01#WagesEmployment|website=Onetonline.org|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1800">{{about|underground passages||Shaft (disambiguation)}}

In civil engineering a '''shaft''' is an underground vertical or inclined passageway. Shafts are constructed for a number of reasons including:

* For the construction of a tunnel
* For [[Ventilation (mining)|ventilation]] of a tunnel or [[Subterranea (geography)|underground structure]]
* As a drop shaft for a sewerage or water tunnel
* For access to a tunnel or underground structure, also as an escape route

==Construction==
There are a number of methods for the construction of shafts, the most significant being:

* The use of sheet piles, [[Slurry wall |diaphragm walls]] or bored piles to construct a square or rectangular braced shaft
* The use of segmental lining installed by [[underpinning]] or [[caisson (engineering)|caisson]] sunk to form a circular shaft
* Incremental excavation with a shotcrete circular or elliptical lining
* Incremental excavation supported by shotcrete, rock bolts, cable anchors and steel sets or ribs

Shafts can be sunk either dry or for methods such as the caisson method they can be sunk wet. Sinking a dry shaft means that any water that flows into the excavation is pumped out to leave no significant standing or flowing water in the base of the shaft. When wet sinking a shaft the shaft is allowed to flood and the muck is excavated out of the base of the shaft underwater using a grab on the end of a crane or similar excavation method. Because the shaft is flooded, the lining can not be constructed at the excavation level of the shaft so this method only suits methods where the lining is installed before shaft sinking (such as the use of sheet piles) or where the lining is sunk down with the shaft such as the caisson method.

A '''Tactical Engagement Simulation''' (TES) is a [[training]] system for using [[weapon]]s. [[Laser]] transmitters are used instead of bullets, larger rounds, or shorter-range guided weapons such as [[anti-tank missile]]s.  A laser transmitter is mounted on the weapon and aligned with the weapon's [[gun barrel|barrel]].  

[[Gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is often used as the stimulated medium and this produces a wavelength of 904 nanometres, in the near infrared band outside the sensitivity of the human eye which is from about 400 to 700 nm (0.4 to 0.7 micrometres).  

In modern TES systems the laser transmission is coded so that in a [[field exercise]], individual weapons can be identified by exercise control (EXCON) and appropriate calculations made of gravity drop, [[warhead]] damage radius and so forth.  

Weapons as small as [[hand gun]]s can be part of a TES system as can larger weapons including [[tanks]] and large calibre guns.  In field exercises, the laser transmitters can trigger cartridge-based [[Weapon effects simulation]] (WES) devices mounted on potential targets such as tanks and other vehicles.  WES systems include [[pyrotechnic]] flash/bang and smoke devices that add realism to a field exercise.  

All these events are recorded on the exercise computer.  After-Action Review (AAR) can include comprehensive analysis of weapon firing, accuracy and warhead effects on the targets.  Such techniques have taken much speculation out of the assessment of field exercises and have resulted in more realistic training than used to be available other than by using (dangerous) live firing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25208">'''Toxicodynamics''', termed [[pharmacodynamics]] in [[pharmacology]], describes the dynamic interactions of a toxicant with a biological target and its biological effects.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli&gt;Boelsterli, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A [[biological target]], also known as the site of action, can be binding proteins, [[ion channel]]s, [[DNA]], or a variety of other receptors. When a [[toxicant]] enters an organism, it can interact with these receptors and produce structural or functional alterations. The [[mechanism of action]] of the toxicant, as determined by a toxicant’s chemical properties, will determine what receptors are targeted and the overall toxic effect at the cellular level and organismal level.

Toxicants have been grouped together according to their chemical properties by way of [[quantitative structure-activity relationship]]s (QSARs), which allows prediction of toxic action based on these properties.  [[Endocrine disruptors|endocrine disrupting chemicals]] (EDCs) and [[carcinogen]]s are examples of classes of toxicants that can act as QSARs. EDCs mimic or block transcriptional activation normally caused by natural [[steroid hormone]]s.  These types of chemicals can act on [[androgen receptor]]s, [[estrogen receptor]]s and [[thyroid hormone receptor]]s.  This mechanism can include such toxicants as [[dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane]] (DDE) and [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs). Another class of chemicals, carcinogens, are substances that cause [[cancer]] and can be classified as [[genotoxic]] or nongenotoxic carcinogens.  These categories include toxicants such as [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAHs) and [[carbon tetrachloride]] (CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

The process of toxicodynamics can be useful for application in environmental [[risk assessment]] by implementing toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models.  TKTD models include phenomenas such as time-varying exposure, carry-over [[toxicity]], organism recovery time, effects of mixtures, and extrapolation to untested [[chemical compound|chemicals]] and [[species]].  Due to their advantages, these types of models may be more applicable for risk assessment than traditional modeling approaches.

== Overview ==

[[File:Diagram showing the conceptual pathway of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics.png|thumb|alt=A box model explaining the processes of toxokinetics and toxicodynamics.|A box model explaining the processes of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics.]]

While [[toxicokinetics]] describes the changes in the concentrations of a toxicant over time due to the uptake, [[biotransformation]], distribution and elimination of toxicants, toxicodynamics involves the interactions of a toxicant with a [[biological target]] and the functional or structural alterations in a cell that can eventually lead to a toxic effect. Depending on the toxicant’s chemical reactivity and vicinity, the toxicant may be able to interact with the biological target. Interactions between a toxicant and the biological target may also be more specific, where high-affinity [[binding site]]s increase the selectivity of interactions. For this reason, toxicity may be expressed primarily in certain [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] or [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. The targets are often receptors on the cell surface or in the [[cytoplasm]] and [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Toxicants can either induce an unnecessary response or inhibit a natural response, which can cause damage. If the biological target is critical and the damage is severe enough, irreversible injury can occur first at the molecular level, which will translate into effects at higher levels of organization.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt;

== Endocrine disruptors ==

EDCs are generally considered to be toxicants that either mimic or block the transcriptional activation normally caused by natural steroid hormones.&lt;ref name=Tabb&gt;Tabb and Blumberg, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals include those acting on androgen receptors, estrogen receptors and thryoid hormone receptors.&lt;ref name=Tabb /&gt;

=== Effects of endocrine disruptors ===

Endocrine disrupting chemicals can interfere with the [[endocrine system]] in a number of ways including hormone synthesis, storage/release, transport and clearance, receptor recognition and binding, and postreceptor activation.&lt;ref name=Choi&gt;Choi et al., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In wildlife, exposure to EDCs can result in altered fertility, reduced viability of offspring, impaired hormone secretion or activity and modified reproductive anatomy.&lt;ref name=Guillette&gt;Guillette et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive anatomy of offspring can particularly be affected if maternal exposure occurs.&lt;ref name=Colborn&gt;Colborn et al., 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In females, this includes [[mammary gland]]s, [[fallopian tube]]s, [[uterus]], [[cervix]], and [[vagina]]. In males, this includes the [[prostate]], [[seminal vesicle]]s, [[epididymitis]] and [[testes]].&lt;ref name=Colborn /&gt; Exposure of fish to EDCs has also been associated with abnormal thyroid function, decreased fertility, decreased hatching success, de-feminization and masculinization of female fish and alteration of [[immune system|immune function]].&lt;ref name=Colborn /&gt;

Endocrine disruption as a [[mode of action]] for [[xenobiotic]]s was brought into awareness by [[Our Stolen Future]] by Theo Colborn.&lt;ref name=Tabb /&gt; Endocrine disrupting chemicals are known to accumulate in body tissue and are highly persistent in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Clotfelter et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Many toxicants are known EDCs including [[pesticide]]s, [[phthalate]]s, [[phytoestrogens]], some industrial/commercial products, and [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref name=Choi /&gt; These chemicals are known to cause endocrine disruption via a few different mechanisms. While the mechanism associated with the thyroid hormone receptor is not well understood, two more established mechanisms involve the inhibition of the androgen receptor and activation of the estrogen receptor.

=== Androgen-receptor mediated ===
Certain toxicants act as endocrine disruptors by interacting with the androgen receptor. DDE is one example of a chemical that acts via this mechanism. DDE is a [[metabolite]] of [[DDT]] that is widespread in the environment.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; Although production of DDT has been banned in the Western world, this chemical is extremely persistent and is still commonly found in the environment along with its metabolite DDE.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; DDE is an [[antiandrogen]], which means it alters the expression of specific androgen-regulated genes, and is an androgen receptor (AR)-mediated mechanism.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; DDE is a [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] compound which diffuses into the cell and binds to the AR.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; Through binding, the receptor is inactivated and cannot bind to the androgen response element on DNA.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; This inhibits the transcription of androgen-responsive genes&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; which can have serious consequences for exposed wildlife. In 1980, there was a spill in [[Lake Apopka]], Florida which released the pesticide dicofol and DDT along with its metabolites.&lt;ref name=Guillette /&gt; The neonatal and juvenile alligators present in this lake have been extensively studied and observed to have altered [[Blood plasma|plasma]] hormone concentrations, decreased clutch viability, increased juvenile mortality, and morphological abnormalities in the testis and ovary.&lt;ref name=Guillette /&gt;

=== Estrogen-receptor mediated ===
Toxicants may also cause endocrine disruption through interacting with the estrogen receptor. This mechanism has been well-studied with PCBs. These chemicals have been used as coolants and lubricants in transformers and other electrical equipment due to their insulating properties.&lt;ref name=ATSDR&gt;ATSDR&lt;/ref&gt; A purely [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] substance, PCBs are no longer in production in the United States due to the adverse health effects associated with exposure, but they are highly persistent and are still widespread in the environment.&lt;ref name=ATSDR /&gt; PCBs are a [[xenoestrogen]], which elicit an enhancing (rather than inhibiting) response, and are mediated by the estrogen receptor.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; These are often referred to as estrogen mimics because they mimic the effects of estrogen. PCBs often build up in sediments and [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in organisms.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; These chemicals diffuse into the nucleus and bind to the estrogen receptor.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; The estrogen receptor is kept in an inactive conformation through interactions with proteins such as [[heat shock protein]]s 59, 70, and 90.&lt;ref name=Pait&gt;Pait, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; After the toxicant binding occurs, the estrogen receptor is activated and forms a [[protein dimer|homodimer]] complex which seeks out estrogen response elements in the DNA.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; The binding of the complex to these elements causes a rearrangement of the [[chromatin]] and transcription of the gene, resulting in production of a specific protein.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; In doing this, PCBs elicit an estrogenic response which can affect numerous functions within the organism.&lt;ref name=Boelsterli /&gt; These effects are observed in various aquatic species. The levels of PCBs in marine mammals are often very high as a result of bioaccumulation.&lt;ref name=Perrin&gt;Perrin, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have demonstrated that PCBs are responsible for reproductive impairment in the [[harbor seal]] (Phoca vitulina).&lt;ref name=Perrin /&gt; Similar effects have been found in the [[grey seal]] (Halichoerus grypus), the [[ringed seal]] (Pusa hispida) and the [[California sea lion]] (Zalophys californinus).&lt;ref name=Perrin /&gt; In the grey seals and ringed seals, uterine occlusions and [[stenosis]] were found which led to [[sterility (physiology)|sterility]].&lt;ref name=Perrin /&gt; If exposed to a xenoestrogen such as PCBs, male fish have also been seen to produce [[vitellogenin]].&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; Vitellogenin is an egg protein female fish normally produce but is not usually present in males except at very low concentrations.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt; This is often used as a [[biomarker]] for EDCs.&lt;ref name=Pait /&gt;

== Carcinogens ==
Carcinogens are defined as any substance that causes cancer. The toxicodynamics of carcinogens can be complex due to the varying mechanisms of action for different carcinogenic toxicants. Because of their complex nature, carcinogens are classified as either genotoxic or nongenotoxic carcinogens.

=== Effects of carcinogens ===
The effects of carcinogens are most often related to human exposures but mammals are not the only species that can be affected by cancer-causing toxicants.&lt;ref name=Rand&gt;Rand, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies have shown that cancer can develop in fish species as well.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; [[Neoplasm]]s occurring in [[Epithelium|epithelial tissue]] such as the [[liver]], gastrointestinal tract, and the [[pancreas]] have been linked to various environmental toxicants.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; Carcinogens preferentially target the liver in fish and develop hepatocellular and biliary lesions.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt;

=== Genotoxic carcinogens ===
Genotoxic carcinogens interact directly with DNA and genetic material or indirectly by their reactive metabolites.&lt;ref name=VanDelft&gt;VanDelft et al., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicants such as PAHs can be genotoxic carcinogens to aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt;&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;Newman, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  PAHs are widely spread throughout the environment through the incomplete burning of coal, wood, or petroleum products.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt; Although PAHs do not bioaccumulate in vertebrate tissue, many studies have confirmed that certain PAH compounds such as [[benzo(a)pyrene]], [[benz(a)anthracene]], and Benzofluoranthene, are [[Bioavailability|bioavailable]] and responsible for liver [[disease]]s like cancer in wild fish populations.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt; One mechanism of action for genotoxic carcinogens includes the formation of [[DNA adduct]]s. Once the PAH compound enters an organism, it becomes [[Metabolism|metabolized]] and available for biotransformation.

The biotransformation process can activate the PAH compound and transform it into a diol epoxide,&lt;ref name=Munoz&gt;Munoz and Albores, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which is a very [[reactive intermediate]]. These diol-epoxides [[Covalent bond|covalently bind]] with DNA [[base pair]]s, most often with [[guanine]] and [[adenine]] to form stable adducts within the DNA structure.&lt;ref name=Munoz /&gt; The binding of diol epoxides and DNA base pairs blocks polymerase replication activity. This blockage ultimately contributes to an increase in DNA damage by reducing repair activity.&lt;ref name=Munoz /&gt;

Due to these processes, PAH compounds are thought to play a role in the initiation and early promotion stage of [[carcinogenesis]]. Fish exposed to PAHs develop a range of liver [[lesion]]s, some of which are characteristic of [[hepatocarcinogen]]icity.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt;

=== Nongenotoxic carcinogens ===
Nongenotoxic, or [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] carcinogens are different and slightly more ambiguous than genotoxic carcinogens since they are not directly carcinogenic. Nongenotoxic carcinogens act by secondary mechanisms that do not directly damage genes. This type of carcinogenesis does not change the sequence of DNA; instead it alters the expression or repression of certain genes by a wide variety of cellular processes.&lt;ref name=VanDelft /&gt; Since these toxicants do not directly act on DNA, little is known about the mechanistic pathway.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; It has been proposed that modification of gene expression from nongenotoxic carcinogens can occur by [[oxidative stress]], peroxisome proliferation, suppression of [[apoptosis]], alteration of intercellular communication, and modulation of metabolizing enzymes.&lt;ref name=VanDelft /&gt;

Carbon tetrachloride  is an example of a probable nongenotoxic carcinogen to aquatic vertebrates. Historically, carbon tetrachloride has been used in pharmaceutical production, petroleum refining, and as an industrial solvent.&lt;ref name=NTP&gt;National Toxicology Program, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its widespread industrial use and release into the environment, carbon tetrachloride has been found in drinking water and therefore, has become a concern for aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=Rabergh&gt;Rabergh and Lipsky, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its high [[Hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic]] properties, carbon tetrachloride could potentially be linked to liver cancer. Experimental cancer studies have shown that carbon tetrachloride may cause [[Benign tumor|benign]] and [[Malignancy|malignant]] liver [[tumor]]s to [[rainbow trout]].&lt;ref name=NTP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rabergh /&gt; carbon tetrachloride works as a nongenotoxic carcinogen by formulating [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] which induce oxidative stress.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt; It has been proposed that once carbon tetrachloride enters the organism, it is metabolized to trichloromethyl and trichloromethyl peroxy radicals by the [[CYP2E1]] [[enzyme]].&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Manibusan&gt;Manibusan and Eastmond, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The more reactive radical, trichloromethyl peroxy, can attack [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s in the [[Cell membrane|cellular membrane]] to form [[fatty acid]] free radicals and initiate [[lipid peroxidation]].&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt; The attack on the cellular membrane increases its permeability, causing a leakage of enzymes and disrupts cellular calcium [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt; This loss of calcium homeostasis activates calcium dependent [[degradative enzyme]]s and [[cytotoxicity]], causing hepatic damage.&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt; The regenerative and proliferative changes that occur in the liver during this time could increase the frequency of genetic damage, resulting in a possible increase of cancer.&lt;ref name=Manibusan /&gt;

== Applications ==

Toxicodynamics can be used in combination with toxicokinetics in environmental risk assessment to determine the potential effects of releasing a toxicant into the environment.  The most widely used method of incorporating this are TKTD models.

=== Setup of TKTD models ===
Both toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics have now been described, and using these definitions models were formed, where the internal concentration (TK) and damage (TD) are [[simulation|simulated]] in response to exposure.  TK and TD are separated in the model to allow for the identification of properties of toxicants that determine TK and those that determine TD.  To use this type of model, [[parameter]] values for TK processes need to be obtained first.  Second, the TD parameters need to be estimated.  Both of these steps require a large database of toxicity information for [[parameterization]].  After establishing all the parameter values for the TKTD model, and using basic scientific precautions, the model can be used to predict toxic effects, calculate recovery times for organisms, or establish extrapolations from the model to toxicity of untested toxicants and species.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher"&gt;Ashauer and Escher 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashauer et al., 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of TKTD models ===
It has been argued that the current challenges facing risk assessments can be addressed with TKTD modeling.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;  TKTD models were derived in response to a couple of factors.  One is the lack of time being considered as a factor in toxicity and risk assessment.  Some of the earliest developed TKTD models, such as the [[Critical Body Residue]] (CBR) model and Critical Target Occupation (CTO) model, have considered time as a factor but a criticism has been that they are for very specific circumstances such as reversibly acting toxicants or irreversibly acting toxicants.  Further extrapolation of the CTO and CBR models are [[DEBtox]], which can model sublethal endpoints, and hazard versions of the CTO, which takes into account [[stochastic]] death as opposed to individual [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]].&lt;ref name="Jager et al."&gt;Jager et al. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Another significant step to developing TKTD models was the incorporation of a [[state variable]] for damage.  By using damage as a toxicodynamic state-variable, modeling intermediate recovery rates can be accomplished for toxicants that act reversibly with their targets, without the assumptions of instant recovery (CBR model) or irreversible interactions (CTO model). TKTD models that incorporate damage are the Damage Assessment Model (DAM) and the Threshold Damage Model (TDM).&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jager et al." /&gt; For what may seem like straightforward [[Clinical endpoint|endpoints]], a variety of different TKTD approaches exist.  A review of the assumptions and [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of each was previously published in the creation of a general unified threshold model of survival (GUTS).&lt;ref name="Jager et al." /&gt;

=== Advantages for risk assessment ===

As referenced above, TKTD models have several advantages to traditional models for risk assessments.  The principal advantages to using TKTD models are:&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;

* The consequences of time-varying or repeated [[Chemical exposure|exposures]] can be explained and simulated by the TKTD model.
* Carry-over toxicity as well as delayed effects can be simulated, whether the carry-over toxicity is due to TK or TD or both.&lt;ref&gt;Ashauer et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, TKTD models can quantify risks from pulsed or fluctuating exposures.
* Organism recovery time depends on the time course of TK and TD, which makes the TKTD models suitable for calculating organism recovery time.
* TKTD models have the potential to predict effects of mixtures and also be used as mechanism-based extrapolation to untested toxicants or untested species.
* Linking TKTD models with [[agent-based model|Individual Based Models]] (IBM) may improve risk assessment of toxicants by simulating [[Time|temporal]] aspects as well as [[ecology|ecological]] aspects.

Due to its advantages, TKTD models may be more powerful than the traditional [[dose-response relationship|dose-response]] models because of their incorporation of chemical [[concentration]]s as well as temporal dimensions.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;  Toxicodynamic modeling (such as TKTD models) has been shown to be a useful tool for toxicological research, with increasing opportunities to use these results in risk assessment to permit a more scientifically based risk assessment that is less reliable on [[animal testing]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaauboer 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, these types of models can formalize knowledge about the toxicity of toxicants and organism [[Resistance (ecology)|sensitivity]], create new hypotheses, and simulate temporal aspects of toxicity, making them useful tools for risk assessment.&lt;ref name="Ashauer and Escher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jager et al." /&gt;
