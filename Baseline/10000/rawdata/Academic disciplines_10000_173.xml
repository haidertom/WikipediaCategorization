{{Advanced Placement}}

'''Advanced Placement Microeconomics''' (or '''AP Microeconomics''') is a course offered by the College Board as part of the Advanced Placement Program for high school students interested in college-level coursework in microeconomics and/or gaining [[advanced standing]] in [[college]]. The course begins with a study of fundamental economic concepts such as [[scarcity]], [[opportunity cost]]s, production possibilities, specialization, and [[Transfer credit|comparative advantage]]. Major topics include the nature of functions of product markets; factor markets; and efficiency, equity, and the role of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14434">'''Adaptive comparative judgement''' is a technique borrowed from [[psychophysics]] which is able to generate reliable results for educational assessment – as such it is an alternative to traditional exam script marking. In the approach, judges are presented with pairs of student work and are then asked to choose which is better, one or the other. By means of an iterative and adaptive algorithm, a scaled distribution of student work can then be obtained without reference to criteria.

==Introduction==
Traditional exam script marking began in Cambridge 1792 when, with undergraduate numbers rising, the importance of proper ranking of students was growing. So in 1792 the new Proctor of Examinations, William Farish, introduced marking, a process in which every examiner gives a numerical score to each response by every student, and the overall total mark puts the students in the final rank order. [[Francis Galton]] (1869) noted that, in an unidentified year about 1863, the [[Senior Wrangler]] scored 7,634 out of a maximum of 17,000, while the Second Wrangler scored 4,123. (The 'Wooden Spoon' scored only 237.)

Prior to 1792, a team of Cambridge examiners convened at 5pm on the last day of examining, reviewed the 19 papers each student had sat – and published their rank order at midnight. Marking solved the problems of numbers and prevented unfair personal bias, and its introduction was a step towards modern objective testing, the format it is best suited to. But the technology of testing that followed, with its major emphasis on reliability and the automatisation of marking, has been an uncomfortable partner for some areas of educational achievement: assessing writing or speaking, and other kinds of performance need something more [[qualitative data|qualitative]] and judgemental.

The technique of Adaptive Comparative Judgement is an alternative to marking. It returns to the pre-1792 idea of sorting papers according to their quality, but retains the guarantee of reliability and fairness. It is by far the most reliable way known to score essays or more complex performances{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source(s) needed to justify such a strong claim|date=September 2018}}. It is much simpler than marking, and has been preferred by almost all examiners who have tried it. The real appeal of Adaptive Comparative Judgement lies in how it can re-professionalise the activity of assessment and how it can re-integrate [[Educational assessment|assessment]] with learning.

==History==

===Thurstone's law of comparative judgement===
{{quote|"There is no such thing as absolute judgement"|Laming (2004)&lt;ref&gt;* Laming, D R J (2004) ''Human judgment : the eye of the beholder.'' London, Thomson.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The science of comparative judgement began with [[Louis Leon Thurstone]] of the [[University of Chicago]]. A pioneer of [[psychophysics]], he proposed several ways to construct scales for measuring sensation and other [[psychological]] properties. One of these was the [[law of comparative judgment]] (Thurstone, 1927a, 1927b),&lt;ref&gt;Thurstone, L L (1927a). ''Psychophysical analysis''. American Journal of Psychology, 38, 368-389. Chapter 2 in Thurstone, L.L. (1959). The measurement of values. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thurstone, L L (1927b). ''The method of paired comparisons for social values''. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 21, 384-400. Chapter 7 in Thurstone, L.L. (1959). The measurement of values. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois&lt;/ref&gt; which defined a mathematical way of modeling the chance that one object will 'beat' another in a comparison, given values for the 'quality' of each. This is all that is needed to construct a complete measurement system.

A variation on his model (see [[Pairwise comparison]] and the BTL model), states that the difference between their quality values is equal to the log of the odds that object-A will beat object-B:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{log\;odds}(A\ \text{beats}\ B\mid v_a,v_b)=v_a-v_b
&lt;/math&gt;

Before the availability of modern computers, the mathematics needed to calculate the 'values' of each object's quality meant that the method could only be used with small sets of objects, and its application was limited. For Thurstone, the objects were generally sensations, such as intensity, or attitudes, such as the seriousness of crimes, or statements of opinions. Social researchers continued to use the method, as did market researchers for whom the objects might be different hotel room layouts, or variations on a proposed new biscuit.

In the 1970s and 1980s, comparative judgement appeared, almost for the first time in educational assessment, as a theoretical basis or precursor for the new Latent Trait or Item Response Theories. (Andrich, 1978) These models are now standard, especially in item banking and adaptive testing systems.

===Re-introduction in education===
The first published paper using Comparative Judgement in education was Pollitt &amp; Murray (1994), essentially a research paper concerning the nature of the English proficiency scale assessed in the speaking part of Cambridge's CPE exam. The objects were candidates, represented by 2-minute snippets of video recordings from their test sessions, and the judges were Linguistics post-graduate students with no assessment training. The judges compared pairs of video snippets, simply reporting which they thought the better student, and were then clinically interviewed to elicit the reasons for their decisions.

Pollitt then introduced Comparative Judgement to the UK awarding bodies, as a method for comparing the standards of A Levels from different boards. Comparative judgement replaced their existing method which required direct judgement of a script against the official standard of a different board. For the first two or three years of this Pollitt carried out all of the analyses for all the boards, using a program he had written for the purpose. It immediately became the only experimental method used to investigate exam comparability in the UK; the applications for this purpose from 1996 to 2006 are fully described in Bramley (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Bramley, T (2007) ''Paired comparison methods''. In Newton, P, Baird, J, Patrick, H, Goldstein, H, Timms, P and Wood, A (Eds).'' Techniques for monitoring the comparability of examination standards. London'', QCA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Pollitt presented a paper at the conference of the International Association for Educational Assessment titled Let's Stop Marking Exams, and another at the same conference in 2009 titled Abolishing Marksism. In each paper the aim was to convince the assessment community that there were significant advantages to using Comparative Judgement in place of marking for some types of assessment. In 2010 he presented a paper at the Association for Educational Assessment – Europe, How to Assess Writing Reliably and Validly, which presented evidence of the extraordinarily high reliability that has been achieved with Comparative Judgement in assessing primary school pupils'skill in first language English writing.

===Adaptive comparative judgement===
Comparative judgement becomes a viable alternative to marking when it is implemented as an adaptive web-based assessment system. In this, the 'scores' (the model parameter for each object) are re-estimated after each 'round' of judgements in which, on average, each object has been judged one more time. In the next round, each script is compared only to another whose current estimated score is similar, which increases the amount of statistical information contained in each judgement. As a result, the estimation procedure is more efficient than random pairing, or any other pre-determined pairing system like those used in classical comparative judgement applications. (Pollitt, 2012).&lt;ref name=p2012&gt;Pollitt, A (2012) The method of Adaptive Comparative Judgement. Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy &amp; Practice. 19: 3, 1-20.  DOI:10.1080/0969594X.2012.665354&lt;/ref&gt;

As with computer-adaptive testing, this adaptivity maximises the efficiency of the estimation procedure, increasing the separation of the scores and reducing the standard errors. The most obvious advantage is that this produces significantly enhanced reliability, compared to assessment by marking, with no loss of validity.

===Current comparative judgement projects===

==== Digital Assess ====
The Digital Assess platform is the original adaptive comparative judgement system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalassess.com www.digitalassess.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The system is designed to run at scale deployments of Adaptive Comparative Judgements and has been used around the world in a wide range of contexts. The company is currently developing new versions of the approach that utilise machine learning to substantially reduce the number of required judgements.

==== Open Source Comparative Judgement Projects ====
The Digital Platform for the Assessment of Competences (D-PAC) is a consortium with University of Antwerp, iMinds and Ghent University to create an open source Comparative Judgement application. D-PAC, In collaboration with No More Marking Ltd, have released the algorithms that power [http://www.nomoremarking.com www.nomoremarking.com] under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007

====Free Web-based Comparative Judgement ====
[http://www.nomoremarking.com No More Marking] have created a free online Comparative Judgement application, along with a repository of useful information.

====e-scape====
The first application of Comparative Judgement to the direct assessment of students was in a project called [[e-scape]], led by Prof. Richard Kimbell of London University's Goldsmiths College (Kimbell &amp; Pollitt, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Kimbell R, A and Pollitt A   (2008)   ''Coursework assessment in high stakes examinations: authenticity, creativity, reliability Third international Rasch measurement conference''. Perth: Western Australia: January.&lt;/ref&gt; The development work was carried out in collaboration with a number of awarding bodies in a Design &amp; Technology course. Kimbell's team developed a sophisticated and authentic project in which students were required to develop, as far as a prototype, an object such as a children's [[pill dispenser]] in two three-hour supervised sessions.

The web-based judgement system was designed by Karim Derrick and Declan Lynch from TAG Developments, now a part of Digital Assess, and based on the original [[MAPS (software)]] assessment portfolio system, now known as Manage. Goldsmiths, TAG Developments and Pollitt ran three trials, increasing the sample size from 20 to 249 students, and developing both the judging system and the assessment system. There are three pilots, involving Geography and Science as well as the original in Design &amp; Technology.

====Primary school writing====
In late 2009, TAG Developments and Pollitt trialled a new version of the system for assessing writing. A total of 1000 primary school scripts were evaluated by a team of 54 judges in a simulated national assessment context. The reliability of the resulting scores after each script had been judged 16 times was 0.96, considerably higher than in any other reported study of similar writing assessment. Further development of the system has shown that reliability of 0.93 can be reached after about 9 judgements of each script, when the system is no more expensive than single marking but still much more reliable.&lt;ref name="p2012"  /&gt;

Several projects are underway at present, in England, Scotland, Ireland, Israel, Singapore and Australia. They range from primary school to university in context, and include both formative and summative assessment, from writing to mathematics. The basic web system is now available on a commercial basis from TAG Assessment (http://www.tagassessment.com), and can be modified to suit specific needs.

=====University of Limerick=====

ACJ has been used by Seery, Canty, Gordon and Lane in the University of Limerick, Ireland to assess undergraduate student work on Initial Teacher Education programmes since 2009.

=====Purdue University=====

ACJ has been used by Dr. Bartholomew at Purdue University to assess design portfolios in middle, high-school, and university students.   Bartholomew has also used ACJ as a formative assessment teaching and learning tool for open-ended problems.

{{Anthropology |theories}}

The '''alliance theory''', also known as the '''general theory of exchanges''', is a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] method of studying [[kinship]] relations. It finds its origins in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1949) and is in opposition to the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] theory of [[Radcliffe-Brown]]. Alliance theory has oriented most [[Anthropology|anthropological]] French works until the 1980s; its influences were felt in various fields, including [[psychoanalysis]]&lt;!-- (who shared the belief in a universal [[incest taboo]])--&gt;, [[philosophy]] and [[political philosophy]].

The hypothesis of a "marriage-alliance" emerged in this frame, pointing out towards the necessary interdependence of various families and lineages. Marriages themselves are thus seen as a form of [[communication]] that anthropologists such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]], [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] or [[Rodney Needham]] have described. Alliance theory hence tries to understand the basic questions about inter-individual relations, or what constitutes [[human society|society]].

Alliance theory is based on the [[incest taboo]]: according to it, only this [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] prohibition of incest pushes human groups towards [[exogamy]]. Thus, inside a given society, certain categories of kin are forbidden to inter-marry. The incest taboo is thus a negative prescription; without it, nothing would push men to go searching for women outside their inner kinship circle, or vice versa. This theory echoes with [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913). But the incest taboo of alliance theory, in which one's daughter or sister is offered to someone outside a family circle, starts a circle of exchange of women: in return, the giver is entitled to a woman from the other's intimate kinship group. Thus the negative prescriptions of the prohibition have positive counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], ''Les structures élémentaires de la parenté'', Paris, Mouton, 1967, 2ème édition, p.60''&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the alliance theory is thus of a reciprocal or a generalized exchange which founds [[Affinity (law)|affinity]]. This global phenomenon takes the form of a "circulation of women" which links together the various social groups in one whole: society.

== Elementary structures and complex structures ==

According to Lévi-Strauss's alliance theory, there are two different structural "models" of marriage exchange. Either the women of ego's group are offered to another group "explicitly defined" by social institutions: these are the "elementary structures of kinship". Or the group of possible spouses for the women in ego's group is "indetermined and always open", to the exclusion, however, of certain kin-people ([[nuclear family]], aunts, uncles...), as in the [[Western world]]. Lévi-Strauss call these latter "complex structures of kinship".

Levi-Strauss' model attempted to offer a single explanation for [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross-cousin]] marriage, sister-exchange, dual organisation and rules of [[exogamy]]. Marriage rules over time create social structures, as marriages are primarily forged between groups and not just between the two individuals involved. When groups exchange women on a regular basis they marry together, with each marriage creating a debtor/creditor relationship which must be balanced through the "repayment" of wives, either directly or in the next generation. Levi-Strauss proposed that the initial motivation for the exchange of women was the incest taboo, which he deemed to be the beginning and essence of culture, as it was the first rule to check natural impulses; and secondarily the sexual division of labour. The former, by prescribing exogamy, creates a distinction between marriageable and tabooed women and thus necessitates a search for women outside one's own kin group ("marry out or die out"), which fosters exchange relationships with other groups; the latter creates a need for women to do "women's tasks". By necessitating wife-exchange arrangements, exogamy therefore promotes inter-group alliances and serves to form structures of social networks.

Levi-Strauss also discovered that a wide range of historically unrelated cultures had the rule that individuals should marry their cross-cousin, meaning children of siblings of the opposite sex - from a male perspective that is either the FZD (father's sister's daughter in kinship abbreviation) or the MBD (mother's brother's daughter in kinship abbreviation). Accordingly, he grouped all possible kinship systems into a scheme containing three basic kinship structures, constructed out of two types of exchange. He called the three kinship structures elementary, semi-complex and complex.

Elementary structures are based on positive marriage rules that specify whom a person must marry, while complex systems specify negative marriage rules (whom one must not marry), thus leaving a certain amount of room for choice based on preference. Elementary structures can operate based on two forms of exchange: restricted (or direct) exchange, a symmetric form of exchange between two groups (also called moieties) of wife-givers and wife-takers; in an initial restricted exchange FZ marries MB, with all children then being bilateral cross-cousins (the daughter is both MBD and FZD). Continued restricted exchange means that the two lineages marry together. Restricted exchange structures are generally quite uncommon.

The second form of exchange within elementary structures is called generalised exchange, meaning that a man can only marry either his MBD ([[matrilateral]] cross-cousin marriage) or his FZD ([[patrilateral]] cross-cousin marriage). This involves an asymmetric exchange between at least three groups. Matrilateral cross-cousin marriage arrangements where the marriage of the parents is repeated by successive generations are very common in parts of Asia (e.g. amongst the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]]). Levi-Strauss considered generalised exchange to be superior to restricted exchange because it allows the integration of indefinite numbers of groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Barnard and Good, 1984:96&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of restricted exchange are found in some tribes residing in the [[Amazon basin]]. These tribal societies are made up of multiple moieties which often split up, thus rendering them comparatively unstable. Generalised exchange is more integrative but contains an implicit hierarchy, for instance amongst the Kachin where wife-givers are superior to wife-takers. Consequently, the last wife-taking group in the chain is significantly inferior to the first wife-giving group to which it is supposed to give its wives. These status inequalities can destabilise the entire system or can at least lead to an accumulation of wives (and in the case of the Kachin also of bridewealth) at one end of the chain.

From a structural perspective, matrilateral cross-cousin marriage is superior to its patrilateral counterpart; the latter has less potential to produce social cohesion since its exchange cycles are shorter (the direction of wife exchange is reversed in each successive generation). Levi-Strauss' theory is supported by fact that patrilateral cross-cousin marriage is in fact the rarest of three types. However, matrilateral generalised exchange poses a risk, as group A depends on being given a woman from a group that it has not itself given a woman to, meaning that there is a less immediate obligation to reciprocate compared to a restricted exchange system. The risk created by such a delayed return is obviously lowest in restricted exchange systems.

Levi-Strauss proposed a third structure between elementary and complex structures, called the semi-complex structure, or the Crow-Omaha system. Semi-complex structures contain so many negative marriage rules that they effectively come close to prescribing marriage to certain parties, thus somewhat resembling elementary structures. These structures are found amongst societies such as the [[Crow tribe|Crow]] and [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]] native [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in [[North America]].

In Levi-Strauss' order of things, the basic building block of kinship is not just the nuclear family, as in structural-functionalism, but the so-called kinship atom: the nuclear family together with the wife's brother. This "mother's brother" (from the perspective of the wife-seeking son) plays a crucial role in alliance theory, as he is the one who ultimately decides whom his daughter will marry. Moreover, it is not just the nuclear family as such but alliances between families that matter in regard to the creation of social structures, reflecting the typical structuralist argument that the position of an element in the structure is more significant than the element itself. Descent theory and alliance theory therefore look at two different sides of the same coin: the former emphasising bonds of consanguinity (kinship by blood), the latter stressing bonds of affinity (kinship by law or choice).

The '''Annapolis Group''' is an American organization of independent [[liberal arts college]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =  | last = | title = About This Site|publisher = annapolisgroup.org| date = | url= http://annapolisgroup.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents approximately 130 [[liberal arts colleges in the United States]]. These colleges work together to promote a greater understanding of the goals of a [[liberal arts education]] through their websites, as well as through independent [[research]]. Its current [[Chair (official)|chair]] is [[Stephen D. Schutt]], the president of [[Lake Forest College]].

==Background==
The Annapolis Group was first organized in early 1993 in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. Its original members included and expanded upon the [[Oberlin Group]] which was first organized in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = | last = | title = Jewell Joins prestigious Annapolis Group| publisher = [[William Jewell College]]| date = | url = http://campus.jewell.edu/headlines/achieve/spring2003/jewellFacets.html| access-date = April 13, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928005551/http://campus.jewell.edu/headlines/achieve/spring2003/jewellFacets.html| archive-date = September 28, 2007| dead-url = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Annapolis Group was created by the presidents of [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]], [[Gettysburg College]], and [[Dickinson College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = | last = | title = Moravian College named to prestigious Annapolis Group| publisher = [[Moravian College]]| date = | url = http://www.moravian.edu/news/releases/2003/078.htm| access-date = April 13, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901190453/http://www.moravian.edu/news/releases/2003/078.htm| archive-date = September 1, 2006| dead-url = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of rankings==
An article was published on the website for the Annapolis Group (collegenews.org) in 2004, titled, "Liberal Arts College Presidents Speak Out on College Rankings." The article included statements made by the presidents of [[Dickinson College|Dickinson]], [[Reed College|Reed]], [[University of Puget Sound|Puget Sound]],  [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]], [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton]], [[Earlham College|Earlham]], [[Hendrix College|Hendrix]],  [[Colgate University|Colgate]], [[Washington and Jefferson College|Washington &amp; Jefferson]],  [[Centre College|Centre]], [[Ursinus College|Ursinus]], [[Connecticut College|Connecticut]], [[Kenyon College|Kenyon]], [[Mount Holyoke College|Mt. Holyoke]], and [[Skidmore College|Skidmore]].

===Presidents Letter===
The ''Presidents Letter'' (dated May 10, 2007), developed by Lloyd Thacker of the [[Education Conservancy]], was sent to college and university presidents in the United States in May 2007, concerning the ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' college rankings. The letter does not ask for a full boycott but rather states that:

:while we believe colleges and universities may want to cooperate in providing data to publications for the purposes of rankings, we believe such data provision should be limited to data which is collected in accord with clear, shared professional standards (not the idiosyncratic standards of any single publication), and to data which is required to be reported to state or federal officials or which the institution believes (in accord with good accountability) should routinely be made available to any member of the public who seeks it.&lt;ref name="Presidents Letter"&gt;{{cite web | first =  | last = | title =Presidents Letter| publisher =| date =2007-05-10| url= http://www.educationconservancy.org/presidents_letter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, it asks presidents not to participate in the "reputational survey" portion of the overall survey (this section accounts for 25% of the total rank and asks college presidents to give their subjective opinion of other colleges). The letter also asks presidents not to use the rankings as a form of publicity:

:Among other reasons, we believe [...] rankings: imply a false precision and authority that is not warranted by the data they use; obscure important differences in educational mission in aligning institutions on a single scale; say nothing or very little about whether students are actually learning at particular colleges or universities; encourage wasteful spending and gamesmanship in institutions' pursuing improved rankings; overlook the importance of a student in making education happen and overweight the importance of a university's prestige in that process; and degrade for students the educational value of the college search process. We ask you to make the following two commitments: 1. Refuse to fill out the U.S. News and World Report reputational survey. 2. Refuse to use the rankings in any promotional efforts on behalf of your college or university, and more generally, refuse to refer to the rankings as an indication of the quality of your college or university."&lt;ref name="Presidents Letter" /&gt;

====List of colleges and universities====
{{main|List of colleges and universities which have signed the Presidents Letter}}
Twelve college  and university presidents originally signed the letter in early May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =  | last = | title =Battle Lines on ‘U.S. News’| publisher = [[Inside Higher Ed]] | date = May 7, 2007 | url= http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/05/07/usnews }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter currently has 130 signatures, though others may be added at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =  | last = | title =Presidents Letter| publisher = [[Education Conservancy]] | date =  | url= http://www.educationconservancy.org/presidents_letter.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 movement===
{{main|Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)}}
On June 19, 2007, during the annual meeting of the Annapolis Group, members discussed this letter. As a result, "a majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting said that they did not intend to participate in the U.S. News reputational rankings in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Jaschik |title=More Momentum Against 'U.S. News'|publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=June 20, 2007 |url= http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/20/usnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement also said that its members "have agreed to participate in the development of an alternative common format that presents information about their colleges for students and their families to use in the college search process." This database will be web based and developed in conjunction with higher education organizations including the [[National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities]] and the [[Council of Independent Colleges]].

On June 22, 2007, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' editor Robert Morse issued a response in which he argued, "In terms of the peer assessment survey, we at ''U.S. News'' firmly believe the survey has significant value because it allows us to measure the 'intangibles' of a college that we can't measure through statistical data. Plus, the reputation of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone will be able to get into. The peer survey is by nature subjective, but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between private and public colleges."&lt;ref name="Morse"&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Morse|title=About the Annapolis Group's Statement|work=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|date=June 22, 2007|url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2007/6/22/about-the-annapolis-groups-statement.html#read_more|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702061309/http://www.usnews.com/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2007/6/22/about-the-annapolis-groups-statement.html#read_more|archivedate=July 2, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the alternative database discussed by the Annapolis Group, Morse also argued, "It's important to point out that the Annapolis Group's stated goal of presenting college data in a common format has been tried before [...] ''U.S. News'' has been supplying this exact college information for many years already. And it appears that NAICU will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality. ''U.S. News'' first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of ''U.S. News''."&lt;ref name="Morse" /&gt;

The '''''Ars amatoria''''' ({{lang-en|The Art of Love}}) is an instructional [[elegy]] series in three books by the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] poet [[Ovid]]. It was written in 2 AD.

==Background==
Book one of ''Ars amatoria'' was written to show a man how to find a woman. In book two, Ovid shows how to keep her. The third book, written two years after the first books were published, gives women advice on how to win and keep the love of a man ("I have just armed the Greeks against the Amazons; now, [[Penthesilea]], it remains for me to arm thee against the Greeks...").

==Content==

The first two books, aimed at men, contain sections which cover such topics as 'not forgetting her birthday', 'letting her miss you - but not for long' and 'not asking about her age'. The third gives similar advice to women, sample themes include: 'making up, but in private', 'being wary of false lovers' and 'trying young and older lovers'. Although the book was finished around 2 AD, much of the advice he gives is applicable to any day and age. His intent is often more profound than the brilliance of the surface suggests. In connection with the revelation that the theatre is a good place to meet girls, for instance, Ovid, the classically educated trickster, refers to the story of [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|the rape of the Sabine women]]. It has been argued that this passage represents a radical attempt to redefine relationships between men and women in Roman society, advocating a move away from paradigms of force and possession, towards concepts of mutual fulfilment.&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Jacqueline, The Rape of the Sabine Women, Ovid Ars amatoria Book I: 101-134, master's dissertation, University of Johannesburg, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The superficial brilliance, however, befuddles  even scholars (paradoxically, Ovid consequently tended in the 20th century to be underrated as lacking in seriousness). The standard situations and [[cliche]]s of the subject are treated in an entertainment-intended way, with details from [[Greek mythology]], everyday Roman life and general human experience. Ovid likens love to military service, supposedly requiring the strictest obedience to the woman. He advises women to make their lovers artificially jealous so that they do not become neglectful through complacency. Perhaps accordingly, a slave should be instructed to interrupt the lovers' tryst with the cry 'Perimus' ('We are lost!'), compelling the young lover to hide in fear in a cupboard. The tension implicit in this uncommitted tone is reminiscent of a flirt, and in fact, the semi-serious, semi-ironic form is ideally suited to Ovid's subject matter.

It is striking that through all his ironic discourse, Ovid never becomes ribald or obscene. Of course 'embarrassing' matters can never be entirely excluded, for 'praecipue nostrum est, quod pudet, inquit, opus'&lt;ref&gt;Ov, Ars am. 3,769&lt;/ref&gt; 'what brings a blush ... is our especial business here'. Sexual matters in the narrower sense are only dealt with at the end of each book, so here again, form and content converge in a subtly ingenious way. Things, so to speak, always end up in bed. But here, too, Ovid retains his style and his discretion, avoiding any pornographic tinge. The end of the second book deals with the pleasures of simultaneous orgasm. Somewhat atypically for a Roman, the poet confesses, ''Odi concubitus, qui non utrumque resolvunt. Hoc est, cur pueri tangar amore minus''&lt;ref&gt;Ov, Ars am. 2,683&lt;/ref&gt; ('I don't like intercourse that doesn't make both lovers come. That's why I'm less into the love of boys.').

At the end of the third part, as in the [[Kama Sutra]], the sexual positions are 'declined', and from them women are exhorted to choose the most suitable, taking the proportions of their own bodies into careful consideration. Ovid's tongue is again discovered in his cheek when his recommendation that tall women should not straddle their lovers is exemplified at the expense of the tallest hero of the Trojan Wars: ''Quod erat longissima, numquam Thebais Hectoreo nupta resedit equo''&lt;ref&gt;Ov, Ars am. 3,778&lt;/ref&gt; ('Since she was very tall, the daughter of Thebes ([[Andromache]]) as wife never mounted Hector as horse').

However, the word ''ars'' in the title is not to be translated coldly as 'technique', or as 'art' in the sense of civilized refinement, but as "textbook", the literal and antique definition of the word.

Appropriately for its subject, the ''Ars amatoria'' is composed in [[elegiac couplet]]s, rather than the [[dactylic hexameter]]s, which are more usually associated with the didactic poem.

==Reception==
The work was such a popular success that the poet wrote a sequel, ''[[Remedia Amoris]]'' (Remedies for Love). At an early ''recitatio'', however, [[Vivianus (Gens)|S. Vivianus Rhesus]] is noted as having walked out in disgust.&lt;ref&gt;Agr. De art. am. 378-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption that the 'licentiousness' of the ''Ars amatoria'' was responsible in part for Ovid's relegation (banishment) by [[Augustus]] in AD 8 is dubious, and seems rather to reflect modern sensibilities than historical fact. For one thing, the work had been in circulation for eight years by the time of the relegation, and it postdates the [[Lex Julia|Julian Marriage Laws]] by eighteen years. Secondly, it is hardly likely that Augustus, after forty years unchallenged in the purple, felt the poetry of Ovid to be a serious threat or even embarrassment to his social policies. Thirdly, Ovid's own statement&lt;ref&gt;Ov. Tr., 2.207&lt;/ref&gt; from his Black Sea exile that his relegation was because of 'carmen et error' ('a song and a mistake') is, for many reasons, hardly admissible.

It is more probable that Ovid was somehow caught up in factional politics connected with the succession: [[Postumus Agrippa]], Augustus' adopted son, and Augustus' granddaughter, [[Julia the Younger|Vipsania Julilla]], were both relegated at around the same time. This would also explain why Ovid was not reprieved when Augustus was succeeded by Agrippa's rival [[Tiberius]]. It is likely, then, that the ''Ars amatoria'' was used as an excuse for the relegation.&lt;ref&gt;F. Norwood (1964), 'The Riddle of Ovid's Relegatio', in Classical Philology. 58: 150-63&lt;/ref&gt; This would be neither the first nor the last time a 'crackdown on immorality' disguised an uncomfortable political secret.

==Legacy==
The ''Ars amatoria'' created considerable interest at the time of its publication. On a lesser scale, [[Martial]]'s epigrams take a similar context of advising readers on love. Modern literature has been continually influenced by the ''Ars amatoria'', which has presented additional information on the relationship between Ovid's poem and more current writings.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Gibson, R., Green, S., Sharrock, A., (eds.) 'The Art of Love: Bimillennial Essays on Ovid's Ars amatoria and Remedia Amoris', OUP 2007; Sprung, Robert C., 'The Reception of Ovid's Ars amatoria in the Age of Goethe', Senior Thesis, Harvard College, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ars amatoria'' was included in the syllabuses of mediaeval schools from the second half of the 11th century, and its influence on 12th and 13th centuries' European literature was so great that the German mediaevalist and palaeographer [[Ludwig Traube (palaeographer)|Ludwig Traube]] dubbed the entire age 'aetas Ovidiana' ('the Ovidian epoch').&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, K.L., Reading the Ovidian Heroine, Brill, Leiden, 2001, xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the years immediately following its publication, the ''Ars amatoria'' has historically been victim of moral outcry. All of Ovid's works were burned by [[Savonarola]] in [[Florence|Florence, Italy]] in 1497; an English translation of the ''Ars amatoria'' was seized by U.S. Customs in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Haight, A. L. and Grannis, C. B., Banned Books 387 BC to 1978 AD, R.R. Bowker &amp; Co, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the actions against the work, it continues to be studied in college courses on Latin literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtNSM3gHnvEC|title=A Companion to Ovid|editor-last=Knox|editor-first=Peter E.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=2012|isbn=1118556666|quote=The ''Ars amatoria'' [...] now has an established place on university curricula.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that [[Edmond Rostand]]'s fictionalized portrayal of [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]] makes an allusion to the ''Ars amatoria'': the theme of the erotic and seductive power of poetry is highly suggestive of Ovid's poem, and Bergerac's nose, a distinguishing feature invented by Rostand, calls to mind Ovid's [[cognomen]], Naso (from ''nasus'', 'large-nosed').

'''Book preservation in developing countries''' is a growing concern among [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] and conservation [[librarians]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. Without proper resources and training, many countries around the world struggle to maintain books and [[manuscripts]] as part of their cultural history. Environmental conditions pose perhaps the greatest threat to these materials. Political instability also endangers library and museum collections. Recent contributions are helping to address specific needs and promote the development of preservation programs.

== Overview ==
All library collections experience damage from use and decay from the aging process. Due to a variety of economic, historic, environmental and political factors, libraries and archival repositories in developing countries face exceptional challenges in book and manuscript preservation. [[Southeast Asia]], [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]] have been identified as areas with materials having critical need for preservation{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. Local librarians and archivists struggle to provide access for patrons while protecting the structural integrity of materials against damage from over-use, neglect, and extreme climate conditions.

This is especially difficult as print materials in developing countries are often created using fragile, non-lasting paper product and ink. Providing information and education about preservation practices and principles is becoming an increasing focus for professionals working in countries with established practices. Going back to at least the year 2000, efforts have been made to establish a decision matrix and guidelines for preservation workers in developing countries to use in implementing preservation and conservation programs.&lt;ref name="Conservation and Preservation Activities in Archives and Libraries in Developing Countries: An Advisory Guideline on Policy and Planning"&gt;[http://www.acarm.org/oid%5Cdownloads%5C4%5C3_1_3_12_00_PM_Conservation%20G...]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts to improve preservation in developing countries==
In August 1985, [[John F. Dean]] became [[Cornell University Library]]'s first preservation and conservation librarian. Dean's efforts helped the Department of Preservation and Conservation at Cornell to grow into one of the leading programs of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v11/bp11-09.html], Cornell University: The Department of Preservation and Conservation Outline of Development, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from his work at Cornell, Dean has made important contributions towards improving preservation efforts in developing countries. He has created online tutorials for library conservation and preservation in Southeast Asia and Iraq and the Middle East. The tutorials are designed so that librarians and archivists in these and other countries have a set of basic guidelines to refer to when dealing with preservation issues. Specific topics addressed in the tutorials include "Management and Planning", "Preservation", "Building Capacity" and "Supporting the Effort". Both tutorials are available in English; the tutorial for Iraq and the Middle East is also available in Arabic.

==Area specific problems and actions==
===India===
The advancement of technology and IT professions in [[India]] has resulted in a large number of digital library projects across the country. The main problem these initiatives are running into are access and copyright laws{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

===Puerto Rico===
[[Munoz-Sola]] points out the impracticality of mounting modern environmental controls in a library to stabilize temperature and humidity in the balmy [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munoz-Sola|first=Haydee|date=1987|title=Preservation of Library Materials in a Tropical Climate|url=https://doi.org/10.1300/J122v07n03_05|journal=Science &amp; Technology Libraries|volume=7:3|pages=41–47|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expense involved in creating an ideal environment in both energy and manpower would counteract positive outcomes for the condition of collections. Puerto Rico also has an additional concern with preservation: due to political instability in the past, many libraries and collections have been destroyed, which places a greater need on preserving what is left. Munoz-Sola also points out that many developing countries are in tropical climates, and thus face these problems.

===Ukraine and Bulgaria===
Conservators at the Ukraine V. Stefanyk Scientific Library of the [[National Academy of Science of Ukraine|National Academy of Sciences]] make the effort to adapt advanced preservation techniques to their home area by hiring local craftsmen to manufacture necessary tools and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baird|first=Brian J.|last2=Schaffner|first2=Bradley L.|title=Slow Fires Still Burn: Results of a Preservation Assessment of Libraries in L’viv, Ukraine, and Sofia, Bulgaria {{!}} Baird {{!}} College &amp; Research Libraries|url=http://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/15608|doi=10.5860/crl.64.4.318}}&lt;/ref&gt; This library has a well-established conservation program, with staff trained at workshops in Europe.

The L’viv National University Library in Bulgaria received enough funds from their government to build a new facility to house extra collections and offices. However the new building, with its brand new heating system has caused the collections to deteriorate much more rapidly than those collections stored in the main building which has thick stone walls and a naturally occurring stable environment. These countries are coping with the transition from being under Soviet rule to self-governing states.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">'''COCOA''' was an early [[text file]] utility and associated file format for [[digital humanities]], then known as humanities computing. It was approximately 4000 [[punched card]]s of [[FORTRAN]] and created in the late 1960s and early 1970s at [[University College London]] and the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] in [[Harwell, Oxfordshire]]. Functionality included word-counting and [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Paul E.

== Oxford Concordance Program ==

The Oxford Concordance Program (OCP) format was a direct descendent of COCOA developed at [[Oxford University]]. The [[Oxford Text Archive]] holds items in this format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Concordia discordantium canonum ac primum de iure naturae et constitutionis |publisher= University of Oxford Text Archive |accessdate= 20 October 2013 |url= http://ota.ox.ac.uk/desc/0699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==

The COCOA file format bears at least a passing similarity to the later [[markup language]]s such as [[SGML]] and [[XML]]. A noticeable difference with its successors is that COCOA tags are flat and not tree structured. In that format, every information type and value encoded by a tag should be considered true until the same tag changes its value. Members of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] community maintain legacy support for COCOA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= This script is used to convert COCOA to TEI |format= [[XSL]] |year= 2010 |author= James Cummings, [[Sebastian Rahtz]] |publisher= Oxford University |url= https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/blob/dev/cocoa/cocoa-to-tei.xsl |accessdate= 3 April 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/tree/master/cocoa&lt;/ref&gt; although most in-demand texts and corpora have already been migrated to more widely understand formats such as [[TEI XML]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helsinki.fi/varieng/CoRD/corpora/HelsinkiCorpus/HC_XML.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
== Example ==
The play[[ The Medea of Euripides]] by [[Euripides]] in [[ancient greek]] is encoded in a 1976  [[Oxford Text Archive]] edition&lt;ref&gt;http://ota.ox.ac.uk/desc/2414&lt;/ref&gt; as:

Note the [[XML]]-like tags at the start with metadata, numbered 'V' tags between each line and the creative use of whitespace on the first and last lines. The actually text is a pre-[[Unicode]] transliteration into the Roman alphabet, compare to the Greek source on [https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%9C%CE%AE%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1 wikisource].

'''The Microsoft Research - University of Trento Centre for Computational and Systems Biology''' ('''COSBI''')  is a non profit research center located in [[Trentino]], [[Italy]]. The Center has two offices: one in [[Trento]] and one opened in 2011 in [[Rovereto]],&lt;ref&gt;http://manifattura.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/e-arrivato-il-cosbi/ Cosbi new office in Manifattura Domani&lt;/ref&gt; and was constituted on December 6, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/cosbianniversary-113010.aspx COSBI Celebrates recently 5 Years of activities.&lt;/ref&gt; COSBI is a limited liability consortium, owned half by [[Microsoft Research]] Cambridge and half by the [[University of Trento]].

==History==

===Origin===

COSBI is a joint venture between [[Microsoft Research]] and the [[University of Trento]]. The founding agreement was signed in [[Prague]] on February 2, 2005 by the Minister of Education, University and Research (Minister Letizia Moratti), the Minister of Innovation and Technology (Minister Lucio Stanca), the Province of Trento (Gianluca Salvatori, Councillor of Planning, Research, and Innovation), the University of Trento (Davide Bassi, Rector), the Microsoft Corporation ([[Bill Gates]], president and founder). COSBI was inaugurated on December 7, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/cosbi-032609.aspx Trento Centre: Award-Winning Research&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merging knowledge===
COSBI celebrated its fifth anniversary &lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/tjuaagny/info/highperformancecomputationalsystemsbiology  Speaker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/cosbianniversary-113010.aspx Microsoft Research Article&lt;/ref&gt; by hosting the conference Merging Knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosbi.eu/mergingknowledge/ Merging Knowledge&lt;/ref&gt; From Programming Languages to Personalized Healthcare,&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/msr_er/archive/2010/12/22/preparing-for-transformation-how-convergence-in-computer-science-and-biology-could-fuel-the-next-healthcare-revolution.aspx  healthcare revolution&lt;/ref&gt; Trento, Italy (November 30 – December 3, 2010). During the event scientific speakers discussed the relevance of computer science to the study of systems biology by exploring the main fields of computational and systems biology, as well as nutrigenomics, which merges personalized medicine with personalized diet.

'''Cancer immunotherapy''' (sometimes called '''immuno-oncology''') is the artificial stimulation of the [[immune system]] to treat [[cancer]], improving on the system's natural ability to fight cancer. It is an application of the [[basic research|fundamental research]] of [[cancer immunology]] and a growing subspecialty of [[oncology]]. It exploits the fact that [[cancer cells]] often have molecules on their surface that can be detected by the immune system, known as [[tumor antigen]]s; they are often [[protein]]s or other macromolecules (e.g. [[carbohydrate]]s). [[Immunotherapy|Immunotherapies]] can be categorized as active, passive or hybrid (active and passive). Active immunotherapy directs the immune system to attack [[tumor]] cells by targeting tumor antigens. Passive immunotherapies enhance existing anti-tumor responses and include [[Monoclonal antibody|the use of monoclonal antibodies]], [[lymphocyte]]s and [[cytokine]]s.

Among these, multiple antibody therapies are approved in various jurisdictions to treat a wide range of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Korneev KV, Atretkhany KN, Drutskaya MS, Grivennikov SI, Kuprash DV, Nedospasov SA | title = TLR-signaling and proinflammatory cytokines as drivers of tumorigenesis | journal = Cytokine | volume = 89 | pages = 127–35 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 26854213 | doi = 10.1016/j.cyto.2016.01.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that bind to a target [[antigen]] on the cell surface. The immune system normally uses them to fight [[pathogen]]s. Each antibody is specific to one or a few proteins. Those that bind to tumor antigens treat cancer. [[Cell surface receptor]]s are common targets for antibody therapies and include [[CD20]], [[CD274]] and [[CD279]]. Once bound to a cancer antigen, antibodies can induce [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]], activate the [[complement system]], or prevent a receptor from interacting with its [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]], all of which can lead to cell death. Approved antibodies include [[alemtuzumab]], [[ipilimumab]], [[nivolumab]], [[ofatumumab]] and [[rituximab]].

Active cellular therapies usually involve the removal of immune cells from the blood or from a tumor. Those specific for the tumor are grown in culture and returned to the patient where they attack the tumor; alternatively, immune cells can be [[genetically engineer]]ed to express a tumor-specific [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]], cultured and returned to the patient. Cell types that can be used in this way are [[natural killer cell|natural killer (NK) cell]]s, [[lymphokine-activated killer cell]]s, [[cytotoxic T cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. 

Role of DC-NK Cell Interplay in Immunobiology and Immunotherapy

==Cellular immunotherapy==
===Dendritic cell therapy===
[[File:Dendritic_cell_therapy.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Blood cells are removed from the body, incubated with tumour antigen(s) and activated.  Mature dendritic cells are then returned to the original cancer-bearing donor to induce an immune response.]]
Dendritic cell therapy provokes anti-tumor responses by causing dendritic cells to present tumor antigens to lymphocytes, which activates them, priming them to kill other cells that present the antigen. Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the mammalian immune system.&lt;ref name="pmid11481463"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riddell SR | title = Progress in cancer vaccines by enhanced self-presentation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 16 | pages = 8933–35 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11481463 | pmc = 55350 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.171326398 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.8933R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cancer treatment they aid cancer antigen targeting.&lt;ref name="pmid23890062"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palucka K, Banchereau J | title = Dendritic-cell-based therapeutic cancer vaccines | journal = Immunity | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–48 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23890062 | pmc = 3788678 | doi = 10.1016/j.immuni.2013.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only approved cellular cancer therapy based on dendritic cells is [[sipuleucel-T]].

One method of inducing dendritic cells to present tumor antigens is by vaccination with autologous tumor lysates&lt;ref name="pmid27235694"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirayama M, Nishimura Y | title = The present status and future prospects of peptide-based cancer vaccines | journal = [[International Immunology]] | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 319–28 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27235694 | doi = 10.1093/intimm/dxw027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or short peptides (small parts of protein that correspond to the protein antigens on cancer cells). These peptides are often given in combination with [[adjuvants]] (highly [[immunogenic]] substances) to increase the immune and anti-tumor responses. Other adjuvants include proteins or other chemicals that attract and/or activate dendritic cells, such as [[granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] (GM-CSF).

Dendritic cells can also be activated ''[[in vivo]]'' by making tumor cells express GM-CSF. This can be achieved by either genetically engineering tumor cells to produce GM-CSF or by infecting tumor cells with an [[oncolytic virus]] that expresses GM-CSF.

Another strategy is to remove dendritic cells from the blood of a patient and activate them outside the body. The dendritic cells are activated in the presence of tumor antigens, which may be a single tumor-specific peptide/protein or a tumor [[cell lysate]] (a solution of broken down tumor cells). These cells (with optional adjuvants) are infused and provoke an immune response.

Dendritic cell therapies include the use of antibodies that bind to receptors on the surface of dendritic cells. Antigens can be added to the antibody and can induce the dendritic cells to mature and provide immunity to the tumor. Dendritic cell receptors such as [[TLR3]], [[TLR7]], [[TLR8]] or [[CD40]] have been used as antibody targets.&lt;ref name="pmid23890062" /&gt; Dendritic cell-NK cell interface also has an important role in immunotherapy. The design of new dendritic cell-based vaccination strategies should also encompass NK cell-stimulating potency. It is critical to systematically incorporate NK cells monitoring as an outcome in antitumor DC-based clinical trials &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calmeiro J, Carrascal M , Gomes C, Falcão A, Cruz MT, Neves BM | title = Highlighting the Role of DC-NK Cell Interplay in Immunobiology and Immunotherapy | journal = Dendritic Cells, Intech | date = November 2018 | doi = 10.5772/intechopen.78804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Approved drugs ====
Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) was approved for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant [[prostate cancer]] in 2010. The treatment consists of removal of [[antigen presenting cell]]s from blood by [[leukapheresis]] and growing them with the [[fusion protein]] PA2024 made from GM-CSF and prostate-specific [[prostatic acid phosphatase]] (PAP) and reinfused. This process is repeated three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner TA, Elzey BD, Hahn NM | title = Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) autologous vaccine approved for treatment of men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer | journal = Human Vaccines &amp; Immunotherapeutics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 534–39 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22832254 | doi = 10.4161/hv.19795 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oudard S | title = Progress in emerging therapies for advanced prostate cancer | journal = Cancer Treatment Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–89 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23107383 | doi = 10.1016/j.ctrv.2012.09.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sims RB | title = Development of sipuleucel-T: autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer | journal = Vaccine | volume = 30 | issue = 29 | pages = 4394–97 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22122856 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.11.058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shore ND, Mantz CA, Dosoretz DE, Fernandez E, Myslicki FA, McCoy C, Finkelstein SE, Fishman MN | title = Building on sipuleucel-T for immunologic treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer | journal = Cancer Control | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–16 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23302902 | doi = 10.1177/107327481302000103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CAR-T cell therapy ===
{{main|Chimeric antigen receptor}}
The premise of CAR-T immunotherapy is to modify T cells to recognize cancer cells in order to more effectively target and destroy them. Scientists harvest T cells from people, genetically alter them to add a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that specifically recognizes cancer cells, then infuse the resulting CAR-T cells into patients to attack their tumors.

==== Approved drugs ====
[[Tisagenlecleucel]] (Kymriah), a [[chimeric antigen receptor]] (CAR-T) therapy, was approved by FDA in 2017 to treat [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm574058.htm|title=Press Announcements - FDA approval brings first gene therapy to the United States|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment removes [[CD19]] positive cells (B-cells) from the body (including the diseased cells, but also normal antibody producing cells).

[[Axicabtagene ciloleucel]] (Yescarta) is another CAR-T therapeutic, approved in 2017 for treatment of [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]] (DLBCL).&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm581216.htm|title=FDA approves CAR-T cell therapy to treat adults with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma|publisher=fda.gov|date=2017-10-18|accessdate=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antibody therapy==
[[File:Engineered_monoclonal_antibodies.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Many forms of antibodies can be engineered.]]
{{main|Monoclonal antibody therapy}}
[[Antibody|Antibodies]] are a key component of the [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive immune response]], playing a central role in both recognizing foreign antigens and stimulating an immune response. Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins produced by some [[B cells]] and are composed of two regions: an [[Fragment antigen-binding|antigen-binding fragment (Fab)]], which binds to antigens, and a [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fragment crystallizable (Fc)]] region, which interacts with so-called [[Fc receptors]] that are expressed on the surface of different immune cell types including [[macrophages]], [[neutrophils]] and NK cells. Many immunotherapeutic regimens involve antibodies. [[Monoclonal antibody]] technology engineers and generates antibodies against specific antigens, such as those present on tumor surfaces. These antibodies that are specific to the antigens of the tumor, can then be injected into a tumor

===Antibody types ===

==== Conjugation ====

Two types are used in cancer treatments:&lt;ref name="pmid22437872" /&gt;

* Naked monoclonal antibodies are antibodies without added elements. Most antibody therapies use this antibody type.
* Conjugated monoclonal antibodies are joined to another molecule, which is either cytotoxic or [[radioactive]]. The toxic chemicals are those typically used as [[chemotherapy]] drugs, but other toxins can be used. The antibody binds to specific antigens on cancer cell surfaces, directing the therapy to the tumor. Radioactive compound-linked antibodies are referred to as radiolabelled. Chemolabelled or immunotoxins antibodies are tagged with chemotherapeutic molecules or toxins, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Fc regions ====
Fc’s ability to bind [[Fc receptors]] is important because it allows antibodies to activate the immune system. Fc regions are varied: they exist in numerous subtypes and can be further modified, for example with the addition of sugars in a process called [[glycosylation]]. Changes in the [[Fc region]] can alter an antibody’s ability to engage Fc receptors and, by extension, will determine the type of immune response that the antibody triggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pincetic A, Bournazos S, DiLillo DJ, Maamary J, Wang TT, Dahan R, Fiebiger BM, Ravetch JV | title = Type I and type II Fc receptors regulate innate and adaptive immunity | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 707–16 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25045879 | doi = 10.1038/ni.2939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cancer immunotherapy drugs, including [[PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors]], are antibodies. For example, [[immune checkpoint]] blockers targeting PD-1 are antibodies designed to bind PD-1 expressed by T cells and reactivate these cells to eliminate [[tumors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Topalian SL, Hodi FS, Brahmer JR, Gettinger SN, Smith DC, McDermott DF, Powderly JD, Carvajal RD, Sosman JA, Atkins MB, Leming PD, Spigel DR, Antonia SJ, Horn L, Drake CG, Pardoll DM, Chen L, Sharfman WH, Anders RA, Taube JM, McMiller TL, Xu H, Korman AJ, Jure-Kunkel M, Agrawal S, McDonald D, Kollia GD, Gupta A, Wigginton JM, Sznol M | title = Safety, activity, and immune correlates of anti-PD-1 antibody in cancer | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 366 | issue = 26 | pages = 2443–54 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22658127 | pmc = 3544539 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1200690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Programmed cell death protein 1|Anti-PD-1 drugs]] contain not only an Fab region that binds PD-1 but also an Fc region. Experimental work indicates that the Fc portion of cancer immunotherapy drugs can affect the outcome of treatment. For example, anti-PD-1 drugs with Fc regions that bind inhibitory Fc receptors can have decreased therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahan R, Sega E, Engelhardt J, Selby M, Korman AJ, Ravetch JV | title = FcγRs Modulate the Anti-tumor Activity of Antibodies Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 Axis | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 543 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 28854351 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccell.2015.09.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging studies have further shown that the Fc region of anti-PD-1 drugs can bind Fc receptors expressed by tumor-associated macrophages. This process removes the drugs from their intended targets (i.e. PD-1 molecules expressed on the surface of T cells) and limits therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arlauckas SP, Garris CS, Kohler RH, Kitaoka M, Cuccarese MF, Yang KS, Miller MA, Carlson JC, Freeman GJ, Anthony RM, Weissleder R, Pittet MJ | title = In vivo imaging reveals a tumor-associated macrophage-mediated resistance pathway in anti-PD-1 therapy | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 389 | pages = eaal3604 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28490665 | pmc = 5734617 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, antibodies targeting the co-stimulatory protein [[CD40]] require engagement with selective Fc receptors for optimal therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahan R, Barnhart BC, Li F, Yamniuk AP, Korman AJ, Ravetch JV | title = Therapeutic Activity of Agonistic, Human Anti-CD40 Monoclonal Antibodies Requires Selective FcγR Engagement | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 820–31 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27265505 | pmc = 4975533 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccell.2016.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these studies underscore the importance of Fc status in antibody-based [[immune checkpoint]] targeting strategies.

==== Human/non-human balance ====
Antibodies are also referred to as murine, chimeric, humanized and human. Murine antibodies are from a different species  and carry a risk of immune reaction. Chimeric antibodies attempt to reduce murine antibodies' [[immunogenicity]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; by replacing part of the antibody with the corresponding human counterpart, known as the constant region. Humanized antibodies are almost completely human; only the [[complementarity determining regions]] of the [[variable region]]s are derived from murine sources. Human antibodies have been produced using unmodified human DNA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harding FA, Stickler MM, Razo J, DuBridge RB | title = The immunogenicity of humanized and fully human antibodies: residual immunogenicity resides in the CDR regions | journal = MAbs | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 256–65 | date = May–Jun 2010 | pmid = 20400861 | pmc = 2881252 | doi = 10.4161/mabs.2.3.11641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antibody-dependent_cell-mediated_cytotoxicity.png|left|thumb|Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. When the Fc receptors on natural killer (NK) cells interact with Fc regions of antibodies bound to cancer cells, the NK cell releases perforin and granzyme, leading to cancer cell apoptosis.]]

===Cell death mechanisms===

====Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)====
[[Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] (ADCC) requires antibodies to bind to target cell surfaces. Antibodies are formed of a binding region (Fab) and the Fc region that can be detected by immune system cells via their [[Fc receptor|Fc surface receptors]]. Fc receptors are found on many immune system cells, including NK cells. When NK cells encounter antibody-coated cells, the latter's Fc regions interact with their Fc receptors, releasing [[perforin]] and [[granzyme B]] to kill the tumor cell. Examples include [[Rituximab]], [[Ofatumumab]] and Alemtuzumab. Antibodies under development have altered Fc regions that have higher affinity for a specific type of Fc receptor, FcγRIIIA, which can dramatically increase effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiner LM, Surana R, Wang S | title = Monoclonal antibodies: versatile platforms for cancer immunotherapy | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 317–27 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20414205 | pmc = 3508064 | doi = 10.1038/nri2744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seidel UJ, Schlegel P, Lang P | title = Natural killer cell mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in tumor immunotherapy with therapeutic antibodies | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 4 | pages = 76 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23543707 | pmc = 3608903 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2013.00076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complement====
The [[complement system]] includes blood proteins that can cause cell death after an antibody binds to the cell surface (the [[classical complement pathway]], among the ways of complement activation). Generally the system deals with foreign pathogens, but can be activated with therapeutic antibodies in cancer. The system can be triggered if the antibody is chimeric, humanized or human; as long as it contains the [[IgG1]] [[Fc region]]. Complement can lead to cell death by activation of the [[membrane attack complex]], known as complement-dependent [[cytotoxicity]]; enhancement of [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]; and CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity occurs when antibodies bind to the cancer cell surface, the C1 complex binds to these antibodies and subsequently protein pores are formed in the cancer [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gelderman KA, Tomlinson S, Ross GD, Gorter A | title = Complement function in mAb-mediated cancer immunotherapy | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 158–64 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15036044 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2004.01.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alemtuzumab====
[[Alemtuzumab]] (Campath-1H) is an anti-[[CD52]] humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of [[fludarabine]]-refractory [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL), [[cutaneous T-cell lymphoma]], [[peripheral T-cell lymphoma]] and [[T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia]]. CD52 is found on &gt;95% of peripheral blood [[lymphocyte]]s (both T-cells and B-cells) and [[monocyte]]s, but its function in lymphocytes is unknown. It binds to CD52 and initiates its cytotoxic effect by complement fixation and ADCC mechanisms. Due to the antibody target (cells of the immune system) common complications of alemtuzumab therapy are infection, toxicity and [[myelosuppression]].&lt;ref&gt;Byrd JC, Stilgenbauer S, Flinn IW.

====Atezolizumab====
{{Main|Atezolizumab}}&lt;!--What is Duralumab? A type of Atezolizumab?--&gt;

[[Durvalumab]] (Imfinzi) is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) with the PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1) molecules. Durvalumab is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who:
* have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy.
* have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.

====Ipilimumab====
[[Ipilimumab]] (Yervoy) is a human [[IgG1]] antibody that binds the surface protein [[CTLA4]]. In normal physiology T-cells are activated by two signals: the [[T-cell receptor]] binding to an [[antigen]]-[[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC complex]] and T-cell surface receptor CD28 binding to [[CD80]] or [[CD86]] proteins. CTLA4 binds to CD80 or CD86, preventing the binding of CD28 to these surface proteins and therefore negatively regulates the activation of T-cells.&lt;ref name="pmid21629286"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sondak VK, Smalley KS, Kudchadkar R, Grippon S, Kirkpatrick P | title = Ipilimumab | journal = Nature Reviews.

Active [[cytotoxic T-cell]]s are required for the immune system to attack melanoma cells. Normally inhibited active melanoma-specific cytotoxic T-cells can produce an effective anti-tumor response. Ipilumumab can cause a shift in the ratio of [[Regulatory T cell|regulatory T-cells]] to cytotoxic T-cells to increase the anti-tumor response. Regulatory T-cells inhibit other T-cells, which may benefit the tumor.&lt;ref name="pmid21629286" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21900389" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21294471" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11244047" /&gt;

==== Nivolumab ====
{{Main|Nivolumab}}

==== Ofatumumab ====
[[Ofatumumab]] is a second generation human [[IgG1]] antibody that binds to [[CD20]]. It is used in the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL) because the cancerous cells of CLL are usually CD20-expressing B-cells. Unlike [[rituximab]], which binds to a large loop of the CD20 protein, ofatumumab binds to a separate, small loop. This may explain their different characteristics. Compared to rituximab, ofatumumab induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity at a lower dose with less [[immunogenicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castillo J, Perez K | title = The role of ofatumumab in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia resistant to previous therapies | journal = Journal of Blood Medicine | volume = 1 | pages = 1–8 | year = 2010 | pmid = 22282677 | pmc = 3262337 | doi = 10.2147/jbm.s7284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang B | title = Ofatumumab | journal = MAbs | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–31 | date = Jul–Aug 2009 | pmid = 20068404 | pmc = 2726602 | doi = 10.4161/mabs.1.4.8895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pembrolizumab ====
As of 2017, [[pembrolizumab]], which blocks [[PD-1|PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1]], has been used via intravenous infusion to treat inoperable or metastatic [[melanoma]], metastatic [[non-small cell lung cancer]] (NSCLC) in certain situations, as a second-line treatment for [[head and neck squamous cell carcinoma]] (HNSCC), after [[Platinum-based antineoplastic|platinum-based chemotherapy]], and for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classic [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] (cHL).&lt;ref name=USlabel2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Pembrolizumab label |url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/125514s014lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=May 2017}} linked from [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&amp;varApplNo=125514 Index page at FDA website] November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Pembrolizumab label at eMC |url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/30602|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rituximab ====
[[Rituximab]] is a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody specific for CD20, developed from its parent antibody [[Ibritumomab]]. As with ibritumomab, rituximab targets CD20, making it effective in treating certain B-cell malignancies. These include aggressive and indolent lymphomas such as [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]] and follicular lymphoma and [[leukemia]]s such as B-cell [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]. Although the function of CD20 is relatively unknown, CD20 may be a [[calcium channel]] involved in B-cell activation. The antibody's mode of action is primarily through the induction of ADCC and [[Complement system|complement-mediated cytotoxicity.]] Other mechanisms include apoptosis{{Clarify|reason=Vague|date=April 2016}} and cellular growth arrest. Rituximab also increases the sensitivity of cancerous B-cells to chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keating GM | title = Rituximab: a review of its use in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, low-grade or follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma | journal = Drugs | volume = 70 | issue = 11 | pages = 1445–76 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20614951 | doi = 10.2165/11201110-000000000-00000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plosker 2003 803–43"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plosker GL, Figgitt DP | title = Rituximab: a review of its use in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia | journal = Drugs | volume = 63 | issue = 8 | pages = 803–43 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12662126 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200363080-00005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plosker 2003 803–43" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cerny T, Borisch B, Introna M, Johnson P, Rose AL | title = Mechanism of action of rituximab | journal = Anti-Cancer Drugs | volume = 13 Suppl 2 | pages = S3–10 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12710585 | doi = 10.1097/00001813-200211002-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janeway"&gt;{{cite book |last=Janeway |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Janeway |first2=Paul |last2=Travers |first3=Mark |last3=Walport |first4=Mark |last4=Shlomchik |name-list-format=vanc |title=Immunobiology | edition = Fifth |publisher=Garland Science |year=2001 |location=New York and London |pages= |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=imm.TOC&amp;depth=10 |isbn=978-0-8153-4101-7}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiner GJ | title = Rituximab: mechanism of action | journal = Seminars in Hematology | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–23 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20350658 | pmc = 2848172 | doi = 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.01.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cytokine therapy==
[[Cytokine]]s are proteins produced by many types of cells present within a tumor. They can modulate immune responses. The tumor often employs them to allow it to grow and reduce the immune response. These immune-modulating effects allow them to be used as drugs to provoke an immune response. Two commonly used cytokines are interferons and interleukins.&lt;ref name="pmid14708024"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dranoff G | title = Cytokines in cancer pathogenesis and cancer therapy | journal = Nature Reviews. Cancer | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–22 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14708024 | doi = 10.1038/nrc1252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interleukin-2]] and [[interferon]]-α are cytokines, proteins that regulate and coordinate the behavior of the immune system. They have the ability to enhance anti-tumor activity and thus can be used as passive cancer treatments. Interferon-α is used in the treatment of [[hairy-cell leukaemia]], [[AIDS]]-related [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], [[follicular lymphoma]], [[chronic myeloid leukaemia]] and [[malignant melanoma]]. Interleukin-2 is used in the treatment of [[malignant melanoma]] and [[renal cell carcinoma]].

===Interferon===
[[Interferon]]s are produced by the immune system. They are usually involved in anti-viral response, but also have use for cancer. They fall in three groups: [[Interferon type I|type I]] (IFNα and IFNβ), [[Interferon type II|type II]] (IFNγ) and [[Type III interferon|type III]] (IFNλ). IFNα has been approved for use in [[hairy-cell leukaemia]], AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, follicular lymphoma, [[chronic myeloid leukaemia]] and melanoma. Type I and II IFNs have been researched extensively and although both types promote anti-tumor immune system effects, only type I IFNs have been shown to be clinically effective. IFNλ shows promise for its anti-tumor effects in [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn GP, Koebel CM, Schreiber RD | title = Interferons, immunity and cancer immunoediting | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 836–48 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17063185 | doi = 10.1038/nri1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasfar A, Abushahba W, Balan M, Cohen-Solal KA | title = Interferon lambda: a new sword in cancer immunotherapy | journal = Clinical &amp; Developmental Immunology | volume = 2011 | pages = 349575 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22190970 | pmc = 3235441 | doi = 10.1155/2011/349575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike type I IFNs, [[Interferon gamma]] is not approved yet for the treatment of any cancer.However, improved survival was observed when [[Interferon gamma]] was administrated to patients with [[bladder carcinoma]] and [[melanoma]] cancers. The most promising result was achieved in patients with stage 2 and 3 of [[ovarian carcinoma]].The ''[[in vitro]]'' study of IFN-gamma in cancer cells is more extensive and results indicate anti-proliferative activity of IFN-gamma leading to the growth inhibition or cell death, generally induced by [[apoptosis]] but sometimes by [[autophagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razaghi A, Owens L, Heimann K | title = Review of the recombinant human interferon gamma as an immunotherapeutic: Impacts of production platforms and glycosylation | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 240 | pages = 48–60 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27794496 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.10.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interleukin===
[[Interleukin]]s have an array of immune system effects. [[Interleukin-2]] is used in the treatment of [[malignant melanoma]] and [[renal cell carcinoma]]. In normal physiology it promotes both effector T cells and T-regulatory cells, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown.&lt;ref name="pmid14708024" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coventry BJ, Ashdown ML | title = The 20th anniversary of interleukin-2 therapy: bimodal role explaining longstanding random induction of complete clinical responses | journal = Cancer Management and Research | volume = 4 | pages = 215–21 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22904643 | pmc = 3421468 | doi = 10.2147/cmar.s33979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combination immunotherapy==

Combining various immunotherapies such as PD1 and CTLA4 inhibitors can enhance anti-tumor response leading to durable responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ott PA, Hodi FS, Kaufman HL, Wigginton JM, Wolchok JD | title = Combination immunotherapy: a road map | journal = Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer | volume = 5 | pages = 16 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28239469 | pmc = 5319100 | doi = 10.1186/s40425-017-0218-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mahoney KM, Rennert PD, Freeman GJ | title = Combination cancer immunotherapy and new immunomodulatory targets | journal = Nature Reviews.

Combining checkpoint immunotherapies with pharmaceutical agents has the potential to improve response, and such combination therapies are a highly investigated area of clinical investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang J, Shalabi A, Hubbard-Lucey VM | title = Comprehensive analysis of the clinical immuno-oncology landscape | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–91 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29228097 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdx755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immunostimulatory drugs such as [[Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor|CSF-1R]] inhibitors and [[Toll-like receptor|TLR]] agonists have been particularly effective in this setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perry CJ, Muñoz-Rojas AR, Meeth KM, Kellman LN, Amezquita RA, Thakral D, Du VY, Wang JX, Damsky W, Kuhlmann AL, Sher JW, Bosenberg M, Miller-Jensen K, Kaech SM | title = Myeloid-targeted immunotherapies act in synergy to induce inflammation and antitumor immunity | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 215 | issue = 3 | pages = 877–93 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29436395 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20171435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Rodell CB, Arlauckas SP, Cuccarese MF, Garris CS, Li R, Ahmed MS, Kohler RH, Pittet MJ, Weissleder R |date=2018-05-21|title=TLR7/8-agonist-loaded nanoparticles promote the polarization of tumour-associated macrophages to enhance cancer immunotherapy |journal=Nature Biomedical Engineering |doi=10.1038/s41551-018-0236-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Adoptive T-cell therapy===
[[File:Adoptive_T-cell_therapy.png|thumb|Cancer specific T-cells can be obtained by fragmentation and isolation of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, or by genetically engineering cells from peripheral blood. The cells are activated and grown prior to transfusion into the recipient (tumour bearer).]]

Adoptive T cell therapy is a form of [[passive immunization]] by the transfusion of T-cells ([[adoptive cell transfer]]). They are found in [[blood]] and tissue and usually activate when they find foreign [[pathogen]]s. Specifically they activate when the T-cell's surface receptors encounter cells that display parts of foreign proteins on their surface antigens. These can be either infected cells, or [[antigen presenting cell]]s (APCs). They are found in normal tissue and in tumor tissue, where they are known as [[tumor infiltrating lymphocyte]]s (TILs). They are activated by the presence of APCs such as dendritic cells that present [[tumor antigen]]s. Although these cells can attack the tumor, the environment within the tumor is highly immunosuppressive, preventing immune-mediated tumour death.&lt;ref name="NatureRev2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Restifo NP, Dudley ME, Rosenberg SA | title = Adoptive immunotherapy for cancer: harnessing the T cell response | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 269–81 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22437939 | doi = 10.1038/nri3191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple ways of producing and obtaining tumour targeted T-cells have been developed. T-cells specific to a tumor antigen can be removed from a tumor sample (TILs) or filtered from blood. Subsequent activation and culturing is performed ''ex vivo,'' with the results reinfused. Activation can take place through gene therapy, or by exposing the T cells to tumor antigens.

As of 2014, multiple ACT clinical trials were underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John|last=Carroll|name-list-format=vanc|work=Fierce Biotech|date=December 2013|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/novartispenns-customized-t-cell-wows-ash-stellar-leukemia-data/2013-12-09|title=Novartis/Penn's customized T cell wows ASH with stellar leukemia data}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John|last=Carroll|work=FierceBiotech|date=February 2014|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/servier-stages-entry-high-stakes-car-t-showdown-novartis/2014-02-18|title=Servier stages an entry into high-stakes CAR-T showdown with Novartis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Biotech’s Coming Cancer Cure: Supercharge your immune cells to defeat cancer?

Oncol. | date=April 2018 | pmid = 29688262 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdy139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 2 adoptive T-cell therapies, [[tisagenlecleucel]] and [[axicabtagene ciloleucel]], were approved by the FDA in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm574058.htm|title=FDA approval brings first gene therapy to the United States|publisher=fda.gov|date=2017-08-30|accessdate=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt;

Another approach is adoptive transfer of haploidentical [[γδ T cells]] or  [[NK cells]] from a healthy donor. The major advantage of this approach is that these cells do not cause [[GVHD]]. The disadvantage  is frequently impaired function of the transferred cells.&lt;ref name="pmid = 24528541"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilhelm M, Smetak M, Schaefer-Eckart K, Kimmel B, Birkmann J, Einsele H, Kunzmann V | title = Successful adoptive transfer and in vivo expansion of haploidentical γδ T cells | journal = Journal of Translational Medicine | volume = 12 | issue =  | pages = 45 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24528541 | pmc = 3926263 | doi = 10.1186/1479-5876-12-45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-CD47 therapy===

Many tumor cells overexpress [[CD47]] to escape [[Immunosurveillance|immunosurveilance]] of host immune system. CD47 binds to its receptor [[Signal-regulatory protein alpha|signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα)]] and downregulate [[phagocytosis]] of tumor cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaiswal S, Chao MP, Majeti R, Weissman IL | title = Macrophages as mediators of tumor immunosurveillance | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 212–19 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20452821 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2010.04.001 | pmc = 3646798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, anti-CD47 therapy aims to restore clearance of tumor cells.

===Anti-GD2 antibodies===
[[File:GD2_ganglioside.png|thumb|The GD2 ganglioside]]
[[Carbohydrate]] [[antigen]]s on the surface of cells can be used as targets for immunotherapy. [[GD2]] is a [[ganglioside]] found on the surface of many types of cancer cell including [[neuroblastoma]], [[retinoblastoma]], [[melanoma]], [[small cell lung cancer]], [[brain tumor]]s, [[osteosarcoma]], [[rhabdomyosarcoma]], [[Ewing’s sarcoma]], [[liposarcoma]], [[fibrosarcoma]], [[leiomyosarcoma]] and other [[soft tissue sarcoma]]s. It is not usually expressed on the surface of normal tissues, making it a good target for immunotherapy. As of 2014, clinical trials were underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahmed M, Cheung NK | title = Engineering anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies for cancer immunotherapy | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 588 | issue = 2 | pages = 288–97 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24295643 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2013.11.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:11 Hegasy CTLA4 PD1 Immunotherapy.png|left|thumb|440x440px|Cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation (CTLA4, PD1)]]
[[Immune checkpoint]]s affect immune system function. Immune checkpoints can be stimulatory or inhibitory. Tumors can use these checkpoints to protect themselves from immune system attacks. Currently approved checkpoint therapies block inhibitory checkpoint receptors. Blockade of negative feedback signaling to immune cells thus results in an enhanced immune response against tumors.&lt;ref name="pmid22437870"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pardoll DM | title = The blockade of immune checkpoints in cancer immunotherapy | journal = Nature Reviews. Cancer | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 252–64 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22437870 | pmc = 4856023 | doi = 10.1038/nrc3239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One ligand-receptor interaction under investigation is the interaction between the transmembrane [[programmed cell death 1]] protein (PDCD1, PD-1; also known as CD279) and its ligand, [[Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1|PD-1 ligand 1]] (PD-L1, CD274). PD-L1 on the cell surface binds to PD1 on an immune cell surface, which inhibits immune cell activity. Among PD-L1 functions is a key regulatory role on T cell activities. It appears that (cancer-mediated) upregulation of PD-L1 on the cell surface may inhibit T cells that might otherwise attack. PD-L1 on cancer cells also inhibits FAS- and interferon-dependent apoptosis, protecting cells from cytotoxic molecules produced by T cells. Antibodies that bind to either PD-1 or PD-L1 and therefore block the interaction may allow the T-cells to attack the tumor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Granier C, De Guillebon E, Blanc C, Roussel H, Badoual C, Colin E, Saldmann A, Gey A, Oudard S, Tartour E | title = Mechanisms of action and rationale for the use of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer | journal = ESMO Open | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = e000213 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28761757 | pmc = 5518304 | doi = 10.1136/esmoopen-2017-000213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CTLA-4 blockade ====
The first checkpoint antibody approved by the FDA was ipilimumab, approved in 2011 for treatment of melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cameron F, Whiteside G, Perry C | title = Ipilimumab: first global approval | journal = Drugs | volume = 71 | issue = 8 | pages = 1093–104 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21668044 | doi = 10.2165/11594010-000000000-00000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It blocks the immune checkpoint molecule [[CTLA-4]]. Clinical trials have also shown some benefits of anti-CTLA-4 therapy on lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, specifically in combination with other drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lynch TJ, Bondarenko I, Luft A, Serwatowski P, Barlesi F, Chacko R, Sebastian M, Neal J, Lu H, Cuillerot JM, Reck M | title = Ipilimumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line treatment in stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer: results from a randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase II study | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 30 | issue = 17 | pages = 2046–54 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22547592 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2011.38.4032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Le DT, Lutz E, Uram JN, Sugar EA, Onners B, Solt S, Zheng L, Diaz LA, Donehower RC, Jaffee EM, Laheru DA | title = Evaluation of ipilimumab in combination with allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells transfected with a GM-CSF gene in previously treated pancreatic cancer | journal = Journal of Immunotherapy | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 382–89 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23924790 | pmc = 3779664 | doi = 10.1097/CJI.0b013e31829fb7a2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In on-going trials the combination of CTLA-4 blockade with PD-1 or [[PD-L1 inhibitor]]s is tested on different types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01928394|A Study of Nivolumab by Itself or Nivolumab Combined With Ipilimumab in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, patients treated with check-point blockade (specifically CTLA-4 blocking antibodies), or a combination of check-point blocking antibodies, are at high risk of suffering from immune-related adverse events such as dermatologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or hepatic [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Postow MA, Callahan MK, Wolchok JD | title = Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Cancer Therapy | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 33 | issue = 17 | pages = 1974–82 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25605845 | pmc = 4980573 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2014.59.4358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are most likely due to the breadth of the induced T-cell activation when anti-CTLA-4 antibodies are administered by injection in the blood stream.

Using a mouse model of bladder cancer, researchers have found that a local injection of a low dose anti-CTLA-4 in the tumour area had the same tumour inhibiting capacity as when the antibody was delivered in the blood.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Hooren L, Sandin LC, Moskalev I, Ellmark P, Dimberg A, Black P, Tötterman TH, Mangsbo SM | title = Local checkpoint inhibition of CTLA-4 as a monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD1 prevents the growth of murine bladder cancer | journal = European Journal of Immunology | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 385–93 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27873300 | doi = 10.1002/eji.201646583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the levels of circulating antibodies were lower, suggesting that local administration of the anti-CTLA-4 therapy might result in fewer adverse events.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====PD-1 inhibitors====
Initial clinical trial results with IgG4 PD1 antibody [[Nivolumab]] were published in 2010.&lt;ref name="pmid22437870" /&gt; It was approved in 2014. Nivolumab is approved to treat melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, and [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/business/food-and-drug-administration-immunotherapy-bladder-cancer.html|title=F.D.A.

[[Pembrolizumab]] is another PD1 inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in 2014. 
Keytruda ([[Pembrolizumab]]) is approved to treat melanoma and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Antibody [[BGB-A317]] is a PD-1 inhibitor (designed to not bind Fc gamma receptor I) in early clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/06/05/846118/0/en/BeiGene-Presents-Initial-Clinical-Data-on-PD-1-Antibody-BGB-A317-at-the-2016-American-Society-of-Clinical-Oncology-Annual-Meeting.html|title=BeiGene Presents Initial Clinical Data on PD-1 Antibody BGB-A317 at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting|author=BeiGene, Ltd.|publisher=Globe Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PD-L1 inhibitors====
{{main|PD-L1 inhibitor}}In May 2016, PD-L1 inhibitor [[atezolizumab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2016-04-11.htm|title=FDA grants priority review for Roche's cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab in specific type of lung cancer|last1=Roche}}&lt;/ref&gt; was approved  for treating bladder cancer.

====Other====

Other modes of enhancing [adoptive] immuno-therapy include targeting so-called [[intrinsic checkpoint blockade]]s e.g. [[CISH]]. A number of cancer patients do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade. Response rate may be improved by combining immune checkpoint blockade with additional rationally selected anticancer therapies (out of which some may stimulate T cell infiltration into tumors). For example, targeted therapies such, radiotherapy, vasculature targeting agents, and immunogenic chemotherapy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pfirschke C, Engblom C, Rickelt S, Cortez-Retamozo V, Garris C, Pucci F, Yamazaki T, Poirier-Colame V, Newton A, Redouane Y, Lin YJ, Wojtkiewicz G, Iwamoto Y, Mino-Kenudson M, Huynh TG, Hynes RO, Freeman GJ, Kroemer G, Zitvogel L, Weissleder R, Pittet MJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Immunogenic Chemotherapy Sensitizes Tumors to Checkpoint Blockade Therapy | journal = Immunity | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 343–54 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26872698 | doi = 10.1016/j.immuni.2015.11.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can improve immune checkpoint blockade response in animal models of cancer.

===Oncolytic virus===
An [[oncolytic virus]] is a virus that preferentially infects and kills cancer cells. As the infected cancer cells are destroyed by [[oncolysis]], they release new infectious virus particles or virions to help destroy the remaining tumour. Oncolytic viruses are thought not only to cause direct destruction of the tumour cells, but also to stimulate host anti-tumour immune responses for long-term immunotherapy.&lt;ref name=pmid27486853&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fukuhara H, Ino Y, Todo T | title = Oncolytic virus therapy: A new era of cancer treatment at dawn | journal = Cancer Science | volume = 107 | issue = 10 | pages = 1373–79 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27486853 | pmc = 5084676 | doi = 10.1111/cas.13027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid28589082&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haddad D | title = Genetically Engineered Vaccinia Viruses As Agents for Cancer Treatment, Imaging, and Transgene Delivery | journal = Frontiers in Oncology | volume = 7 | pages = 96 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28589082 | pmc = 5440573 | doi = 10.3389/fonc.2017.00096 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid29329556&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marin-Acevedo JA, Soyano AE, Dholaria B, Knutson KL, Lou Y | title = Cancer immunotherapy beyond immune checkpoint inhibitors | journal = Journal of Hematology &amp; Oncology | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 8 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29329556 | pmc = 5767051 | doi = 10.1186/s13045-017-0552-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential of viruses as anti-cancer agents was first realized in the early twentieth century, although coordinated research efforts did not begin until the 1960s. A number of viruses including adenovirus, reovirus, measles, herpes simplex, Newcastle disease virus and vaccinia have now been clinically tested as oncolytic agents. T-Vec is the first FDA-approved [[oncolytic virus]] for the treatment of melanoma.  A number of other oncolytic viruses are in Phase II-III development.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Polysaccharides===

Certain compounds found in [[Medicinal mushrooms|mushrooms]], primarily [[polysaccharide]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, can up-regulate the immune system and may have anti-cancer properties. For example, [[Beta-glucans|beta-glucan]]s such as [[lentinan]] have been shown in laboratory studies to stimulate [[macrophage]], [[NK cells]], [[T cells]] and immune system [[cytokines]] and have been investigated in clinical trials as [[immunologic adjuvant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aleem E | title = β-Glucans and their applications in cancer therapy: focus on human studies | journal = Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 709–19 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23140353 | doi = 10.2174/1871520611313050007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neoantigens ===
{{Main|Neoantigen}}Many tumors express mutations. These mutations potentially create new targetable antigens (neoantigens) for use in T cell immunotherapy. The presence of CD8+ T cells in cancer lesions, as identified using RNA sequencing data, is higher in tumors with a high [[Tumor Mutational Burden|mutational burden]]. The level of transcripts associated with cytolytic activity of natural killer cells and T cells positively correlates with mutational load in many human tumors. In non–small cell lung cancer patients treated with lambrolizumab, mutational load shows a strong correlation with clinical response. In melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, long-term benefit is also associated with a higher mutational load, although less significantly. The predicted MHC binding neoantigens in patients with a long-term clinical benefit were enriched for a series of [[tetrapeptide]] motifs that were not found in tumors of patients with no or minimal clinical benefit.&lt;ref name="SnyderMakarov2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snyder A, Makarov V, Merghoub T, Yuan J, Zaretsky JM, Desrichard A, Walsh LA, Postow MA, Wong P, Ho TS, Hollmann TJ, Bruggeman C, Kannan K, Li Y, Elipenahli C, Liu C, Harbison CT, Wang L, Ribas A, Wolchok JD, Chan TA | title = Genetic basis for clinical response to CTLA-4 blockade in melanoma | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 371 | issue = 23 | pages = 2189–99 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25409260 | pmc = 4315319 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1406498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human neoantigens identified in other studies do not show the bias toward tetrapeptide signatures.&lt;ref name="ss15"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schumacher TN, Schreiber RD | title = Neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy | journal = Science | volume = 348 | issue = 6230 | pages = 69–74 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25838375 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaa4971 | bibcode = 2015Sci...348...69S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Applied Genomics''' is a Center of Emphasis at the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]] with the primary goal of discovering and translating basic research findings into medical innovations.

The Center is one of the world’s largest genetics research and analytical facilities. It is the primary center at a pediatric hospital with access to state-of-the-art high-throughput genotyping technology, and has processed genetic samples from over 100,000 people.

The Center is focused on detecting the genetic causes of some of the most prevalent childhood diseases including (but not limited to) [[asthma]], [[obesity]], [[ADHD]], [[autism]], [[diabetes]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[epilepsy]], [[schizophrenia]], and pediatric [[cancer]], all of which are thought to involve multiple, interacting genes within the body.

==Mission statement==

The mission of the Center for Applied Genomics is to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by complex medical disorders. The Center is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia with the primary goal of translating basic research findings to medical innovations.

We aim to discover genetic causes for the most prevalent diseases of childhood including asthma, autism, diabetes, epilepsy, obesity, schizophrenia, and pediatric cancer. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies.

The Center is one of the world's largest genetics research programs, and the lead center at a pediatric hospital to have large-scale access to state-of-the-art high-throughput genotyping technology.

===ADHD===
Although highly heritable, genetic correlates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]) have been difficult to pinpoint. In 2009, Center for Applied Genomics researchers identified [[copy number variants]] as a potential cause of the disorder. CNVs are relatively large segments of chromosomes where the DNA has been deleted, duplicated, or rearranged. The group found 222 CNVs that were more common in individuals with ADHD than in unrelated healthy individuals. These CNVs tended to concentrate in areas that had previously been associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, schizophrenia and [[Tourette syndrome]]. They also tended to occur at or near genes known to be important for learning, synapse transmission, and nervous system development. This paper was one of the first to pinpoint CNVs as a genetic cause of ADHD and was important in identifying previously unassociated genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elia J, Gai X, Xie HM |title=Rare structural variants found in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder are preferentially associated with neurodevelopmental genes |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=637–46 |date=June 2010 |pmid=19546859 |pmc=2877197 |doi=10.1038/mp.2009.57|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asthma===
[[Asthma]] is a complex disease with genetic and environmental causes. It affects more than 6% of children in the developed world (Fanta, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fanta CH |title=Asthma |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=360 |issue=10 |pages=1002–14 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19264689 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra0804579}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Because of its complexity, candidate genes for asthma have been difficult to determine. In 2010, the Center published a genome-wide association study of 3,377 children with asthma and 5,579 healthy children. This type of study allows researchers to examine genetic variations across an individual’s entire genome, and compare variations between affected and unaffected groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sleiman PM, Flory J, Imielinski M |title=Variants of DENND1B associated with asthma in children |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=362 |issue=1 |pages=36–44 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20032318 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0901867|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered a region on chromosome 17 and a previously unassociated region on chromosome 1 that strongly correlated with susceptibility to asthma. The region in chromosome 1 was especially associated with asthma in the children of African ancestry, and contains a gene, DENND1B, that is expressed by natural killer cells – a critical component of the immune system. Targeting the DENND1B gene may be a promising avenue for future treatments of asthma.

===Autism===
Although twin studies suggest that ASDs are highly heritable, specific genes have been difficult to identify. In 2009, the Center conducted a [[genome-wide association study]] on a group of 780 families (3,101 individuals) with affected children, a second group of 1,204 affected individuals, and 6,491 controls, all of whom had European ancestry. By comparing genomics variations between the groups, researchers led by Kai Wang identified six genetic markers between two specific genes that confirmed susceptibility to ASDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang K, Zhang H, Ma D |title=Common genetic variants on 5p14.1 associate with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Nature |volume=459 |issue=7246 |pages=528–33 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19404256 |pmc=2943511 |doi=10.1038/nature07999|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first study to demonstrate a genome-wide significant association of this kind. The two genes, [[cadherin]] 10 and [[cadherin]] 9 are sticky molecules that help neurons bind together. They play an important role in neurodevelopment, and may be important in helping us understand the neuropathology of autism.

In 2009, the Center published a second paper in the journal Nature that identified copy number variations (CNVs) as important genetic features in autism. Led by Joseph Glessner, the group examined 859 autism cases and 1,409 healthy children of European ancestry. The autism group had significantly more CNVs on or near genes that had previously been associated with the disorder. Further, they identified several new susceptibility genes in [[ubiquitin]] networks that were associated with the autism group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glessner JT, Wang K, Cai G |title=Autism genome-wide copy number variation reveals ubiquitin and neuronal genes |journal=Nature |volume=459 |issue=7246 |pages=569–73 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19404257 |pmc=2925224 |doi=10.1038/nature07953|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubiquitins are small proteins that help to destroy unneeded or damaged proteins. Damage to ubiquitin networks can theoretically cause neurological changes that may underlie autism and are an important avenue for future research into the disorder.

===Cancer===
The Center for Applied Genomics has been at the forefront of research into the genetic causes of a number of cancers and has had a major impact on our understanding of how cancer occurs.

[[Neuroblastoma]] is a type of cancer most commonly found in children that affects the sympathetic nervous system (part of the nervous system that helps control our organs). It is often lethal. In 2008, the Center group collaborated with the [http://stokes.chop.edu/programs/maris/ Maris Lab] at the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania to publish the first of three important papers on the genetic causes of neuroblastoma. They performed a genome-wide association study comparing the genomes of 1032 patients and 2043 controls. The researchers found a significant association between neuroblastoma and a region of chromosome 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maris JM, Mosse YP, Bradfield JP |title=Chromosome 6p22 locus associated with clinically aggressive neuroblastoma |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=358 |issue=24 |pages=2585–93 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18463370 |pmc=2742373 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0708698|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Center followed-up this finding with another genome-wide association study that focused on a 397-person high-risk subset of the neuroblastoma group. They identified a region on chromosome 2 on or near the BARD1 gene, which has been found to regulate cell growth and tumor suppressants. These data show that a common variation in the BARD1 gene contributes to aggressive neuroblastoma – the most clinically important form of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Capasso M, Devoto M, Hou C |title=Common variations in BARD1 influence susceptibility to high-risk neuroblastoma |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=718–723 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19412175 |pmc=2753610 |doi=10.1038/ng.374|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Center contributed another study identifying copy number variations (CNVs) as a potential cause of neuroblastoma. CNVs are segments of DNA consisting of deleted, duplicated, or rearranged genetic material. They identified a CNV on chromosome 1 that associated with the disorder. It behaved similarly to a class of genes known as neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) genes and was thus implicated as a previously unknown member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Diskin SJ, Hou C, Glessner JT |title=Copy number variation at 1q21.1 associated with neuroblastoma |journal=Nature |volume=459 |issue=7249 |pages=987–91 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19536264 |pmc=2755253 |doi=10.1038/nature08035|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was the first germline CNV study in any cancer.

[[Testicular cancer]] is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 34, but also peaks in infancy and old age. In 2009, in collaboration with the [http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9542 Nathanson Lab] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the Center published the results of a genome-wide associated study that examined the genomes of 227 patients with testicular germ cell tumors and 919 controls. They identified an area on chromosome 5 as a major risk factor for the disease, which was in the region of a gene called [[SPRY4]]. A specific copy of this gene is associated with a 40% greater chance of testicular cancer. Even more strikingly, they identified a region in chromosome 12 within a gene called KITLG. Patients with a specific form of the KITLG gene were much more likely to have testicular cancer – each copy of the gene-form increased risk of testicular cancer threefold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanetsky PA, Mitra N, Vardhanabhuti S |title=Common variation in KITLG and at 5q31.3 predisposes to testicular germ cell cancer |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=811–5 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19483682 |pmc=2865677 |doi=10.1038/ng.393|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents one of the largest effect sizes reported in cancer.

===Crohn's Disease===
[[Crohn's disease]] (CD) is one of the two main forms of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (the other being [[ulcerative colitis]]). It affects the gastrointestinal tract, and may cause pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, and can result in significant weight loss. The genetic associations of CD have remained elusive. In 2008, the Center pioneered an alternative strategy for examining the disorder by focusing on age-of-onset. To this end, they carried out a genome-wide association study of 1,011 individuals with pediatric-onset IBD and 4,250 matched controls. Researchers identified and replicated two previously unreported regions on chromosome 20 and chromosome 21 that predicted childhood IBD. These regions were located near the genes TNFRSF6B and PSMG1 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kugathasan S, Baldassano RN, Bradfield JP |title=Loci on 20q13 and 21q22 are associated with pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1211–5 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18758464 |pmc=2770437 |doi=10.1038/ng.203|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these genes is now thought to be intimately linked to the biology of IBD.

In a subsequent paper, the Center applied [[pathway analysis]] to focus on multiple regions in the genome that may interact to cause Crohn’s disease.  Researchers led by Kai Wang identified an association between CD and a network of 20 genes. The network contains many [[interleukins]] – proteins that are critical components of the immune system. Many of the genes in the pathway did not correlate significantly with CD independently. However, when analyzed together, the network of genes did significantly associate with the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang K, Zhang H, Kugathasan S |title=Diverse genome-wide association studies associate the IL12/IL23 pathway with Crohn Disease |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=399–405 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19249008 |pmc=2668006 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.01.026|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding represents an important proof-of-principle as the first demonstration of the power of a pathway approach to understanding human genomics.

In 2009, the Center also published a genome-wide association study of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) in 3,426 affected individuals and 11,963 genetically matched controls. Researchers identified five new regions associated with early-onset IBD, and detected associations at a number of loci previously implicated in adult-onset IBD. This provides an important demonstration of the close genetic relationship between early- and adult-onset IBD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Imielinski M, Baldassano RN, Griffiths A |title=Common variants at five new loci associated with early-onset inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=1335–40 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19915574 |doi=10.1038/ng.489 |pmc=3267927|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schizophrenia===
[[Schizophrenia]] is a complex disorder that affects about a half percent of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bhugra D |title=The global prevalence of schizophrenia |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e151; quiz e175 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15916460 |pmc=1140960 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldner EM, Hsu L, Waraich P, Somers JM |title=Prevalence and incidence studies of schizophrenic disorders: a systematic review of the literature |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=9 |pages=833–43 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12500753}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the first symptoms of schizophrenia typically appear in adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bhugra D |title=The global prevalence of schizophrenia |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e151; quiz e175 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15916460 |pmc=1140960 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a genome-wide association study of 1,735 schizophrenic patients and 3,485 healthy adults, the Center identified copy number variations as a potential cause of the disorder. In the schizophrenia group, researchers located CNVs near the CACNA1B and DOC2A genes, both of which facilitate calcium signals that are important to [[neurotransmission]] in the brain. They also identified CNVs near the RET and RIT2 genes, which are known to be involved in brain development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glessner JT, Reilly MP, Kim CE |title=Strong synaptic transmission impact by copy number variations in schizophrenia |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=107 |issue=23 |pages=10584–9 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20489179 |pmc=2890845 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1000274107|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the regions associated with schizophrenia have previously been found to associate with autism and ADHD. This provides a strong indication that many psychiatric disorders stem share similar neurodevelopmental features.

===Type 1 Diabetes===
[[Type 1 diabetes]] in children results from autoimmune destruction of cells in the pancreas, leading to an insufficient production of insulin. It is fatal unless treated by insulin. In 2007, researchers performed a genome-wide association study in a large pediatric group that identified a previously unknown association between type 1 diabetes and a genetic variation on chromosome 16. This region contains KIAA0350, the gene product of which is predicted to be a sugar-binding protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grant SF, Hakonarson H, Schwartz S |title=Can the genetics of type 1 and type 2 diabetes shed light on the genetics of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults? |journal=Endocrine Reviews |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=183–93 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20007922 |doi=10.1210/er.2009-0029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent follow-up studies (e.g. Concannon ''et al.'', 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Concannon P, Onengut-Gumuscu S, Todd JA |title=A human type 1 diabetes susceptibility locus maps to chromosome 21q22.3 |journal=Diabetes |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=2858–61 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18647951 |pmc=2551699 |doi=10.2337/db08-0753|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have confirmed a link between this gene and type-1 diabetes, and our group is currently participating in a resequencing study of this region. This paper was published in Nature [hyperlink to ]

== Technology ==
The Center uses [[microarrays]] to perform whole-genome analysis – microarrays are slides consisting of thousands to millions of tiny probes. They allow researchers to screen an individual’s genome for huge numbers of genetic markers called [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs). A SNP occurs when the DNA in two individuals in the population differs by a single nucleotide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g2conline.org/#Gene%20Finding?aid=554/|title=Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms|publisher=[[Dolan DNA Learning Center]]|accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, one individual may have an 'A' at a specific position, and another individual may have a 'C'. This can impact on the protein encoded by the DNA sequence (the gene) and increase gene risk.

An association typically means that a SNP is significantly more frequent in a patient-group than in controls.  Once researchers know the location of a SNP that is more common in a group, they can examine the sequence of DNA from which it comes. In this way, they can check if it is part of a gene, or is close to a gene. The Center can simultaneously scan the genome for thousands of these associations at once – a powerful methodology called [[genome-wide association]]. At the Center, researchers have examined over 100,000 individuals.

Humans can also differ in the number of copies of each gene an individual has. These differences are called [[copy number variants]]. Rare alterations in a chromosome can lead to the gain or a loss of a copy.  A duplication occurs when a fragment of DNA is gained – during copying, or when genes are shuffled at conception. The same process can cause a deletion, where a fragment of DNA is lost. Deletions and duplications of greater than 1,000 nucleotides are called copy number variants (CNVs).

The Center is equipped with the [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] BeadArray System and utilizes both the Infinium and GoldenGate analytical methods. The Center's equipment includes multiple Tecan hardware systems and scanning instruments with integrative Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). It uses several [[genotyping]] units from [[Affymetrix]], adding flexibility to internal and collaborative projects to conduct studies on either platform.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7442">'''Chronic toxicity''', the development of adverse effects as a result of long term exposure to a contaminant or other stressor, is an important aspect of [[aquatic toxicology]].&lt;ref name="Rand"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of aquatic toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment |last1=Rand |first1=G.M. |year=1995 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn= 978-1560320913|page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse effects associated with chronic toxicity can be directly lethal but are more commonly sublethal, including changes in growth, reproduction, or behavior. Chronic toxicity is in contrast to [[acute toxicity]], which occurs over a shorter period of time to higher concentrations. Various toxicity tests can be performed to assess the chronic toxicity of different contaminants, and usually last at least 10% of an organism’s lifespan.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of ecotoxicology |last1=Newman |first1=M.C. |year=2010 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn= 978-1-4200-6704-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of aquatic chronic toxicity tests can be used to determine water quality guidelines and regulations for protection of aquatic organisms.

==Chronic toxicity definition==
Chronic toxicity is the development of adverse effects as the result of long term exposure to a toxicant or other stressor. It can manifest as direct lethality but more commonly refers to sublethal endpoints such as decreased growth, reduced reproduction, or behavioral changes such as impacted swimming performance.

==Common aquatic chronic toxicity tests== 
Chronic toxicity tests are performed to determine the long term toxicity potential of toxicants or other stressors, commonly to aquatic organisms. Examples of common aquatic chronic toxicity test organisms, durations, and endpoints include: 
*Fathead minnow, ''[[Pimephales promelas]]'', larval survival and growth
*Daphnia, ''[[Daphnia magna]]'', 21-d survival and reproduction
*Green algae, ''[[Raphidocelis subcapitata]]'', 72-h growth
*Amphipod, ''[[Hyalella azteca]]'', 42-d survival, growth, and reproduction

==Application of chronic toxicity test results==
Results from chronic toxicity tests can be used to calculate values that can be used for determining water quality standards. These include:

===[[NOEC]]/[[LOEC]]===
The no observed effects concentration (NOEC) is determined as the highest tested concentration that shows no statistically significant difference from the control. The lowest observed effects concentration (LOEC) is the lowest concentration of those tested that produced a statistically significant difference from the control. NOECs and LOECs can be derived from both acute and chronic tests and are used by agencies to set water quality standards.

===[[Maximum Overdrive toxicant concentration|MATC]]/CV===
The maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) is calculated as the geometric mean of the NOEC and LOEC. MATC is sometimes called the chronic value (CV) and defined as “the concentration (threshold) at which chronic effects are first observed”.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Ecotoxicology, second edition |last1=Hoffman |first1=D.J. |last2=Rattner |first2=B.A. |last3=Burton |first3=G.A. Jr. |last4=Cairns |first4=J. |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PEC/[[Predicted no-effect concentration|PNEC]]===
The predicted no effects concentration (PNEC) is calculated from toxicity tests to determine the concentration that is not thought to cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name="Duffus"&gt;{{cite book |title=Concepts in Toxicology|last1=Duffus |first1=J.H. |last2=Templeton |first2=D.M. |last3=Nordberg |first3=M. |year=2009 |publisher=RSC Publishing |isbn = 978-0-85404-157-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determination of aquatic PNEC values requires toxicity test results from freshwater fish (e.g. ‘‘Pimephales promelas’’, freshwater invertebrates (e.g. ‘‘Daphnia magna’’), and freshwater algae (e.g. ‘‘Raphidocelis subcapitata’’)
The probable effects concentration (PEC), the concentration predicted to be in the environment, is compared with the PNEC in risk assessment. The PEC takes into account both acute and chronic exposures to toxicants.

===ACR/AF===
The [[acute to chronic ratio]] (ACR) allows for an estimation of chronic toxicity using acute toxicity data. It is calculated by dividing the LC50 by the MATC. The inverse of this (MATC/LC50) is termed the application factor (AF). AFs can be used when chronic toxicity data is not known for a specific species.

==Challenges with chronic toxicity testing== 
The chronic toxicity of toxicants is useful information to know in determining water quality guidelines, but this information is not always easily obtained. Chronic toxicity tests can be costly and difficult, due to challenges in keeping control organisms alive, maintaining water quality, retaining constant chemical exposures, and the sheer time required for tests.  Because of this, acute toxicity tests are more commonly employed, and ACRs and AFs are used to estimate chronic toxicity of toxicants to organisms.

==Factors that influence toxicity==
There are many factors that can increase or decrease the toxicity of toxicants or stressors, making interpretation of test results difficult. These can be chemical, biological, or toxicological.

===Chemical factors===
Water chemistry plays an important role in the toxicity of certain toxicants. This includes pH, salinity, water hardness, conductivity, temperature, and amounts of dissolved organic carbon [[(DOC)]]
For instance, the toxicity of copper is decreased with increasing amounts of DOC, as described by the [[biotic ligand model]] (BLM).&lt;ref name="Di Toro"&gt;{{cite journal  | last1 = Di Toro | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Allen | first2 = H.E. | last3 = Bergman | first3 = H.L. |last4 = Meyer | first4 = J.S. |last5 = Paquin |first5 = P.R. |last6 = Santore |first6 = R.C. | title = Biotic Ligand Model of the acute toxicity of metals I. Technical basis | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | volume = 20 | issue = 10 | pages = 2383–2396 | date = 2001 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620201034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological factors===
Chronic toxicity will vary with differences in organisms, including species, size, and age. Certain species are more susceptible to toxic effects, as shown in species sensitivity distributions [[(SSDs)]]. Certain life stages are more susceptible to adverse effects, which is why [[early life stage]] (ELS) toxicity tests are performed for certain aquatic species. In addition, other physical factors, like organism size, can lead to differences in response to toxicants.

==Examples for use in water quality guidelines==
Water quality guidelines are determined based on the results of both acute and chronic toxicity tests. Criteria maximum concentrations (CMCs) are obtained from acute toxicity tests, whereas criteria continuous concentrations (CCCs) are obtained from chronic toxicity tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/handbook/chapter03.cfm “Water Quality Standards Handbook - Chapter 3: Water Quality Criteria (40 CFR 131.11)” U.S. EPA, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; They are values determined by the U.S. EPA to be protective of aquatic organisms.

'''Computational semiotics''' is an interdisciplinary field that applies, conducts, and draws on research in [[logic]], [[mathematics]], the [[theory of computation|theory]] and [[computer programming|practice]] of [[computer science|computation]], [[formal language|formal]] and [[natural language|natural]] [[linguistics|language studies]], the [[cognitive science]]s generally, and [[semiotics]] proper.  A common theme of this work is the adoption of a [[sign (semiotics)|sign-theoretic]] perspective on issues of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[knowledge representation]].  Many of its applications lie in the field of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) and fundamental devices of recognition.

One part of this field, known as [[algebraic semiotics]], combines aspects of [[algebra]]ic specification and social semiotics, and has been applied to [[user interface]] design and to the representation of [[mathematical proof]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12456">'''Contemplative psychology''' "is a psychology that forms an intrinsic part of the contemplative traditions of most world religions. The term 'contemplative psychology' therefore does not refer to academic psychological theory about contemplation, religion or religious behavior. It refers to the psychological insights and methods that are - often implicitly - present in the vision and practice of religions and that clarify and guide ones contemplative or religious development" (p.&amp;nbsp;82).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Han de Wit, {{Cite web|url = http://shambhalanetwork.org/sandbox3/index.php?file=2012/08/On_contemplative_psychology.pdf|title = On Contemplative Psychology|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Contemplative psychology addresses the question of how we could intelligently approach and understand human life-experience" (p.&amp;nbsp;83).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
The term Contemplative Psychology was coined by [[Han F. De Wit]] in 1991 when he, a theoretical psychologist at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, published his pioneering book ''Contemplative Psychology.''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2510|title = Han F. d e W it , Contemplative Psychology. Translated from the Dutch by Marie Louise Baird. Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1991. xviii+ 248 pp.|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this project was to "establish a dialogue between contemplative psychology and academic psychology" (p.&amp;nbsp;233).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contemplative Psychology|last = De Wit|first = H.F.|publisher = Duquesne University Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Pittsburgh|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a first step Han did not offer a systematic contemplative psychology but rather he suggested a "framework in which a full-fledged contemplative psychology may be developed" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). Is this work he outlines the "contours and the view of contemplative psychology" (p.&amp;nbsp;4). As Han develops the concept, his first point is to illustrate "a position from which the 'excavation' and 'exposure' of the contemplative psychologies seems possible" (p.&amp;nbsp;115) and to "make explicit and clarify the nature and position of the psychological ''know-how'' that contemplative traditions contain" (p.&amp;nbsp;14)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This implied a comparative study of different religious and contemplative traditions in the belief that there was enough in common between these traditions to make "the search for a general contemplative psychological perspective and approach" meaningful (p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Contemplative psychology became visible in the Western sphere of psychology when researchers began studying the methods used to help individuals understand their own mind, emotions, and motivations. The goal of these practices is to improve the quality of one's own life (and, by extension, the quality of other people's lives). Research began at [[Naropa University]], and was developed extensively by Han himself.

Thus far, mindfulness has been the contemplative practice of most research.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Exploring how contemplative practices can inform counselling psychology and counsellor training. (2013). Counselling and Spirituality, 115-142.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mindfulness is a practice that allows one to exist in the present moment without being  judgmental of it.&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn, J. 2005"&gt;Kabat-Zinn, J. (2005). Full catastrophe living: Using the wisdom of the body and mind to face stress, pain, and illness (3rd ed.). New York, NY: Bantam Dell.&lt;/ref&gt; This meditative absorption, often referred to as [[samadhi]] in many eastern traditions, is the equivalent of [[contemplation]] in Western traditions. Gerald G. May expands on this notion in his book ''Will and Spirit'' by differentiating between willfulness and willingness. ''Willfulness'', he explains, is one's attempted mastery over the psyche, while ''willingness'' is a surrender of one's self to a way of being. Contemplative practices allow persons to cultivate meaningful experiences intrinsic to religious and spiritual traditions that are virtually absent in modern, mechanistic psychology alone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn, J. 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="May, G. 1983"&gt;May, G. (1983). Will and spirit: A contemplative psychology. San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Understanding contemplative traditions ===
For Han, the project of defining a contemplative psychology begins with the excavation and explication of the "psychology embedded in various contemplative traditions (although often in an implicit and not fully developed state); to compare these different psychologies and derive more general rules from them; and to refine and systematize these findings further through a confrontation with contemporary academic psychology" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus Han did not create the concept of contemplative psychology from scratch. It emerged as a common ''techne'' in various religious and secular traditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Han develops three concepts of contemplative tradition: monastic tradition, lay tradition and temporal (non-religious) tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Monastic tradition is "a context in which people devote their whole life to the practice of a religious discipline and to the spiritual exercises that are part of it" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People of the monastic traditions typically live with a group of individuals that is fairly separate from the surrounding society. "Their daily life activities are permeated by a discipline that is supposed to develop and sustain religious or spiritual growth" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These individuals are typically trained to possess a practical knowledge of their particular tradition and there role is to educate people in the religious view of the world. "This know how is psychological and methodological in nature" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is a form of contemplative psychology.

Lay traditions are "religious disciplines that are practiced in the context of normal every day life" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are two particular views on lay tradition practice. One is that religious practice in everyday life brings one closer to a monastic tradition and the other is that daily life is the ultimate [[monastery]] and that daily practice is the monastic practice brought into everyday lived experiences. In either view there is psychological knowledge that could be considered contemplative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Temporal (non-religious) traditions are "contemplative traditions could be 'non religious', that is without a connection with a particular religion" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite an informal nature these traditions contain "a discipline based on a particular kind of psychological knowledge, that guides its practitioners towards the realization of the highest human values" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The assumption of contemplative psychology is that contemplative traditions have in common "some normative anthropology, some notion of 'materialistic man' or 'fallen man' and the idea that human beings have the possibility to uplift themselves and others from their' corrupted state' towards what is often called 'enlightenment'"(p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Contemplative psychology gathers its knowledge base from the comparative analysis of experiential knowledge across contemplative traditions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Wit, H.F. de.’Methodologie in contemplatief perspectief’. In: L.K.A. Eisenga (e.d.). Over de qrenzen van de psychologie. Amsterdam: Swetz &amp; Zeitlinger, 1985.|last = |first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from the psychology of religion and psychology in general==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If we would interpret the preposition ‘of’ in the possessive sense of 'belonging to', then contemplative psychology would definitely be a psychology of religion, but the academic ‘psychology of religion’ would not. For the standard interpretation of the preposition ‘of' in ‘psychology of religion’ is rather in the direction of ‘about’ than in the direction of ‘belonging to’. And conventional psychology about religion is not and does not intend to be a psychology belonging to religion" (p.86).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus contemplative psychology is a psychology of first-person experience. The psychology of religion (and scientific psychology) is a psychology ''about'' its object of study, it is a third-person psychology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The major difference is epistemological. The first-person nature of contemplative psychology values the knowledge which comes from private, personal experience. "It has its own notion of objectivity (see e.g. the ‘acid test of truth’ in Roberts, 1985: 171)" (p.86).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The psychology of religion and scientific psychology in general "tend to shun away from research into experience that is only available in the first-person sense. For the private character of first-person experience seems to exclude ‘objectivity’ as defined in third person methodology" (p.&amp;nbsp;86).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differing objectives ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The object of contemplative psychology is the totality of human existence or human experience. The central question is: what is the place of all aspects of human life within the contemplative perspective and its development? How could one deal with all these aspects in a way that furthers one’s contemplative development" (p.87)?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The object of scientific psychology of religion is religion itself, which is viewed as one among the many non-religious aspects of human life. The central question here is: how could we gain a third-person psychological understanding of religious phenomena and how are these causally related to other non-religious phenomena" (p.87)?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Differing aims ===
The aim of contemplative psychology as a field of study is a way of life. It pursues knowledge about living "in the first-person sense of being wise [and] being free from confusion and ignorance" (p.&amp;nbsp;87).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The aim of psychology of religion is scientific knowledge, that is true information ''about'' its object of study. "This knowledge is primarily representational and indirect and as such distinct from (at a distance of) what it represents"(p.&amp;nbsp;87).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differing methodology ===
Because of the difference in epistemological bases there is also differentiation between the methods of acquiring the differing types of knowledge. The methods of contemplative psychologies are in fact practices and disciplines like ([[meditation]], [[contemplation]], [[prayer]]) that bring about what the contemplative tradition views the existentential path towards the above-mentioned aims."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Han de Wit characterizes these practices as ''awareness strategies''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; that are aimed at the "discipline of becoming aware on the spot of one’s working basis" (p.&amp;nbsp;111).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The methods of psychology of religion consist of the empirical scientific method, which are characterized by Han de Wit as ''conceptual strategies,'' as they aim for the development of conceptual knowledge that represents human behavior."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Uses ==
An example of using contemplative psychology would be using Buddhist concepts such as brilliant sanity (or [[buddha-nature]]), [[ego (religion)|ego]], [[mindfulness]], and interconnectedness as framework for interpreting psychological experiences, as is done in the contemplative counseling program at Naropa university.&lt;ref&gt;Nimmanheminda, S., Unger, R., Abigail, L., &amp; Mathew, H. (n.d.). (2010). Group therapy training at Naropa University's contemplative counseling psychology program. Group, 34(4), 309-318.&lt;/ref&gt; The same could be applied to other faiths, as May used the Christian concept of [[Grace (Christianity)|Grace]] as a framework for explaining our psychological surrender to a cosmic order.&lt;ref name="May, G. 1983"/&gt;

== Research ==
DID is distinctive for its interest in rising middle income developing countries (like the [[BRIC]]s) as well as in social, political, and economic phenomena in conjunction with policy related questions of those fast-growing developing countries. The department’s mission is “to explore the sources of success in emerging economies as well as understand the major development challenges they continue to face”.

DID’s areas of research are ‘[[Inclusive growth|inclusive development]]’ on the one hand and ‘national development’ on the other hand. Within these two broad themes, it works on five research clusters:

* Political Institutions in Emerging Economies
* Poverty, Inequality and the New Middle Classes in Emerging Economies
* Natural Resources and Emerging Economies
* Gender Relations in Emerging Economies
* Private Sector Development in Emerging Economies

DID publishes a [[working paper]] series and has links to various external organisations including institutions like the UK [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] and the UK [[Department for International Development]], the [[British Academy]], the [[European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes|European Association of Development Institutes]], the UK [[Development Studies Association]], the US [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[UNDP]], the [[United Nations University]], the [[WHO]], the [[World Bank]], and various international non-governmental and research organisations.

'''Developmentally appropriate practice''' (or DAP) is a perspective within [[early childhood education]] whereby a [[teacher]] or child caregiver nurtures a child's social/emotional, physical, and cognitive development by basing all practices and decisions on (1) theories of [[child development]], (2) individually identified strengths and needs of each child uncovered through [[authentic assessment]], and (3) the child's cultural background as defined by his [[community]], [[family history]], and [[types of family|family structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bredekamp, V.S.|author2=Copple, C.|last-author-amp=yes  |date=1997 |title=Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Early Childhood Programs |publisher=Washington, DC: NAEYC |url=http://sales.naeyc.org/Itemdetail.aspx?Stock_No=2349&amp;Category= |accessdate=2007-01-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228050845/http://sales.naeyc.org/Itemdetail.aspx?Stock_No=2349&amp;Category= |archivedate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

'''Developmentally Appropriate Practice''' (DAP) is the practice of an excellent educator who knows and changes his/her teaching practices to meet the students where they are developmentally. In order to adjust teaching practices to meet these students' needs, the teacher must research and be educated on child development and a variety of approaches in order to teach the children. Every approach or teaching strategy should be appropriate for the students in the classroom. Teachers can use multiple strategies in one lesson to ensure all children are learning. To ensure each students' needs are being met the educator must know each student and know where he/she is developmentally and what works for him/her. Meeting the students' needs and adjusting the way a skill or concept is being taught does not mean the educator makes the task easier for the student. Instead, the educator challenges the student by setting a goal that is attainable without frustrating the student. Along with adjusting to meet the students where they are developmentally the educator must take into consideration the students' cultural and social contexts. These practices and this knowledge base are a foundation or a starting point for educators as they make decisions in their classrooms.[1]

==Position Statement==

'''The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)''' wrote a position statement to outline best practices for teachers and educators of all kinds. The position statement was adopted in 2009 and is written solely based on research about child development, child learning, and effective educational practices. Educators have the responsibility to narrow the achievement gap for students who come from all kinds of backgrounds and give them learning opportunities they may not have the ability to experience outside of the school. Giving the child experiences that are both led by them and led by the teacher are important for the child's development and learning. Child-led experiences can come from play, which is an extremely important way to learn and spend time as a child. Children may not have the opportunity at home to have well developed or engaging play where they will learn social skills, cognitive skills, or emotional skills. These are very important skills for children to develop. Teacher-led experiences should be well developed, well thought out, consist of a variety of approaches and be completely focused on the children. This position statement gives educators and teachers guidance and principles to keep in mind in decision making, classroom community, enhancing planning curriculum for development, assessing child development and building relationships with families.[2]

==Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Preschool Years (3-5)==

Children ages 3-5 are referred to as preschoolers. The preschool years are a vitally important period of learning and development in all areas of human functioning- physical, social and emotional, cognitive (including perception, reasoning, memory, and other aspects of academic and intellectual development), and language. It is also established that best development and learning during these years is most likely to occur when children establish positive and caring relationships with adults and other children; receive carefully planned, intentional adult guidance and assistance; and explore interesting environments with many things to do and learn.

Early childhood teachers, in collaboration with families, are responsible for ensuring that that program promotes the development and enhances the learning of each individual child served; in other words, professionals must ensure that the program is developmentally appropriate. Ensuring this requires that teachers have a great deal of knowledge, skill, and training. Children entering preschool vary significantly in what they know and can do.

Considerable growth and change occur in children during the preschool years in all areas of development. To function most effectively, preschool teachers need to know about the goals, sequences, and trajectories of development in all of those areas- to avoid a scaled-down version of curriculum intended for older children and to understand the importance of communicating with kindergarten and other teachers and aligning the curriculum accordingly.

Three-year-olds are no longer toddlers, but they behave like toddlers at times, and they are not steady in their gains. Children's social skills are still uncertain, they are still working on how to regulate and appropriately express their emotions, and they are not yet able to communicate their ideas and feelings in skilled, complex ways. They believe in fairies and monsters and have trouble with logical sequences that seem basic to adults- which is why adults tend to underestimate their abilities. Yet at other times, their language ability, motor skills, reasoning abilities, and other behaviors make them seem older than they are.

The challenge for the preschool teacher is to maintain appropriate expectations, providing each child with the right amount of challenge, support, sensitivity, and stimulation that promotes development and learning- all of which can only happen within the context of a close, nurturing teacher-child relationship.

Preschoolers revel in their increasing coordination, using their bodies cheerfully and enthusiastically. They thrive in environments that encourage them to experiment with new materials, roles, and ideas through various projects and especially through play. They have great interest in feelings and are better able to express and label their emotions and identify others' emotions. They make some important gains in cognition, allowing them the pleasure of representing their world in pretend play, symbols, objects, drawings, and words. And, given a rich language environment, they show impressive gains in language skills.

Preschoolers are an enchanting, enthusiastic, curious, and inherently playful and imaginative bunch, providing the adults who work with them entry to a world of great charm and delight!

==Developmentally Appropriate Practice in the Kindergarten Year (5-6 y/o)==

In the Kindergarten Year, children are 5-6 years old, learning through play, community, and social interaction with peers. As a kindergarten teacher it is developmentally appropriate to be modeling positive social interactions in the classroom, fostering positive relationships between students of different cultures and ethnicities, give children leadership roles in the classroom, and teach in whole and small group settings, with peer interaction during instruction. It is important in this year that children spend the majority of the day moving, with little time sitting down and still. They should be working and developing their fine and gross motor skills through this daily movement. Children should also be spending time playing outside everyday, with a regular physical education schedule.

In kindergarten children should be learning body and spatial awareness, as well as key movements like balancing, jumping and catching objects of varied size. Children should have time daily to exercise their fine motor skills, such as through writing with utensils of varied size, using scissors, play dough, puzzles, etc. Along with physical development, kindergarten is a time when students should be developing self-help skills, which should be promoted by teachers through giving students daily activities that teach them to care for themselves. These activities would look like washing their hands, putting on jackets and cleaning up after their own classroom activity.

Teachers should be giving regular time in the classroom for students to be conversing with others, and working in small groups on projects that teach communication, listening and understanding skills. Teachers should provide opportunities for students to verbally respond to questions, describe scenarios, retell stories, and give directions. It is important that English Second Language students are integrated and involved in these discussions and peer work time, in order to develop their listening, speaking and understanding skills.

Academically students should be introducing phonological and phonemic awareness by implementing songs, poems, books, etc. Students should have books read to them on a daily basis. Books should be available in a classroom library at all times and contain a variety of story types. It is appropriate at this age that students be taught the sounds of letters, and writing should be encouraged throughout. Math is taught through manipulatives, block play, games, etc., and at this age it is natural for students to begin to try and make sense of the world through mathematics. Science is based off students natural curiosity and experiences. Science should be a hands on activity.

Technology should be integrated into the classroom through computers, and any other available technology in the classroom, but should foster problem solving and thinking, and by teachers to document children.

==Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Primary Grades (6-8)==

During the early grades, children gain increasing mastery in every area, both in their development and their learning. The exploring, problem solving, communicating, etc. that children do during this time period enthuses and interests them, which teachers can use at this age to create a lifelong love for learning. In order for primary children to prosper, they need warm and sensitive teaching, integrated learning, authentic assessment, and a mix of child and teacher-guided activities.

During the primary grades, it is essential for children to learn how to read. It, however, is equally important that the children develop the desire to read. This sets the tone for almost everything in the classroom and, most often times, determines what type of student the child will be. Teacher's build such enthusiasm by showing interest in each individual child's needs and show genuine excitement for their learning. Teachers should provide a variety of ways for students to learn being that every individual learns in their own way. This will encourage student effort, despite the type of learner the child is.

Physically, children in the primary grades grow around 2-3 inches in height, with their face maturing a good bit as well. It is during this time that the child's face starts to elongate to accommodate permanent teeth. The child's major gross motor skills have typically developed by this time. As far as fine motor skills, some children have started to develop them by this age, while some are still refining these skills.

Socially, primary aged children need an atmosphere characterized by good conversation, laughter, and excitement over accomplishments. It is important that a teacher creates this type of atmosphere in the classroom in order to promote what is developmentally appropriate for these grade levels.

As far as emotionally, children in the primary grades are largely guided by their emotions and they are the main force guiding behavior as well as learning from infancy through adulthood. The ability to infer other's thoughts, feelings, and intentions is a key component to help kids develop and maintain relationships. It is during the primary grades that students become increasingly able to consider the feelings and emotions of others.

Cognitively, primary aged children are making great strides. A significant, yet gradual, change occurs in most children between the ages of five and seven. This being because they become able to think about things more dimensionally, which allows them to solve a wider range of problems. Due to this cognitive growth, children in the primary grades enjoy challenges that test their growing skills. That is, as long as they are able to experience success following these challenges. This is something that teachers should keep in mind in the primary grades when they are creating material.

As far as language goes, children experience a drastic growth in the primary grades following the already substantial growth that happens in the preschool years. It is during this time period that children start to develop actual writing and reading skills, as opposed to the preschool and kindergarten years where listening, speaking, and reading skills are only just emerging.

'''Environmental resource management''' is the [[management]] of the interaction and impact of [[Society|human societies]] on the [[natural environment|environment]]. It is not, as the phrase might suggest, the management of the environment itself. Environmental resources management aims to ensure that [[ecosystem services]] are protected and maintained for future human generations, and also maintain ecosystem integrity through considering [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Economy|economic]], and [[Science|scientific]] ([[Ecology|ecological]]) variables.&lt;ref name=Wostl2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pahl-Wost, C. |title=The implications of complexity for integrated resource management |journal=Environmental Modelling and Software |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=561–9 |date=May 2007 |doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2005.12.024 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815206000417}}{{rp|561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental resource management tries to identify factors affected by conflicts that rise between meeting needs and protecting resources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uehara|first=Thiago Hector Kanashiro|last2=Otero|first2=Gabriela Gomes Prol|last3=Martins|first3=Euder Glendes Andrade|last4=Philippi Jr|first4=Arlindo|last5=Mantovani|first5=Waldir|date=June 2010|title=Pesquisas em gestão ambiental: análise de sua evolução na Universidade de São Paulo|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1414-753X2010000100011&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|journal=Ambiente &amp; Sociedade|volume=13|issue=1|pages=165–185|doi=10.1590/s1414-753x2010000100011|issn=1414-753X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus linked to [[environmental protection]], [[sustainability]] and [[integrated landscape management]].

==Significance==
Environmental resource management is an issue of increasing concern, as reflected in its prevalence in seminal texts influencing global [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] frameworks such as the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s [[Our Common Future]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=World Commission on Environment and Development |chapter=Our Common Future, Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development |chapterurl=http://www.un-documents.net/wced-ocf.htm |title=Development and International Co-operation: Environment |publisher=United Nations |date=2 August 1987 |id=General Assembly document A/42/427 |url=http://www.un-documents.net/a42-427.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which highlighted the integrated nature of environment and [[international development]] and the [[Worldwatch Institute]]'s annual [[State of the World (book series)|State of the World]] reports.

The environment determines the nature of people, [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, and places around the [[Earth]], affecting behaviour, [[religion]], [[culture]] and economic practices.

==Scope==
[[File:TerracesBuffers.JPG|thumb|upright|Improved agricultural practices such as these [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] in northwest Iowa can serve to preserve soil and improve water quality]]
Environmental resource management can be viewed from a variety of perspectives. It involves the management of all components of the [[biophysical environment]], both living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[Abiotic component|abiotic]]), and the relationships among all living [[species]] and their [[habitat]]s. The environment also involves the relationships of the human environment, such as the social, cultural and economic environment, with the biophysical environment. The essential aspects of environmental resource management are ethical, economical, social, and technological. These underlie principles and help make decisions.

The concept of environmental determinism, probabilism and possibilism are significant in the concept of environmental resource management.

Environmental resource management covers many areas in [[science]], including [[geography]], [[biology]], [[social sciences]], [[political sciences]], [[public policy]], [[ecology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[physiology]].

==Aspects==

===Ethical===
Environmental resource management strategies are intrinsically driven by conceptions of [[Human-Environment interaction|human-nature relationships]].&lt;ref name=Colby1991&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colby |first=M.E. |title=Environmental management in development: the evolution of paradigms |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=193–213 |date=September 1991 |doi=10.1016/0921-8009(91)90032-A |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092180099190032A |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical aspects involve the cultural and social issues relating to the environment, and dealing with changes to it. "All human activities take place in the context of certain types of relationships between society and the bio-physical world (the rest of nature),"&lt;ref name=Colby1991_193&gt;{{harvnb|Colby|1991|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so, there is a great significance in understanding the ethical values of different groups around the world. Broadly speaking, two schools of thought exist in environmental ethics: [[Anthropocentrism]] and [[Ecocentrism]], each influencing a broad spectrum of environmental resource management styles along a continuum.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; These styles perceive "...different evidence, imperatives, and problems, and prescribe different solutions, strategies, technologies, roles for economic sectors, culture, governments, and ethics, etc."&lt;ref name=Colby1991_193/&gt;

====Anthropocentrism====
{{Main|Anthropocentrism}}
Anthropocentrism, "...an inclination to evaluate reality exclusively in terms of human values,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anthropocentrism |work=WordNet Search — 3.1 |publisher=Princeton University |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Anthropocentrism&amp;sub=Search+WordNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ethic reflected in the major interpretations of Western religions and the dominant economic paradigms of the industrialised world.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; Anthropocentrism looks at nature as existing solely for the benefit of humans, and as a commodity to use for the good of humanity and to improve human quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=White L |title=The historical roots of our ecologic crisis |journal=Science |volume=155 |issue=3767 |pages=1203–7 |date=March 1967 |pmid=17847526 |doi=10.1126/science.155.3767.1203 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17847526}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Morris |last=Berman |title=The Reenchantment of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUS2tQc7nYcC |year=1981 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-9225-9 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Pepper |first2=John W. |last2=Perkins |first3=Martyn J. |last3=Youngs |title=The Roots of Modern Environmentalism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA145 |year=1984 |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-7099-2064-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropocentric environmental resource management is therefore not the conservation of the environment solely for the environment's sake, but rather the conservation of the environment, and ecosystem structure, for humans' sake.

====Ecocentrism====
{{Main|Ecocentrism}}

Ecocentrists believe in the intrinsic value of nature while maintaining that human beings must use and even exploit nature to survive and live.&lt;ref name=Purser&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Purser, R. |author2=Montuori, A. |title=Ecocentrism is in the eye of the beholder |journal=Acad. Manage. Rev. |volume=21 |pages=611–3 |date=July 1996 |doi=10.5465/AMR.1996.26115125 |url=http://amr.aom.org/content/21/3/603.full.pdf+html}}{{rp|611}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this fine ethical line that ecocentrists navigate between fair use and abuse.&lt;ref name=Purser /&gt; At an extreme of the ethical scale, ecocentrism includes philosophies such as [[ecofeminism]] and [[deep ecology]], which evolved as a reaction to dominant anthropocentric paradigms.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; "In its current form, it is an attempt to synthesize many old and some new philosophical attitudes about the relationship between nature and human activity, with particular emphasis on ethical, social, and spiritual aspects that have been downplayed in the dominant economic worldview."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colby|1991|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
[[File:Gibraltar East Side Water Catchments in 1992.jpg|thumb|A water harvesting system collects rainwater from the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] into pipes that lead to tanks excavated inside the rock.]]
The economy functions within, and is dependent upon goods and services provided by natural ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Thampa&gt;{{cite book |first=Dodo J. |last=Thampapillai |title=Environmental economics: concepts, methods, and policies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xaCZAAAAIAAJ |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-553577-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the environment is recognized in both [[classical economics]] and [[neoclassical economics]] theories, yet the environment was a lower priority in economic policies from 1950 to 1980 due to emphasis from policy makers on economic growth.&lt;ref name=Thampa /&gt; With the prevalence of environmental problems, many economists embraced the notion that, "If environmental sustainability must coexist for economic sustainability, then the overall system must [permit] identification of an equilibrium between the environment and the economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thampapillai|2002|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, economic policy makers began to incorporate the functions of the natural environment—or [[natural capital]] — particularly as a sink for wastes and for the provision of raw materials and amenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Allen V. |last1=Kneese |first2=Robert U. |last2=Ayres |first3=Ralph C. |last3=D'Arge |title=Economics and the environment: a materials balance approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCSSAAAAIAAJ |year=1970 |publisher=Resources for the Future; distributed by the Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore |isbn=978-0-8018-1215-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate continues among economists as to how to account for natural capital, specifically whether resources can be replaced through knowledge and technology, or whether the environment is a closed system that cannot be replenished and is finite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Herman E. |last1=Daly |last2=Cobb |first2=John B. Jr |title=For The Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZAIU1yqyRkC |year=1994 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-4705-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic models influence environmental resource management, in that management policies reflect beliefs about natural capital scarcity. For someone who believes natural capital is infinite and easily substituted, environmental management is irrelevant to the economy.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; For example, economic paradigms based on neoclassical models of closed economic systems are primarily concerned with resource scarcity, and thus prescribe legalizing the environment as an economic externality for an environmental resource management strategy.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; This approach has often been termed 'Command-and-control'.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt; Colby has identified trends in the development of economic paradigms, among them, a shift towards more [[ecological economics]] since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Colby1991 /&gt;

"The pairing of significant uncertainty about the behaviour and response of ecological systems with urgent calls for near-term action constitutes a difficult reality, and a common lament" for many [[Environmental Manager|environmental resource managers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arvai|Gregory|Ohlson|2006|p=2413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific analysis of the environment deals with several dimensions of ecological uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Arvai2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arvai |first1=J. |last2=Gregory |first2=R. |last3=Ohlson |first3=D. |title=Deconstructing Adaptive Management: Criteria for Applications to Environmental Management |journal=Ecological Applications |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=2411–25 |date=December 2006 |doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[2411:DAMCFA]2.0.CO;2 |url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/1051-0761%282006%29016%5B2411%3ADAMCFA%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |ref=harv |pmid=17205914|hdl=1794/22080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include: ''structural uncertainty'' resulting from the misidentification, or lack of information pertaining to the relationships between ecological variables; ''parameter uncertainty'' referring to "uncertainty associated with parameter values that are not known precisely but can be assessed and reported in terms of the likelihood…of experiencing a defined range of outcomes";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arvai|Gregory|Ohlson|2006|p=2417}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''stochastic uncertainty'' stemming from chance or unrelated factors.&lt;ref name=Arvai2006 /&gt; [[Adaptive management]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carl J. |last=Walters |title=Adaptive management of renewable resources |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMwYAQAAIAAJ |year=1986 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-02-947970-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=C.S. |editor-last=Holling |author=United Nations Environment Programme |title=Adaptive environmental assessment and management |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRFSAAAAMAAJ |year=1978 |publisher=International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis |isbn=978-0-471-99632-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a useful framework for dealing with situations of high levels of uncertainty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Lance H. |editor1-last=Gunderson |editor2-first=C.S. |editor2-last=Holling |title=Panarchy Synopsis: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IRnr9uAWo0EC |year=2002 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-55963-330-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not without its detractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walters C, Holling CS |title=Large-scale management experiments and learning by doing |journal=Ecology |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=2060–8 |date=December 1990 |doi=10.2307/1938620 |url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1938620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common scientific concept and impetus behind environmental resource management is [[carrying capacity]]. Simply put, carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of organisms a particular resource can sustain. The concept of carrying capacity, whilst understood by many cultures over history, has its roots in [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] theory. An example is visible in the EU [[Water Framework Directive]]. However, "it is argued that Western scientific knowledge ... is often insufficient to deal with the full complexity of the interplay of variables in environmental resource management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johannes RE |title=The case for data-less marine resource management: examples from tropical nearshore finfisheries |journal=Trends Ecol.

Sustainability in environmental resource management involves managing economic, social, and ecological systems both within and outside an organizational entity so it can sustain itself and the system it exists in.&lt;ref name=Avery2010&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gayle C. |last1=Avery |first2=Harald |last2=Bergsteiner |title=Honeybees and Locusts: The Business Case for Sustainable Leadership |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOqC9YnA4HkC |year=2010 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |isbn=978-1-74237-393-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunphy2007&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dexter Colboyd |last1=Dunphy |first2=Andrew |last2=Griffiths |first3=Suzanne |last3=Ben |title=Organizational Change for Corporate Sustainability: A Guide for Leaders and Change Agents of the Future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK5oYAigfjQC |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In context, sustainability implies that rather than competing for endless growth on a finite planet, development improves quality of life without necessarily consuming more resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Costanza |title=Ecological Economics: The Science and Management of Sustainability |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbIjc3LyYOIC |year=1991 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-07563-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainably managing environmental resources requires organizational change that instills sustainability values that portrays these values outwardly from all levels and reinforces them to surrounding stakeholders.&lt;ref name=Avery2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunphy2007 /&gt; The end result should be a symbiotic relationship between the sustaining organization, community, and environment.

Many drivers compel environmental resource management to take sustainability issues into account.

===Current paradigm shifts===
To adjust to today's environment of quick social and ecological changes, some organizations have begun to experiment with new tools and concepts.&lt;ref name=Selin&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Selin.

==Stakeholders==

===Public sector===
[[File:Southern Appalachian bog May 2010.jpg|thumb|A conservation project in [[North Carolina]] involving the search for [[bog turtle]]s was conducted by [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] and the [[North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission]] and its volunteers]]
The [[public sector]] comprises the general government sector plus all public corporations including the [[central bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2006, Glossary of Statistical Terms: Public Sector. Retrieved 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In environmental resource management the public sector is responsible for administering [[natural resource management]] and implementing [[environmental protection]] legislation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DERM&gt;The State of Queensland: Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM), 2011, What we do. Retrieved 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional role of the public sector in environmental resource management is to provide professional judgement through skilled technicians on behalf of the public.&lt;ref name=Selin/&gt; With the increase of intractable environmental problems, the public sector has been led to examine alternative paradigms for managing environmental resources.&lt;ref name=Selin /&gt; This has resulted in the public sector working collaboratively with other sectors (including other governments, private and civil) to encourage sustainable natural resource management behaviours.&lt;ref name=DERM /&gt;

===Private sector===
The [[private sector]] comprises private corporations and non-profit institutions serving households.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2001, Glossary of Statistical Terms: Private Sector, Retrieved 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The private sector's traditional role in environmental resource management is that of the recovery of [[natural resources]].&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith, V.L. |title=Economics of Production from Natural Resources |journal=American Economic Review |volume=58 |issue=3 Part 1 |pages=409–413 |date=June 1968 |jstor=1813767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such private sector recovery groups include mining (minerals and petroleum), forestry and fishery organisations.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt; Environmental resource management undertaken by the private sectors varies dependent upon the resource type, that being renewable or non-renewable and private and common resources (also see [[Tragedy of the Commons]]).&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt; [[Environmental Manager|Environmental managers]] from the private sector also need skills to manage collaboration within a dynamic social and political environment.&lt;ref name=Selin /&gt;

===Civil society===
[[Civil society]] comprises associations in which societies voluntarily organise themselves into and which represent a wide range of interests and ties.&lt;ref name=oecd07&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2007, Glossary of Statistical Terms: Civil Society Organisations. Retrieved 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These can include community-based organisations, indigenous peoples' organisations and non-government organisations ([[NGO]]).&lt;ref name=oecd07 /&gt; Functioning through strong public pressure, civil society can exercise their legal rights against the implementation of resource management plans, particularly land management plans.&lt;ref name=Selin /&gt; The aim of civil society in environmental resource management is to be included in the decision-making process by means of [[public participation]].&lt;ref name=Selin /&gt; Public participation can be an effective strategy to invoke a sense of social responsibility of natural resources.&lt;ref name=Selin /&gt;

== Tools ==
As with all management functions, effective management tools, standards and systems are required. An environmental management standard or system or [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]] attempts to reduce [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] as measured by some objective criteria. The [[ISO 14001]] standard is the most widely used standard for environmental [[risk management]] and is closely aligned to the European [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)]]. As a common auditing standard, the [[ISO 19011]] standard explains how to combine this with [[quality management]].

Other [[environmental management system|environmental management systems (EMS)]] tend to be based on the ISO 14001 standard and many extend it in various ways:
* The Green Dragon Environmental Management Standard is a five-level EMS designed for smaller organisations for whom ISO 14001 may be too onerous and for larger organisations who wish to implement ISO 14001 in a more manageable step-by-step approach,&lt;ref name=greendrag&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.groundwork.org.uk/what-we-do/green-dragon-ems.aspx |title=Green Dragon Environmental Standard |publisher=Groundwork UK |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061812/http://www.wales.groundwork.org.uk/what-we-do/green-dragon-ems.aspx |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* BS 8555 is a phased standard that can help smaller companies move to ISO 14001 in six manageable steps,
* [[The Natural Step]] focuses on basic [[sustainability]] criteria and helps focus [[engineering]] on reducing use of materials or energy use that is unsustainable in the long term,
* [[Natural Capitalism]] advises using [[accounting reform]] and a general [[biomimicry]] and [[industrial ecology]] approach to do the same thing,
* [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] has many further terms and standards that it defines as appropriate to large-scale EMS,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
* The [[UN]] and [[World Bank]] has encouraged adopting a "[[natural capital]]" measurement and management framework,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
* The [[European Union]] [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)]].

Other strategies exist that rely on making simple distinctions rather than building top-down management "systems" using [[performance audit]]s and [[full cost accounting]]. For instance, Ecological Intelligent Design divides products into [[consumable]]s, [[service product]]s or durables and [[unsaleable]]s — toxic products that no one should buy, or in many cases, do not realize they are buying. By eliminating the unsaleables from the [[comprehensive outcome]] of any purchase, better environmental resource management is achieved without ''systems''.

Recent successful cases have put forward the notion of ''integrated management''. It shares a wider approach and stresses out the importance of interdisciplinary assessment. It is an interesting notion that might not be adaptable to all cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Billé, R. |title=Integrated Coastal Zone Management: four entrenched illusions |journal=S.A.P.I.EN.S. |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2008 |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index198.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnolichenology''' is the study of the relationship between [[lichen]]s and people.  Lichens have and are being used for many different purposes by human cultures across the world. The most common human use of lichens is for dye, but they have also been used for medicine, food and other purposes.

==Lichens for dye==
Lichens are a common source of [[natural dye]]s.  The lichen dye is usually extracted by either boiling water or [[ammonia fermentation]].  Although usually called ammonia fermentation, this method is not actually a [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] and involves letting the lichen steep in [[ammonia]] (traditionally [[urine]]) for at least two to three weeks.

In [[North America]] the most significant lichen dye is ''[[Letharia vulpina]]''.  Indigenous people through most of this lichen's range in North America traditionally make a yellow dye from this lichen by boiling it in water.

Many of the [[traditional dyes of the Scottish Highlands]] were made from lichens including red dyes from the [[cudbear]] [[lichen]], ''[[Lecanora tartarea]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xcbAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=corcur+lichen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ABzcJuixuP&amp;sig=vL0RFqTgPAnqdWLuJ4hS8cgWhcs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lU5uU_GnF8z-PKX2gJAI&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=corcur%20lichen&amp;f=false | title=Lichen | publisher=The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia | date=1832 | accessdate=10 May 2014 | author=Brewster, Sir David}}&lt;/ref&gt; the common orange lichen, ''[[Xanthoria parietina]]'', and several species of leafy ''[[Parmelia (lichen)|Parmelia]]'' lichens.  Brown or yellow lichen dyes (called [[crottle|crottle or crotal]]), made from ''[[Parmelia saxatilis]]'' scraped off rocks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=3594&amp;startset=7760752&amp;dtext=snd&amp;query=CROTTLE | title=Crottle | publisher=Dictionary of the Scots Language | accessdate=10 May 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221641/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=3594&amp;startset=7760752&amp;dtext=snd&amp;query=CROTTLE | archivedate=12 May 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and red lichen dyes (called [[corkir]]) were used extensively to produce [[tartan]]s.

Purple dyes from lichens were historically very important throughout Europe from the 15th to 17th centuries.  They were generally extracted from ''[[Roccella (lichen)|Roccella]]'' spp. lichens imported from the [[Canary Islands]], [[Cape Verde Islands]], [[Madagascar]], or [[India]].  These lichens, and the dye extracted from them, are called [[orchil]] (variants [[archil]], [[orcein|orchilla]]).  The same dye was also produced from ''[[Ochrolechia]]'' spp. lichens in Britain and was called  cudbear.  Both ''[[Roccella (lichen)|Roccella]]'' spp. and ''[[Ochrolechia]]'' spp. contain the lichen substance [[orcin]], which converts into the purple dye [[orcein]] in the [[ammonia fermentation]] process.

[[Litmus]], a water-soluble pH indicator dye mixture, is extracted from ''[[Roccella (lichen)|Roccella]]'' species.

==Lichens for medicine==
Many lichens have been used medicinally across the world. A lichen's usefulness as a medicine is often related to the lichen secondary compounds that are abundant in most lichen thalli. Different lichens produce a wide variety of these compounds, most of which are unique to lichens and many of which are antibiotic. It has been estimated that 50% of all lichen species have antibiotic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharnoff|first1=Sylvia|title=Lichens and People|url=http://www.lichen.com/people.html|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many lichen extracts have been found to be effective in killing Gram-positive bacteria, which included species that cause boils, scarlet fever, and pneumonia &lt;ref name="Richardson1974"&gt;Richardson, D. H. S. 1974. Vanishing Lichens. Their History, Biology and Importance. 231 pp. HafnerPress, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most potent lichen antibiotics is [[usnic acid]], as a result [[Usnea|''Usnea'' spp.]] are commonly used in traditional medicines.  ''Usnea'' was used in the United States as a fungal remedy of the mouth, stomach, intestines, anus, vagina, nose, ear, and skin, and in Finland it was used to treat wounds, skin eruptions, and athlete’s foot.&lt;ref name="Vartia1973"&gt;Vartia, K.O. 1973. Antibiotics in lichens. pp. 547-561. In Ahmadjian, V, Hale, ME, eds. The Lichens. p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Russia a preparation of the sodium salt of usnic acid was sold under the name Binan for the treatment of varicose and trophic ulcers, second and third degree burns, and for plastic surgery.&lt;ref name="Richardson1974"/&gt;

Other lichens commonly featured in folk medicines include [[Iceland moss]] and [[Lobaria|Lungwort]].

==Lichens for poisons==
[[File:Letharia vulpina JHollinger crop.jpg|thumb|right|''Letharia vulpina'', the wolf lichen]]
Only a few lichens are truly poisonous, with species of ''[[Letharia vulpina|Letharia]]'' and ''[[Vulpicida]]'' being the primary examples.  These lichens are yellow because they have high concentrations of the bright yellow toxin [[vulpinic acid]].

[[Letharia vulpina|Wolf lichen]] (''Letharia vulpina'') was used in [[Scandinavia]] to poison wolves. The process begins by adding the lichens to various baits such as reindeer blood and other meats, while sometimes mixing the concoction with ground glass or [[strychnine]]. Wolves that ate the concoction were reported to succumb in less than 24 hours. The [[Achomawi]] people of northern California use ''Letharia'' to poison arrowheads. The arrowheads would be soaked in the lichens for a year sometimes with the addition of rattlesnake [[snake venom|venom]]. Although toxic, wolf lichens were used to treat sores and inflammation by indigenous people in north California and southern British Columbia, and even taken internally as medicine.

==Lichens for food==
[[File:Closeup of wila lichen.jpg|thumb|left|The hairlike lichen commonly known as Wila (''Bryoria fremontii'') is edible.]]
There are records of lichens being used as food by many different human cultures across the world.  Lichens are eaten by people in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, and perhaps elsewhere.  Often lichens are merely [[famine food]]s eaten in times of dire needs, but in some cultures lichens are a staple food or even a delicacy.  Two problems often encountered with eating lichens is that they usually contain mildly toxic secondary compounds, and that [[lichenin|lichen polysaccharides]] are generally indigestible to humans.  Many human cultures have discovered preparation techniques to overcome these problems.  Lichens are often thoroughly washed, boiled, or soaked in ash water to help remove secondary compounds.

In the past [[Iceland moss]] (''Cetraria islandica'') was an important human food in northern Europe and Scandinavia, and was cooked in many different ways, such as bread, porridge, pudding, soup, or salad.  [[Wila (lichen)|Wila]] (''Bryoria fremontii'') was an important food in parts of North America, where it was usually pitcooked.  It is even featured in a [[Sk'elep|Secwepemc story]].  [[Cladonia rangiferina|Reindeer lichen]] (''Cladina'' spp.) is a staple food of reindeer and caribou in the Arctic.  Northern peoples in North America and Siberia traditionally eat the partially digested lichen after they remove it from the [[rumen]] of caribou that have been killed.  It is often called 'stomach icecream'.  [[Rock Tripe|Rock tripe]] (''Umbilicaria'' spp. and ''Lasalia'' spp.) is a lichen that has frequently been used as an emergency food in North America.  One species of ''Umbilicaria'', [[Umbilicaria esculenta|Iwa-take]] (''U. esculenta''), is used in a variety of traditional Korean and Japanese foods.  It is quite expensive, and is collected off the sides of cliffs.  In India, and other centers of curry powder production, [[garam masala]] sauce contains certain lichens used as bulking agents.

Very few lichens are poisonous.  Poisonous lichens include those high in [[vulpinic acid]]&lt;ref name="Emmerich1993"&gt;Emmerich, R., I. Giez, O. L. Lange, and P. Proksch.  1993.  Toxicity and antifeedant activity of lichen compounds against the polyphagous herbivorous insect Spodoptera littoralis.  Phytochemistry 33(6): 1389-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[usnic acid]].&lt;ref name="Emmerich1993" /&gt;  Most (but not all) lichens that contain vulpinic acid are yellow, so any yellow lichen should be considered to be potentially poisonous.

==Lichens for embalming==
[[File:Lichen Julian Alps Sovenia 2.jpg|thumb|right|''Pseudevernia furfuracea'' was used in embalming.]]
[[Embalming]] began in [[Ancient Egypt]] around 5,000 years ago. The use of lichens in embalming dates to the [[18th Dynasty]], where ''[[Pseudevernia furfuracea]]'' was found in an Egyptian vase.&lt;ref name="Llano1944"&gt;Llano, G.A.P. 1944. Lichens: their biological and economic significance. The Botanical Review 10 (1): 1-65. Page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The process began with a slit in the abdomen; the organs and viscera were removed. The organs and viscera were wrapped in separate linen packets and replaced in the body or put in canopic jars between the legs. The body cavity was then packed with lichen, [[sawdust]], bruised [[myrrh]], [[Senna (plant)|cassia]], and other spices.&lt;ref name="Llano1944"/&gt; ''Pseudevernia furfuracea'' was employed due to its [[preservative]] and aromatic qualities. Also it was used simply as a highly absorbent, light-weight packaging material. It also contains antibiotic substances. These qualities helped inhibit bacterial decay of the mummies.&lt;ref name="Richardson1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumann1960"&gt;Baumann, B.B. 1960. The botanical aspects of ancient Egyptian embalming and burial. Econ. Bot. 14(1):84-104. Page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Another discovery is that the Egyptians would grind and mix ''Pseudevernia furfuracea'' with their flour for bread. The bread was then placed with the mummy and thought to be the first meal for the mummy in its afterlife. ''Pseudevernia furfuracea'' was imported shiploads from the Grecian archipelago to Alexandria.&lt;ref name="Richardson1974"/&gt; Today, embalming fluids are colored from the lichen dye orchil into a product called [[Cudbear]], illustrating how a historical procedure can influence future practices.

==Other human uses of lichens==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2012}}
Lichens have been and are still being used for many other purposes, including
*Alcohol production (for fermentable carbohydrates, as catalysts, and/or as flavour/preservatives)
*Cosmetics (for hair, and/or sweet smelling powders)
*Perfumes (see [[Oakmoss]])
*Decorations (including costumes and artwork)
*Fibre (clothing, housing, cooking, sanitation)
*Animal feed (both fodder and forage)
*Fuel
*Industrial purposes (production of acid, antibiotic, carbohydrate, litmus)
*Tanning
*Hunting/fishing (to find prey, or to lure them in)
*Navigation
*Insect repellent/insecticide
*Preservatives (for food or beer)
*Poison (arrowheads, wolves: see ''[[Letharia vulpina]]'')

The '''Faculty of Political Science, [[Chulalongkorn University]]''', is regarded as one of the oldest modern higher education institutions in [[Thailand]]. It is the first faculty of political science in Thailand and is considered as one of the best according to the statistics of student who had highest score on admission system chose to study there for 4 years in a row (2010-2013).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.matichon.co.th/news_detail.php?newsid=1368077139&amp;grpid=03&amp;catid=19&amp;subcatid=1903&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of Thailand's leading institutions for [[political science]] training. Many senior government officials, politicians, diplomats and prominent academics are the graduates of the Faculty. Due to its logo and colour, the Faculty, students and its graduates are also called by the nickname, "Singh Dam" (Black Singha).

==History==
The Faculty of Political Science was originally established in 1899 as the School of Civil Servant Training by [[King Chulalongkorn]]. Students were selected from those who passed basic educational training and would be educated about [[public administration]] in the school. They were also required to do internship in different governmental agencies after completion and received certificate for specialised skill afterwards. This School had expanded and its graduates mostly worked as royal [[page (occupation)|page]] which allowed these young men to be close to the central authority and became accustomed to senior officials. As a general practice during that time, new government officials would start their career at the Department of Royal Pages before being promoted to work in other departments. Therefore, [[King Chulalongkorn]] renamed the School to the Royal Pages School to reflect this reality in 1902.

In 1910, [[King Vajiravudh]] viewed that training new graduates to work for the Ministry of Interior was not sufficient for increasing public services in other areas; therefore, he ordered and financially supported the expansion of the Royal Pages School to include many areas of trainings. The School was renamed again to "The Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn" on 1 January 1910. The general curriculum was four-year training of which the first three were for general education leaving the last year for internship. However, the School was upgraded and renamed [[Chulalongkorn University]] on 26 March 1916. The newly established [[Chulalongkorn University]] was then administered in 4 faculties, that is, the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Arts and Science, and the Faculty of Public Administration.
[[File:PolSciCUFront.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|Samranraj Borirak Building, the first building of the faculty ]]

In 1929 after the promulgation of the new Civil Service Act the popularity of the Faculty of Public Administration decreased significantly. The Act did not require applicants to hold university qualification to apply for first level entry of public service. Holders of ordinary secondary school certificate (equivalent to Grade 11) could also enter to the same level, while the students choosing to enter the Faculty had to pass advanced secondary certificate (equivalent to Grade 12) plus 3 years at the university before starting their career. The nadir of its popularity could be seen by only 35 students enrolling in that year. Therefore, the Ministry of Education proposed to [[King Prajadhipok]] to discontinue the Faculty after the completion of its last class. The King initially endorsed the proposal. However, many government officials especially from the Ministry of Interior appealed to the King to reconsider his decision as they still saw the necessity and usefulness of producing graduates in this field. The committee for reconsidering this issue was set up and finally agreed that the Faculty should be continued on the proviso that its admission and curriculum must be revamped. The name of the Faculty was changed to the School of Civil Service and directly overseen by the Office of the President of Chulalongkorn University. In 1933, the Law School of the Ministry of Justice was incorporated into the School, thereafter renamed together the "Faculty of Law and Political Science.

Following the collapse of the absolute monarchy in 1932, the [[University of Moral and Political Science]] (later called [[Thammasat University]]) was established. Then, the Faculty of Law and Political Science of Chulalongkorn University was transferred to be under this new university. The Faculty of Law and Political Science was therefore temporarily disappeared from Chulalongkorn University's academic structure.

In 1948, the government viewed that there was still need for more graduates for public administration, then agreed to re-establish the Faculty of Political Science in Chulalongkorn University in that same year. The new phase of the Faculty of Political Science then began and has progressively developed until today.

The then Faculty of Political Science comprised 3 divisions, that is, Political Science Division, Public Finance Division, and Law Division. Later on, Public Finance Division was merged with Economics Division of the Faculty of Commerce and Accountancy to become the Faculty of Economics in 1971. Also, Law Division was upgraded to the Faculty of Law in 1972. After these splits, the Faculty has mainly focused in teaching modern [[political science]] discipline.

==Academic Administration==
Currently, the Faculty of Political Science organises its academic disciplines into 4 departments, that is,&lt;br /&gt;
1. Department of [[Government]]&lt;br /&gt;
2. Department of [[International Relations]]&lt;br /&gt;
3. Department of [[Public Administration]]&lt;br /&gt;
4. Department of [[Sociology]] and [[Anthropology]]

The Faculty offers undergraduate ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) and postgraduate degrees ([[Master of Arts|MA]], [[Master of Public Administration|MPA]] and [[PhD]]), including an international master programme in International Development Studies taught in English.

There are also a number of research centres under the Faculty including Policy and Management Development Institute (PMDI), Institute of Security and International Studies (ISIS), Public Enterprise Institute (PEI), Centre for Social Development Studies (CSDS), Institute of Local Government Initiatives (ILGI), and Thai Politics Research Centre (TPRC).

The Faculty has also run a prominent academic journal namely Journal of Social Science for over 35 years. The published articles are both written in Thai and English.

==Logo==
The black singha is used as a symbol of the dedicated leader. The black colour symbolises the colour of the neck of [[Shiva]] who drinks the poison churned up from the world ocean ([[Halahala]]) to protect and save all creatures. (In fact, the actual colour of Shiva's neck in Hindu mythology is deeply dark blue or "nila". That's why one of his names is Nilakantha or "having a blue-coloured neck". However, "nila" in Thai (normally pronounced "nin") becomes a simply black colour). Singha is a mythical animal that rules the [[Himmapan]] forest representing the great ruler or leader. These symbolic meanings convey the fact that the Faculty aims at producing qualified graduates who will be leading figures in the society in any respect with passion and dedication to help improve people's quality of life as their foremost principle.

{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
'''Harshness''' (also called '''raucousness'''), in [[music information retrieval]], is a Non-Contextual Low-Level Audio Descriptors (NLDs) that represents one dimension of the multi-dimensional [[psychoacoustic]] feature called as musical [[timbre]].

Classical timbre’ NLDs are [[surface roughness|roughness]], [[spectral centroid]], and [[spectral flux]]. While harmonicity and inharmonicity can also be considered NLDs, harshness differs from them, as well as from roughness, once it reckons for a distinguished perceptual audio feature expressed by the summary spectral periodicity. This feature is especially clear in single-[[Pitch (music)|pitch]], single-[[Musical note|note]], musical audio, where the timbre of two different musical instruments can greatly differ in levels of harshness (e.g., the difference in harshness between a flute and a saxophone is evident). As it is supposed to be, harshness is independent of all others NLDs.

'''Industrial management''', as a field of [[business administration]], studies the structure and organization of [[Industry|industrial]] companies. It comprises those fields of business administration that are necessary for the success of companies within the [[manufacturing]] sector and the encompassing services (primarily [[operations management]], [[marketing]], and [[financial management]]).

== Term industrial company ==
The term industrial company is generally applied to a manufacturing firm that – contrary to a crafts business – produces consumer durables in [[Factory|factories]] from raw materials in mass and serial production ([[division of labour]]) using modern manufacturing machines.

== History of industrial management ==
The precursor of the study field industrial management was [[factory]] management. It had a strong similarity with technical [[Business administration|management]] and was geared towards the engineering fields. Parallel to this, there was also a factory management that was more in the area of business economics. This dealt with the organizational questions of factory and [[office administration]] as well as financial [[accounting]], e.g. the factory [[bookkeeping]] and late also [[management accounting]].

The term and the contents of present-day industrial management were strongly influenced by the establishment of MIT School of Industrial Management in 1952 (renamed the [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan School of Management]] in 1964 after its benefactor, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., MIT graduate and then-chairman of General Motors). MIT School of Industrial Management set itself the goal of educating the "ideal manager" through this (post)graduate management program.

== Course of studies ==
Graduate programs in industrial management draw on Sloan’s idea and provide engineers with a strategic management education with a focus on production management, marketing, financial management, human resources as well as commercial law – supplemented by [[corporate governance]], [[corporate social responsibility]] and [[sustainability]] topics. The primary goal is to enable students and professionals to take a holistic approach to industry management.

Most graduate studies in industrial management are full-time [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree programs that, in addition to a preferably engineering bachelor’s degree, also require several years of professional experience. In general, students spend the first year of their degree acquiring both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills needed to practice them. After the second year, students usually seek internships and pursue elective courses, which often go towards a specialization in their master’s thesis.

Study programs in industrial management are very popular in economies with a high value of manufacturing output, such as the United States and Germany. Especially German research universities incorporate a large number of advanced courses in engineering in their graduate program in industrial management and are, thus, more like [[Master of Engineering|M.Eng.-]] programs. On the other hand, U.S. universities and [[Vocational university|universities of applied sciences]] in Germany offer MBA programs in industrial management that follow more the original idea of Sloan and emphasize hands-on application of theory.

Indian institutes such as National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE) Mumbai, offers two year full time residential course PGDIM - Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Management which is equivalent to MBA.

Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; [[cultural knowledge]], and the practice of heritage research. The project is directed by Dr. [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/george-nicholas George P. Nicholas] ([[Simon Fraser University]]), co-developed with [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/julie-hollowell Julie Hollowell] ([[Indiana University]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/kelly-bannister Kelly Bannister] ([[University of Victoria]]) and is funded by the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]]'s (SSHRC) major collaborative research initiatives (MCRI) program.

IPinCH is a collaboration of scholars, students, heritage professionals, community members, policy makers, and Indigenous organizations across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people|title = People &amp; Partners|website = Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our Research Team&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team|title = Research Team {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes over fifty leading scholars and professionals, nearly one hundred Associates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/associates|title = Associates {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; sixteen Fellows,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/fellows|title = Fellows {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over thirty partnering organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/partners|title = Partnering Organisations {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing Canada, Australia, United States, New Zealand, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Germany, and Switzerland. Our organizational partners range from the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), to [[Parks Canada]], to Indigenous groups including the [[Penobscot Nation of Maine]] and the [[Moriori]] of [[Rekohu]] (Chatham Islands, New Zealand)

The project serves as both a practical resource and a network of support for communities and researchers engaged in cultural heritage work. Topics of research include the theoretical, ethical, and practical implications of commodification, appropriation, and other flows of knowledge about the past, and how these may affect communities, researchers, and other stakeholders.

==Purpose==

===Objectives===
* To document the diversity of principles, interpretations, and actions arising in response to [[intellectual property]] issues in [[cultural heritage]] worldwide;
* To generate more robust theoretical understandings as well as norms of good practice in heritage work; and
* To make findings available to stakeholders, from Aboriginal communities to professional organizations to government agencies, allowing them to develop and refine their own theories, principles, policies and practices.

===Mission===
IPinCH is an international collaboration of [[archaeologists]], [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous organizations]], [[lawyers]], [[anthropologists]], [[ethicists]], museum specialists, policy makers, and others, working to facilitate fair and equitable exchanges of knowledge relating to heritage. The IPinCH Project is concerned with the theoretical, ethical, and practical implications of [[commodification]], [[appropriation (sociology)|appropriation]], and other flows of knowledge about the past, and how these may affect communities, researchers, and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].

===Vision===
IPinCH provides a foundation of research, knowledge and resources to assist archaeologists, academic institutions, descendant communities, scholars, policy makers, and other stakeholders in negotiating more equitable and successful terms of research and policies through an agenda of community-based research and topical exploration of intellectual property (IP) issues. IPinCH focuses on archaeology as a primary component of cultural heritage; however, this project is ultimately concerned with larger issues of the nature of knowledge and rights based on culture—how these are defined and used, who has control and access, and especially how fair and appropriate use and access can be achieved to the benefit of all stakeholders in the past.

The 7-year project began in 2008 with a $2.5 million grant from the Major Collaborative Research Initiatives program of Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sshrc.ca/ Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council&lt;/ref&gt;  About one-fourth of the project budget is reserved for student fellowships&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/opportunities/Students student fellowships&lt;/ref&gt; and research support, and one-fourth for community-based heritage research for case studies&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project_components case studies&lt;/ref&gt; related to the project themes.

The IPinCH Project is led by Dr. Nicholas and guided by a steering committee of six team members representing five universities ([https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/catherine-bell Catherine Bell] [University of Alberta], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/joe-watkins Joe Watkins] [University of Oklahoma], and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/john-r-welch John Welch] [Simon Fraser University], plus Hollowell and Bannister). Team members represent nine Canadian and nineteen international universities, and eleven Canadian and international organizations.  A project advisory board will review project activities in addition to advising on strategies for linking with stakeholders and dissemination of results ([https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/michael-brown Michael Brown] [Williams College], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/larry-chartrand Larry Chartrand] [Métis; University of Winnipeg], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/robert-layton Robert Layton] [University of Durham, UK], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/peter-levesque Peter Levesque] [Principal Director, KMbW - Knowledge Mobilization Works], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/robert-paterson Robert K.

The IPinCH project initially had three components:
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives Community Initiatives]
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/working-groups Working Groups]
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/knowledge-base Knowledge Base]
As of March 2016, eight of the twelve community initiatives have been completed and the final reports are available on the IPinCH website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives|title=IPinCH Community Initiatives|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for details on IPinCH’s Community Initiatives, please see below). To accommodate broadening research interests and developments, IPinCH Working Groups have been reconceptualized as Research Themes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/working-groups|title=Working Groups|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see section below on Research Themes). The knowledge base (KB),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/knowledge-base|title=The IPinCH Knowledge Base|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; an online searchable database and archive containing scholarly and popular articles, documents and tools created by communities, global case studies, research protocols and legislation, and resources created by the IPinCH project, has been retired from the IPinCH website.

In IPinCH’s [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives Community-Based Initiatives] (CBIs), team members work closely with communities to investigate and address pressing cultural heritage challenges in specific contexts. IPinCH-supported Community-Based Initiatives are located all over the globe. We fund seventeen initiatives, based in Australia, Canada, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand, and the United States, working with groups such as the Inuvialuit, the Penobscot Nation, the Ainu, the Hopi Tribe, and the Moriori.

IPinCH values a collaborative approach and employs Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)&lt;ref&gt;Minkler, M., and N. Wallerstein (editors) 2003 Community-Based Participatory Research for Health. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Springett, J. 2003 Issues in Participatory Evaluation.

Jossey-Bass, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;St. Denis, V. 1992 Community-Based Participatory Research: Aspects of the Concept Relevant for Practice. Native Studies Review 8 (2): pp. 51–74&lt;/ref&gt; methods that engage the community in all aspects of the research process. In the CBIs, communities determine the research goals, which form for the foundation for the initiative, including the practical and theoretical outputs. After community review, the results of these initiatives will be made available to partner organizations and stakeholders, in order to assist them in refining their own policies and approaches.

Key features of a CBPR methodology include: 
*A collaborative approach that engages the community or organization in all aspects of the research process—from development of research questions and research design to conducting the research, designing outputs, and disseminating results;
*Research goals that prioritize community needs and result in direct community benefits;
*Projects that contribute to community capacity building and to sustainable and more equitable relations between the community and outside researchers, promote respect for local values, and address mistrust, inequity, and similar issues in conventional research.

Twelve community initiatives received funding from IPinCH and a further five Special Initiatives have also been approved. The community initiatives address a broad range of pressing cultural heritage topics: 
*'''A Case of Access: Inuvialuit Engagement with the Smithsonian’s MacFarlane Collection'''

The MacFarlane Collection is a collection of 550 [[Inuvialuit]] items bought by [[Hudson’s Bay Company]] trader Roderick MacFarlane in the mid-1800s for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, David. Painted Wooden Plaques from the MacFarlane Collection: The Earliest Inuvialuit Graphic Art. ARCTIC VOL. 59, NO. 4 (DECEMBER 2006) P. 351– 360&lt;/ref&gt; Inuvialuit elders, youth, cultural experts, anthropologists and museum curators shared with one another their respective knowledge about the museum collection and documented the process. The project has encouraged interaction and engagement by the Inuvialuit with the objects in the MacFarlane Collection, supported by the creation of a [http://www.inuvialuitlivinghistory.ca/ virtual exhibit] and searchable archive of the collection. Additional details about the "A Case of Access" Community Initiative are available in the [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/project_components/community-based_initiatives/acaseofaccess_finalreport_2014.pdf full report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/project_components/community-based_initiatives/inuvialuit_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary], available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Cultural Tourism in Nunavik'''

In the early 1990s, the first few attempts at [[cultural tourism]] in [[Nunavik]] saw little success, but there is now support from businesses to include tourism as a facet of economic development. The [http://www.avataq.qc.ca/en/Home Avataq Cultural Institute], an IPinCH partner organization, has advocated the development of cultural tourism for some time, but Avataq sees a world’s difference between what it envisions as responsible development and certain economic interests’ vision for cultural tourism. This case study works with local communities to answer several key questions: What part do the Nunavimmiut really play in this development? Are they silent participants or, on the contrary, the driving force behind this development? One of the aims of the research is to re-centre the meaning of cultural tourism as a means of protecting [[Inuit culture]], possibly in tension with the Quebec government’s “[[Plan Nord]]” for Northern economic and tourism development.

*'''Developing Policies and Protocols for the Culturally Sensitive Intellectual Properties of the Penobscot Nation of Maine'''

Indigenous communities face legal, social, cultural, and economic challenges when attempting to protect or manage their intellectual property (IP), and often there is a lack of community infrastructure to formalize processes for confronting IP issues. To mitigate this challenge, the [[Penobscot|Penobscot Nation]] in Maine established an IP Working Group that developed tribal protocols, tools, and an internal infrastructure to address IP issues particularly related to archaeology and heritage-based places. This involved discussions around what constitutes Penobscot Nation intellectual property, what characterizes intellectual property violations (and how to deal with them), and identifying the community’s intellectual property priorities. The [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/penobscot_final_report_2014.pdf full project report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/penobscot_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary] are available on the IPinCH website.
*'''Education, Protection and Management of ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' (Sanilac Petroglyph Site)'''

For the [[Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation]] of Michigan, ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' is a sacred place where teachings from their Anishinabe ancestors are embedded in the rock as [[petroglyph]]s. Amidst concerns over the inappropriate use of the teachings, this case study explores issues around cultural commodification with the goal of working with the Saginaw Chippewa's Ziibiwing Cultural Society to create a plan to protect and control the use of the ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' site. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/ezhibiigaadek_asin_finalreport_2016.pdf project report] is available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Grassroots Resource Preservation and Management in Kyrgyzstan: Ethnicity, Nationalism and Heritage on a Human Scale'''

This case study began a public conversation among both urban and rural people about intellectual property and cultural heritage in [[Kyrgyzstan]], a post-Soviet nation where ties to the past have been attenuated and even severed. In Kyrgyzstan, local communities have little or no awareness of the heritage resources in their midst, and damage to sites is common. This case study had three components all with the shared goal of encouraging a national dialogue on cultural heritage and intellectual property. The first project involved developing a new foundation for an endangered archaeological structure. The second project focused on preserving oral traditions for younger generations of Kyrgyz, while the third initiative was centered on creating a photographic record of local archaeological sites.
*'''Moriori Cultural Database'''

Located on Rēkohu ([[Chatham Islands]], New Zealand), this project involved research and community-building related to [[Moriori people|Moriori]] identity, indigenous cultural heritage and resource management and protection. A key component of this study was the development of a multi-layer database to integrate research on Moriori identity, cultural heritage protection, land use, and resource management in culturally sensitive ways. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/moriori_final_report_2014.pdf project report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/moriori_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary] are available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Secwepemc Territorial Authority – Honoring Ownership of Tangible / Intangible Culture'''

This initiative brought together [[Secwepemc]] community leaders and knowledge holders from Neskonlith, Adams Lake, and Splats’in Bands of interior [[British Columbia]] with a group of social, legal, and political scholars. This community initiative will outline approaches to cultural heritage encounters within Secwepemc territory, examining what it would look like were we to fully accept and act upon the premise that Secwepemc Peoples’ have economic, political, and legal authority within their territory. At the heart of this project is a desire to develop fruitful scholarly and economic collaborations, while fully honouring Secwepemc peoples’ assertions of territorial authority.
* '''The History and Contemporary Practices of the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office'''
What are the differences between [[Hopi]] notions of ''navoti'' (“[[traditional knowledge]]”) and Euro-American understandings of intellectual property? What are the implications of this in terms of managing cultural knowledge resources? This case study is working towards developing an official cultural heritage management guide for the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office and the Hopi Tribe.

*'''The Journey Home - Guiding Intangible Knowledge Production in the Analysis of Ancestral Remains'''

In the Journey Home project, the question was not whether ancestral remains should be repatriated from the [[University of British Columbia]] Lab of Archaeology to the [[Sto:lo|Stó:lō Nation]], but rather how to do things right, regardless of timeframe. This study developed mutually acceptable guidelines for [[repatriation]], addressing complex questions related to the production of knowledge, authority, control, and ongoing relationships with ancestors. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/thejourneyhome_finalreport_2016.pdf project report] is available on the IPinCH website.
*'''The Ngaut Ngaut Interpretive Project: Providing Culturally Sustainable Online Interpretive Content to the Public'''

Indigenous groups around the world are struggling to come to terms with the issues that an online environment poses to the presentation of the Indigenous past and present. In this initiative, the Mannum Aboriginal Community Association Inc. countered offensive and incorrect online information about the Ngaut Ngaut heritage complex in [[South Australia]] by creating their own interpretive content in which they shared community perceptions and values about this significant cultural landscape. The [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3YUNheVwtsFcVRWQXNDbG5MNkE/view?pli=1 full project report] and an [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3YUNheVwtsFYm4wWndadjFRTTQ/view?pli=1 interpretive guide] for the Ngaut Ngaut site are available on the IPinCH website. 
*'''Treaty Relations as a Method of Resolving IP Issues'''

This case study examined the political relationship established between [[First Nations]] and Canada through historical [[Treaty|treaties]]. Did the treaty relationship include, either directly or indirectly, a shared understanding of how the cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples would be treated by Settlers and by the governments they established? How might this historical relationship serve Settler-First Nations relations today? Based on a careful examination of published primary and secondary materials related to treaty negotiations in central Ontario and the Northwest Territories, the study applies historical, oral-historical, and anthropological methods and attempts to identify aspects of these historic treaties which have resonance for current IP debates around topics such as property, ownership, and jurisdiction. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/treatyrelations_finalreport_2014.pdf project report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/treatyrelations_projectsummary_2014.pdf project summary] are available on the IPinCH website.
*'''Yukon First Nations Heritage Values and Heritage Resource Management'''

This community initiative seeks understandings of heritage values from three participating [[Yukon]] First Nations: the [[Champagne and Aishihik First Nations|Champagne &amp; Aishihik First Nations]], the [[Carcross/Tagish First Nation|Carcross-Tagish First Nation,]] and the [[Ta'an Kwach'an Council|Ta'an Kwach'än Council.]] This project will explore how the values of Yukon First Nations towards heritage resources differ from Western understandings, and will articulate and document what Indigenous heritage management practices look like on a practical level.

==Research Themes==
Integrating research findings and knowledge from our Community-Based Initiatives and other sources, the IPinCH Research Themes explore unique questions relating to intellectual property and heritage.  Each group is led by at least two team members, as Research Theme Co-Chairs. Membership in these groups is open to all associated students, partnering organization representatives, co-investigators, associates, collaborators, research assistants, steering committee members, and community representatives.
* '''Bioarchaeology, DNA, and Indigeneity'''
How is [[Genetics|genetic]] information being used to define—or redefine—identity, [[Ancestor|ancestry]], and diversity? What are the ensuing social, ethical, and practical implications of [[DNA]] research for descendent communities, First Nations peoples, and other stakeholders? What are the intersections of genetic and cultural identities? What can research examples such as that of [[Kwäday Dän Ts'ìnchi]] (Long Ago Person Found) or the [[Anzick-1|Clovis period child]] from the Anzick site teach us about moving forward with genetic studies through collaborative research? As archaeologists and anthropologists increasingly turn to genetic information to provide insights into the past, there are important implications for Indigenous peoples today. From genetic ancestry tests that purport to identify “Native American ancestry,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Native American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science|last=TallBear|first=Kim|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Minnesota|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the potential application of [[ancient DNA analysis]] to assist with the [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains|repatriation]] of human remains, DNA is changing the way in which identity is constructed—both for ancient and present-day peoples. Research theme chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/daryl-pullman Daryl Pullman] (Memorial University), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/alan-h-goodman Alan Goodman] (Hampshire College), and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/dorothy-lippert Dorothy Lippert] (Smithsonian Institution).
*'''Commodifications of Cultural Heritage'''
How can processes of commodification be both harmful and beneficial? What tools and strategies can Indigenous communities and scholars use to deal with commodification concerns and opportunities? This theme covers complex topics such as the role of government and legislation in regulating cultural commodification, whether commodification can benefit disempowered communities, and the impact of treating human remains as commodities, whether in medical science or museums. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/sven-ouzman Sven Ouzman] ([[University of Pretoria]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/associates/solen-roth Solen Roth] (University of British Columbia). 
*'''Community-Based Cultural Heritage Research (CBCHR)'''
[[Community-Based Participatory Research]] (CBPR) methods engage communities in all aspects of the research process. In IPinCH’s Community Initiatives, the communities determine the research goals, which form for the foundation for the initiative, including the practical and theoretical outputs. These IPinCH-supported initiatives may serve as positive examples of CBPR methods being put to use to investigate and address pressing cultural heritage needs. There is an ongoing need for background information and case studies to help students and scholars think through the implications of community-based work. This theme also amalgamates resources to help foster balanced and mutually beneficial relationships between academic and community researchers and promote fair and culturally-appropriate uses of intellectual property. Research theme chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/kelly-bannister Kelly Bannister] (University of Victoria), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/julie-hollowell Julie Hollowell] (Indiana University), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/ian-lilley Ian Lilley] (University of Queensland), and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/john-r-welch John R. Welch] (Simon Fraser University). 
*'''Cultural Tourism'''
The diversity of the world’s cultures, both past and present, is one of the key attractions of travel. Governments, the tourism industry, and communities work hard to create unforgettable cultural products and experiences. But are the economic benefits of these experiences shared equally with communities? Are they sustainable environmentally, are they culturally appropriate experiences to share, and do communities have control over how their culture is represented? These questions are at the heart of the ''Cultural Tourism'' research theme. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/lena-mortensen Lena Mortensen] (University of Toronto - Scarborough) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/david-schaepe David Schaepe] (Sto:lo Nation)
*'''Indigenous Peoples, Cultural Heritage, and the Law'''
The ''Indigenous Peoples, Cultural Heritage, and the Law'' Research Theme investigates the application of [[intellectual property law]] to the realm of cultural heritage, as well as alternative models to protect, promote, and maintain cultural and heritage goods. A number of legal systems coexist and often intersect with conventional intellectual property protections, including customary law, international law, informal or “vernacular” intellectual property, and moral economies. Many stakeholders thus face an inter-jurisdictional geography of cultural rights, consisting of [[indigenist]] social movements, NGOs, development agencies and institutions, multilateral institutions, and the [[Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples]]. This theme addresses these complex legal and political landscapes. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/rosemary-j-coombe Rosemary Coombe] ([[York University]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/associates/patricia-goff Patricia Goff] ([[Wilfrid Laurier University]], Ontario).
*'''Indigenous Research Ethics'''
The ''Indigenous Research Ethics'' theme explores the dynamic intersection of policies, procedures, practices, and philosophies of contemporary Indigenous research ethics. The research contained within this theme represents a useful resource for practitioners who grapple with intellectual property ethics and issues. Emphasis is placed upon the special demands and rewards of collaborative research practice. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/alison-wylie Alison Wylie] ([[University of Washington]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/sonya-atalay Sonya Atalay] ([[Indiana University]]).
* '''Safeguarding Indigenous Heritage'''
In 2014, the long-standing conflict over Grace Islet, off [[Salt Spring Island]], B.C., a well-documented [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] burial islet, reached a boiling point as construction began on a private residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/resources/declarations/open-letter-grace-islet|title=An Open Letter on Grace Islet|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grace-islet-home-on-sacred-aboriginal-cemetery-to-be-demolished-1.3186534|title=Home on sacred B.C. aboriginal cemetery to be demolished|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following protests by First Nations, scholars, and members of the public, construction was halted and the province of British Columbia eventually purchased Grace Islet from the private landowner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grace-islet-controversy-ends-as-b-c-steps-in-to-buy-land-1.2906882|title=Grace Islet burial site saved as province steps in|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IPinCH believes that the critical issue in the Grace Islet case is the absence of respect for First Nations laws, values, and practices relating to burial sites and ancestral remains, and the need for descendant communities to have a say in how their ancestral sites are managed and protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/resources/declarations/ancestral-burial-grounds|title=Declaration on the Safeguarding of Indigenous Ancestral Burial Grounds as Sacred Sites and Cultural Landscapes|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace Islet is one of many such cases in British Columbia and, indeed, around the world, that demonstrate the limited legal protections available to protect Indigenous burial grounds''.'' This research theme seeks to examine current challenges in protecting Indigenous ancestral burial sites within the province and to propose a new approach that meets the needs of all parties.

The '''International Network for Social Network Analysis''' ('''INSNA''') is a professional [[learned society|academic association]] of researchers and practitioners of [[social network analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intute.ac.uk/socialsciences/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=sosig1059997247-25098 Intute: Social Sciences], [[Intute]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Members have interests in social networks as a new theoretical paradigm, in methodological developments, and in a variety of applications of different types of [[social networks]] approaches, [[Social Networking Software|social network software]], and [[social networking]]. 

==History==
INSNA was founded in 1977 by [[Barry Wellman]], a [[sociologist]]. A key function of the organization was to provide a sense of identity for a set of researchers who were widely dispersed geographically and across scientific disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~wellman/vita/index.html Barry Wellman] biography: ''Netlab'' at the [[University of Toronto]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellman served as "coordinator" of INSNA until 1988, when he passed the baton to Al Wolfe, an anthropologist at the University of South Florida. Wolfe in turn passed the leadership to Steve Borgatti, who served from 1993 to 1999. Borgatti incorporated INSNA as a legal entity, creating bylaws and establishing the positions of President, Vice-President and Treasurer. A full chronology of INSNA leadership is as follows:

Shortly after INSNA was founded, Linton C. Freeman founded the association's flagship journal, [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/social-networks Social Networks], in 1978. In 1981, the annual Sunbelt Conference was founded by Al Wolfe and H. Russel Bernard. Initially, the conference was independent of the association, but was brought under INSNA's auspices by Steve Borgatti in the 1990s.

As of 2018, INSNA has approximately 1,000 active members, while the SOCNET&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insna.org/socnet.html|title=INSNA: SOCNET|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; listserv has about 3700 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lists.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/wa?INDEX|title=UFL LISTSERV Archives|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As well as publishing a triannual journal [[Connections (journal)|Connections]] on the subject, INSNA also:

*Runs SOCNET, a listserv mailing-list for the subject.
*Hosts the International Sunbelt Social Network Conference annually.&lt;ref&gt;Annual [http://www.insna.org/INSNA/sunbelt_inf.html International Sunbelt Social Network Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522115911/http://www.insna.org/INSNA/sunbelt_inf.html |date=2007-05-22 }}: [[INSNA]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; See list below.
*Facilitates regional and specialized conferences.
*Publishes a quarterly journal, ''Social Networks''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505596/description#description Social Networks], quarterly journal.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Publishes the online ''Journal of Social Structure'', irregular periodicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmu.edu/joss/ Journal of Social Structure], online journal, irregular periodicity.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Provides links to researchers around the world.
*Provides raw data.

==Sunbelt Conference==
:The official conference of the association is the Sunbelt Conference, held annually in a wide variety of international locations. The first Sunbelt conference was organised by Alvin Wolfe and H. Russell Bernard in Tampa, FL. Initially, it was decreed to alternate US coasts, in order to spread travel costs on the part of participants from different regions. However, in 1994, it was decided to incorporate the European network conference, which had been held in parallel with Sunbelt. Starting 1995, Sunbelt observed a 3-year rotation of Europe, west coast, and east coast. Starting with the 2nd Sunbelt, Sunbelt featured a Keynote address by a prominent member of the community. In the 1990s, the keynote speakers were also recognized with the Georg Simmel Distinguished Career Award.

''“Monumentalized Early Iron Age Landscapes in the Danube river basin”'' 

'''Iron-Age-Danube''' is a cross-border project and is part of the [[Interreg|Interreg Danube Transnational Programme]] of the [[European Union]]. 

In the Iron-Age-Danube project the early [[Iron Age]] landscapes in the [[Danube]] river basin are explored with the help of modern technology and traditional archaeological tools. The participating partners from [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]] work together to promote the concept of archaeological [[landscape]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s beyond single [[Archaeological site|archaeological sites]] in these countries.

The project is funded by the [[European Union]] with about 2.169.200 EUR from the [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF). These ERDF resources make 85% of the total project volume which is about 2.552.000 EUR.

The Iron-Age-Danube project lasts from the 1st of January 2017 till the 30th of June 2019.

== Goals of the project ==
The major goal of the project is to communicate a lively image of archaeological research and the Iron Age landscapes to the visitors and to raise the awareness for the importance of archaeological [[Ancient monument|monuments]] for the [[Human History|human history]]. 

The project Iron-Age-Danube ignores [[Border (disambiguation)|border]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;lines between the countries and researches the remains of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] (Iron Age) in the Danube region. The data of this research will help to understand the way of living in the past and the needs of the heritage today.

Another goal is the protection of the monuments and landscapes as well as their sustainable use for the tourism. To strengthen the local tourism, already existing archaeological parks or trails will be revitalised. New visitor programs in form of digital and analogous tools will be developed and implemented in 9 micro-regions. The micro-regions are: [[Großklein]] and Strettweg (Austria), [[Jalžabet]] and [[Kaptol, Požega-Slavonia County|Kaptol]] (Croatia), Poštela and [[Dolenjske Toplice]] (Slovenia) and [[Százhalombatta]], [[Süttő]] and [[Sopron]] (Hungary).

==The project in 2018==
On the 31st of January 2018 the [[European Year of Cultural Heritage]] was officially launched by the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/|title=Front page {{!}} European Year of Cultural Heritage|website=europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-5066_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018|website=europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iron-Age-Danube project was granted the honor to use the EYCH 2018 logo.

In June 2018 the Iron-Age-Danube Project was selected by an Independent Jury as one of 21 finalists for the '''RegioStars Awards''' in the 2018 edition. The voting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/regio-stars-awards/finalists_2018/cat5_fin5|title=RegioStars Awards 2018|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; for this year’s public choice award started on the 3rd of July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/newsroom/news/2018/06/06-12-2018-regiostars-awards-the-independent-jury-has-selected-21-finalists-in-the-2018-edition|title=RegioStars Awards : The independent jury has selected 21 finalists in the 2018 edition|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''land ethic''' is a philosophy or theoretical framework about how, ethically, humans should regard the land. The term was coined by [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1948) in his ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), a classic text of the environmental movement. There he argues that there is a critical need for a "new ethic," an "ethic dealing with human's relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it".&lt;ref name=Leopold1949&gt;Leopold, A. 1949. ''A Sand County Almanac''. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} 

Leopold offers an ecologically based land ethic that rejects strictly human-centered views of the environment and focuses on the preservation of healthy, self-renewing ecosystems. ''A Sand County Almanac'' was the first systematic presentation of a holistic or ecocentric approach to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, Joseph R. ''Environmental Ethics: An Introduction to Environmental Philosophy'', 5th ed. Boston: Wadsworth, 2013, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Although Leopold is credited with coining the term "land ethic," there are many philosophical theories that speak to how humans should treat the land. Some of the most prominent land ethics include those rooted in economics, utilitarianism, libertarianism, egalitarianism, and ecology.

==Economics-based land ethic==

This is a land ethic based wholly upon economic self-interest.&lt;ref name=Leopold1949/&gt;  Leopold sees two flaws in this type of ethic. First, he argues that most members of an ecosystem have no economic worth. For this reason, such an ethic can ignore or even eliminate these members when they are actually necessary for the health of the biotic community of the land. And second, it tends to relegate conservation necessary for healthy ecosystems to the government and these tasks are too large and dispersed to be adequately addressed by such an institution. This ties directly into the context within which Leopold wrote ''A Sand County Almanac.''

For example, when the [[US Forest Service]] was founded by [[Gifford Pinchot]], the prevailing ethos was economic and [[utilitarian]]. Leopold argued for an [[ecological]] approach, becoming one of the first to popularize this term coined by [[Henry Chandler Cowles]] of the [[University of Chicago]] during his early 1900s research at the [[Indiana Dunes]]. Conservation became the preferred term for the more anthropocentric model of [[resource management]], while the writing of Leopold and his inspiration, [[John Muir]], led to the development of [[environmentalism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Utilitarian-based land ethic==

Utilitarianism was first put forth by British philosophers [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Though there are many varieties of [[utilitarianism]], generally it is the view that a morally right action is an action that produces the maximum good for people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''/ "History of Utilitarianism"]&lt;/ref&gt; Utilitarianism has often been used when deciding how to use land and it is closely connected with an economic-based ethic. For example, it forms the foundation for industrial farming; an increase in yield, which would increase the number of people able to receive goods from farmed land, is judged from this view to be a good action or approach. In fact, a common argument in favor of [[industrial agriculture]] is that it is a good practice because it increases the benefits for humans; benefits such as food abundance and a drop in food prices. However, a utilitarian-based land ethic is different from a purely economic one as it could be used to justify the limiting of a person's rights to make profit. For example, in the case of the farmer planting crops on a slope, if the runoff of soil into the community creek led to the damage of several neighbor's properties, then the good of the individual farmer would be overridden by the damage caused to his neighbors. Thus, while a utilitarian-based land ethic can be used to support economic activity, it can also be used to challenge this activity.

==Libertarian-based land ethic==

Another philosophical approach often used to guide actions when making (or not making) changes to the land is [[libertarianism]]. Roughly, libertarianism is the ethical view that agents own themselves and have particular moral rights, including the right to acquire property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/libertarianism/ Vallentyne, Peter, "Libertarianism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; In a looser sense, libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each individual person has a right to a maximum amount of freedom or liberty when this freedom does not interfere with other people's freedom. A well-known libertarian theorist is [[John Hospers]]. For libertarians, property rights are natural rights. Thus, it would be acceptable for the above farmer to plant on a slope as long as this action does not limit the freedom of his or her neighbors.

This view is closely connected to utilitarianism. Libertarians often use utilitarian arguments to support their own arguments. For example, in 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] applied this philosophy to land issues when he argued that the only solution to the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]" was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, Garrett. (1968) "The Tragedy of the Commons." ''Science'', 162, 1243-1248&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument. However, it can be argued that this leaves a libertarian-based land ethics open to the above critique lodged against economic-based approaches. Even excepting this, the libertarian view has been challenged by the critique that numerous people making self-interested decisions often cause large ecological disasters, such as the [[Dust Bowl]] disaster.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Paul 2010"&gt;Thompson, Paul. (2010) "Land." ''Life Science Ethics.'' ed. Gary L. Comstock. Raleigh: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, libertarianism is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and, especially, held by U.S. ranchers and farmers.

{{Dubious |Libertarian based |reason= Libertarianism is generally agreed to be a philosophy of the individual and the morality of ownership.  The Land Ethic, as described by Aldo Leopold, is a philosophy of community and interdependence.  These two ideas remain mutually exclusive despite the dogmatic attempt by the former to redefine the later.  |date=June 2013}}

==Egalitarian-based land ethic==

Egalitarian-based land ethics are often developed as a response to libertarianism. This is because, while libertarianism ensures the maximum amount of human liberty, it does not require that people help others. In addition, it also leads to the uneven distribution of wealth. A well-known egalitarian philosopher is [[John Rawls]]. When focusing on land use, egalitarianism evaluates its uneven distribution and the uneven distribution of the fruits of that land.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Paul 2010"/&gt; While both a utilitarian- and libertarian-based land ethic could conceivably rationalize this mal-distribution, an egalitarian approach typically favors equality, whether that be equal entitlement to land and/or access to food.&lt;ref&gt;Arneson, Richard, "Egalitarianism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also the question of negative rights when holding to an egalitarian-based ethic. In other words, if it is recognized that a person has a right to something, then someone has the responsibility to supply this opportunity or item; whether that be an individual person or the government. Thus, an egalitarian-based land ethic could provide a strong argument for the preservation of soil fertility and water because it links land and water with the right to food, with the growth of human populations, and the decline of soil and water resources.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Paul 2010"/&gt;

==Ecologically based land ethic==

Land ethics may also be based upon the principle that the land (and the organisms that live off the land) has intrinsic value. These ethics are, roughly, based on an ecological or systems view. This position was first put forth by Ayers Brinser in ''Our Use of the Land'', published in 1939. Brinser argued that white settlers brought with them "the seeds of a civilization which has grown by consuming the land, that is, a civilization which has used up the land in much the same way that a furnace burns coal.”{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Later, [[Aldo Leopold]]'s posthumously published ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949) popularized this idea. 

Another example is the [[deep ecology]] view, which argues that human communities are built upon a foundation of the surrounding ecosystems or the biotic communities, and that all life is of inherent worth.&lt;ref&gt;Naess, Arne (1973) "The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement." ''Inquiry'' 16: 95-100&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to egalitarian-based land ethics, the above land ethics were also developed as alternatives to utilitarian and libertarian-based approaches. Leopold's ethic is one of the most popular ecological approaches in the early 21st century. Other writers and theorists who hold this view include [[Wendell Berry]] (b. 1934), [[N. Scott Momaday]], [[J. Baird Callicott]], [[Paul B. Thompson (philosopher)|Paul B. Thompson]], and [[Barbara Kingsolver]].

==Aldo Leopold's land ethic==
In his classic essay, "The Land Ethic," published posthumously in ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), Leopold proposes that the next step in the evolution of ethics is the expansion of ethics to include nonhuman members of the [[biotic community]],&lt;ref name=Leopold1949/&gt; collectively referred to as "the land." Leopold states the basic principle of his land ethic as: "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."

He also describes it in this way: "The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land . . . [A] land ethic changes the role of ''Homo sapiens'' from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such."{{page needed|date=April 2018}}

Leopold was a naturalist, not a philosopher. There is much scholarly debate about what exactly Leopold's land ethic asserts and how he argues for it. At its core, the land ethics claims (1) that humans should view themselves as plain members and citizens of biotic communities, not as "conquerors" of the land; (2) that we should extend ethical consideration to ecological wholes ("soils, waters, plants, and animals"), (3) that our primary ethical concern should not be with individual plants or animals, but with the healthy functioning of whole biotic communities, and (4) that the "summary moral maxim" of ecological ethics is that we should seek to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. Beyond this, scholars disagree about the extent to which Leopold rejected traditional human-centered approaches to the environment and how literally he intended his basic moral maxim to be applied. They also debate whether Leopold based his land ethic primarily on human-centered interests, as many passages in ''A Sand County Almanac'' suggest, or whether he placed significant weight on the intrinsic value of nature. One prominent student of Leopold, [[J. Baird Callicott]], has suggested that Leopold grounded his land ethics on various scientific claims, including a Darwinian view of ethics as rooted in special affections for kith and kin, a Copernican view of humans as plain members of nature and the cosmos, and the finding of modern ecology that ecosystems are complex, interrelated wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird. ''In Defense of the Land Ethic: Essays in Environmental Philosophy''. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989, pp. 75-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this interpretation has recently been challenged by [[Roberta Millstein]], who has offered evidence that Darwin's influence on Leopold was not related to Darwin's views about moral sentiments, but rather to Darwin's views about interdependence in the struggle for existence.&lt;ref&gt;Millstein, Roberta L. (2015) “Re-examining the Darwinian Basis for Aldo Leopold’s Land Ethic,” Ethics, Policy &amp; Environment 18: 301-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions of Leopold's land ethic==

Leopold's ecocentric land ethic is popular today with mainstream environmentalists for a number of reasons. Unlike more radical environmental approaches, such as [[deep ecology]] or [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]], it does not require huge sacrifices of human interests. Leopold does not, for example, believe that humans should stop eating or hunting or experimenting on animals. Nor does he call for a massive reduction in human population, or for permitting humans to interfere with nature only to satisfy vital human needs (regardless of economic or other human costs). As an environmental ethic, Leopold's land ethic is a comparatively moderate view that seeks to strike a balance between human interests and a healthy and biotically diverse natural environment. Many of the things mainstream environmentalists favor--preference for native plants and animals over invasive species, hunting or selective culling to control overpopulated species that are damaging to the environment, and a focus on preserving healthy, self-regenerating natural ecosystems both for human benefit and for their own intrinsic value--jibe with Leopold's ecocentric land ethic.

A related understanding has been framed as [http://www.nature.com/news/govern-land-as-a-global-commons-1.22065 global land as a commons]. In this view biodiversity and terrestrial carbon storage - an element of climate change mitigation - are global public goods. Hence, land should be governed on a global scale as a commons, requiring increased international cooperation on nature preservation &lt;ref&gt;Creutzig, F. [http://www.nature.com/news/govern-land-as-a-global-commons-1.22065 Govern land as a global commons]. Nature 546:7656 pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==

Some critics fault Leopold for lack of clarity in spelling out exactly what the land ethic is and its specific implications for how humans should think about the environment.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, ''Environmental Ethics'', pp. 186-88.&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Leopold did not intend his basic normative principle ("A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community") to be regarded as an ethical absolute. Thus construed, it would prohibit clearing land to build homes, schools, or farms, and generally require a "hands-off" approach to nature that Leopold plainly did not favor. Presumably, therefore, his maxim should be seen as a general guideline for valuing natural ecosystems and striving to achieve what he terms a sustainable state of "harmony between men and land." But this is vague and, according to some critics, not terribly helpful.

A second common criticism of Leopold is that he fails to state clearly why we should adopt the land ethic.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, pp. 185-88.&lt;/ref&gt; He often cites examples of environmental damage (e.g., soil erosion, pollution, and deforestation) that result from traditional human-centered, "conqueror" attitudes towards nature. But it is unclear why such examples support the land ethic specifically, as opposed to biocentricism or some other nature-friendly environmental ethic. Leopold also frequently appeals to modern ecology, evolutionary theory, and other scientific discoveries to support his land ethic. Some critics have suggested that such appeals may involve an illicit move from facts to values.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, pp. 185-88.&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, such critics claim, more should be said about the normative basis of Leopold's land ethic.

Other critics object to Leopold's ecological holism. According to animal rights advocate, Tom Regan, Leopold's land ethic condones sacrificing the good of individual animals to the good of the whole, and is thus a form of "environmental fascism."&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Tom. ''The Case for Animal Rights''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983, pp. 361-62.&lt;/ref&gt; According to these critics, we rightly reject such holistic approaches in human affairs. Why, they ask, should we adopt them in our treatment of non-human animals?

Finally, some critics have questioned whether Leopold's land ethic might require unacceptable interferences with nature in order to protect current, but transient, ecological balances.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; If the fundamental environmental imperative is to ''preserve'' the integrity and stability of natural ecosystems, wouldn't this require frequent and costly human interventions to prevent naturally occurring changes to natural environments? In nature, the "stability and integrity" of ecosystems are disrupted or destroyed all the time by drought, fire, storms, pests, newly invasive predators, etc. Must humans act to prevent such ecological changes, and if so, at what cost? Why should we place such high value on current ecological balances? Why think it is our role to be nature's steward or policeman? According to these critics, Leopold's stress on preserving existing ecological balances is overly human-centered and fails to treat nature with the respect it deserves.

A '''liberal arts college''' or '''liberal arts institution of higher education''' is a [[college]] with an emphasis on [[undergraduate]] study in the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]] and sciences. Such colleges aim to impart a broad general knowledge and develop general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberal Arts: Encyclopædia Britannica Concise|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215125843/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts|archivedate=2008-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in a liberal arts college generally major in a particular discipline while receiving exposure to a wide range of academic subjects, including sciences as well as the traditional humanities subjects taught as liberal arts. Although it draws on European antecedents,{{sfn|Harriman|1935}} the liberal arts college is strongly associated with American higher education, and most liberal arts colleges around the world draw explicitly on the [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|American model]]. Some of the most renowned liberal arts colleges in the U.S. include [[Amherst College]], [[Bowdoin College]], [[Carleton College]], [[Davidson College]], [[Hamilton College]], [[Middlebury College]], [[Pomona College]], [[Swarthmore College]], [[Vassar College]], [[Wellesley College]], and [[Williams College]].&lt;ref name="glaa-inside"/&gt;

There is no formal definition of liberal arts college, but one American authority defines them as schools that "emphasize undergraduate education and award at least half of their degrees in the liberal arts fields of study."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges |work=US News &amp; World Report |title=National Liberal Arts Colleges Rankings |accessdate=2015-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821213346/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges |archivedate=2016-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have adopted similar definitions.{{sfn|Clemmer|1997|p=73}}

Although many liberal arts colleges are exclusively undergraduate, some also offer [[graduate school|graduate]] programs that lead to a [[master's degree]] or [[doctoral degree]] in subjects such as [[business administration]], [[nursing]], [[medicine]], and [[law]].  Similarly, although the term "liberal arts college" most commonly refers to an independent institution, it may also sometimes refer to a [[university college]] within or affiliated with a larger university. Most liberal arts colleges outside the United States follow this model.

==Distinguishing characteristics==
[[File:Shimer College class 1995 octagonal table.jpg|thumb|Discussion class at [[Shimer College]] in Chicago]]

Liberal arts colleges are distinguished from other types of higher education chiefly by their generalist curricula and small size. These attributes have various secondary effects in terms of administration as well as student experience.{{sfn|Bonvillian|1996|pp=29-30}} For example, [[class size]] is usually much lower at liberal arts colleges than at universities, and faculty at liberal arts colleges typically focus on teaching more than research.{{sfn|Clemmer|1997|p=78}}

From a student perspective, a liberal arts college typically differs from other forms of higher education in the following areas: higher overall student satisfaction, a general feeling that professors take a personal interest in the student's education, and perception of encouragement to participate in discussion.{{sfn|Bonvillian|1996|p=30}} Many students select liberal arts colleges with precisely this sense of personal connection in mind.{{sfn|Bonvillian|1996|p=30}}

From an administrative standpoint, the small size of liberal arts colleges contributes to their cohesion and ability to survive through difficult times.{{sfn|Bonvillian|1996|p=29}} Job satisfaction is also typically higher in liberal arts colleges, for both faculty and staff.{{sfn|Clemmer|1997|p=77}} The smaller size also makes it feasible for liberal arts colleges to adopt relatively experimental or divergent approaches, such as the [[Great Books]] curriculum at [[St. John's College (Annapolis)|St. John's]] or [[Shimer College|Shimer]], or the radically [[interdisciplinary]] curriculum of [[Marlboro College|Marlboro]].

In addition, most liberal arts colleges are primarily residential, which means students live and learn away from home, often for the first time.

The distinctiveness of these attributes is somewhat eroded by the tendency of universities to adopt aspects of the liberal arts college, and vice versa.{{sfn|Thelin|2004|p=295}}  For example, several American universities, including the [[University of California]] system, have experimented with a [[cluster colleges]] model in which small liberal-arts-college-like units within a larger university form a "honeycomb of [[residential college]]s".{{sfn|Thelin|2004|pp=295-296}}  In addition, some universities have maintained a sub-unit that preserves many aspects of the liberal arts college, such as [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] within Columbia University.{{sfn|Thelin|2004|p=295}}

Liberal arts colleges themselves sometimes cluster to offer greater curricular breadth or share other resources (for instance [[Colgate University]] and [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in New York allow cross enrollment).

== Liberal arts and liberal arts college ==
In academia, liberal arts generally refer to subjects or skills that aim to provide general knowledge and comprise the arts, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences, as opposed to professional or technical subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/liberal-arts|title=the definition of liberal arts|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017123320/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/liberal-arts|archivedate=2016-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most liberal arts colleges nowadays, however, offer more than just liberal arts subjects, such as computer science from the formal science discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distinctively American: The Residential Liberal Arts Colleges|last=Cech|first=Thomas|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2000|isbn=0765807211|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal arts colleges are found in all parts of the world. Notwithstanding the European origins of the concept of liberal arts education,{{sfn|Harriman|1935}} today the term is largely associated with the United States, and most self-identified liberal arts colleges worldwide are built on the American model.&lt;ref name="abroad-inside"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/02/16/liberalarts|date=2009-02-16|work=Inside Higher Ed|first=Elizabeth|last=Redden|accessdate=2015-01-08|title=The Liberal Arts, Abroad|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110064507/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/02/16/liberalarts|archivedate=2015-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Liberal Arts Alliance, which incorporates institutions on five continents, refers to itself as "an international, multilateral partnership of American style liberal arts institutions."&lt;ref name="glaa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://liberalartsalliance.org/home|title=Global Liberal Arts Alliance|accessdate=2015-01-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109025412/http://liberalartsalliance.org/home|archivedate=2015-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, liberal arts colleges from around the world formed the [[Global Liberal Arts Alliance]], an international consortium and "matching service" to help liberal arts colleges in different countries deal with their shared problems.&lt;ref name="glaa-inside"&gt;{{Cite news|work=Inside Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/06/liberalarts|accessdate=2015-01-08|date=2009-04-06|first=Elizabeth|last=Redden|title=A Global Liberal Arts Alliance|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110063627/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/06/liberalarts|archivedate=2015-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In North America===

{{main|Liberal arts colleges in the United States}}
The liberal arts college model took root in the United States in the 19th century, as institutions spread that followed the model of early schools like [[Harvard College|Harvard]], [[Yale College|Yale]], and [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], although none of these early American schools are regarded as liberal arts colleges today.{{sfn|Bonvillian|1996|p=21}}  These colleges served as a means of spreading a basically European cultural model across the new country.{{sfn|Bonvillian|1996|p=21}}  The model proliferated in the 19th century; some 212 small liberal arts colleges were established between 1850 and 1899.{{sfn|Bonvillian|1996|p=23}} As of 1987, there were about 540 liberal arts colleges in the United States.{{sfn|Clemmer|1997|p=73}}

The oldest liberal arts college in America is considered to be [[Washington College]], the first college chartered after American independence. Other prominent examples in the United States include the so-called [[Little Ivy]] colleges in [[New England]], the surviving predominantly female [[Seven Sisters colleges]] along the northeastern seaboard, the [[Claremont Colleges]] in [[Southern California]], and the [[Five Colleges of Ohio|Ohio Five]], but similar institutions are found all over the country. Most are private institutions, but a handful of public liberal arts schools exist (such as the [[University of Mary Washington]], and [[New Saint Andrews College]] in Moscow, Idaho).

Liberal arts colleges are also found in Canada, including [[Mount Allison University]], [[Bishop's University]], and [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]].

===In Europe===
[[File:Seminar Bard College Berlin, 2013.jpg|thumb|Class at [[Bard College Berlin]], in Europe]]

With the exception of pioneering institutions such as [[Franklin University Switzerland]], established as a Europe-based, US-style liberal arts college in 1969, [[Saint Louis University Madrid Campus]], established in 1967, and [[Richmond, The American International University in London]], established in 1972 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fus.edu/about-franklin/|title=About Franklin|work=Franklin University Switzerland Official Web Site|publisher=Franklin University Switzerland|accessdate=2014-07-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408064857/http://www.fus.edu/about-franklin|archivedate=2014-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; only recently have efforts been made to import the American liberal arts college model to continental Europe.

In the Netherlands, universities have opened constituent liberal arts colleges under the terminology "[[:Category:Liberal arts colleges at universities in the Netherlands|university college]]" since the late 1990s. This trend was spearheaded by Dutch sociologist [[Hans Adriaansens]], who was "frustrated with the large-scale climate of university education in the Netherlands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integral Development: Realising the Transformative Potential of Individuals |first1=Ronnie |last1=Lessem|last2=Schieffer|first2=Alexander|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMqaBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA478|page=478|isbn=9781409423539|year=2014|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch university colleges of this kind include [[Leiden University College The Hague]], [[University College Utrecht]], [[University College Maastricht]], [[Amsterdam University College]], [[University College Roosevelt]], [[Erasmus University College]], and [[Liberal Arts and Sciences at Tilburg University|University College Tilburg]].

Other liberal arts colleges in continental Europe include [[Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts]] in Slovakia, and [[Bard College Berlin]] and the University College Freiburg in Germany. Bard College Berlin was founded in Berlin in 1999 as the European College of Liberal Arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expatica.com/de/education/higher_education/berlins-sturdiest-ivory-tower-8661_10047.html?ppager=0 |title=Berlin's sturdiest ivory tower |publisher=Expatica.com |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217223928/http://www.expatica.com/de/education/higher_education/berlins-sturdiest-ivory-tower-8661_10047.html?ppager=0 |archivedate=17 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 it introduced a 4-year Bachelor of Arts program in Value Studies taught in English and leading to an interdisciplinary degree in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20090313110639526 |title=GERMANY: New approach to liberal studies |publisher=Universityworldnews.com |date=15 March 2009 |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although liberal arts colleges as such remain rare, liberal arts degree programs are beginning to establish themselves in Europe. For example, University College Dublin offers the degree, as does [[St. Mary's University College (Belfast)|St. Marys University College Belfast]], both institutions coincidentally on the island of Ireland. In 2010 the University of Winchester introduced its Modern Liberal Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winchester.ac.uk/mla |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525043134/http://www.winchester.ac.uk/Studyhere/Pages/ba-hons-modern-liberal-arts-philosophy.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 May 2017 |title=BA (Hons) Modern Liberal Arts |publisher=University of Winchester |accessdate=26 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; undergraduate program, the first of its kind in the UK. In 2012, [[University College London]] began its interdisciplinary [[UCL Arts and Sciences|Arts and Sciences]] BASc degree (which has kinship with the liberal arts model) with 80 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc |title=Arts and Sciences (BASc) programmes |publisher=University College London |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929031940/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc |archivedate=29 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[King's College London]] launched the BA Liberal Arts, which has a slant towards arts, humanities and social sciences subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KCL - About Liberal Arts|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/index.aspx|accessdate=15 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107074021/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/index.aspx|archivedate=7 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[New College of the Humanities]] also launched a new liberal education programme. The four-year bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at University College Freiburg is the first of its kind in Germany. It started in October 2012 with 78 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucf.uni-freiburg.de/las |title=Liberal Arts and Sciences Program (LAS) |publisher=''University College Freiburg |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820031719/http://www.ucf.uni-freiburg.de/las |archivedate=20 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Liberal Arts degree program in [[Sweden]] was established at [[Gothenburg]] University in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flov.gu.se/utbildning/grundniva/liberal-arts/ |title=Liberal Arts, Gothenburg University |publisher=Flov.gu.se |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102031149/http://www.flov.gu.se/utbildning/grundniva/liberal-arts/ |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a Liberal Arts Bachelor Programme at [[Uppsala University]]'s Campus [[Gotland]] in the autumn of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uu.se/utbildning/utbildningar/selma/program/?pKod=HLA1K&amp;lasar=13/14|title="Liberal Arts Programme at Uppsala University"|author=|date=|website=uu.se|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630163906/http://www.uu.se/utbildning/utbildningar/selma/program/?pKod=HLA1K&amp;lasar=13%2F14|archivedate=30 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liberal arts colleges in Italy include [[John Cabot University]] and [[The American University of Rome]] in Rome. The University College of North Staffordshire, founded in 1950 in the United Kingdom, was frequently referred to as the "Keele Experiment" because of its innovative curriculum and emphasis on a scholarly community resident together on campus. The college became [[Keele University]] in 1962 and continues to reflect many features of the liberal arts college model. It has been described as the closest example of a liberal arts college in the UK. This distinctiveness will be reinforced with the opening of the new Keele Institute of Liberal Arts and Sciences in 2016.

From September 2016 [[Chavagnes Studium]], a Liberal Arts centre in France will be offering a 2-year intensive BA in the Liberal Arts with a distinctively Catholic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chavagnes.org/studium |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003132808/http://chavagnes.org/studium/ |archivedate=2015-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]] in [[Hong Kong]] was established as a liberal arts college in the early 20th century, although it subsequently became a full-fledged [[university]]. [[Ginling College]] in Nanjing similarly followed the model of an American liberal arts college from its founding in 1915 until forced to conform with the Nationalist educational system in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of a Family Saga: Ginling College|first=Jin|last=Feng|year=2010|isbn=9781438429120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bc5vyn6OVEsC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Zhuhai City, [[Hong Kong Baptist University]] and [[Beijing Normal University]] opened [[United International College]], which adopted the liberal arts college education system.

===In the Middle East===
[[File:Shalem College building.jpg|thumb|[[Shalem College]] in Israel.]]

The liberal arts model has traditionally not been part of the educational landscape in the Middle East or North Africa.  [[Baghdad College]] has offered a liberal arts curriculum since the early 20th century, but despite its name it has never offered more than a [[Secondary school|high school]] education.  [[Effat University]] in Saudi Arabia, a women's institution, is a member of the Global Liberal Arts Alliance and The first liberal arts college in the Middle East is however generally considered to be [[Shalem College]] in Israel, established in 2013.

===In Africa===
[[File:Al Akhawayn Campus.jpg|thumb|[[Al Akhawayn University]] in Morocco.]]
Three institutions in Africa are members of the Global Liberal Arts Alliance: [[Al Akhawayn University]] in Morocco, [[American University of Cairo]] in Egypt, and [[American University of Nigeria]].  The Egyptian and Nigerian schools are universities with a liberal arts component, but Al Akhawayn was founded on the model of an American liberal arts college.

[[Ashesi University]] is a liberal arts college located in [[Berekuso, Ghana]], established in 2002. The school's president, [[Patrick Awuah]], described the school's mission as "educating a new generation of leaders in Africa who think ethically and who are problem solvers and have the ability and the desire to confront problems on the continent."&lt;ref name="ashesi-inside"&gt;{{Cite news|work=Inside Higher Ed|title=A Liberal Arts College Marks Five Years in Ghana|first=Elizabeth|last=Redden|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/10/19/ashesi|date=2007-10-19|accessdate=2015-01-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110121130/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/10/19/ashesi|archivedate=2015-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Marsh Chapel Experiment''', also called the "'''Good Friday Experiment'''", was a 1962 experiment conducted on [[Good Friday]] at [[Boston University]]'s [[Marsh Chapel]]. [[Walter N. Pahnke]], a graduate student in theology at [[Harvard Divinity School]], designed the experiment under the supervision of [[Timothy Leary]] and the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]].&lt;ref name="Pahnke 1966"/&gt; Pahnke's experiment investigated whether [[psilocybin]] (the active principle in [[psilocybin mushroom]]s) would act as a reliable [[entheogen]] in religiously predisposed subjects.&lt;ref name="Pahnke PhD" /&gt;

==Experiment==
Prior to the Good Friday service, graduate degree divinity student volunteers from the [[Boston]] area were randomly divided into two groups. In a [[double-blind]] experiment, half of the students received psilocybin, while a [[control group]] received a large dose of [[niacin]]. Niacin produces clear physiological changes and thus was used as an [[active placebo]]. In at least some cases, those who received the niacin initially believed they had received the psychoactive drug.&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|5}} However, the feeling of face flushing (turning red, feeling hot and tingly) produced by niacin subsided after about an hour after receiving the dose. However, the effects of the psilocybin intensified over the first few hours. 

Almost all of the members of the experimental group reported experiencing profound religious experiences, providing empirical support for the notion that [[psychedelic drug]]s can facilitate religious experiences. One of the participants in the experiment was religious scholar [[Huston Smith]], who would become an author of several textbooks on [[comparative religion]]. He later described his experience as "the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced".&lt;ref name= "Smith 2000"/&gt;

==Doblin's follow-up==
In a 25-year follow-up to the experiment, all of the subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of "a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life".&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|13}} Psychedelic researcher [[Rick Doblin]] considered Pahnke's original study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the [[double-blind]] procedure, and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire. Nevertheless, Doblin said that Pahnke's study cast "a considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non-drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long-term effects".&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|24}} A similar sentiment was expressed by clinical psychologist William A. Richards, who in 2007 stated "[psychedelic] mushroom use may constitute one technology for evoking revelatory experiences that are similar, if not identical, to those that occur through so-called spontaneous alterations of brain chemistry."&lt;ref name="Richards 2008"/&gt;

==Griffiths' study==
In 2002 (published in 2006), a more rigorously controlled version of this experiment was conducted at [[Johns Hopkins University]] by [[Roland R. Griffiths]], yielding similar results.&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2006"/&gt; In a 14-month follow-up to this study, over half of the participants rated the experience among the top five most meaningful spiritual experiences in their lives, and considered the experience to have increased their personal well-being and life satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2008"/&gt;

'''Men's studies''', often called '''men and masculinities''' in academic settings, is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[men]], [[masculinity]], [[feminism]], [[gender]], and [[politics]]. It draws upon [[feminist theory]] in order to analyze different ideologies  having to do with masculinity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allan|first=Jonathan | title = Phallic affect, or why men's rights activists have feelings | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 22&amp;ndash;41 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X15574338 |date= April 2016 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X15574338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through such analysis to examine the multiple ''masculinities'' contained in the idea of masculinity itself. Men's studies also academically examine what it means to be a man in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Bennett|first=Jessica |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/fashion/masculinities-studies-stonybrook-michael-kimmel.html?_r=0|title=A master's degree in...masculinity?|date=August 8, 2015|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
As a relatively new field of study, men's studies was formed largely in response to, and as a critique of, an emerging [[men's rights]] movement, and as such, has been taught in academic settings only since the 1970s.  In many universities, men's studies is a correlation to [[women's studies]] or part of a larger [[gender studies]] program, and as such its faculty tends to be sympathetic to, or engaged in, advocacy of [[feminist]] politics. Men's studies works with feminist studies to question the relationship that men have with patriarchal power throughout different temporal and historical times.&lt;ref name="Gurfinkel"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gurfinkel|first=Helena|title=Masculinity studies: what is it, and why would a feminist care?|url=https://siuewmst.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/masculinity-studies-what-is-it-and-why-would-a-feminist-care/|website=siuewmst.wordpress.com|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University|SIUE]] Women's Studies Program via [[WordPress]]|date=December 6, 2012|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of plural ''masculinities'' was proposed by [[R.W. Connell]] in her influential book ''Masculinities'' (1995);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R. W. | author-link = R.W. Connell | title = Masculinities | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780745614694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the academic field is today often known as ''men and masculinities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aboim | first = Sofia | title = Plural masculinities: the remaking of the self in private life | page = 5 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781315600901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In contrast to the discipline of [[masculine psychology]], men's studies programs and courses often include contemporary discussions of men's rights, [[feminist theory]], [[queer theory]], [[matriarchy]], [[patriarchy]], and more generally, what proponents describe as the social, historical, and cultural constructions of [[Man|men]]. They often discuss the issues surrounding [[male privilege]], seen as evolving into more subtle forms rather than disappearing in the modern era.

== Construction of Masculinity ==
When pursuing masculinity studies, many scholars began explaining how masculinity is a [[Social constructionism|social construction]]. [[Michael Kimmel]], a prominent scholar in the field of masculinity studies, writes extensively on manhood and its definition. He does this starting with the 19th century in America, when masculinity began to be defined through proving oneself as a man. As a result, the political arena, workplace, family, and whole world was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kimmel |editor1-first=Michael | editor-link = Michael Kimmel |title= The politics of manhood |publisher= [[Temple University Press]] |location= Philadelphia |isbn= 9781566393652 |year=1995 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ksbyvqKZL2MC }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change constructed "[[hegemonic masculinity]]", or the "practice that allowed men's dominance over women to continue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&amp;ndash;30 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; or the stereotypical definition of masculinity that many think of initially. In unpacking masculinity, the construction is understood [[Intersectionality|intersectionally]], looking at the historical, cultural, temporal, political, and psychological ways in which the definition of masculinity is created.&lt;ref name="Gurfinkel" /&gt; Because of the intersectional lens used to study masculinity, it becomes clear that there are multiple masculinities because of the various experiences that different histories, cultures, and times produce.

== Organizations ==
The [[American Men's Studies Association]] (AMSA) traces the roots of an organized field of men's studies to the early 1980s and the work of scholars involved in an [[Sexism|anti-sexist]] organization called the Men's Studies Task Group (MSTG) of the National Organization for Changing Men (NOCM) which included Martin Acker, Shepherd Bliss, [[Harry Brod]], Sam Femiano, Martin Fiebert, and [[Michael Messner]]. However, men's studies classes also pre-date NOCM, and a small number were taught in various colleges across the United States throughout the 1970s. Conferences such as the Men and Masculinity conferences sparked the creation of newsletters and journals, such as the ''Men's Studies Newsletter'' (and its successor, ''Men’s Studies Review''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Men’s Studies Review (journal) | publisher = American Men's Studies Association (AMSA) | location = Harriman, Tennessee | lccn = 93648850 | issn = 0890-9741}}&lt;/ref&gt; pertaining to the growing field of men's studies. These became prime resources for those interested in the field, providing news, bibliographies, and firsthand experiences. Following the newsletters and journals came the [[Men's Studies Press]], thus moving the academic field of masculinity studies to books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Doyle|first=James. A|last2=Femiano|first2=Sam | title = A history of the Men's Studies Press and its Association with the American Men's Studies Association | journal = [[The Journal of Men's Studies]], special issue: AMSA at 20 | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 24&amp;ndash;33 | publisher = [[Sage Publishing|Sage]] | doi = 10.3149/jms.2101.24 | date = January 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3149/jms.2101.24 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

When NOCM changed its name to the [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.nomas.org/ | website = nomas.org | publisher = [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS) }}&lt;/ref&gt; the MSTG became the Men's Studies Association (MSA). The MSA was an explicitly pro-feminist group, and those who felt this was too constraining split away several years later to form the American Men's Studies Association (AMSA).

== Criticism ==
A range of criticisms have been made of the separation between "men's studies" and "gender studies". For example, Timothy Laurie and Anna Hickey-Moody insist that "[any] atomisation of masculinity studies as distinct from gender studies, feminist inquiry or queer studies must be understood as provisional and hazardous rather than as the result of absolute differences in the phenomena being investigated or expertise required".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laurie | first1 = Timothy | last2 = Hickey-Moody | first2 = Anna | title = Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;10 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912564 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Joyce E. Canaan and Christine Griffin described their suspicions of The New Men's Studies (TNMS): the emergence of conferences and books on men and masculinity during a time of political and financial cuts to further education and higher education in the UK, "Is it a coincidence that TNMS is being constructed in the present context as a source of potential research, publishing deals, and (even more) jobs for the already-well-paid boys holding prestigious positions?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Canaan | first1 = Joyce E. | last2 = Griffin | first2 = Christine | chapter = The new men's studies: part of the problem or part of the solution | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yC5HBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208 | editor-last1 = Morgan | editor-first1 = D.

==Work and care==
Men's studies are notably concerned with challenging gendered arrangements of work and care, and the male breadwinner role, and policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers, as a tool of changing gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bjørnholt | first = Margunn | authorlink1= Margunn Bjørnholt | title = Changing men, changing times; fathers and sons from an experimental gender equality study | journal = [[The Sociological Review]] | volume = 62 | issue = 2  | pages = 295&amp;ndash;315 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-954X.12156 | date = May 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-954X.12156 }} [http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Changing-men-changing-times-fathers-and-sons-from-an-experimental-gender-equality-study.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Highlighted the need for a better reference evidencing that McLuhan actually coined the term.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4877">As coined in the writings of [[Marshall McLuhan]], '''metamedia''' referred to new relationships between [[form and content]] in the development of new [[technologies]] and new [[wiktionary:media#Etymology_2|media]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964) Marshall McLuhan&lt;/ref&gt; [REFERENCE NEEDED: The book Understanding Media doesn't once use the word metamedia, meta-media, meta-medium or metamedium.]  

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the term was taken up by writers such as [[Douglas Rushkoff]] and [[Lev Manovich]]. Contemporary metamedia, such as at Stanford, has been expanded to describe, "a short circuit between the [[academy]], the [[art studio]] and [[information science]] exploring media and their archaeological materiality."&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; Metamedia utilizes [[new media]] and focuses on collaboration across traditional fields of study, melding everything from  [[improvisational]] theatre and performance art, to [[Agile software development|agile, adaptive software development]] and [[smart mobs]].

==Development==
{{rquote|right|The new avant-garde is no longer concerned with seeing or representing the world in new ways but rather with accessing and using in new ways previously accumulated media. In this respect new media is post-media or meta-media, as it uses old media as its primary material.|[[Lev Manovich]]}}
While [[hypermedia]] was coined a year later in 1965 by a programmer to refer to [[file system]]s of [[multimedia]], the term metamedia was coined in 1964, referring to the theoretical effects of mass media. McLuhan, like his teacher [[Harold Innis]], an earlier theorist of [[communication theory]], saw communication as central to social systems. 

More recent distinctions between old and [[new media]] have meant that metamedia becomes used to describe modernity and art more than systems.

===As an academic field of study===
[[Stanford University]] Humanities Lab and [[MIT]] currently run research labs investigating metamedia.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metamedia.stanford.edu/ |title=metamedia.stanford.edu |work=Metamedia: a collaboratory at Stanford University |accessdate=2008-05-20 |publisher=Affiliated with Stanford Humanities Lab |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604022515/http://metamedia.stanford.edu/ |archivedate=2004-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metamedia.mit.edu/ |title=metamedia.mit.edu |accessdate=2008-05-20 |publisher=MIT |work=Metamedia: transforming humanities education at MIT }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MIT lab's mission is to provide a flexible online environment for creating and sharing [[rich media]] documents for learning on core humanities subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metamedia.mit.edu/overview.html |title=What is Metamedia? |work=metamedia.mit.edu |accessdate=2008-05-20 |publisher=MIT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20041204115327/http://metamedia.mit.edu/overview.html |archivedate=2004-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by [[Kurt Fendt]] (co-Principal Investigator and Manager of the Metamedia project) and [[Henry Jenkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/13380/ |title=Humanities Go Digital: Innovative multimedia programs give students new ways to study languages, literature, and the arts. |accessdate=2008-05-20 |first=Megan |last=Vandre |work=[[Technology Review]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanford's lab is principally facilitated by [[Michael Shanks]] with other collaborators, including [[Howard Rheingold]] and [[Fred Turner (academic)]]. In its mission statement, it describes itself as a "creative studio and laboratory space for experimenting and taking risks...a democratic and collaborative assembly of archaeologists, anthropologists, classicists, communications experts, new media practitioners, performance artists, sociologists, software engineers, technoscientists, and anyone else who wants to join."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanitieslab.stanford.edu/Metamedia/463 |work=Mission statement |publisher=Metamedia at Stanford |title=humanitieslab.stanford.edu |accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent project is Life Squared (aka Life to the Second Power), an animated archive of the work of artist [[Lynn Hershman]] in the online world [[Second Life]]. Life Squared is one endeavor of The Presence Project, a live metamedia [[performance art]] project within the Metamedia lab.&lt;ref&gt;[http://presence.stanford.edu:3455/Collaboratory/346 Life Squared] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515212351/http://presence.stanford.edu:3455/Collaboratory/346 |date=2008-05-15 }} The Presence Project stanford.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti''', "New Academy of Fine Arts", also known as '''NABA''', is a privately run university in [[Milan]], [[Lombardy]], Italy. It has approximately 3000 students,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naba.it/why-choose-naba/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom are from abroad; it participates in the [[Erasmus Programme]].

==History==

NABA was founded in Milan in 1980.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1994 the Nuova Accademia received one of the forty "Ambrogino" certificates of civic merit awarded each year by the [[Comune]] of Milan.&lt;ref name=ambrogio&gt;[http://www.comune.milano.it/dseserver/ambrogini/attach/elenco%20CIVICHE%20BENEMERENZE_storiche.pdf Benemerenze Civiche (elenco aggiornato all'anno 2011)] (in Italian). Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 NABA also began hosting a “node”, or center linked to the [[University of Plymouth]]’s Planetary-Collegium research platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/273 Planetary-Collegium]&lt;/ref&gt; offering various PhD programs in the arts and technology.

NABA was bought by Bastogi Spa of Milan in 2002. In December 2009 Bastogi sold it to [[Laureate Education]] of [[Baltimore]], Maryland, for €22 million.&lt;ref name=bastogi&gt;[http://www.bastogi.com/it/storia/ Storia]. Bastogi Spa. (in Italian) "History".

(in Italian) "Precious schools of design sold to an American colossus". Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation and International Programs==

NABA is listed by the [[Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca]], the Italian ministry of education, as a "legally recognized academy" in the AFAM classification of schools of music, art and dance that are considered equivalent to a traditional university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afam.miur.it/argomenti/istituzioni/accademie-di-belle-arti-legalmente-riconosciute.aspx/ AFAM, Alta Formazione Artistica, Musicale e Coreutica: Accademie di belle arti legalmente riconosciute].

'''Pan Britannica Industries Ltd'''  ('''PBI''') was a small company which had 400 employees. It was a household and agrochemical formulation company based at Britannica House, Stewardstone Road, [[Waltham Cross]]  and with a distribution presence in [[Wisbech]] in [[Cambridgeshire]]. PBI was, in common with many other UK household names, both a manufacturer and marketing organisation for both agricultural and horticultural products.

PBI produced many agro-chemical formulations that were popular with farmers in many parts of the globe. However It was best known for its product [[Baby Bio]], a liquid plant food that came in a notable small perfume-shaped bottle. Other major products by PBI are the Expert range of books, such as the ''Garden Expert'', ''House Plant Expert'', ''Greenhouse Expert'' etc. written by, [[D.G. Hessayon|Dr D.G. Hessayon]], who later became chairman of PBI. The motto of these books is "''Easy-to-follow advice and information you can trust''". With this in mind they are colourful, informative, and contain accurate product information and literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourhouseplants.com/guides/hessayon&lt;/ref&gt; The Company adopted this approach throughout all its products and brands. Such an approach was in no small way attributable to Dr. Hessayon, who was highly regarded within and outside both Agriculture and Horticulture, for many years.

The company was sold to the [[Sumitomo]] corporation in the late eighties, but continued to be run largely by the same management. It is now part of the [[Bayer]] Corporation, which markets the best of its brands. The Waltham Abbey site has been redeveloped into a housing estate. There is still a presence in Waltham Cross called PBI Home &amp; Garden Ltd in the same building, now renamed Durkan house.

Similar UK operations were run by ICI Agriculture, Murphy Chemical Co, Allbright &amp; Wilson (Farm Protection), Shell Chemical Company, BP and Fisons. Some small scale horticultural products were also packaged at the Waltham Abbey plant, including Draza Slug Pellets for Bayer Agriculture (now owner of the Bio Trade Mark). Companies such as [[Elanco]], [[DuPont]], [[Rohm &amp; Haas]] and [[Stauffer]] actually manufactured, packaged, and labelled the vast majority of Chemical marketed by PBI.

Many of the products which PBI marketed gave it, a very small player, a strong market presence on the global agrochemicals scene. Due to legislation, many of the products have been discontinued in [[Western world|the west]] due to long-term human health issues, but were considered safe and manufactured by other companies around the world. Now only the benign formulas like Baby Bio have continued availability.

Dr Hessayon still writes Expert books but these are now published by [[Transworld (company)|Transworld]].

== Cancer allegations ==

The company did have one negative brush with fame when its formulation plant in Waltham Abbey was alleged to be at the centre and therefore the cause of a cancer hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcgraw-hill.co.uk/openup/chapters/0335218423.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This was highlighted by Storyline, an investigative television programme by [[Carlton Television]], in early 1993. Reports of an unusual occurrence of cancer around the plant and subsequent legal action taken by the residents were the basis for this programme, which was followed by several articles in the press.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/inquiry-is-sought-over-pesticide-cancer-fears-1470365.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations were rejected by the then managing director, Mr. Jeremy Tear. No official body or agency then charged with the oversight of activities at the Waltham Abbey site had raised any concerns connected with the activity or safety procedures at the plant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9360">In social sciences, '''participation inequality''' consists of difference between levels of participation of various groups in certain activities. Common examples include:
* differing levels of participation in democratic, electoral politics, by social class, race, gender, etc.
* differing levels of participation in online communities as described by [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen |first=Jakob |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/participation_inequality.html |title=Participation Inequality: Encouraging More Users to Contribute |publisher=Useit.com |date=2006-10-09 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In politics, participation inequality typically affects "the kinds of individuals, such as the young, the poor and those with little formal education"&lt;ref name="enumtoNRE"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irpp.org/choices/archive/vol9no7.pdf|format=PDF|title=From Enumeration to the National Register of Electors: An Account and an Evaluation|last=Black|first=Jerome H.|journal=Choices|publisher=Institute for Research on Public Policy|volume=9|number=7|issn=0711-0677|date=7 August 2003|accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who tend to not take the initiative to participate in electoral and related events. State enumeration, such as was done in Canada before the implementation of the [[National Register of Electors]] in 1996, "worked to augment voter turnout among all segments of society and thus mitigated a natural tendency toward participation inequality in electoral politics".&lt;ref name="enumtoNRE" /&gt;

== Political Participation Inequality ==
'''Political participation inequality''' refers to how populations differ in political participation when sorted by various characteristics. Most often these groupings are by social class, race, gender, or ethnicity. Widespread political participation inequality often describes when various groups are left out of the political sphere or excluded from various political rights.

Participation inequality usually helps political theorists determine where democracies fail or when political institutions are not democratically responsive. When political systems are too unequal in terms of political participation, it most generally means that there is a breakdown in the ability of all citizens to politically deliberate to distribute various scarce resources, implement comprehensive public policy, or enact needed social reforms. Nations with high amounts of participation inequality are generally characterized as undemocratic although there are certain nations, like India, where low participation inequality has not helped the democratic responsiveness of Indian institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahuja, Chhibber|first=Amit, Pradeep|date=2012|title=Why the Poor Vote in India: "If I Don't Vote, I Am Dead to the State"|url=|journal=Studies in Comparative International Development|volume=|pages=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Dahl ===
[[File:Robert_Dahl's_Two-Dimensions.png|thumb|Robert Dahl's two dimensions for evaluating democracies/polarchies]]
In his 1971 paper ''Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition'', [[Robert A. Dahl|Robert Dahl]] provided a basic framework to evaluate democracies or polyarchies (nearly/almost full democracies) based on their participation inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition|last=Dahl|first=Robert|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=New Haven and London|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that there are two dimensions: public contestation – the various rights and procedures guaranteed to citizens – and inclusiveness – how accessible these rights are to all citizens. More fully, public contestation describes the necessary functions for a liberal democracy: a competitive political atmosphere, ability to run for office, right to vote, right to assembly, etc. Inclusiveness describes what portion of the population is able to enjoy these rights and procedures.

Participation inequality is usually represented along the dimension of inclusiveness. So, if a nation were to allow only short people to vote, this political system would have a certain level of public contestation – the right to vote being available – and a certain dimension of inclusiveness – only short people being able to enjoy this right. This system of evaluating democracies enables comparisons of political regimes based on participation inequality by comparing inclusiveness between equally publicly contestable political systems.

=== Causes of Political Participation ===

==== Dahlian Causes ====
Using Dahl’s framework, the first cause of participation inequality can be rooted in a political system’s public policy or in the Dahlian dimension of inclusiveness. Policies that exclude groups based on ethnic identity such as old [[Apartheid South Africa|apartheid]] South Africa or Iranian exclusion of Sunni political parties best conveys systemic political exclusion that is rooted in a regime’s citizenship requirements or public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2016/04/29/4452814.htm|title=Political Identity and the Problem of Democratic Exclusion|date=2016-04-29|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Expansion of Dahl ====
[[File:Expansion_of_Dahl's_Theory.png|thumb|An expansion on Robert Dahl's two dimensions by adding a possible third dimension: institutions]]
The more insidious cause of participation inequality stems from a third dimension that has been recently added to Dahl’s two-dimensional evaluation of political systems: institutions. In this framework, '''institutions''' implement political rights and procedures guaranteed by the state. Institutional causes for participation inequality can include literacy tests, extensive citizenship requirements, sparse voting booths in rural or poor areas, and a lack of public transportation. These all affect the ability of citizens to properly exercise guaranteed rights like voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramakrishnan, Espenshade|first=S. Karthick, Thomas J.|date=September 2001|title=Immigrant Incorporation and Political Participation in the United States|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-7379.2001.tb00044.x/full|journal=International Migration Review|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional causes of participation inequality can also be mitigated or exacerbated by cultural norms. Most often high voter turnout usually is hailed as a marker for a democratically responsive nation; however, in [[India]] “the turnout rate among the poor is almost as high as for those who are either middle class or rich. A detailed study of voter participation reported for the 2009 national elections shows that voter participation rates do not seem to vary by income status at all…Recent studies report similar findings from Africa and Latin America (Bratton 2008; Boot &amp; Seligson 2008)”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of these studies conclude that in developing democracies voting acts as a reassurance of social status or worth in the eyes of the state. This cultural norm has not translated to more democratically responsive institutions in that “the governments created by these elections are known to neglect the interests of the poor and treat them disrespectfully compared to other income groups”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nations like India are considered to be exceptions to the general rule that economic status has some bearing on voter participation.

==== Economic and Educational Inequality ====
Economic inequality and educational inequality have often been pointed to as common culprits for political participation inequality. In large part, these two types of inequality are often created and reiterated by political institutions, but most political theorists differentiate these causes for political participation as separate, largely because they are not fully solved by changes in political institutions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solt|first=Frederick|date=2008|title=Economic Inequality and Democratic Political Engagement|jstor=25193796|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=52|issue=1|pages=48–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the outcomes of political institutions highly vary from regime to regime, most of the literature finds that high amounts of economic inequality in developed countries depress voter turnout for poorer individuals and increase voter turnout for more affluent individuals (this depends on social cohesion of societies, correlating negatively with affluent political participation when economic inequality is high).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other literature finds that educational inequality depresses voter turnout depending on one’s income level and perceived relative educational status (how one perceives one’s social status and others’ education levels).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persson|first=Mikael|date=March 2010|title=The Effects of Economic and Educational Inequality on Political Participation|url=https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/a47c0359-276e-4a48-9c16-c46bd345968d.pdf|journal=University of Gothenburg Department of Political Science|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paubhā''' ([[Devanagari]]: पौभा) is a traditional religious painting made by the [[Newar]] people of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chitrakar |first=Madan |title=Nepali Art |publisher=Teba-Chi Studies Centre |location=Kathmandu |year=2012 |pages=35–52 |chapter=Paubha Art|isbn=978-9937-2-4933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paubhas depict deities, [[mandala]]s or monuments, and are used to help the practitioner meditate. The [[Tibetan art|Tibetan]] equivalent is known as [[Thangka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, A.W. and Stahl, Anne Vergati (1979) ''Newar Art: Nepalese Art during the Malla Period.'' New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most paubhas show [[Buddhist]] subjects, but a few have [[Hindu]] themes. The paintings are made to earn religious merit both for the artist and the patron. Newar Buddhists commission artists to paint paubhas which are displayed during festivals and other special occasions. The traditional painters of paubhas are the [[Chitrakar]] caste who are known as Pun (पुं) in [[Nepal Bhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;Chitrakar, Madan (2000) ''Tej Bahadur Chitrakar: Icon of a Transition.''

==History==

A paubha of [[Amitabha Buddha]] at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|Los Angeles County Museum]] is believed to be the earliest specimen which is done in a style dating from the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

 ([[Nepal Sambat]] 485). It is a specimen of the skill of Newar artists that made them sought-after throughout the Himalayan region and as far as China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2011/c-welch-part-ii-l11228/overview.html| title = The Stuart Cary Welch Collection | work = | publisher = Sotheby's| year=| accessdate =24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newar artists and merchants took the paubha art to Tibet from which the Tibetan thangka evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| url =http://rmanyc.org/exhibitions/view/682| title =The Nepalese Legacy in Tibetan Painting| work =| publisher =Rubin Museum of Art| year =| accessdate =25 September 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20111120102024/http://www.rmanyc.org/exhibitions/view/682| archivedate =20 November 2011| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The painting==

Paubhas are painted on a rectangular piece of canvas. It is prepared by applying a mixture of buffalo glue and white clay on it. The surface is then rubbed with a smooth stone to give it polish. The painting is done according to the rules and dimensions handed down by tradition, and artists cannot exercise their creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pradhan|first=Ujjwal |title=A heritage in peril
|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/07/09/features/a-heritage-in-peril/210299/ |date=10 July 2010 | accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The paint is made from minerals and plants. Gold and silver paint are also used on paubhas. The eyes of the deity are painted when the rest of the painting has been completed, and is known as "mikhā chāyekegu" (opening the eyes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Gurung (Pradhan)| first =Renuka| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/13/paubha-painting-the-traditional-art-of-nepal.html| title =Paubha Painting: The Traditional Art of Nepal| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brocade is sewn to the edge of the paubha to make a frame for display.

From a composition perspective, the surface of Paubha is usually occupied of a large figure in the center that is placed inside a shrine and surrounded by registers of smaller figures on the sides; the background is usually filled in with natural elements such as rocks rendered in abstract patterns. The color is often deep and subdued with subtle shadings of the figures and exquisite renderings of details that are the hallmarks of early Nepalese paubhas&lt;ref&gt;Huu Phuoc Le, Le Huu Phuoc, '''Buddhist Architecture '''', Grafikol, 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==

An annual exhibition of statues of [[Dipankara Buddha]] and paubhas is held in sacred courtyards in the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. The ceremony is known as Bahidyah Bwayegu (बहीद्यः ब्वयेगु), and is held during the month of [[Gunla]]. Gunla, which corresponds to August, is a holy month for Newar Buddhists. Groups of devotees led by musical bands make a tour of the courtyards to view the displays. In recent times, the traditional exhibitions have become fewer and shorter due to fear of art thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15492">'''Progress tests''' are longitudinal, feedback oriented [[educational assessment]] tools for the evaluation of development and sustainability of cognitive knowledge during a learning process. A progress test is a written knowledge exam (usually involving multiple choice questions) that is usually administered to all students in the "A" program at the same time and at regular intervals (usually twice to four times yearly) throughout the entire academic program. The test samples the complete knowledge domain expected of new graduates upon completion of their courses, regardless of the year level of the student). The differences between students’ knowledge levels show in the test scores; the further a student has progressed in the curriculum the higher the scores. As a result, these resultant scores provide a longitudinal, repeated measures, curriculum-independent assessment of the objectives (in knowledge) of the entire programme.&lt;ref name=MT18_103&gt;van der Vleuten CPM, Verwijnen GM, Wijnen WHFW. 1996.

==History==
Since its inception in the late 1970s at both [[Maastricht University]] &lt;ref name=MT18_103/&gt; and the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] &lt;ref&gt;Arnold L, Willoughby TL. 1990. The quarterly profile examination. Academic Medicine 65(8):515–516.&lt;/ref&gt; independently, the progress test of applied knowledge has been increasingly used in medical and health sciences programs across the globe. They are well established and increasingly used in [[medical education]] in both undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. They are used formatively and summatively.

==Use in academic programs==
The progress test is currently used by national progress test consortia in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, D. B., Holtzman, K. Z., Butler, A., Langer, M. M., Nelson, M. V., Chow, J. W.

The progress test serves several important functions in academic programs. Considerable empirical evidence from medical schools in the Netherlands, Canada, United Kingdom and Ireland, as well postgraduate medical studies and schools in dentistry and psychology have shown that the longitudinal feature of the progress test provides a unique and demonstrable measurement of the growth and effectiveness of students’ knowledge acquisition throughout their course of study

M., Scherpbier, A. J. J. A., &amp; van der Vleuten, C. P. M. (2002). Growth of medical knowledge. Medical Education, 36, 711-717.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, this information can be consistently used for diagnostic, remedial and prognostic teaching and learning interventions.  In the Netherlands, these interventions have been aided by the provision of a web-based results feedback system known as ProF &lt;ref&gt;Muijtjens, A. M. M., Timmermans, I., Donkers, J., Peperkamp, R., Medema, H., Cohen-Schotanus, J., et al. (2010). Flexible electronic feedback using the virtues of progress testing. Medical Teacher, 32, 491-495.&lt;/ref&gt; in which students can compare their results with their peers across different total and subtotal score perspectives, both across and within universities.

Additionally, the longitudinal data can serve as a transparent quality assurance measure for program reviews by providing an evaluation of the extent to which a school is meeting its curriculum objectives.&lt;ref name=MT18_103/&gt;&lt;ref name=MT32_503/&gt;&lt;ref name=MT27_514&gt;Verhoeven, B. H., Snellen-Balendong, H. A. M., Hay, I. T., Boon, J. M., Van Der Linde, M. J., Blitz-Lindeque, J. J., et al. (2005). The versatility of progress testing assessed in an international context: a start for benchmarking global standardization? Medical Teacher, 27(6), 514-520.&lt;/ref&gt; The test also provides more reliable data for high-stakes assessment decisions by using measures of continuous learning rather than a one-shot method (Schuwirth, 2007).  Inter-university progress testing collaborations provide a means of improving the cost-effectiveness of assessments by sharing a larger pool of items, item writers, reviewers, and administrators. The collaborative approach adopted by the Dutch and other consortia has enabled the progress test to become a benchmarking instrument by which to measure the quality of educational outcomes in knowledge. The success of the progress test in these ways has led to consideration of developing an international progress test.&lt;ref name=MT27_514/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schauber, S., &amp; Nouns, Z. B. (2010). Using the cumulative deviation method for cross-institutional benchmarking in the Berlin progress test. Medical Teacher, 32, 471-475.&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits for all main stakeholders in a medical or health sciences programme make the progress test an appealing tool to invest resources and time for inclusion in an assessment regime. This attractiveness is demonstrated by its increasingly widespread use in individual medical education institutions and inter-faculty consortia around the world, and by its use for national and international benchmarking practices.

==Advantages==
Progress tests provide a rich source of information: the comprehensive nature in combination with the cross-sectional and longitudinal design offers a wealth of information both for individual learners as well as for curriculum evaluations.&lt;ref name=MT18_103/&gt;

Progress Testing fosters knowledge retention: the repeated testing of the same comprehensive domain of knowledge means that there is no point testing facts that could be remembered if studied the night before. Long term knowledge and knowledge retention is fostered because item content remains relevant long after the knowledge has been learned. Progress Testing removes the need for resit examinations: every new test occasion is a renewed opportunity to demonstrate growth of knowledge.

Progress Testing allows early detection of high achievers: some learners perform (far) beyond the expected level of their phase in training (e.g. they might have had relevant previous other training) and, depending on their performance, individual and more speeded pathways through the curriculum could be offered.

Progress Testing brings stability in assessment procedures: curriculum changes, changes in content, have no consequence for the progress test provided the end outcomes are unchanged.

Progress Testing provides excellent benchmarking opportunities: progress tests are not limited to a single school nor to PBL curricula and evaluations can easily be done to compare graduates and the effectiveness of different curriculum approaches.

==Disadvantages==
Naturally, there are disadvantages. The required resources for test development and scoring and the need for a central organization are two very important ones.

Scoring,&lt;ref&gt;Muijtjens AM, Mameren HV, Hoogenboom RJ, Evers JL, van der Vleuten CP. 1999. The effect of a ‘don’t know’ option on test scores: Number-right and formula scoring compared. Medical Education 33(4):267–275.&lt;/ref&gt; psychometric procedures &lt;ref&gt;Shen L. 2000. Progress testing for postgraduate medical education: A four year experiment of American College of Osteopathic Surgeons Resident Examinations. Advances in Health Sciences Education: Theory and Practice 5(2):117–129&lt;/ref&gt; for reducing test difficulty variation and standard setting procedures &lt;ref&gt;Verhoeven BH, Snellen-Balendong HA, Hay IT, Boon JM, van der Linde MJ, Blitz-Lindeque JJ, Hoogenboom RJI, Verwijnen GM, Wijnen WHFW, Scherpbier AJJA, et al. 2005. The versatility of progress testing assessed in an international context: A start for benchmarking global standardization? Medical Teacher 27(6):514–520&lt;/ref&gt; are more complex in progress testing.

Finally progress tests do not work in heterogeneous programs with early specialization (like in many health sciences programs). In more homogenous programs, such as most medical programs, they work really well and pay off in relation to driving learning and use of resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">{{Rhetoric}}
'''Pronuntiatio''' was the discipline of delivering [[Public speaking|speeches]] in Western classical [[rhetoric]]. It is one of the five canons of classical rhetoric (the others being [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[elocutio]], and [[memoria]]) that concern the crafting and delivery of speeches. In literature the equivalent of ancient ''pronuntiatio'' is the [[recitation]] of [[epic poetry|epics]] (Aris. Po. 26.2.).&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Lausberg, David E. Orton, R. Dean Anderson, ''Handbook of literary rhetoric: a foundation for literary study'', BRILL, 1998, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt;

As with ''memoria'', the canon that dealt with the memorization of speeches, ''pronuntiatio'' was not extensively written about in Classical texts on rhetoric. Its importance declined even more, once the written word became the focus of rhetoric, although after the eighteenth century it again saw more interest in the works of men such as [[Gilbert Austin]].

Rhetoricians laid down guidelines on the use of the voice and gestures (''actio'') in the delivery of oratory. There were instructions on the proper modulation of the voice (volume and pitch), as well as the phrasing, pace, and emphasis of speech. Also covered were the physical aspects of oration: stance, gestures, posture, and facial expressions. There was also the concept of ''exercitatio'' (or practice exercises) that enabled speakers to both memorize their speeches and practice their delivery.

This excerpt from [[Quintilian]]'s ''Institutio oratoria'' provides an example of the types of advice provided by rhetoricians:
:"The head, being the chief member of the body, has a corresponding importance in delivery, serving not merely to produce graceful effect, but to illustrate our meaning as well. To secure grace it is essential that the head should be carried naturally and erect. For a droop suggests humility, while if it be thrown back it seems to express arrogance, if inclined to one side it gives an impression of languor, while if it is held too stiffly and rigidly it appears to indicate a rude and savage temper." (''Institutio oratoria'', XI iii 68-69, translated by H. E. Butler, Loeb Classical Library, 1922)

While the content, structure, and style of oration were (and continue to be) the most important elements of oratory, effective delivery enhances its persuasive power, and poor delivery detracts greatly from its intended effect.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Delivery is based on the technology of the times.
During Cicero's time, delivery was predominantly speaking. Written delivery developed because of the written language, and now delivery is both spoken and written. Technology has taken away the distinctions between written and oral delivery.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}
 
Written discourse did not become important until reading became more common.  Because the ancients did not use punctuation, their writing consisted of one long stream of words called ''scriptio continua''.  
During the editing process, modern rhetors must go through three stages: correctness rule, formatting, and presentation.  
Writers face more problems than speakers because they must be conscious of spelling, punctuation, and grammar.  
Punctuation is useful in written discourse because it marks the end of a thought and allows the reader to pause and process the information.
Visual rhetoric focuses on images and how words function as images.
The delivery of ocular demonstration is the use of words to produce mental images in the audience.  Textual presentation allows the writer to grab the reader's attention before actually reading the text based on the appearance of the text.  The invention of word processors has allowed writers to enhance the appearance of their text and use effects to put emphasis on certain words or thoughts.
''Delivery'' refers not only to written or spoken language, but also to photographs, paintings, or movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowley|first1=Sharon|last2=Hawhee|first2=Debra|title=Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students|date=2004|publisher=Pearson Longman|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychology, philosophy and physiology''' ('''PPP''') was a [[academic degree|degree]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. It was Oxford's
first psychology degree, beginning in 1947, but admitted its last students in October 2010. It has been, in part, replaced by '''philosophy, psychology and linguistics''' (PPL, in which students usually study two of three subjects).

PPP covered the study of thought and behaviour from the differing points of view of [[psychology]], [[physiology]] and [[philosophy]]. Psychology includes [[social interaction]], [[learning]], [[child development]], mental illness and [[information processing]]. Physiology considers the organization of the brain and body of [[mammal]]s and [[human]]s, from the molecular level to the organism as a whole. Philosophy is concerned with [[ethics]], [[knowledge]], the [[mind]], etc.

A '''singing telegram''' is a message that is delivered by an [[artist]] in a musical form.  Singing telegrams are historically linked to normal [[telegram]]s, but tend to be humorous. Sometimes the artist is in costume or formal clothing.  Singing telegrams are often given as a gift.

[[Western Union]], the American [[telegraph]] company began offering singing telegram services in 1933. That July 28, a fan sent Hollywood singing star [[Rudy Vallee]] a birthday greeting by telegram. [[George P. Oslin]] (1899–1996), the Western Union public relations director, decided this would be a good opportunity to make telegrams, which had been associated with deaths and other tragic news, into something more popular.  He asked a Western Union operator, Lucille Lipps, to sing the message over the telephone, and this became the first singing telegram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | title = Special delivery: The singing telegram endures | newspaper = Columbia News Service | date = July 7, 2002 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108220256/http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | archivedate = November 8, 2006 | df =  | author=Liz Sadler }}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Oslin created the singing telegram because he thought "that messages should be fun," he recalled that he "was angrily informed I was making a laughingstock of the company."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = George Oslin, 97, creator of the singing telegram | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = October 31, 1996 | page = 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As relatively few telegram recipients had telephones, most telegrams, including singing telegrams, were first delivered in person. The popularization of the telephone in the 1960s reduced telegrams in general. By 1972, Western Union was receiving a small number of requests for singing telegrams and was seeking regulatory approval on a state-by-state basis to eliminate the offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Western Union Tuning Out Singing Telegram | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = July 29, 1972 | page = 27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Western Union suspended its singing telegram service in 1974, but independent singing telegram companies, specializing in often costumed personal delivery of gift messages, have kept up the tradition.

==Variants==
A '''DIY singing telegram''' is a specially written song all about the person in karaoke DVD form, so that any singer anywhere in the world can deliver the fully personalised singing telegram.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Kissogram===
A '''kissogram''', also called '''kissagram''' (short for kissing [[telegram]]), is a [[message]] delivered along with a [[kiss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/kissogram |title=Definition of kissogram |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually arranged as a fun surprise for a person for a special occasion. Message deliverers can be hired either by themselves, or as part of an [[Employment agency|agency]]. A kissogram is usually presented by a performer dressed in a costume or uniform such as a [[police officer]], [[nurse]], [[french maid]] or [[nun]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} This term was used in the TV program Doctor Who to describe the profession of Doctor Who's companion Amy Pond. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/doctor-who/news/a197176/new-who-companion-has-kissogram-job/|title=New 'Who' companion 'has kissogram job'|date=2010-01-18|work=Digital Spy|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stripogram===
A '''stripogram''' or '''strippergram'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strippergram|title=strippergram - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of message delivery in which a [[stripper]] will perform a [[striptease]] while singing or dancing.  The word is a combination of [[telegram]] and striptease.  This type of entertainment became popular in the 1970s in the US and spread to the UK and Europe during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thecelebratedmisterk|title=Newsroom Stripper|date=2012-03-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lusr48t3cBM|accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a Strip-O-Gram is most often a form of gift given for a [[birthday]], [[anniversary]] or [[bachelor party]].  A common practice is for the stripper-gram to be dressed in an outfit of one kind or another and to act out some form of charade connected with this, before commencing their act - for example a police officer 'arresting' somebody, a lawyer pretending to serve papers, a jilted bride and so on (sometimes this charade will be relevant to something the intended 'victim' has experienced, such as a divorce, or brush with the law). Usually a Strip-o-gram entertainer is accompanied by a chaperone, who plays her music, holds on to the money, tips and secures her safety. Unlike an escort who comes alone and does more of a one on one with the celebrant and is not chaperoned. Now-a-days, some agencies or performers do both to secure a bigger pay out.

==Star System==
In the early 1980s, a collaboration of independent singing telegrams companies in the U.S. was formed by Larry Balsamo, Hey!Wires Sing Telegrams in Chicago. Similar to [[Florists' Transworld Delivery]], the Star System was a referral system for people to send a singing telegram to friends and family throughout the United States.

==In popular culture==
In the 1976 season 5, episode 1 of The Bob Newhart Show, Bob receives a singing telegram announcing a visit from his college roommate and his new wife.  

In the 1985 movie ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Sam Lowry ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) received an invitation to his mother's party via singing telegram. When told the message had been sent Reply Paid, he attempted to sing his reply.

In ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'', 1985, a singing telegram ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) arrives and is shot on the doorstep. She is later revealed to be a secret blackmail informant. 

In a classic episode of [[Sesame Street]], Grover poses as a singing telegram artist. He goes up to [[Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)|Mr. Johnson]] singing a series of singing telegrams not directed for him until he eventually gives him the right telegram. The telegram is about Mr. Johnson's hat being found by someone in Buffalo, New York, but to Mr. Johnson's dismay, Grover forgets who sent the telegram.

In the 1987 [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]] episode "Soft Touch", [[Penny Parker]] ([[Teri Hatcher]]) tries her hand at being a singing telegram deliveryperson. But due to her forgetfully visiting the wrong address, she happens to witness two thugs torturing a man.

In ''[[The Fisher King]]'', 1991, Parry ([[Robin Williams]]) sends a singing telegram ([[Michael Jeter]]) to Lydia, the love interest in her office.

In the 2010 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]", the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor's]] [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Amy Pond]] worked delivering kissograms, prior to traveling with the Doctor.

[[Actor–network theory|Actor-network theory]] has developed this concept as the object around which [[social networks]] form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network Theory|last=Latour|first=Bruno|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was applied to social media netwotks by [[Jyri Engeström]] in 2005 as part of the explanation of why some social media networks succeed and some fail. Engeström maintained that "Social network theory fails to recognise such real-world dynamics because its notion of sociality is limited to just people." Instead, he proposed what he called "object centered sociality," citing the work of the sociologist [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]]. For example, Engeström maintained that much of the success of the popular photo-sharing site [[Flickr]] was because photographs serve as social objects around which conversations of social networks form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engeström|first=Jyri|title=Why some social network services work and others don’t — Or: the case for object-centered sociality|url=http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why-some-social-network-services-work-and-others-dont-or-the-case-for-object-centered-sociality.html|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was popularized by Hugh MacLeod, cartoonist and social observer in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacLeod|first=Hugh|title=Social Objects for Beginners|url=http://gapingvoid.com/2007/12/31/social-objects-for-beginners/|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">'''Energy statistics''' refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as [[coal]], [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], or renewable energy sources ([[biomass]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar energy]]), when they are used for the energy they contain. [[Energy]] is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or produce [[heat]]. Some energy commodities, called [[fuels]], release their [[energy content]] as heat when they [[combustion|burn]]. This heat could be used to run an [[Internal combustion engine|internal]] or [[external combustion engine]].

The need to have [[statistics]] on energy commodities became obvious during the [[1973 oil crisis]] that brought tenfold increase in [[petroleum prices]]. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing]] countries. As the gap narrows (''see picture''), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.[[Image:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|525px|Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]] 

The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources:
* [[Energy industry]]
* Other industries ("self-producers")
* Consumers
The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., [[metric ton]]s), and, when [[Energy accounting|energy balances]] are calculated, in energy units (e.g., [[terajoule]]s or [[Ton of oil equivalent|tons of oil equivalent]]). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of [[economic statistics]] is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the [[First law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">A '''Supreme Court Clinic''' is a [[law school clinic]] that provides hands-on legal experience in [[Supreme Court Litigation]] to law students. Clinics are usually directed by clinical professors and experienced Supreme Court litigators and typically represent indigent or non-profit clients in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Assistance is provided [[pro bono]].

Supreme Court Clinics exist at Stanford Law School, New York University Law School, Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, The University of Virginia School of Law, The University of Texas School of Law, Emory University School of Law, George Mason University School of Law, Northwestern University Law School, Southwestern Law School, and University of Pennsylvania Law School. Supreme Court clinics generally file [[amicus briefs]] ("friend of the Court briefs"); petitions for [[certiorari]], which are formal requests to the Court to decide a case; and merits briefs, which are formal legal arguments presented to the Court after it as agreed to take a case. Typically, experienced Supreme Court litigators help run the clinics. It is these litigators who represent the clinics before the Court during oral arguments.

The first Supreme Court Clinic was founded at [[Stanford Law School]] in 2004 and, by March 2006, the Supreme Court had agreed to hear five cases the clinic helped file and declined to hear three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/15/education/15stanford.html?ex=1300078800&amp;en=166193a56fba80c8&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | publisher=The New York Times | title=Stanford Law Students Get Early Supreme Court Duty | author=Falcone, Michael | date=March 15, 2006 | accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at NYU School of Law was formed in Fall 2007. The Supreme Court Clinic at the [[University of Texas School of Law]] was formed in Fall 2006; the [[Yale Supreme Court Advocacy Clinic]] was formed in Fall 2006; and the [[University of Virginia School of Law|University of Virginia]] Supreme Court Litigation Clinic was formed in Fall 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10943">'''Systemic development''' is a process of thinking about development which uses a [[systems thinking]] approach to create a solution to a social, environmental, and economic stress which the world is suffering from.

== Overview ==
[[File:Sustainable development.svg|thumb|Development can be a combination of multiple disciplines. Sustainable development focuses on a balance of environmental, economic, and social.]]
The core approach of systemic development is a process for thinking holistically while addressing complex issues and progressing towards a mutual goal with high participation rates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The process encompasses comprehension of current activities and future needs from a holistic perspective. For success, it is essential that the process moves from an integrated assessment to a sustainable assessment. The perspective must consider the many facets of the current and proposed development including the economic, social, environmental, political and ecological aspects. The idea behind a systemic development approach can be applied to many disciplines, similar to [[sustainable development]]. Systemic development is practice rather than [[sustainability]], which is an end state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Systems theory|General Systems Theory]] (GST) laid the foundation to systemic thinking. [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig Von Bertalanffy]] was known as the founder of the original principles of GST.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Cruz, Ivonne, Andri Stahel, and Manfred Max-Neef. "Towards a Systemic Development Approach: Building on the Human-Scale Development Paradigm." ''Ecological Economics'' 68.7 (2009): 2021-030. ''Elsevier''. Web. 20 Apr. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.02.004&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1968, when GST was introduced in Bertalanffy’s book, ''General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications'', the traditional approach to development used linear thinking or cause-and-effect thinking. GST was influenced by many different types of theories such as “Chaos theory, complexity theory, catastrophe theory, cybernetics, fuzzy set theory, and learning matrices” &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spruill|first=Nina|last2=Kenney|first2=Con|last3=Kaplan|first3=Laura|date=2001-03-01|title=Community Development and Systems Thinking: Theory and Practice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ncr.90110/abstract|journal=National Civic Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=1|pages=105–116|doi=10.1002/ncr.90110|issn=1542-7811}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, [[Peter Senge]], author of ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'', wove systemic thinking approach into development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Concepts ==
The integration of ontology, methodology, epistemology, and axiology has formed an outline for GST. Together, these concepts and philosophies contribute to the theory of systemic development.&lt;ref&gt;Sedlacko, Michal, Andre Martinuzzi, Inge RÃ¸pke, Nuno Videira, and Paula Antunes. "Participatory Systems Mapping for Sustainable Consumption: Discussion of a Method Promoting Systemic Insights." ''Ecological Economics'' 106 (2014): 33-43. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800914002043/1-s2.0-S0921800914002043-main.pdf?_tid=9d75173e-4500-11e7-b416-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1496125640_f44c0f82766115a9b6be398ef056d52f&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontological ===
[[Ontology]] is the most basic fundamental tool. In a systemic development approach, the first step is to define the boundaries, thresholds, and stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sala, Serenella, Biagio Ciuffo, and Peter Nijkamp. "A Systemic Framework for Sustainability Assessment." ''Ecological Economics'' 119 (2015): 314-25. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800915003821/1-s2.0-S0921800915003821-main.pdf?_tid=24da3502-4500-11e7-951c-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1496125438_401becd0b4afcc87524ef4bc3b8de9af&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Understanding what is, is crucial to understand the layers of complexity of the development needs.

=== Methodological ===
[[Methodology]] in systemic development must consider all variables, values, and sustainability principles, and aim to ensure that no elements have been neglected. It is important to ensure completeness, comprehensiveness, and transparency of the assessment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Mutual feedback and interactions between stakeholders should be modeled and assessed using carefully designed specific methodologies.

=== Epistemological ===
[[Epistemology]] stresses how dialogue and communication by the stakeholders are the key tools to systemic development. This is when the verification and confirmation of the facets of the development process are discovered. Insight from each stakeholder is important to enhance and broaden the perspective of all involved. It is essential to take these viewpoints into consideration because they influence the process, the trends, the drivers of change, and the interactions between the parts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is during this phase that learning is accomplished.

=== Axiological ===
Axiologology emphasizes the ethical and aesthetic responsibility during the development process. It is important because the solution manifested by the systemic development process needs to represent the values of the represented stakeholders.

==Framework ==
=== Holistic Thinking ===
To successfully achieve development through a [[systems approach]], holistic thinking is necessary. A holistic approach to a system thinks about each variable, the space between the variables and what defines the variable. “It’s the sum of the interaction of its parts”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this process each individual must learn from each other to understand the whole system in a [[multidimensional]] way to find a solution. To think about development with a systemic lens, one needs to be able to see the whole instead of parts and understand the relationship between the parts, the way the parts move, what drives the behavior of the parts, what influences the flow or direction, and to understand why there are no more or no fewer parts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Flander, Katleen De, and Jeb Brugmann. "Pressure-Point Strategy: Leverages for Urban Systemic Transformation." ''Sustainability'' 9.1 (2017): 99. ''Sustainability''. Web. 15 May 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/1/99&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The many factors that make up the whole can be a complex system.

=== Stakeholders ===
Including many diverse stakeholders helps each individual to grow their own perspective, gain an understanding of others and to increase their creativity. Systemic involvement must strive for a [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] approach instead of a [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] or [[interdisciplinary]] approach to achieve successful development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Transdisciplinary allows for the integration of methodologies and epistemologies through collaboration of the different stakeholders. Including more perspectives in the loop will increase the chance of a successful solution.

=== Communication and Learning ===
The foundation of systemic development, systems thinking, when applied, creates knowledge which leads to expanded knowledge, which leads to success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dialog is an essential tool for sharing knowledge and translating it into action. Communication can provide feedback and insight about “system, culture, practices, and artifacts and about the objectives and values of the project sponsor, client, and other stakeholders.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Learning happens during the dialog process as each stakeholder comes to observe other stakeholder’s values and ideas about what successful development would encompass.

''The Fifth Element'', by Peter Senge, emphasizes the importance of learning to improve lives using systems thinking. Individuals who acquire information, knowledge, and skills from other stakeholders and the environment tend to experience a change in their own lives and livelihood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They themselves then become the agents of change by sharing their knowledge with others.&lt;ref&gt;Work Bank. Knowledge for Development. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex loop ===
A feedback loop, closed loop, or systems complex model is a tool to help cope with complexity&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and understand the system as a whole. The tool will help to visualize the direction, velocity, delay time, long term and short term effects, and to help see the dynamic process. Feedback is necessary to learn about each other, including objectives and values of stakeholders and officials. A systemic approach to development is change oriented. The approach must encourage humans to communicate through interpersonal interactions, address the values of each stakeholder, and take part in developing and understanding the complex loop.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Goals ==
[[File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|thumb|Parts, society, needs, means, individuals, and bigger picture are pieces of the puzzle that must be accounted for to make systemic development successful.]]
Systemic development is based on the principle that one must understand the complexity of the whole system to develop a solution. This can be accomplished by learning different elements in the system and applying them to their existing knowledge. We must learn about the past suggested solutions, the balance of the system, influx of the system, the challenges within the system, the best timing for each element, learning about uncertainty of cause-and-effect, the best leverage points in the system, the system does not work unless every piece is functioning at its prime, and there is no one individual at fault if everyone is working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314017669|title=Systemic development : local solutions in a global environment|last=1944-|first=Sheffield, Jim,|last2=Emergence.|first2=Institute for the Study of Coherence and|last3=N.Z.)|first3=ANZSYS Conference (13th : 2007 : Auckland,|date=2009|publisher=Isce Publishing|isbn=9780981703275|oclc=314017669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of systemic development is to have community participants shift from being reactors to viewing themselves “as active participants in shaping their reality [to move] from reacting to the present to creating the future”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The non-linear processes must coincide, be fluid and strive to benefit all parties involved.

The '''UK Astronomy Technology Centre''' ('''UK ATC''') is based at the [[Royal Observatory, Edinburgh|Royal Observatory]] in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, and is part of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]].

The UK ATC designs, builds, develops, tests and manages major instrumentation projects in support of UK and international [[Astronomy]]. It has design offices, workshops and test facilities for both ground- and space-based instruments, including a suite of test labs capable of handling the largest current and projected instruments.&lt;ref name="ukatcinfo1"&gt;[http://www.roe.ac.uk/ukatc/information/aboutukatc.pdf UK Astronomy Technology Centre] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519232926/http://www.roe.ac.uk/ukatc/information/aboutukatc.pdf |date=19 May 2011 }}.

The UK ATC was formed in 1998 in Edinburgh from the technology departments of the [[Royal Observatory, Edinburgh|Royal Observatory]], Edinburgh (ROE), and the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Greenwich Observatory]], Cambridge (RGO). Its initial "customers" were the then new [[Gemini Observatory]], the former ROE observatories in Hawaii (the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]] (JCMT) and the [[United Kingdom Infrared Telescope]] (UKIRT)), and a former RGO observatory, the [[Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes|Isaac Newton Group]] on [[La Palma]], [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.stfc.ac.uk/UKATC/35238.aspx UK ATC history].

'''Video design''' or '''projection design''' is a creative field of stagecraft. It is concerned with the creation and integration of film, motion graphics and live camera feed into the fields of [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[dance]], [[fashion shows]], [[concerts]] and other live events. Video design has only recently gained recognition as a separate creative field. Prior to this, the responsibilities of video design would often be taken on by a [[scenic designer]] or [[lighting designer]]. A person who practices the art of video design is often known as a '''Video Designer'''. However, naming conventions vary around the world, and so practitioners may also be credited as '''Projection Designer''', "Media Designer", '''[[Cinematographer]]''' or '''Video Director''' (amongst others). As a relatively new field of stagecraft, practitioners create their own definitions, rules and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projctn.com/about-projection-design|title=About Projection Design  - Projctn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Filmmaking]] and [[video production]] content has been used in performance for many years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/theater/18mcelroy.html|title=Projection Design Comes of Age|first=Steven|last=Mcelroy|date=18 May 2008|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has large format [[slide projection]] delivered by systems such as the PANI projector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pani.com/unternehmen/daten/e_daten.html?english |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926111206/http://www.pani.com/unternehmen/daten/e_daten.html?english |archivedate=September 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Erwin Piscator]], as stage director at the Berlin [[Volksbühne]] in the 1920s, made extensive use of film projected onto his sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://myclone.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/field-guide-to-new-media-for-the-performing-arts/|title=Field Guide to New Media for the Performing Arts|first=David|last=Haden|date=28 January 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the development of digital projection technology in the mid 90s, and the resulting drop in price, made it more attractive and practical to live performance producers, directors and scenic designers. The role of the video designer has developed as a response to this, and in recognition of the demand in the industry for experienced professionals to handle the video content of a production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livedesignonline.com/theatre/projection_designer_scenic_tony_award_0430/|title=Sunday In The Park Projection Designer Being Considered For Scenic Tony Award|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Scenic Artists]]' Local 829, the Union representing [[Scenic Artists]] in the USA has included "Projection Designers" as of mid- 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usa829.org/News.aspx?ItemID=109|title=News|first=|last=USA829|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means anybody working in this field will be doing so officially as "Projection Designer" if he or she is working under a union contract, even if the design utilises technology other than [[video projectors]]. The term "Projection Designer" stems from the days when slide and film projectors were the primary source of projection and is now in wide use across North America.

[http://www.arts.ac.uk/wimbledon/courses/postgraduate/ma-digital-theatre/ MA Digital Theatre], [[University of the Arts London]]  is the first Master's level course in the UK designed to teach video design exclusively as a specific discipline, rather than embedding it into scenic design. 
Also, Opera Academy Verona has a Workshop Laboratory from 2009 of Projection Design for Opera and Theatre, Directed from Carlo Saleti, Gianfranco Veneruci and Florian CANGA.

In the USA,  a number of programs started at about the same time reflecting the growing acceptance of the profession and the need for skilled projection designers. [[Yale University]] began a graduate level program in Projection Design in 2010.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yale.edu/2009/10/30/school-drama-adds-new-concentration-projection-design|title=School of Drama Adds New Concentration in Projection Design|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's being headed by [[Wendall K. Harrington]]. [[CalArts]] had their concentration Video For Performance [https://theater.calarts.edu/programs/design-and-production/video-performance] since the mid-2000s and is currently led by Peter Flaherty while [[UT Austin]] started the MFA concentration [http://www.utexas.edu/finearts/tad/images/integrated-media/  Integrated Media for Live Performance]  also in 2010. It is being led by the Sven Ortel. Both the UT Austin and Yale program are part of an MFA in Design and graduated their first students in 2013.

== Roles of the video designer ==

Depending on the production, and due to the crossover of this field with the fields of [[lighting design]] and [[scenic design]], a video designer's roles and responsibilities may vary from show to show. A video designer may take responsibility for any or all of the following.

[[File:Production-timeline.jpg|thumb|Video Design for Theatre: Production Timeline &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://somethinggraphic.net/2013/11/10/who-will-make-up-the-video-team/|title=Video Know-How for Shows: Who will make up the video team?|first=|last=ninapixelpixie|date=10 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

* The overall conceptual design of the video content to be included in the piece, including working with the other members of the [[production team]] to ensure that the video content is integrated with the other design areas.
* The creation of this video content using [[animation|2D]] and [[3D animation]], [[motion graphics]], [[stop motion animation]], [[illustration]], [[filming]] or any other method.
* The management of live cameras, their signal and how it is used on stage as part of the design. 
* The [[Film Director|direction]], lighting and/or [[cinematography]] of any film clips included in the piece.
* The design of the technical system to deliver the video content, including the specification of [[video projectors]], [[LED display]]s, monitors and control systems, cabling routes and rigging positions for optimal video effects. 
* The management of the budget allocated to video, including the sourcing of display technologies and control technologies, their delivery, maintenance and insurance.

This is a very wide skills base, and it is not uncommon for a video designer to work with associates or assistants who can take responsibility for certain areas. For example, a video designer may conceptually design the video content, but hire a skilled [[animator]] to create it, a programmer to program the control system, a production engineer to designer and engineer the control system and a [[projectionist]] to choose the optimum projection positions and maintain the equipment.

== Concert video design ==
&lt;!-- "Concert video design" redirects here. Please update redirect if retitling section. --&gt;

'''Concert video design''' is a niche of the [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]] industry that involves the creation of original video content intended explicitly for display during a live [[concert]] performance.

The creation of visuals for live music performances bears close resemblance to [[music videos]], but are typically meant to be displayed as 'backplate' imagery that adds a visual component to the music performed onstage. However, as the use of video content during musical performances has grown in popularity since the turn of the 21st century, it has become more common to have self-standing 'introductory' and 'interstitial' videos that play on screen on stage without the performers. These pieces may include footage of the artist or artists, shot specifically for the video, and presented onstage with pre-recorded music so that the final appearance is essentially a music video. Such stand-alone videos, however, are typically only viewed in this live setting and may include additional theatrical [[sound effects]].

The earliest concert video visuals likely date to the period of the late 1960s when concerts for artists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Doors]] featured [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] imagery on projection screens suspended behind the performers. Live concert performances took on more and more theatrical elements particularly notable in the concert events put on by [[Pink Floyd]] throughout their career.

[[Laurie Anderson]] was among the earliest to experiment with video content as part of a live performance, and her ideas and images continue to be a direct inspiration to performers as diverse as [[David Bowie]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Kanye West]]. Meanwhile, in 1982, [[Devo]] integrated rear-projected visuals into their concert set, choreographing themselves to match and interact with the action on screen for several songs. But the rock show that made video content 'standard practice' was [[U2]]'s [[Zoo TV Tour]] conceived and designed by [[Willie Williams (set designer)|Willie Williams]] - who has collaborated with [[Laurie Anderson]].

== Technology used in video design ==

Video designers make use of many technologies from the fields of [[stagecraft]], broadcast equipment and home cinema equipment to build a workable video system, including technologies developed specifically for live video and technologies appropriated from other fields. A video system may include any of the following:

Historically and presently, in many parts of the world, women's participation in the profession of medicine (as [[physician]]s or [[surgeons]] for instance) has been significantly restricted. However, women's informal practice of medicine in roles such as caregivers or as [[allied health professions|allied health professionals]] has been widespread. Most countries of the world now provide women with equal access to [[medical education]]. However, not all countries ensure equal employment opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;See generally, "Women's Human Rights", 1998, [[Human Rights Watch]] (available [https://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/women/women3.html online]).&lt;/ref&gt; and gender equality has yet to be achieved within medical [[Specialty (medicine)|specialties]] and around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichenbach|first=Laura|last2=Brown|first2=Hilary|date=2004-10-02|title=Gender and academic medicine: impacts on the health workforce|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=329|issue=7469|pages=792–795|issn=0959-8138|pmid=15459056|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7469.792|pmc=521007}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite studies suggesting that female doctors may be providing higher-quality care than male doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsugawa|first=Yusuke|last2=Jena|first2=Anupam B.|last3=Figueroa|first3=Jose F.|last4=Orav|first4=E.

They continued to practice without formal training or recognition in England and eventually North America for the next several centuries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The History of Women in Surgery, by Debrah A. Wirtzfeld, MD&lt;/ref&gt;  Women's participation in the medical professions was generally limited by legal and social practices during the decades while medicine was [[professionalization|professionalizing]].&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches"&gt;See generally [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] &amp; [[Deirdre English]], ''Witches, Midwives, and Nurses'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; However, women openly practiced medicine in the [[allied health professions]] ([[nursing]], [[midwifery]], etc.), and throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, women made significant gains in access to [[medical education]] and medical work through much of the world. These gains were sometimes tempered by setbacks; for instance, [[Mary Roth Walsh]] documented a ''decline'' in women physicians in the US in the first half of the twentieth century, such that there were fewer women physicians in 1950 than there were in 1900.&lt;ref name="Walsh-1977"&gt;Walsh, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, through the latter half of the twentieth century, women made gains generally across the board. In the United States, for instance, women were 9% of total US medical school enrollment in 1969; this had increased to 20% in 1976.&lt;ref name="Walsh-1977" /&gt;  By 1985, women constituted 16% of practicing US physicians.&lt;ref name="Morantz-Sanchez-2001-preface"&gt;Morantz-Sanchez, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the twenty-first century in industrialized nations, women have made significant gains, but have yet to achieve parity throughout the medical profession.  Women have achieved parity in medical school in some industrialized countries, since 2003 forming the majority of the United States medical student body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/pressrel/2003/031104.htm "Applicants to U.S. Medical Schools Increase; Women the Majority for the First Time"],  [[Association of American Medical Colleges]], Nov. 3, 2003, press release ("Women made up the majority of medical school applicants for the first time ever").&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007-2008, women accounted for 49% of medical school applicants and 48.3% of those accepted.&lt;ref name="aamc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aamc.org/download/153708/data/ |format=PDF |title=U.S. Medical School Applicants and Students 1982-1983 to 2011-2012 |work=aamc.org |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;!--dead link: http://www.aamc.org/data/facts/charts1982to2007.pdf --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) 48.3% (16,838) of medical degrees awarded in the US in 2009-10 were earned by women, an increase from 26.8% in 1982-3.&lt;ref name="aamc" /&gt; While more women are taking part in the medical field, a 2013-2014 study reported that there are significantly fewer women in leadership positions within the academic realm of medicine. This study found that women accounted for 16% of deans, 21% of the professors, and 38% of faculty, as compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rebecca M. "Gender Inequality in Medicine: Too Much Evidence to Ignore." Psychiatric Times, vol. 34, no. 5, September 2017, pp. 1–5., http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/early-career-psychiatry/gender-inequality-medicine-too-much-evidence-ignore&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the practice of medicine remains disproportionately male overall. In industrialized nations, the recent parity in gender of medical students has not yet trickled into parity in practice. In many developing nations, neither medical school nor practice approach gender parity.

Moreover, there are skews within the medical profession: some medical specialties, such as surgery, are significantly male-dominated,&lt;ref&gt;Dixie Mills, "Women in Surgery - Past, Present, and Future" (2003 presentation), [[Association of Women Surgeons]]; available at [http://www.womensurgeons.org/about/items/womeninsurgery2003c.ppt AWS website].&lt;/ref&gt; while other specialties are significantly female-dominated, or are becoming so. In the United States, female physicians outnumber male physicians in pediatrics and female residents outnumber male residents in family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16229.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102101755/http://www.ama-assn.org:80/ama/pub/category/16229.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 November 2007 |title=AMA (WPC) Table 16 - Physician Specialties by Gender- 2006 |date=25 September 2015 |work=Women Physicians Congress (WPC) |accessdate=10 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12915.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022162222/http://www.ama-assn.org:80/ama/pub/category/12915.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 October 2004 |title=AMA (WPC) Table 4 - Women Residents by Specialty - 2005 |date=25 September 2015 |work=Women Physicians Congress (WPC) |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continue to dominate in nursing. In 2000, 94.6% of registered nurses in the United States were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/reports/rnsurvey/rnss1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030212144558/http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/reports/rnsurvey/rnss1.htm |archivedate=2003-02-12 |deadurl=yes |title=The Registered Nurse Population |date=March 2000 |work=bhpr.hrsa.gov |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In health care professions as a whole in the US, women numbered approximately 14.8 million, as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/ |title = Women’s Health at Work |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |date = 13 May 2013 |first1 = Naomi |last1 = Swanson |first2 = Julie |last2 = Tisdale-Pardi |first3 = Leslie |last3 = MacDonald |first4 = Hope M. |last4 = Tiesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomedical research and academic medical professions—i.e., faculty at medical schools—are also disproportionately male. Research on this issue, called the "leaky pipeline" by the [[National Institutes of Health]] and other researchers, shows that while women have achieved parity with men in entering graduate school, a variety of discrimination causes them to drop out at each stage in the academic pipeline: graduate school, [[postdoc]], faculty positions, achieving tenure; and, ultimately, in receiving recognition for groundbreaking work.&lt;ref&gt;The term was coined by S.E. Berryman in "Who Will Do Science?", 1983; see Louise Luckenbill-Edds, [http://www.ascb.org/index.cfm?id=1584&amp;navid=112&amp;tcode=nws3 "2000 WICB / Career Strategy Columns (Archive)"], Nov. 1, 2000, WICB Newsletter, ''American Society for Cell Biology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

=== Glass ceiling ===
The [[glass ceiling]] is used as a metaphor to convey the undefined obstacles that women and minorities face in the workplace.

One study surveyed physician mothers and their physician daughters in order to analyze the effect that discrimination and harassment have on the individual and their career. This study included 84% of physician mothers that graduated medical school prior to 1970, with the majority of these physicians graduating in the 1950s and 1960s. The authors of this study stated that discrimination in the medical field persisted after the title VII discrimination legislation was passed in 1965.&lt;ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127"&gt;Shrier, Diane K.; Zucker, Alyssa N.; Mercurio, Andrea E.; Landry, Laura J.; Rich, Michael; Shrier, Lydia A. (2007). "Generation to Generation: Discrimination and Harassment Experiences of Physician Mothers and Their Physician Daughters".&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Women's Health''.&amp;nbsp;'''16'''&amp;nbsp;(6): 1–13.&amp;nbsp;{{doi|10.1089/jwh.2006.0127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to this study, one third of physician daughters reported experiencing a form of gender discrimination in medical school, field training, and the work environment. This study also stated that both generations equally experienced gender discrimination within their work environments.

This article provided an overview on the history of gender discrimination, claiming that gender initiated the systematic exclusion of women from medical schools. This was the case until 1970, when the National Organization for Women (NOW) filed a class action lawsuit against all medical schools in the United States. &amp;nbsp;More specifically, this lawsuit was successful in forcing medical schools to comply to the civil rights legislation. This success was seen by 1975 when the number of women in medicine had nearly tripled, and continued to grow as the years progressed. By 2005, over 25% of physicians and around 50% of medical school students were women. The increase of women in medicine also came with an increase of women identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, yet this population is still largely underrepresented in comparison to the general population of the medical field.&lt;ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127"/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Within this specific study, 22% of physician mothers and 24% of physician daughters identified themselves as being an ethnic minority. These women reported experiencing instances of exclusion from career opportunities as a result of their [[Intersectionality|race and gender]].&amp;nbsp;

In an article titled "I'm too used to it”: A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education," the author described how confidence in ability varies based upon gender. According to this article, females tend to have lessened confidence in their abilities as a doctor, yet their performance is equivalent to that of their male counterparts. This study also commented on the impact of power dynamics within medical school, which is established as a hierarchy that ultimately shapes the educational experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Specifically, this article described how power dynamics led to the formation of a “hidden curriculum” in medical school, which revolves around understanding the contribution of gender roles in regards to being a female doctor. According to this article, this position holds females more accountable for their actions as a result of unrealistic expectations set forth by these gender roles, which expects female doctors to take on a nurturing and matronly persona when dealing with patients. The hidden curriculum, according to this article, is an integral aspect of a female's medical education that must be learned in order to tolerate instances of gender discrimination.

On the topic of power dynamics, another study commented on the nature of sexual harassment, stating that it was most commonly perpetrated within career training stages, by people in positions of power. According to this article, instances of sexual harassment attribute to the high attrition rates of females in the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clancy K. H., Nelson R. G., Rutherford J. N., Hinde K. | year = 2014 | title = Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE): Trainees Report Harassment and Assault | url = | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 7| pages = 1–9 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0102172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study describes sexual harassment as a growing problem due to the fact that it goes widely underreported, which is said to be caused by the transient nature of career training, alongside weak policies and the perpetrators holding positions of power over the victim.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babaria|first=Palav|last2=Abedin|first2=Sakena|last3=Berg|first3=David|last4=Nunez-Smith|first4=Marcella|date=2012-04-01|title="I'm too used to it": A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953612000780|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=74|issue=7|pages=1013–1020|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.11.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's Contributions to Medicine in the United States==

Women have successfully provided the world with information not previously known. A few women who provided knowledge were:
 
'''Helen Brooke Taussig:''' ''The First Female President of the American Heart Association''

[[Helen B. Taussig|Helen Brooke Taussig]] was born on May 24, 1898, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. She is most commonly known as the first female president of the American Heart Association&lt;ref name=TaussigEB&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Helen-Brooke-Taussig|title=Helen Brooke Taussig {{!}} American physician|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taussig was diagnosed with [[Dyslexia]] when she was young. Around the same time, her mother, Edith Guild Taussig (1861-1909) died.&lt;ref name=TaussigEB/&gt; Her father, [[Frank William Taussig]] (1859-1940), was an economist and educator in the United States. He was also known for creating the "Foundation of Modern [[International trade|Trade Theory"]].  Taussig earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B]] from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1921. In 1922 she applied at [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard University's Medical School]], and was denied. The University was not accepting women at the time. Instead she graduated from [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] in 1927. In her 30s, Taussig grew deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/013500/013565/html/13565bio.html|title=Helen Brooke Taussig|last=Morton|first=Lauren|date=2005|website=Archives of Maryland|archive-url=|archive-date=December 5, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Taussig was appointed the Head of he Children's Hear Clinic at the Harriet Lane home, which was part of Johns Hopkins University. Due to her inability to hear, Taussig found an alternative method to studying the heartbeat in children by feeling the beat with her hands. This method lead her to discover [[Blue baby syndrome|"Blue Baby Syndrome]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blalock|first=Alfred|date=1945-05-19|title=THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF MALFORMATIONS OF THE HEART|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1945.02860200029009|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|language=en|volume=128|issue=3|doi=10.1001/jama.1945.02860200029009|issn=0002-9955|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was termed so due to the cyanotic hue resembling babies who were thought to be ill. In 1947, a surgeon named [[Alfred Blalock]] teamed up with Taussig and wrote an article called,&lt;ref&gt;"Congenital Malformations of the Heart",&lt;/ref&gt; which explored their creation and alternative approach for a stunt-"[[Blalock–Taussig shunt|Blalock-Taussig Shunt]]"- that would help circulate blood from the lungs to the heart. In the article it states, "The operation here reported and the studies leading thereto were undertaken with the conviction that even though the structure of the heart was grossly abnormal, in many instances it might be possible to alter the course of the circulation in such a manner as to lessen the 'cyanosis' and the resultant disability." (Read before the [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] Medical Society, March 12, 1945.) Taussig received multiple awards after 1950. In 1954, Taussig received the Albert Lasker award, which is awarded for outstanding contributions to medicine. In 1959, Taussig was acknowledged for being one of the first women who received full professorship to Johns Hopkins University. In 1964, Taussig was awarded the [[Medal of Freedom|medal of freedom]] from President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Finally, in 1965, Taussig was known as the first women of the [[American Heart Association]], for which she is so prominently known for. To further her interest in pediatrics, nearly a decade and a half later in the 1960s, Taussig remained to advocate for children's&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; health. She was "responsible for investigating the epidemic of serious congenital limb malformations". This investigation focused on European children and Taussig had a theory that the malformations were caused by the use of [[Thalidomide]]. She resolved this ongoing issue by persuading the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to discontinue the use and sale of Thalidomide in the U.S

'''Helen Flanders Dunbar:''' ''The "Mother" of Holistic Medicine''

[[Helen Flanders Dunbar]] was born in [[Chicago]] on May 14, 1902, and Dunbar was the oldest child. Dunbar's mother, Edith Vaughn Flanders (1871-1963), was an Episcopalian clergyman's daughter as well as a professional [[Genealogy|Genealogist]]. Dunbar's father, Francis William Dunbar (1868-1939), was very much established as well due to his standing as an electrical engineer, as well as a patent attorney. In her early life, Dunbar's education was strictly limited to tutors and attending private schools. She graduated from [[Brearley School]], which was located in [[New York City]], in 1919, which lead to her enrollment in [[Bryn Mawr College]]. At this particular point in her life her interest in [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and medicine. Dunbar met [[James H. Leuba|James Henry Leuba]] at [[Bryn Mawr College]], which sparked her interest due to his standing as a psychologist of religion at the college. In the summer of 1929, after successfully receiving a bachelor's degree in mathematics and psychology from [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], Dunbar continued her education by spending five weeks in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts receiving clinical training. In 1927, Dunbar received a [[bachelor's degree]] as [[Latin honors|"Magna Cum Laude]]" from Union Theological Seminar. This achievement was awarded primarily due to her thesis, "Methods Training in the Devotional Life Emphasized in the American Churches".&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; Dunbar also won a travelling Fellowship due to this particular piece of writing. From 1931 until 1936, Dunbar held the position as director of Joint Committee of the [[New York City]] Religion and Health of the Federal Council and Churches of the Academy of Medicine. From 1943 until the year before she died, Dunbar wrote an assortment of books including: [http://www.womeninmedicinemagazine.com/profile-of-women-in-medicine/helen-flanders-dunbar-pioneer-in-psychosomatic-medicine "Psychosomatic Diagnosis]" in 1943, "Mind, Body: Psychosomatic Medicine"&lt;ref name=Dunbar&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/helen-flanders-dunbar/|title=Helen Flanders Dunbar|last=Young|first=Tracy L.|date=2010|website=Psychology's Feminist Voices|archive-url=|archive-date=2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947, "Your Child's Mind and Body; A practical guide for parents" in 1949, and "Illness: the realization of an infant's fantasy with special reference to testing methods" in 1951. During the year of her death, Dunbar wrote "Accidents of Life Experience", "Basic aspects and applications of the psychology of safety", and "Psychiatry in medicine specialties".&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; Helen Flanders Dunbar died in 1959.

==Midwifery in 18th Century America==
As per the documentary “A Midwife’s Tale”, historian of 18th century America, [[Laurel Thatcher Ulrich]], follows the diary of [[Martha Ballard]], which proves to be a telling source of women's roles as medical practitioners. Out of the different occupations women took on around this time, [[midwifery]] was the best paid of them all.&lt;ref name="Ulrich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ulrich|first1=Laurel Thatcher|title=A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812|date=1990|publisher=Knopf|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[18th century]], households tended to have an abundance of children largely in part to have a helping hand in responsibilities and to combat high mortality rates.&lt;ref name="McMillen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMillen|first1=Sally Gregory|title=Motherhood in the Old South: Pregnancy, Childbirth and Infant Rearing|date=1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the high chance of complications in labor, Martha Ballard, specifically, had high success rates in delivering healthy babies to healthy mothers.&lt;ref name="Ulrich" /&gt;

==Competition Between Midwifery and Obstetrics==
A shift from women midwifery to male obstetrics occurs in the growth of medical practices such as the founding of the [[American Medical Association]].&lt;ref name="Feldhusen" /&gt; Instead of assisting labor in the basis of an emergency, there were doctors such as Dr. Benjamin Page who wanted to take over the delivery of babies completely; putting midwifery second.&lt;ref name="Ulrich" /&gt; This is an example of the growing sense of competition between male physicians and female midwives as a rise in obstetrics took hold. The education of women on the basis of midwifery was stunted by both physicians and public-health reformers, driving midwifery to be seen as out of practice.&lt;ref name="Brodsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodsky|first1=Phyllis L|title=Where have all the midwives gone?|journal=Journal of Perinatal Education|date=2008|volume=17|issue=4|doi=10.1624/105812408X324912|pmid=19436438|pmc=2582410|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Societal roles also played a fact in the downfall of the practice in midwifery because women were unable to obtain the education needed for licensing and once married, women were to embrace a domestic lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Feldhusen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://midwiferytoday.com/web-article/history-midwifery-childbirth-america-time-line/|last1=Feldhusen|first1=Adrian E|title=The History of Midwifery and Childbirth in America: A Time Line|website=Midwifery Today|publisher=Midwifery Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient medicine===
The involvement of women in the field of [[medicine]] has been recorded in several early civilizations. An [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] or [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Merit-Ptah]], described in an inscription as "chief physician", is the earliest woman named in the [[history of science]]. [[Agamede]] was cited by [[Homer]] as a healer in [[ancient Greece]] before the [[Trojan War]]. [[Agnodice]] was the first female [[physician]] to practice legally in 4th century BC [[Athens]].  [[Metrodora]] was a physician and generally regarded as the first [[medical writing|medical writer]]. Her book, ''On the Diseases and Cures of Women'', was the oldest medical book written by a female and was often referenced by many other female physicians. She credited much of her writings to the ideologies of [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Influential Women In Medicine: From The Past To The Present|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/most-influential-women-medicine-past-present-270560|website=Medical Daily|accessdate=24 September 2017|language=en|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
During the [[Middle Ages]], [[convent]]s were an important place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly [[research]]. An example is the [[Germans|German]] [[abbess]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]], whose prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including [[medicine]], [[botany]] and [[natural history]] (c.1151-58).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |title=Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) |author=Sabina Flanagan |publisher=University of Adelaide |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406172530/http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |archivedate=2005-04-06 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered Germany's first female [[physician]].&lt;ref name=hildegard&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Hildegard von Bingen | encyclopedia = Key Figures in Medieval Europe - An Encyclopedia | editor = Richard K.

Women in the Middle Ages participated in many healing techniques and capacities. According to historical documents, small numbers of women occupied almost all ranks of medical personnel during the period.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica|title=Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe|journal=Signs|date=1989|volume=14|issue=2|pages=434–473|doi=10.1086/494516|jstor=3174557}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked as [[herbalists]], [[midwives]], [[surgeons]], [[barber-surgeons]], nurses, and traditional [[empirics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=William L.|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=1992|volume=82|issue=2|pages=288–295|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288|pmid=1739168|pmc=1694293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women treated everyone, not only women as historians once thought. The names of 24 women described as surgeons in Naples between 1273 and 1410 are known, and references have been found to 15 women practitioners, most of them Jewish and none described as midwives, in Frankfurt between 1387 and 1497.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siraisi|first1=Nancy G.|title=Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine: An Introduction to Knowledge and Practice|date=2009-05-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-76131-2|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Women also engaged in midwifery and healing arts without leaving any trace of their activities in written records, and practiced in rural areas or where there was little access to medical care.
Society in the Middle Ages limited women's role as physician. Once universities established faculties of medicine during the thirteenth century, women were excluded from advanced medical education.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Licensure began to require clerical vows for which women were ineligible, and healing as a profession became male dominated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In many occasions, women had to fight against accusation of illegal practice done by males, putting into question their real motives. If they were not accused of malpractice, then women were considered "witches" by both clerical and civil authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=WL|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history|date=1992|journal=Am J Public Health|pmc=1694293|pmid=1739168|volume=82|issue=2|pages=288–95|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because surgeons and barber-surgeons were often organized into guilds, they could hold out longer against the pressures of licensure. Like other guilds, a number of the barber-surgeon guilds allowed the daughters and wives of their members to take up membership in the guild, generally after the man's death. According to documents, Katherine la surgiene of London, daughter of Thomas the surgeon and sister of William the Surgeon belonged to a guild in 1286.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rawcliffe|first1=Carole|title=Medicine and Society in Later Medieval England|date=1997|publisher=Sutton|location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|isbn=978-0-7509-1497-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation of female members in the guilds of Lincoln, Norwich, Dublin and York continue until late in the period. Midwives, those who assisted pregnant women through childbirth and some aftercare, included only women. Midwives constituted roughly one third of female medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Men did not involve themselves in women's medical care, likewise, women did not involve themselves in men's health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica|title=Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|jstor=3174557|volume=14|issue=2|pages=434–473|doi=10.1086/494516|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The southern [[Italy|Italian]] coastal town of Salerno was an important center of medical learning and practice in the 12th century.  There, the physician [[Trota of Salerno]] gathered a number of her medical practices in several written collections.  One work on women's medicine that was associated with her, the ''De curis mulierum'' ("On Treatments for Women") formed the core of what came to be known as the ''[[Trotula]]'' ensemble, a compendium of three texts that circulated throughout medieval Europe.  Trota herself gained a reputation that spread as far as France and England.  There are also references in the writings of other Salernitan physicians to the ''mulieres Salernitane'' ("Salernitan women"), which give some idea of local empirical practices.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The 'Trotula': A Medieval Compendium of Women’s Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dorotea Bucca]] was another distinguished Italian physician. She held a chair of philosophy and medicine at the University of Bologna for over forty years from 1390.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite journal| author= JS Edwards |title= A Woman Is Wise: The Influence of Civic and Christian Humanism on the Education of Women in Northern Italy and England during the Renaissance |journal=Ex Post Facto: Journal of the History Students at San Francisco State University |volume =XI | year=2002 |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~epf/2002/edwards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RoqNOWuNa8oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22dorotea+bucca%22 Howard S.

===Medieval Islamic world===
For the medieval Islamic world, little specific information is known about female medical practitioners although it is likely that women were regularly involved in medical practice in some capacity.  Male medical writers refer to the presence of female practitioners (singular, ''ṭabība'') in describing certain procedures or situations.  For example, the late 10th/early 11th century Andalusi physician and surgeon [[al-Zahrawi]], in explaining how to excise bladder stones, notes that the procedure is difficult for male doctors practicing on female patients: because of the need to touch the genitalia, the male practitioner must either find a female doctor who can perform the procedure, or a eunuch physician, or a midwife who takes instruction from the male surgeon.  In other words, even though direct evidence for female practitioners is rare, their existence can be inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, "History of Science," ''Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures''.  Volume I: ''Methodologies, Paradigms and Sources'', Suad Joseph, general editor (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2003), pp. 358-61; Peter Pormann, "Female Patients and Practitioners in Medieval Islam," ''The Lancet'' 373 (May 9, 2009), pp. 1598-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  As al-Zahrawi's example also suggests, midwives played an important role in the delivery of women's healthcare.  For these practitioners, there is more detailed information, both in terms of the prestige of their craft ([[ibn Khaldun]] calls it a noble craft, "something necessary in civilization") and in terms of biographical information on historic women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Giladi Avner | year = 2010 | title = Liminal Craft, Exceptional Law:  Preliminary Notes on Midwives in Medieval Islamic Writings | url = | journal = International Journal of Middle East Studies | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 185–202 | doi=10.1017/s0020743810000012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Molénat, "Priviligiées ou poursuivies: quatre sages-femmes musulmanes dans la Castille du XVe siècle," ''Identidades marginales'', ed.

===Western medicine in China===
[[Traditional Chinese medicine]] based on the use of [[Chinese herbology|herbal medicine]], [[acupuncture]], [[Traditional Chinese massage|massage]] and other forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years.  However, Western Medicine was introduced to China in the 19th Century, mainly by medical missionaries sent from various Christian mission organizations, such as the [[London Missionary Society]] (Britain), the [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church (Britain) and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian Church]] (US). [[Benjamin Hobson]] (1816-1873), a medical missionary sent by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1839, set up a highly successful Wai Ai Clinic (惠愛醫館) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ifeng.com/article/46027.html |title=回眸：当年传教士进羊城_MW悦读室之岭南话廊_凤凰博报- 博采众家之言 报闻公民心声-凤凰网 |publisher=Blog.ifeng.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/GDSI199901009.htm |title=合信的《全体新论》与广东士林-《广东史志》1999年01期-中国知网 |publisher=Mall.cnki.net |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Guangzhou, China. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] (香港華人西醫書院) was founded in 1887 by the [[London Missionary Society]], with its first graduate (in 1892) being [[Sun Yat-sen]] (孫中山).  Sun later led the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]], which changed China from an empire to a republic. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the [[University of Hong Kong]], which started in 1911.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, women of China were reluctant to be treated by Western male doctors. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors. One of these was [[Sigourney Trask]] of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who set-up a hospital in [[Fuzhou]] during the mid-19th century. Trask also arranged for a local girl, [[Hü King Eng]], to study medicine at [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College]], with the intention that Hü would return to practise western medicine in Fuzhou. After graduation, Hü became the resident physician at Fuzhou's [[Woolston Memorial Hospital]] in 1899 and trained several female physicians.&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{cite book | title=Notable Women of Modern China | last1=Burton | first1=Margaret E. | author-link=Margaret E.

===Women's health movement in the 1970s===
The 1970s marked a great increase of women entering and graduating from [[medical school]]{{where|date=August 2015}}. From 1930 to 1970, a period of 40 years, about 14,000 women graduated from medical school. From 1970 to 1980, a period of 10 years, over 20,000 women graduated from medical school.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi, Michele A. and Gertrude A. Streuernage, ed., Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines (New York: Harrington Park Press, 1990), 236.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase of women in the medical field was due to both political and cultural changes.

Two laws in the United States lifted restrictions for women in the medical field -- [[Title IX]] of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1972 and the [[Public Health Service Act]] of 1975, banning discrimination on grounds of gender. In November 1970, the Assembly of the Association of American Medical Colleges rallied for equal rights in the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines,'' 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, women's ideas about themselves and their relation to the medical field were shifting due to the [[women's movement]].

A sharp increase of women in the medical field led to developments in doctor patient relationships, changes in terminology and theory. One area of medical practice that was challenged and changed was [[gynecology]]. Wendy Kline &lt;ref&gt;Kline, Wendy. ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave'' (University of Chicago Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; talks about the blurring of "clinical" and "sexual" that occurred in the medical field in the late 40s into the 60s, particularly in gynecology. Kline says that "to ensure that young brides were ready for the wedding night, they [doctors] used the [[pelvic exam]] as a form of sex instruction ."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave,'' p 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ellen Frankfort's book ''Vaginal Politics'', Frankfort talks about the "shame" and "humiliation" felt during a pap test; "I was naked, he was dressed; I was lying down, he was standing up; I was quiet, he was giving orders "&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, Ellen. ''Vaginal Politics'' (New York: Vintage, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

With higher numbers of women enrolled in medical school, medical practices like gynecology were challenged and changed.  One medical student is quoted in Kline's book as saying, "Since I experienced my own exams as a humiliating procedure, I feared inflicting the same humiliation on another person."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972 the University of Iowa Medical School instituted a new training program for pelvic and breast examinations. Students would act both as the doctor and the patient, allowing each student to understand the procedure and create a more gentle, respectful examination. This method was quite different from the previous practice in which doctors were taught to assert their power over patients. With changes in ideologies and practices throughout the 70s, by 1980 over 75 schools had adopted this new method.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines,'' 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

With women entering the medical field and women's rights movements came also the women's health movement which sought alternative methods of health care for women. This came through the creation of self-help books, most notably ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]: A Book by and for Women''.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Women’s Health Book Collective Staff, ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women'' (Boston: Simon and Schuster Trade, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This book gave women a "manual" to help understand their body. It challenged hospital treatment, and doctors' practices. Aside from self-help books, many help centres were opened: birth centres run by [[midwives]], safe [[abortion]] centres, and classes for educating women on their bodies, all with the aim of providing non-judgmental, warm, and comfortable care for women.&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, Bruce J. The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and politics. (Da Capo Press, 2002), 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Kline speaks to this claim women were taking on their body in relation to the medical world; women felt that "not only should women have access to information about their bodies... they should also help to create this knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The women's health movement, along with women involved in the medical field, opened the doors for research and awareness for female illness like [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].

While scholars in the history of medicine had developed some study of women in the field—biographies of pioneering women physicians were common prior to the 1960s—the study of women in medicine took particular root with the advent of the [[women's movement]] in the 1960s, and in conjunction with the [[women's health movement]].  Two publications in 1973 were critical in establishing the women's health movement and scholarship about women in medicine: First, the publication of ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' in 1973 by the Boston Women's Health Collective,&lt;ref&gt;''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; and second, "Witches, Midwives, and Nurses: A History of Female Healers", a short paper by [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Deirdre English]] also in 1973.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches" /&gt; The Ehrenreich/English paper examined the history of women in medicine as the professionalization of the field excluded women, particularly [[midwifery|midwives]], from the practice.  Ehrenreich and English later expanded the work into a full-length book, ''[[For Her Own Good]]'', which connected the exclusion of women from the practice of medicine to [[sexism|sexist]] medical practices; this text and ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' became key texts in the women's health movement. The English/Ehrenreich text laid out some early insights about the professionalization of medicine and the exclusion of women from the profession, and numerous scholars, such as [[Diana Elizabeth Long]], have greatly built upon and expanded this work.
