'''''A la poupée''''' is an [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printmaking]] technique for applying different ink colors using a ball-shaped wad of fabric to apply the ink to a [[copperplate etching|copperplate]]. Paper is printed through just one run in the press. The term ''a la poupée'' means "with a doll", which refers to the wad of fabric, shaped like a ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/clrflimpr-tech.shtm | title=Colorful impressions: Techniques | publisher=National Gallery of Art | accessdate=March 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Around the Piano''''' (French: ''Autour du piano'') is an 1885 painting by French artist [[Henri Fantin-Latour]]. It was exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] the same year, then was bought by Adolphe Jullien. In 1915, it was given to the [[Musée du Luxembourg]], then was at the [[Musée du Louvre]] until 1986. It is currently kept at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;{{cite web |title=Henri Fantin-Latour, ''Autour du piano'', en 1885 — Notice de l'œuvre |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/de/kollektionen/werkkatalog/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=000214&amp;cHash=34e19f6012 |publisher=Musée d'Orsay |language=French |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and reception ==
The painting was the last of the four portraits of groups that Fantin-Latour devoted to his friends and celebrities in the arts world. He referred here to the concerts given by the group known as "Le Petit Bayreuth" initiated by Antoine Lascoux. Despite three previous paintings and numerous [[still life]]s, the painter had not received the critical acclaim which he expected. He finally reached it through ''Around the Piano''. The painting, however, remains the least known of series of four ones, perhaps because the people depicted are less famous.

Exhibited at the Salon of 1885, the painting was called ''The Wagnerists'' by visitors, as the person seated at the piano was thought to be [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], a composer who was an early supporter of [[Wagner]]. Adolphe Jullien, a close friend of Latour, rejected this name, saying that Fantin did not want to paint an artistic manifesto, but simply a gathering of friends, and that the score on the piano, although indistinct, was a piece by Brahms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wagner et la France |url=http://www.histoire-image.org/site/oeuvre/analyse.php?i=432 |first=Georges |last=Liébert |publisher=L'Histoire par image |language=French |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7583">'''Art Loss Register''' (ALR) is the world's largest database of [[Art theft|stolen art]].&lt;ref&gt;Eileen Kinsella. "[https://news.artnet.com/market/art-loss-register-embroiled-least-three-international-art-disputes-305134 The Art Loss Register is Entangled in Three Major International Art Disputes]". ''artnet Magazine'', June 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A computerized international database that captures information about lost and stolen art, antiques, and collectables, the ALR is a London-based, independent, for profit corporate offspring of the New York-based, nonprofit [[International Foundation for Art Research]] (IFAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifar.org/home.php|title=International Foundation for Art Research (IFAR)-IFAR Home Page|website=www.ifar.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of functions served by ALR has grown as the number of its listed items has increased. The database is used by collectors, the art trade, insurers, and law enforcement agencies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artloss.com/content/home Art Loss Register] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501083655/http://www.artloss.com/content/home |date=May 1, 2010 }}: [http://www.artloss.com/content/history-and-business History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525120830/http://www.artloss.com/content/history-and-business |date=May 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, IFAR helped create the Art Loss Register (ALR) as a commercial enterprise to expand and market the database. IFAR managed ALR's U.S. operations through 1997. In 1998 the ALR assumed full responsibility for the IFAR database although IFAR retains ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifar.org/about.php|title=IFAR Retains Ownership of Art Loss Database|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the database comprised only 20,000 items, but it grew in size nearly tenfold during its first decade.&lt;ref&gt;Houpt, Simon. (2006). ''Museum of the Missing, p. 8.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Houpt, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first steps towards ALR began with the establishment of IFAR in New York in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Glueck, Grace. [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/08/archives/art-group-is-set-up-to-judge-attribution.html?sq=international%2520foundatin%2520for%2520art%2520research&amp;scp=13&amp;st=cse   "Art Group Is Set Up To Judge Attribution,"] ''New York Times.'' May 8, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other explicit goals, IFAR was created to compile information about stolen art.&lt;ref name="yarrow"&gt;Yarrow, Andrew L. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/arts/a-lucrative-crime-grows-into-a-costly-epidemic.html?scp=10&amp;sq=international%20foundatin%20for%20art%20research&amp;st=cse  "A Lucrative Crime Grows Into a Costly Epidemic,"] ''New York Times.'' March 20, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the growth of international art thefts, IFAR began publishing the "Stolen Art Alert" in 1976.

By 1990, IFAR was updating its catalogue of stolen art 10 times a year.&lt;ref name="yarrow"/&gt;  The magnitude of the problem overwhelmed what had grown to be over 20,000 manual records. While IFAR had been very successful in recording the details of losses, that was only a good first step.

In 1991, the ALR was established in London as a commercial company, earning fees from insurers and theft victims. Its founding shareholders included insurance and auction houses, which some think is a conflict of interest [[Christie's#cite note-72]]. The majority of shares are owned by its founder, [[Julian Radcliffe]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/arts/design/tracking-stolen-art-for-profit-and-blurring-a-few-lines.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 Tracking Stolen Art, for Profit, and Blurring a Few Lines, ''New York Times'', September 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Significant capital investment was needed so that IFAR could be computerised and so that the database made available to worldwide law enforcement agencies and others.  

==Development==
In response to the growth and development of IFAR, museum officials revised some policies based on an assumption that discussing theft would scare away potential donors. The AFR initially formed a partnership with the ALR, but, they later split after disagreements over strategy and issues of control.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The change from policies of secrecy to ones which emphasize openness was gradual, mirroring an expectation that publicizing theft is likely to promote recovery.&lt;ref name="yarrow"/&gt; The ALR has been widely criticised for its methods and for the actions of its chairman, [[Julian Radcliffe]]. The Register has consistently lost money but for the personal cash infusions of its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chasingaphrodite.com/2013/08/01/optical-due-diligence-art-loss-register-claims-to-vet-ancient-art-does-it/|title=Art Loss Register Claims to Vet Ancient Art, Does it?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Selected timeline
{{dynamic list}}
* '''1990''': Artworks stolen from the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] in Boston includes [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]]'s [[The Concert (Vermeer)|Concert]], three [[Rembrandt]]s and five works by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name="yarrow"/&gt;
* '''1989''': IFAR received reports of about 5,000 thefts.&lt;ref name="yarrow"/&gt;
* '''2003''': ALR obtains information about a Sisley stolen from the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts d'Orléans]] in Orleans. The museum was unable to afford the fee and the Sisley has not been recovered.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Criticism of methods==
The approach adopted by the ALR has been criticised. The Register has contacted owners of stolen art saying it had information, but not revealing it until a fee was paid. In another instance the ALR lied to Sotheby’s saying that paintings were not stolen. The paintings were then shipped to London, where they were seized.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The ALR has likened this approach to the police misleading a suspect during an investigation.

[[File:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Paolo Uccello]]'s depiction of [[Saint George]] and the dragon, c. 1470, a classic image of a damsel in distress.]]

The '''damsel-in-distress''', '''persecuted maiden''', or '''princess in jeopardy''' is a classic theme in world literature, art, film and video games; most notably in those that have a lot of action. This [[fantasy tropes|trope]] usually involves beautiful, innocent, or helpless young female leads, placed in a dire predicament by a [[villain]], [[monster]] or [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], and who requires a male [[hero]] to achieve her rescue. Often these young women are stereotyped as very physically weak and almost completely dependent on the male lead. After rescuing her, the hero often obtains her hand in marriage. She has become a [[stock character]] of fiction, particularly of [[melodrama]]. Though she is usually human, she can also be of any other species, including fictional or [[folklore|folkloric]] species; and even divine figures such as an [[angel]], [[spirit]], or [[deity]].

The word "damsel" derives from the French ''[[wikt:demoiselle|demoiselle]]'', meaning "young lady", and the term "damsel in distress" in turn is a translation of the French ''demoiselle en détresse''.{{cn|date=May 2017}} It is an archaic term not used in modern English except for effect or in expressions such as this. It can be traced back to the [[knight-errant]] of Medieval songs and tales, who regarded protection of women as an essential part of his [[chivalric code]] which includes a notion of [[honour]] and [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]] remarks in his book ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', "the source of the chivalrous idea, is pride aspiring to beauty, and formalised pride gives rise to a conception of honour, which is the pole of noble life". Huizinga, ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919) 1924:58.&lt;/ref&gt; The English term "damsel in distress" itself first seems to have appeared in Richard Ames' 1692 poem "Sylvia’s Complaint of Her Sexes Unhappiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ames|first=Richard|title=Sylvia’s Complaint of Her Sexes Unhappiness : a Poem, Being the Second Part of Sylvia’s Revenge, Or, a Satyr Against Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDW-gC3gqx8C&amp;pg=PA1|year=1692|publisher=Richard Baldwin|location=London|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient history ===
{{Unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 011.jpg|thumb|[[Rembrandt]]'s [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] chained to the rock – a late-[[Renaissance]] damsel in distress from Greek mythology.]]

The damsel in distress theme featured in the stories of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]]. [[Greek mythology]], while featuring a large retinue of competent [[List of Greek mythological figures|goddesses]], also contains helpless maidens threatened with sacrifice. For example, [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]'s [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|mother]] offended [[Poseidon]], who sent a beast to ravage the land. To appease him Andromeda's parents fastened her to a rock in the sea. The hero [[Perseus]] slew the beast, saving Andromeda. Andromeda in her plight, chained naked to a rock, became a favorite theme of later painters. This theme of the [[Princess and dragon]] is also pursued in the myth of [[Saint George and the Dragon|St George]].

Another early example of a damsel in distress is [[Sita]] in the ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Ramayana]]''. In the epic, Sita is kidnapped by the villain [[Ravana]] and taken to [[Lanka]]. Her husband [[Rama]] goes on a quest to rescue her, with the help of the monkey-god [[Hanuman]].

=== Post-classical history ===
European [[fairy tale]]s frequently feature damsels in distress. Evil witches trapped [[Rapunzel]] in a tower, cursed the princess to die in "[[Snow White]]", and put [[Sleeping Beauty]] into a magical sleep. In all of these, a valorous prince comes to the maiden's aid, saves her, and marries her (though Rapunzel is not directly saved by the prince, but instead saves him from blindness after her exile).

The damsel in distress was an archetypal character of medieval romances, where typically she was rescued from imprisonment in a tower of a castle by a knight-errant. [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Clerk's Tale]]'' of the repeated trials and bizarre torments of patient Griselda was drawn from [[Petrarch]]. The [[Emprise de l'Escu vert à la Dame Blanche]] (founded 1399) was a [[chivalric order]] with the express purpose of protecting oppressed ladies.

The theme also entered the official [[hagiography]] of the Catholic Church – most famously in the story of [[Saint George]] who saved a princess from being devoured by a [[dragon]]. A late addition to the official account of this Saint's life, not attested in the several first centuries when he was venerated, it is nowadays the main act for which Saint George is remembered.

Obscure outside [[Norway]] is [[Hallvard Vebjørnsson]], the Patron Saint of [[Oslo]], recognised as a martyr after being killed while valiantly trying to defend a woman – most likely a [[slavery|slave]] – from three men accusing her of theft.

===Modern history===

====17th century====

In the 17th century English [[ballad]] ''[[The Spanish Lady]]'' (one of several English and Irish songs with that name), a Spanish lady captured by an English captain falls in love with her captor and begs him not to set her free but to take her with him to England, and in this appeal describes herself as "A lady in distress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.contemplator.com/england/slady.html
 |title = Spanish Lady
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====18th century====

[[File:Dicksee-Chivalry-1885.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Bernard Dicksee]]. ''Chivalry'']]

The damsel in distress makes her debut in the modern novel as the title character of [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Clarissa]]'' (1748), where she is menaced by the wicked seducer Lovelace.

Reprising her medieval role, the damsel in distress is a staple character of [[Gothic literature]], where she is typically incarcerated in a castle or monastery and menaced by a sadistic nobleman, or members of the religious orders. Early examples in this genre include Matilda in [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', Emily in [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'', and Antonia in [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]]' ''[[The Monk]]''.

The perils faced by this Gothic heroine were taken to an extreme by the [[Marquis de Sade]] in ''[[The Misfortunes of Virtue|Justine]]'', who exposed the [[erotic]] subtext which lay beneath the damsel-in-distress scenario.

[[File:The Knight Errant b John Everett Millais 1870.jpg|left|thumb|[[John Everett Millais]]' ''The Knight Errant'' of 1870 saves a damsel in distress and underlines the erotic subtext of the genre.]]
One exploration of the theme of the persecuted maiden is the fate of Gretchen in [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']]. According to the philosopher [[Schopenhauer]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The great Goethe has given us a distinct and visible description of this denial of the will, brought about by great misfortune and by the despair of all deliverance, in his immortal masterpiece Faust, in the story of the sufferings of Gretchen. I know of no other description in poetry. It is a perfect specimen of the second path, which leads to the denial of the will not, like the first, through the mere knowledge of the suffering of the whole world which one acquires voluntarily, but through the excessive pain felt in one's own person. It is true that many tragedies bring their violently willing heroes ultimately to this point of complete resignation, and then the will-to-live and its phenomenon usually end at the same time. But no description known to me brings to us the essential point of that conversion so distinctly and so free from everything extraneous as the one mentioned in Faust'' ([[The World as Will and Representation]], Vol. I, §68)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====19th century====

The misadventures of the damsel in distress of the Gothic continued in a somewhat caricatured form in Victorian [[melodrama]]. According to Michael Booth in his classic study ''English Melodrama'' the Victorian stage melodrama featured a limited number of stock characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an old man, an old woman, a comic man and a comic woman engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. Often the good but not very clever hero is duped by a scheming villain, who has eyes on the damsel in distress until fate intervenes to ensure the triumph of good over evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = Michael |last = Booth |title = English Melodrama |publisher = Herbert Jenkins |year = 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such melodrama influenced the fledgling cinema industry and led to damsels in distress being the subject of many early silent films, especially those that were made as multi-episode serials. Early examples include ''[[The Adventures of Kathlyn]]'' in 1913 and ''[[The Hazards of Helen]]'', which ran from 1914 to 1917. The silent movie heroines frequently faced new perils provided by the industrial revolution and catering to the new medium's need for visual spectacle. Here we find the heroine tied to a railway track, burning buildings, and explosions. Sawmills were another stereotypical danger of the industrial age, as recorded in a popular song from a later era:
{{cquote|... A bad gunslinger called Salty Sam was chasin' poor Sweet Sue&lt;br&gt;
He trapped her in the old sawmill and said with an evil laugh,&lt;br&gt;
If you don't give me the deed to your ranch&lt;br&gt;
I'll saw you all in half!&lt;br&gt;
And then he grabbed her (and then)&lt;br&gt;
He tied her up (and then)&lt;br&gt;
He turned on the bandsaw (and then, and then...!) ...

====20th century====
[[File:Perilsofnyoka.JPG|thumb|Jungle girl Nyoka, played by [[Kay Aldridge]], frequently found herself in distress in ''[[Perils of Nyoka]]'']]

During the [[First World War]], the imagery of a Damsel in Distress was extensively used in Allied propaganda (see illustrations). Particularly, the Imperial German conquest and occupation of Belgium was commonly referred to as [[The Rape of Belgium]] - effectively making British and French soldiers into knights bent on saving that rape victim. This was expressed explicitly in the lyrics of ''[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song) |Keep the Home Fires Burning]]'' mentioning British boys as having gone to help a "Nation in Distress". 

A form of entertainment in which the damsel-in-distress emerged as a stereotype at this time was [[stage magic]]. Restraining attractive female assistants and imperiling them with blades and spikes became a staple of 20th century magicians' acts. Noted illusion designer and historian [[Jim Steinmeyer]] identifies the beginning of this phenomenon as coinciding with the introduction of the "[[sawing a woman in half]]" illusion. In 1921 magician [[P. T. Selbit]] became the first to present such an act to the public. Steinmeyer observes that: "Before Selbit's illusion, it was not a cliche that pretty ladies were teased and tortured by magicians. Since the days of [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin|Robert-Houdin]], both men and women were used as the subjects for magic illusions". However, changes in fashion and great social upheavals during the first decades of the 20th century made Selbit's choice of "victim" both practical and popular. The trauma of war had helped to desensitise the public to violence and the emancipation of women had changed attitudes to them. Audiences were tiring of older, more genteel forms of magic. It took something shocking, such as the horrific productions of the [[Grand Guignol]] theatre, to cause a sensation in this age. Steinmeyer concludes that: "beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment".&lt;ref name="hiding"&gt;{{cite book |title = Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible |first = Jim |last = Steinmeyer |publisher = William Heinemann/Random House |year = 2003 |pages = 277–295 |isbn = 0-434-01325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The damsel-in-distress continued as a mainstay of the comics, film, and television industries throughout the 20th century. Imperiled heroines in need of rescue were a frequent occurrence in black-and-white [[film serial]]s made by studios such as [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Mascot Pictures]], [[Republic Pictures]], and [[Universal Studios]], and in the 1930s, 40s and early 50s. These serials sometimes drew inspiration for their characters and plots from adventure novels and comic books. Notable examples include the character [[Nyoka the Jungle Girl]], whom [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] created for comic books and who was later adapted into a serial heroine in Republic productions such as ''[[Perils of Nyoka]]'' (1942). Additional classic damsels in that mold were [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], in both the novel and movie versions of ''[[Tarzan]]'', and Ann Darrow, as played by [[Fay Wray]] in the movie ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), in one of the most iconic instances. The notorious hoax documentary ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930) also featured this idea, and Wray's role was repeated by [[Jessica Lange]] and [[Naomi Watts]] in remakes. As journalist Andrew Erish has noted: "Gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits".&lt;ref name="Erish"&gt;{{Cite journal |url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/959395991.html?dids=959395991:959395991&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+8%2C+2006&amp;author=Andrew+Erish&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=E.6&amp;desc=Movies |title = Illegitimate dad of 'Kong'; One of the Depression's highest-grossing films was an outrageous fabrication, a scandalous and suggestive gorilla epic that set box office records across the country |first = Andrew |last = Erish |journal = Los Angeles Times |publisher = Los Angeles Times |date = 8 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small screen iconic portrayal, this time in children's cartoons, was [[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'s girlfriend, [[List of Underdog characters#Sweet Polly Purebred|Sweet Polly Purebred]].

Frequently cited examples of a damsel in distress in comics include [[Lois Lane]], who was eternally getting into trouble and needing to be rescued by [[Superman]], and [[Olive Oyl]], who was in a near-constant state of [[kidnapping|kidnap]], requiring her to be saved by [[Popeye]].

Damsels in distress have been cited as an example of differential treatment of genders in literature, film, and works of art. Feminist criticism of art, [[feminist film theory|film]], and [[feminist literary criticism|literature]] has often examined gender-oriented characterisation and plot, including the common "damsel in distress" trope, as perpetrating regressive and patronizing myths about women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://feministfrequency.com/video/damsel-in-distress-part-2-tropes-vs-women/|title=Damsel in Distress (Part 2) Tropes vs Women|date=28 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Alison Lurie, "Fairy Tale Liberation", ''The New York Review of Books'', v. 15, n. 11 (Dec. 17, 1970) (germinal work in the field); Donald Haase, "Feminist Fairy-Tale Scholarship: A Critical Survey and Bibliography", ''Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies'' v.14, n.1 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern writers and directors, such as [[Anita Sarkeesian]], [[Angela Carter]] and [[Jane Yolen]], have revisited classic [[fairy tale]]s and "damsel in distress" stories or collected and anthologised stories and [[Folklore|folk tales]] that break{{huh|date=January 2017}} the "damsel in distress" pattern.&lt;ref&gt;See Jane Yolen, "This Book Is For You", ''Marvels &amp; Tales'', v. 14, n. 1 (2000) (essay); Yolen, ''Not One Damsel in Distress: World folktales for Strong Girls'' (anthology); Jack Zipes, ''Don't Bet on the Prince: Contemporary Fairy Tales in North America and England'', Routledge: New York, 1986 (anthology).&lt;/ref&gt; 

While late twentieth-century feminist criticism may have highlighted alternatives to the damsel stereotype, the origins of some alternatives are to be found elsewhere. [[Joseph Campbell]]'s work on comparative mythology has provided a theoretical model for heroes throughout the history of literature, drama, and film, which has been further developed by [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] writers such as [[Christopher Vogler]]. These theories suggest that within the underlying story arc of every hero is found an episode known as the [[Monomyth#Initiation|ordeal]], where the character is almost destroyed. By surviving fear, danger, or torture the hero proves he or she has special qualities and ultimately emerges re-invented to progress to ultimate victory. Within this theory the empowered "damsel" can be a female hero rendered powerless and imperilled during her heroic ordeal but who ultimately emerges as a strong figure who claims victory; yet the male and female versions of such ordeal and empowerment still differ at a fundamental level, in that when there is a character doing the rescuing (sometimes referred to as "help unlooked for"), he is almost invariably male.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Empowered damsel==
Examples can be found in films that date back to the early days of movie making. One of the films most often associated with the stereotype of the damsel in distress, ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' (1914), in fact provides at least a partial counterexample, in that Pauline, as played by [[Pearl White]], is a strong character who decides against early marriage in favour of seeking adventure and becoming an author. Despite common belief, the film does not feature scenes with Pauline tied to a railroad track and threatened by a buzzsaw, although such scenes were incorporated into later re-creations and were also featured in other films made in the period around 1914. Academic Ben Singer has contested the idea that these "serial-queen melodramas" were male fantasies and has observed that they were marketed heavily at women.&lt;ref name="singer"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first motion picture serial made in the United States, ''[[What Happened to Mary?]]'' (1912), was released to coincide with a serial story of the same name published in McClure's ''Ladies' World'' magazine.

Empowered damsels were a feature of the serials made in the 1930s and 1940s by studios such as [[Republic Pictures]]. The "cliffhanger" scenes at the end of episodes provide many examples of female heroines bound and helpless and facing fiendish death traps. But those heroines, as played by actresses such as [[Linda Stirling]] and [[Kay Aldridge]], were often strong, assertive women who ultimately played an active part in vanquishing the villains.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

[[C.L. Moore]]'s 1934 story "[[Shambleau]]" – generally acknowledged as epoch-making in the history of [[science fiction]] – begins in what seems a classical damsel in distress situation: the protagonist, space adventurer [[Northwest Smith]], sees a "sweetly-made girl" pursued by a lynch mob intent on killing her and intervenes to save her, but finds her not a girl nor a human being at all, but a disguised alien creature, predatory and highly dangerous. Soon, Smith himself needs rescuing and barely escapes with his life.

These themes have received successive updates in modern-era characters, ranging from 'spy girls' of the 1960s to current movie and television heroines. In her book ''The Devil With James Bond'' (1967) Ann Boyd compared [[James Bond]] with an updating of the legend of [[St George]] and the "[[princess and dragon]]" genre, particularly with [[Julius No|Dr. No]]'s dragon tank. The damsel in distress theme is also very prominent in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', where the story is told in the [[First person narrative|first person]] by the young woman [[Vivienne Michel]], who is threatened with imminent rape by thugs when Bond kills them and claims her as his reward.

The female spy [[Emma Peel]] in the 1960s British television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' was often seen in "damsel in distress" situations. The character and her reactions, as portrayed by actress [[Diana Rigg]], differentiated these scenes from other movie and television scenarios where women were similarly imperilled as pure victims or pawns in the plot. A scene with Emma Peel bound and threatened with a death ray in the episode ''From Venus with Love'' is a direct parallel to James Bond's confrontation with a laser in the film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''.&lt;ref name="fromvenus"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are examples of the classic hero's ordeal as described by Campbell and Vogler. The serial heroines and Emma Peel are cited as providing inspiration for the creators of strong heroines in more recent times. Ranging from Joan Wilder in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and [[Princess Leia]] in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' to "post feminist" icons such as [[Buffy Summers]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', [[Xena]] and [[Gabrielle (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Gabrielle]] from ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'',  [[Sydney Bristow]] from ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', [[Natasha Romanoff]] from [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] from the series of the [[Kim Possible|same name]], [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] from [[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]], and [[Veronica Mars (character)|Veronica Mars]] also from the series of the [[Veronica Mars|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Reflecting these changes, [[Daphne Blake]] of the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' cartoon series (who throughout the series is captured dozens of times, falls through trap doors, etc.) is portrayed in the [[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo film]] as a wisecracking feminist heroine (quote: "I've had it with this damsel in distress thing!"). The 2009 film ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' includes a classical damsel in distress episode, where [[Irene Adler]] (played by [[Rachel McAdams]]) is helplessly bound to a conveyor belt in an industrial slaughterhouse, and is saved from being sawn in half by a chainsaw; yet in other episodes of the same film Adler is strong and assertive – for example, overcoming with contemptuous ease two thugs who sought to rob her (and robbing them instead). In the film's climax it is Adler who saves the [[British Empire]], dismantling at the last moment a device set to poison the entire membership of Parliament.

In the final scene of the 2007 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'' the traditional roles are reversed when male protagonist Robert ([[Patrick Dempsey]]) is captured by Queen Narissa ([[Susan Sarandon]]) in her dragon form. In a [[King Kong]] fashion, she carries him to the top of a New York skyscraper, until Robert's beloved [[Giselle (Disney)|Giselle]] climbs, sword in hand, to save him.

A similar role reversal is evident in [[Stieg Larsson]]'s ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', in whose climatic scene the male protagonist is captured by a mass murderer, locked in an underground torture room, chained, stripped naked, and humiliated when his female partner enters to save him and destroy the villain. Still another example is ''[[Foxglove Summer]]'', part of [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series - where the protagonist Peter Grant is bound and taken captive by the Queen of the Faeries, and it is Grant's girlfriend who comes to rescue him, riding a Steel Horse.

In [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale ''[[The Snow Queen]]'' (1844), the protagonist Gerda, a little girl, rescues her friend Kai, a little boy, from the Snow Queen. In the 2013 film adaptation ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', Gerda and Kai are substituted with the sisters Anna and Elsa respectively.

In the game the hero was Mario, and the objective of the game was to rescue a young princess named Peach. Peach was depicted as having a pink dress and blond hair. The princess was kidnapped and trapped in a castle by the villain Bowser, who is depicted as a turtle. Princess Peach appears in 15 of the main Super Mario games and is kidnapped in 13 of them. The only main games in which Peach was not kidnapped were in the North America release of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', but she was a character that can be played. Zelda became playable in some later games of the ''Legend of Zelda'' series or had the pattern altered.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!-- ref name="Objectification of Women in Video Games" --&gt;

A '''dedication''' is the expression of friendly connection or thanks by the author towards another person. The dedication has its own place on the ''dedication page'' and is part of the [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]].

==Position and function  of the dedication==
In newer books, the dedication is located on a ''dedication page'' on its own, usually on the [[Recto and verso|recto page]] after the [[Title page|main title page]] inside the [[front matter]]. It can occupy one or multiple lines depending on its importance. It can also be "in a longer version as a dedication letter or dedication preface at the book's beginning".&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Rautenberger (ed.): ''Reclams Sachlexikon des Buches'', p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the dedication's function is mainly part of the self-portrayal of the author in front of his or her readers.

==History==
[[Image:Orfeo libretto dédicace.jpg|thumb|left|The dedication of ''Orfeo'' by [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], 1609]]
Evidence of dedications is provided back into the [[Classical antiquity]]. Besides the wish to express their gratitude towards a certain person, the authors often had also other reasons to dedicate their work to a particular person. Well into the 18th century, it was not usual for [[publisher]]s to remunerate the authors; authors tended to be paid or remunerated as one element of a [[patron-client relationship]], in which the author-client paid tribute, in the dedication, to his or her patron.  A typical writer dedicated "their book to a high standing personality -- to [[Fürst]]s or [[bishop]]s -- or to a city and tried to gain some money through this practice".&lt;ref name="Hiller2002"&gt;Citation after Helmut Hiller, Stephan Füssel: ''Wörterbuch des Buches''. 6. Auflage. Vittorio Klostermann, Frankfurt am Main, 2002. {{ISBN|3-465-032209}}, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases the petitioner was lucky and received a gift from the patron. In some cases, the writer groveled before the patron and a formal dedication "contained often a very elaborate and submissive affection".&lt;ref name="Hiller2002" /&gt; In some cases not only the authors tried to get some money, but also the printers tried through dedications to cover a part of their costs.

==Themes==
A book dedication can provide a fascinating glimpse into the life and times of the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Patricia|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications|date=2015|isbn=0989870839|asin=B00VZ2YRM4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Lord Byron]] (1788–1824) engaged in a famous feud with [[Robert Southey]], who was then England's [[Poet Laureate]]. Byron wrote a mocking 17-verse dedication to his epic poem ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' in which he savagely pilloried Southey as a dull, reactionary "warbler" who had abandoned his political principles for favor and financial reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications|date=2015|isbn=|pages=281–288|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout time, book dedications were used to make political statements or to condemn war and inequality. Author [[Toni Morrison]] dedicated ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'', her 1987 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel about a fugitive slave who killed her daughter, to "Sixty Million and more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications|date=2015|isbn=|pages=173|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, book dedications reflect the tastes and mores of society. Whereas many Elizabethan dedications were erudite and witty, some modern authors have abandoned literary pretense, sometimes using profanity to shock or amuse their audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications |date=2015|isbn=|pages=13|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handwritten dedication==

The dedication is not to be confounded with the handwritten dedication of a single copy: the [[presentation copy]].

'''Deployment''' is the realisation of an application, or execution of a [[plan]], idea, [[scientific modelling|model]], [[design]], [[specification]], [[Standardization|standard]], [[algorithm]], or [[policy]].

== Industry-Specific Definitions ==

=== Computer Science ===
In [[computer science]], a deployment is a realisation of a [[technical specification]] or algorithm as a [[computer program|program]], [[software component]], or other [[computer system]] through [[computer programming]] and [[Software deployment|deployment]].  Many implementations may exist for a given specification or standard.  For example, [[web browser]]s contain implementations of [[World Wide Web Consortium]]-recommended specifications, and software development tools contain deployment of [[programming languages]].

A special case occurs in [[object-oriented programming]], when a [[concrete class|concrete]] [[class (object-oriented programming)|class]] deploys an [[interface (object-oriented programming)|interface]]; in this case the concrete class is an ''deployment'' of the interface and it includes methods which are ''deployments'' of those [[method (object-oriented programming)|method]]s specified by the interface.

=== Information Technology (IT) ===
In the IT Industry, deployment refers to post-sales process of guiding a client from purchase to use of the software or hardware that was purchased. This includes requirements analysis, scope analysis, customisations, systems integrations, user policies, user training and delivery. These steps are often overseen by a project manager using [[project management]] methodologies. [[Software Deployment]] involves several professionals that are relatively new to the knowledge based economy such as [[Business analysis|business analysts]], [[Technical analysis|technical analysts]], [[solutions architect]]s, and project managers.

To deploy a system successfully, a large number of inter-related tasks need to be carried out in an appropriate sequence. Utilising a well-proven implementation methodology and enlisting professional advice can help but often it is the number of tasks, poor planning and inadequate resourcing that causes problems with an deployment project, rather than any of the tasks being particularly difficult. Similarly with the cultural issues it is often the lack of adequate consultation and two-way communication that inhibits achievement of the desired results.

=== Political Science ===
In [[political science]], deployment refers to the carrying out of [[public policy]]. [[Legislatures]] pass laws that are then carried out by [[public servants]] working in [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic agencies]]. This process consists of rule-making, rule-administration and rule-adjudication. Factors impacting deployment include the legislative intent, the administrative capacity of the deploying bureaucracy, interest group activity and opposition, and executive support.

=== Social and Health Sciences ===
"Deployment is defined as a specified set of activities designed to put into practice an activity or program of known dimensions. According to this definition, deployment processes are purposeful and are described in sufficient detail such that independent observers can detect the presence and strength of the "specific set of activities" related to implementation. In addition, the activity or program being deployed is described in sufficient detail so that independent observers can detect its presence and strength." &lt;ref name="NIRN2014"&gt;The National Implementation Research Network&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water and Natural Resources ===
In water and natural resources, deployment refers to the actualisation of best management practices with the ultimate goals of conserving natural resources and improving the quality of water bodies.

'''Types:'''
*[[Direct changeover]]
*[[Parallel running]] or as known as parallel
*[[Pilot introduction]] or as known as pilot
*[[Well-trade]]
*[[Phased Deployment]]

== Role of End Users ==
System deployment generally benefits from high levels of user involvement and management support. User participation in the design and operation of information systems has several positive results. First, if users are heavily involved in systems design, they move opportunities to mold the system according to their priorities and business requirements, and more opportunities to control the outcome. Second, they are more likely to react positively to the change process. Incorporating user knowledge and expertise leads to better solutions.

The relationship between users and information systems specialists has traditionally been a problem area for information systems deployment efforts.  Users and information systems specialists tend to have different backgrounds, interests, and priorities. This is referred to as the user-designer communications gap. These differences lead to divergent organizational loyalties, approaches to problem solving, and vocabularies.&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"/&gt; Examples of these differences or concerns are below:

=== User Concerns ===
* Will the system deliver the information I need for my work?
* How quickly can I access the data?
* How easily can I retrieve the data?
* How much clerical support will I need to enter data into the system?
* How will the operation of the system fit into my daily business schedule?&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"&gt;Laudon, K., &amp; Laudon, J. (2010). "Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm." Eleventh  Edition (11 ed.). New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Designer Concerns ===
* How much storage space will the master file consume?
* How many lines of program code will it take to perform this function?
* How can we cut down on CPU time when we run the system?
* What are the most efficient ways of storing this data?
* What database management system should we use?&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"/&gt;

'''''Fiction Weekly''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[literary magazine]] based in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]].  ''Fiction Weekly'' was conceived in the summer of 2008 by members of the [[McNeese State University]] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA Program]] in [[creative writing]].  As its name suggests, ''Fiction Weekly'' publishes on a weekly basis; it is published exclusively on the internet and features one previously unpublished piece of [[fiction]] on its front page each week.

Authors published in ''Fiction Weekly'' have appeared in [[anthologies]] such as [[New Stories From the South]], have been nominated for the [[Pushcart Prize]], and have been published in many other well reputed literary magazines including, [[Glimmer Train]], [[The Pinch]], and [[Harpur Palate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://michelle-reed.name/5.html Reed, Michelle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fictionweekly.com/theonionwasme.htm Fiction Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of May 2010, the website had not been updated for six months. It was stated that the magazine ceased publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What it was|url=http://www.fictionweekly.com/|work=Fiction Weekly|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film censorship''' is carried out by various countries to differing degrees, sometimes as a result of powerful or relentless lobbying by organizations or individuals. Films that are banned in a particular country change over time.

==Rating systems==
A [[motion picture rating system]] is designated to classify films with regard to suitability for audiences in terms of issues such as sex, violence, substance abuse, profanity, impudence or other types of obscene content. A particular issued rating can be called a certification, classification, certificate.

==By country==
{{See also|List of banned films}}

===Australia===

Australia's [[Australian Classification Board]] (ACB), formerly known as the Office of Film and Literature Classification  (OFLC), uses the Commonwealth Classification Act 1995 as a guide for the majority of the censorship within the country; however, each state and territory is free to make additional legislation (see [[Censorship in Australia]]). Australia is regarded by many to be the most restrictive on film ratings of all Western democratic countries, considering its history and prolific "refusal of classification" (tantamount to banning in other countries) to certain films, although restrictions have eased over the years.

In practice, films still get a short cinematic run before they are reviewed and prevented from being shown at cinemas or released on DVD. This is not a comprehensive list; many films that have been previously banned are not mentioned here (however, some have since been released uncut on DVD). Also not included are the numerous pornographic films deemed too excessive to release under an X18+ category, which are refused classification by the ACB.

===Brazil===
;During dictatorship (1964–1988)
During the dictatorship in Brazil, that last from 1964 to 1988, several films were banned under the Federal Law from Brazil 5536 from 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:federal:lei:1968-11-21;5536 |title=Lei nº 5.536, de 21 de Novembro de 1968 - 5536/68 :: Legislação::Lei 5536/1968 (Federal - Brasil) :: |publisher=Lexml.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During several years a project was being developed to find and publish every document on censorship in films during the dictatorship.
The project "Memory of Censorship in Brazilian Cinema" released in 2005 six thousand documents about 175 banned films during the dictatorship. And, finally, in 2007 they released documents for the last 269 films banned at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriacinebr.com.br/projeto.asp |title=:.

;After democratization (1988–)
* 1993: ''[[Beyond Citizen Kane]]'':

"On August 20, 2009, the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported that Rede Record bought the broadcasting rights of the documentary from Ellis for less than US$ 20,000."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diversao.terra.com.br/tv/noticias/0,,OI3934538-EI12993,00.html |title=Documentário vira arma de Record contra Globo - Terra Brasil |publisher=Diversao.terra.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portalimprensa.uol.com.br/portal/ultimas_noticias/2009/08/20/imprensa30235.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826185949/http://portalimprensa.uol.com.br/portal/ultimas_noticias/2009/08/20/imprensa30235.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-26 |title=Record compra direitos de documentário sobre a Rede Globo - Portal IMPRENSA |publisher=Portalimprensa.uol.com.br |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"On February 14, 2011, the newspaper Jornal do Brasil (quoting the network's spokesperson) reported that Rede Record would be broadcasting the documentary in 2011, on a date yet to be specified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogcidadania.com.br/2011/02/record-exibira-muito-alem-do-cidadao-kane/ |title=Record exibirá Muito Além do Cidadão Kane &amp;#124; Blog da Cidadania |publisher=Blogcidadania.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jornal do Brasil |url=http://www.jb.com.br/jb-premium/noticias/2011/02/14/muito-alem-do-cidadao-marinho-2/ |title=Jornal do Brasil - JB Premium - Muito além do cidadão Marinho |publisher=Jb.com.br |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1976: ''Di Cavalcanti'':

This film (short) about Di Cavalcanti was banned due a lawsuit open by Di Cavalcanti daughter, Elizabeth, in 1979. The film documented the wake and funeral of the Brazilian painter Di Cavalcanti. Since 1979 it can not be shown, at the request of his daughter Elizabeth through preliminary injunction granted by Justice, confirmed in 1983, for sentimental reasons tied with religious ideas. In 1985, the lawyer Felipe Falcon moved an action to reform the judgment, by proposing the dispossession of the film by the state on cultural grounds, to the detriment of the heirs of Di and Glauber. Yet with no solution in sight, Di Glauber must stay contained in a sealed box. 2004: In spite of everything, João Rocha ( director of Thuth Profane),nephew of the Glauber Rocha, has placed a copy on video on providers outside of Brazil: the internet users can make free downloads of the movie, proving that censor the cinema in digital age is useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pron.com.br/editoria/almanaque/news/58427/?noticia=GLAUBER+SEM+CENSURA |title=Glauber sem censura - Paraná-Online - Paranaense como você |publisher=Pron.com.br |date=2013-01-19 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://correiodobrasil.com.br/di-sem-censura/54075/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708184915/http://correiodobrasil.com.br/di-sem-censura/54075/ |archivedate=2012-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meucinediario.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/censored-films-in-brazil-1908-1988-2/ |title=CENSORED FILMS IN BRAZIL, 1908-1988 &amp;#124; DIÁRIO CINEMATOGRÁFICO |publisher=Meucinediario.wordpress.com |date=2012-07-31 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2011: ''[[A Serbian Film]]'':

''A Serbian Film'' had its release in Brazil liberated on August 5, 2011. The exception is Rio de Janeiro estate, where the film was forbidden due a lawsuit filed by the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] political party, who claim that the pedophilia scenes infringe the part of the Brazilian Constitution that protects children (Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente). The case was overturned in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/a-serbian-film-liberado-em-todo-brasil-menos-no-rio-de-janeiro-2706621|title='A Serbian Film' é liberado em todo Brasil, menos no Rio de Janeiro|date=5 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.estadao.com.br/flavia-guerra/quase-um-ano-depois-a-serbian-film-e-liberado-em-todo-o-brasil/|title=Quase um ano depois, A Serbian Film é liberado em todo o Brasil|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{main|Film censorship in Canada}}
At present, only films containing prohibited material (such as child pornography) or under court order (such as libel or copyright infringement) are banned in Canadian provinces. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===China===
{{main|Film censorship in China|Hong Kong motion picture rating system}}
Republic of China (Taiwan) has attempted age-based rating system as early as November 1948, become a democracy since the 1980s, and technically dropped censorship requirement in its film law in 2015, despite it still may not issue the Restricted rating occasionally, if the film elicits feelings of shame or disgust in persons over the age of 18. In Mainland China, film censorship, often on political grounds, is rampant. Films in Mainland China are currently reviewed by the [[State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television]] (SAPPRFT) (Chinese: 国家新闻出版广电总局) which dictates whether, when, and how a movie gets released.

===India===
{{Main article|Film censorship in India}}In India, films are censored by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), a statutory [[censorship]] and [[Motion picture content rating system|classification]] body       under the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]], [[Government of India]]. Films should be certified by the board to publicly exhibit it in India, including films shown in television. CBFC is considered to be one of the most powerful censor boards in the world due to its strict ways of functioning.

===Iran===

{{main|Film censorship in Iran}}
All films depicting anything deemed contrary to Islamic morals are banned outright in Iran.

===Ireland===
{{main|Film censorship in the Republic of Ireland}}
Due to the small size of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], films banned by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) were rarely even submitted for release in Ireland, due to the high costs of promotion and distribution for such a small audience. Similarly, BBFC cuts are often left in DVD releases, due to the difficulties in separating the two film supplies.

This changed in 2000; many of these films have since been unbanned and rated anywhere from PG to 18. During the review process it was decided that no more films would be banned for either theatre or video release, but some bans are still in place.
Banned films can still be viewed at private members' clubs with 18+ age limits.

===Israel===
All [[Germany|German]] films were banned from 1956 until 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UyIvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zN4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=971,1381626&amp;dq=israel+bans+film&amp;hl=en Israel lifts total ban on German films.] ''Canadian Jewish Chronicle Review.'' 14 April 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
{{Main article|Film censorship in Malaysia}}

===South Africa===
During the Apartheid regime, films depicting interracial couples were banned and/or censored for content - the James Bond films ''Live and Let Die'' and ''A View To A Kill'' had love scenes which were censored by the South African government.{{citation needed |date=November 2013}}

===South Korea===
{{Main article |Film censorship in South Korea}}

According to the Internet Movie Database, there are no currently-banned films in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of banned films in South Korea|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?certificates=kr:(banned)|accessdate=2010-12-17|publisher=The Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, sexual scenes have been a major issue that pits filmmakers against the Media Rating Board. Pubic hair and male or female genitalia are disallowed on the screen, unless they are digitally blurred. In rare cases extreme violence, obscene language, or certain portrayals of drug use may also be an issue. Korea has a five level rating systems; G, PG-12, PG-15, PG-18 and Restricted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Film censorship in the United Kingdom}}
The infamous [[video nasty]] list was created in 1982 to protect against obscenity. Films on this list were banned and distributors of said films were liable to be prosecuted (some of the films were banned before the list was made). This list banned 74 films at one point in the mid-1980s; the list was eventually trimmed down, and only 39 films were successfully prosecuted. Most of the films (even of the 39 successfully prosecuted) have now been approved by the [[BBFC]], cut or uncut (see [[Video Recordings Act 1984]]).

===United States===
{{Main article|Film censorship in the United States}}
The United States has no federal agency charged with either permitting or restricting the exhibition of motion pictures. Most instances of films being banned are via ordinances or proclamations by city or state governments.&lt;ref&gt;Wittern-Keller, Laura. Freedom of the Screen: Legal Challenges to State Film Censorship. University Press of Kentucky, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are instances of films being judicially found to be of an obscene nature and subject to specific laws against such material (i.e., [[child pornography]]).  Such findings are usually only legally binding in the jurisdiction of the court making such a ruling.

The established [[Cinema of the United States|film industry in the United States]] began a form of self-censorship in the late 1920s called the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] to forestall any possible formation of a federal censoring agency. In 1968, the Production Code was superseded by the [[MPAA film rating system]].

== Brief History ==
[[File:Private Screening Room.jpg|alt=Where films would be screened before public viewing|thumb|Private Screening Room]]
Film censorship, the control of the content and presentation of a film, has been a part of the film industry almost as long as it has been around.&lt;ref&gt;Helicon (2018). "The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather Guide". ''Censorship, Film''.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Britain established film censorship in 1912 and the United Stated followed a decade later. Other early efforts of censoring the film industry include the Hays Code of 1922 and the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, Dawn (2001).

'''Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|KG|}}  (6 October 1573&amp;nbsp;– 10 November 1624), (pronunciation uncertain: {{IPAc-en|'|r|ɛ|z|l|i}} "Rezley",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stopes|1922|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|aɪ|z|l|i}} "Rizely" (archaic),&lt;ref name=pms&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague-Smith|1977|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|t|s|l|i}} (present-day)&lt;ref name=pms/&gt; and {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|aɪ|ə|θ|s|l|i}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been suggested), was the only son of [[Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton]], and [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Mary Browne]], daughter of [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu]]. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] two narrative poems, ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' and ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'', were dedicated to Southampton, who is frequently identified as the [[Fair Youth]] of [[Shakespeare's Sonnets]].

==Family==
Henry Wriothesley, born 6 October 1573 at [[Cowdray House]], Sussex, was the only son of [[Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton]], by [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Mary Browne]], the only daughter of [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu]]e, and his first wife, [[Jane Browne, Viscountess Montague|Jane Radcliffe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He had two sisters, Jane, who died before 1573, and Mary (c.1567&amp;nbsp;– 1607), who in June 1585 married [[Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=128}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=12, 27}}; {{Harvnb|Elzinga|2004}};.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father's death, Southampton's mother married firstly, on 2 May 1595, as his second wife, [[Thomas Heneage|Sir Thomas Heneage]] (d. 17 October 1595), [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household]], and secondly, between 5 November 1598 and 31 January 1599, [[William Hervey, 1st Baron Hervey|Sir William Hervey]]. She died in November 1607.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=127}}; {{Harvnb|Elzinga|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
When his father died on 4 October 1581 Southampton inherited the earldom and landed income valued at £1097 6s per annum. His wardship and marriage were sold by the [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen]] to her kinsman, [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham]], for £1000. According to Akrigg, Howard then "entered into some further agreement, of which no documentation can now be found, which transferred to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] personally the custody and marriage of the young Earl, but left Howard holding his lands", and late in 1581 or early in 1582 Southampton, then eight years of age, came to live at [[Cecil House]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=21–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1585, at age twelve, Southampton entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne states that he matriculated 11 December 1585.&lt;/ref&gt; graduating M.A. on 6 June 1589.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WRTY585H|name=Wriothesley, Henry, 4th Earl of Southampton}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=28, 30}}; {{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His name was entered at the [[Gray's Inn]] legal society before he left the university, and he was admitted on 29 February 1588.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=30}}; {{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Southampton's 16th birthday, 6 October 1589, Lord Burghley noted Southampton's age in his diary, and by 1590 Burghley was negotiating with Southampton's grandfather, [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu]]e, and Southampton's mother, [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Mary]], for a marriage between Southampton and Lord Burghley's eldest granddaughter, [[Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Derby|Elizabeth Vere]], daughter of Burghley's daughter, [[Anne Cecil]], and [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].{{sfn|Honan|2012}} However the match was not to Southampton's liking, and in a letter written in November 1594, about six weeks after Southampton had turned 21, the Jesuit [[Henry Garnet]] reported the rumour that "The young Erle of Southampton refusing the Lady Veere payeth £5000 of present payment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=31–2, 39}}; {{Harvnb|Stopes|1922|pp=35–8, 86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1591 Lord Burghley's Clerk in Chancery, [[John Clapham (historian and poet)|John Clapham]], dedicated to Southampton a poem in Latin, ''Narcissus'', recounting the Greek legend of a beautiful young man who perishes through self-love. According to Akrigg, Southampton was now spending much of his time at court. He was in attendance when Queen Elizabeth visited [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in late September 1592, and was praised fulsomely in the Latin poem written by John Sandford to commemorate the Queen's visit. In October 1592 Southampton's grandfather, [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu|Viscount Montague]], died. Montague had been a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]], and on 3 May 1593 Philip Gawdy of [[Clifford's Inn]] (a law school and [[Inn of Chancery]]) wrote to his brother, [[Bassingbourne Gawdy (died 1606)|Bassingbourne Gawdy]], that Southampton had been nominated to the Order, together with the [[John Puckering|Lord Keeper]], [[Thomas Burgh, 3rd Baron Burgh|Lord Burgh]], and [[Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Lord Willoughby de Eresby]]. Shortly thereafter, in his ''Honour of the Garter'' dated 26 June 1593, [[George Peele]] referred to him as "Gentle Wriothesley, Southampton's star", claiming erroneously that an Earl of Southampton had been among the founding Knights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=33–6}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Romilly|1879|pp=521–2}}; {{Harvnb|Dyce|1829|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However it was not until 1603 that Southampton was invested in the Order under [[James VI and I|King James]].

==Southampton and Shakespeare==
[[File:Miniature of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, 1594. (Fitzwilliam Museum) cropped.png|thumb|160px|left|Henry Wriothesley at 21]]
[[File:Dedication page of The Rape of Lucrece by William Shakespeare 1594.jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Dedication (publishing)|dedication]] to Southampton of ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'', 1594]]
In 1593 [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] dedicated his narrative poem ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' to Southampton, followed in 1594 by ''The Rape of Lucrece''. Although the dedication to ''Venus and Adonis'' is more restrained, the dedication to ''The Rape of Lucrece'' is couched in extravagant terms: "The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end ... What I have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours." This type of vaunting language was not particularly unusual though, because other dedications of the day always excessively praised any noble person sponsoring the author's work &amp;ndash; mainly for political, and above all financial, reasons.

[[Nathan Drake (essayist and physician)|Nathan Drake]], in ''Shakespeare and his Times'', was the first to suggest that Southampton was not only the dedicatee of Shakespeare's two long narrative poems, but also the "Fair Youth" of the ''Sonnets''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drake|1817|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The title page refers to the "onlie begetter of these {{Not a typo|in|suing}} [[Shakespeare's Sonnets|sonnets]] Mr W.H.," and it had earlier been inferred that the ''Sonnets'' were addressed to "Mr. W.H.". Drake, however, adopting [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|Chalmers']] suggestion that one meaning of "beget" is "bring forth", argued that Mr. W.H. was merely the procurer of the manuscript rather than the "Fair Youth" addressed in the poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drake|1817|pp=58–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other adherents of the theory that Southampton was the addressee of the ''Sonnets'' have suggested that his initials, H.W. (Henry Wriothesley), were simply reversed by the publisher to conceal his identity.{{sfn|Honan|1998|p=361}} However Honan argues that although Southampton "may be involved in Shakespeare's sonnets", "there is no real likelihood that he traduced him by drawing his portrait as the fickle, treacherous Young Man of the sonnets, who is implicitly 'lascivious' (sonnet 95), 'sensual' to a 'fault' or to his 'shame' (sonnets 34, 35), and ridden with vices".{{sfn|Honan|2012}}

Despite extensive archival research, no documents have been found concerning their relationship apart from the dedications to Shakespeare's two long narrative poems. [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]], on the authority of poet and playwright [[William Davenant]] (1606 &amp;ndash; 7&amp;nbsp;April 1668), stated in his ''Life of Shakespeare'' that Southampton once gave Shakespeare £1000 to "go through with a purchase,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowe|first1=Nicholas|title=Some Account of the Life, &amp;c. of Mr. William Shakespear|date=1709|publisher=Jacob Tonson|location=London|page=x [i.e., Roman numeral 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Honan terms this a myth.{{sfn|Honan|2012}}

==The 1590s==
Southampton received dedications from other writers in the 1590s. On 27 June 1593 [[Thomas Nashe]] completed his [[picaresque novel]], ''[[The Unfortunate Traveller]]'', and dedicated it to Southampton,&lt;ref&gt;The dedication was withdrawn from the second edition.&lt;/ref&gt; terming him "a dere lover and cherisher . . . as well of the lovers of Poets, as of Poets themselves",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKerrow|1958|pp=252, 255}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=37–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1593 [[Barnabe Barnes]] published ''Parthenophil and Parthenope'' with a dedicatory sonnet to Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1595 [[Gervase Markham]] included a dedicatory sonnet to Southampton in ''The Most Honorable Tragedy of Richard Grinvile, Knight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steggle|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 1596 [[Giovanni Florio|John Florio's]] Italian/English dictionary was entered in the Stationers' Register.&lt;ref&gt;It was not published until 1598.&lt;/ref&gt; In his dedication, Florio, who was for some years in the Earl's "pay and patronage", complimented Southampton on his fluency in Italian, saying he "had become so complete a master of Italian as to have no need of travel abroad to perfect his mastery of that tongue".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1597 [[Henry Lok]] included a sonnet to Southampton among the sixty dedicatory sonnets in his ''Sundry Christian Passions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=53–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Burton]] dedicated to him a translation of [[Achilles Tatius]]'s, ''[[Leucippe and Clitophon|Clitophon and Leucippe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 1594 Southampton's friend, [[Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby|Sir Henry Danvers]], shot Henry Long, brother of Sir Walter Long, in the course of a local feud between the Danvers and Long families. Sir Henry and his elder brother, [[Charles Danvers|Sir Charles Danvers]], fled to [[Titchfield]], where Southampton sheltered them. The brothers were outlawed, and eventually escaped to the continent where they took refuge at the court of [[Henri IV of France|King Henri IV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=41–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 1595, Southampton [[jousting|jousted]] in Queen Elizabeth's [[Accession Day tilt|accession day tournament]], earning a mention in George Peele's ''Anglorum Feriae'' as "gentle and debonaire". However, according to Akrigg, "Gentle and debonair he may have been, but we never again hear of Southampton being high in the graces of Queen Elizabeth".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 1596 the Queen specifically instructed [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], not to take either Southampton or the [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]],&lt;ref&gt;According to Akrigg, Southampton and Derby were "rather close friends at this period"; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with him on an expedition for the [[Siege of Calais (1596)|Relief of Calais]], and it also appears that Southampton did not accompany Essex on the [[Capture of Cádiz|Cadiz Expedition]] that summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=56–9}}; Honan states that Southampton did go with Essex to Cadiz; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1597 Southampton challenged the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] to a duel with rapiers, requiring intervention by the Queen and Privy Council, and on 1 March stood godfather at the christening of [[Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Sir Robert Sidney's]] daughter, Bridget. Later that year Southampton was with Essex on his "inglorious" [[Islands Voyage|Voyage to the Azores]], where according to Rowland Whyte, "My Lord of Southampton fought with one of the [[Philip II of Spain|Kings]] great Men of Warre, and suncke her". On his return he made his first appearance in the [[House of Lords]] on 5 November, and was put on several committees, but became a "chronic absentee". By this time he was in serious financial difficulties, and had turned over administration of his estates to two trustees, who by the end of the year had sold some of his lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=58, 67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1598 Southampton was involved in a brawl at court with [[Ambrose Willoughby]],&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Willoughby, second son of [[Charles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham]], is also mentioned in a letter of 17 June 1602 from [[John Chamberlain (letter writer)|John Chamberlain]] to [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Sir Dudley Carleton]]: "[[Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos|Gray Bridges]] hath hurt Ambrose Willoughby in the heade and body, for abusing his father and himself at a conference of arbiterment twixt them and Mistris Bridges"; {{Harvnb|McClure|1939|p=150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the Queen's [[esquires of the body]], who had ordered him to leave the presence chamber where he was playing at [[primero]] after the Queen had retired for the evening. Southampton struck Willoughby, and "Willoughby puld of some of his locke", for which the Queen gave Willoughby thanks, saying "he had done better yf he had sent hym to the porters lodge, to see who durst have fetcht hym out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=68}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a suggestion that underlying the altercation was something Willoughby had said which caused trouble between Southampton and his mistress, [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]], one of the Queen's [[Maid of Honour|Maids of Honour]]. The Queen forbade Southampton to present himself at court, although he was soon allowed back. Nonetheless it was reported by Rowland Whyte at the beginning of February that "My Lord of Southampton is much troubled at her Majesties straungest Usage of hym". Faced with his financial difficulties and the Queen's disfavour, Southampton determined to live abroad for a time, and seized the opportunity of accompanying [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]] on an embassy to [[Henri IV of France]]. On 6 February Southampton was granted licence to travel abroad for two years, and by March he and Cecil were in [[Angers]], where on 7 March Southampton was presented to the French King.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=68–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Cecil returned to England from his failed mission in April, Southampton remained at the French court, planning to travel to Italy with [[Charles Danvers|Sir Charles Danvers]] and [[Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby|Sir Henry Danvers]], whom he had helped to escape from England in 1594 after the murder of Henry Long. At that juncture the Queen decided to pardon the Danvers brothers, and they were back in England on 30 August 1598, at which time Southampton also returned in secret, and married his pregnant mistress, [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]]. He left for the continent almost immediately, but by 3 September the Queen had learned of the marriage and consigned Elizabeth Vernon, one of her chief ladies-in-waiting, to the [[Fleet Prison]] for marrying without royal permission.

The Queen ordered Southampton to return to England forthwith, but he remained in Paris for two months, losing large sums in gambling. By the beginning of November he was back in England, also lodged in the Fleet, where he remained for a month, during which time Elizabeth Vernon gave birth to a daughter, Penelope. To add to his difficulties, Southampton was at this time involved in a dispute with his mother, the [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Dowager Countess]], over her prospective marriage to [[William Hervey, 1st Baron Hervey|Sir William Hervey]]. [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Lord Henry Howard]] was brought in to smooth matters between mother and son, and the Countess and Hervey were wed in early January 1599.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=41–6, 69–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1599, during the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] (1595–1603), Southampton went to [[Essex in Ireland|Ireland with Essex]], who made him General of the Horse, but the Queen insisted that the appointment be cancelled. Southampton remained on in personal attendance upon the Earl, rather than as an officer. However, Southampton was active during the campaign and prevented a defeat at the hands of the Irish rebels when his cavalry drove off an attack at [[Arklow]] in [[County Wicklow]]. Shortly after the [[Essex's Rebellion]] in February 1601, William Reynolds, a soldier who had served with Essex in Ireland in 1599, mentioned Southampton in a letter to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]]. Speaking of certain men involved in the Essex rebellion who had not yet been arrested, Reynolds wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=181–2}}; {{Harvnb|Duncan-Jones|1993|pp=484–6}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do mervell also what becam of pearse edmones, the earle of Essex man, borne in strand neare me, and which has had many rewards &amp; preferments by the earle essex, his villany I have often complained of, he dweles in London, he was corporall generall of the horse in Ierland under the earle of Sowthamton, he eate &amp; drank at his table and lay in his tente, the earle of Sowthamton gave him a horse, which edmones refused a 100 markes for him, the earle Sowthamton would cole and huge him in his armes and play wantonly with him. This pearse began to fawne and flatter me in Ierland offering me great curtesie, telling me what pay grases &amp; giftes they earles bestowed uppon him, therby seming to move and anymate me to desiar and looke for the like favour, But I coeld never love &amp; afecte them to make them my frends, esspecially essex whoes mynd I ever mistrusted....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Duncan-Jones, Reynolds' letter hints that 'rewards could be obtained from either or both of the two Earls in return for sexual favours'. On the other hand, Duncan-Jones concludes that Reynolds may have been a paranoid schizophrenic, and that by his own statement he had written over 200 letters to the Queen, Privy Council, and members of the clergy wherein he had "complaynid of al the abewses and vilent oppresseones &amp; sodometicall sines over flowing this land".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Duncan-Jones|1993|pp=481, 482, 484}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return from Ireland, Southampton attracted notice as a playgoer. "My Lord Southampton and Lord Rutland," wrote [[Rowland Whyte]] to [[Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester|Sir Robert Sydney]] in 1599, "come not to the court: the one doth but very seldom. They pass away the time in London merely in going to plays every day".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1844|p=clxxiii}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Southampton was deeply involved in the [[Essex's Rebellion]] of 1601, and in February of that year he was sentenced to death. Cecil, who urged the Queen to show the greatest possible degree of clemency,  obtained the [[Commutation of sentence|commutation]] of his penalty to [[life imprisonment]].

==Life under King James==
[[Image:HenryWriothesley 1594.jpg|thumb|200px|Southampton c.1600]]
On the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] Southampton resumed his place at court and received numerous honours from the new king. On the eve of the abortive rebellion of Essex he had induced the players at the [[Globe Theatre]] to revive ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and on his release from prison in 1603 he resumed his connection with the stage. In January 1605 he entertained [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] with a performance of ''Love's Labour's Lost'' by [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]] and his company, to which Shakespeare belonged, at Southampton House.&lt;ref&gt;HMC: ''Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House'', vol.16, p.415, letter of Walter Cope to Robert Cecil about Burbage.&lt;/ref&gt;

He seems to have been a born fighter, and engaged in more than one serious quarrel at court, being imprisoned for a short time in 1603 following a heated argument with Lord Grey of Wilton in front of Queen Anne. Grey, an implacable opponent of the Essex faction, was later implicated in the [[Main Plot]] and [[Bye Plot]]. Southampton was in more serious disgrace in 1621 for his determined opposition to [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. He was a volunteer on the [[Protestant]] side in Germany in 1614, and in 1617 he proposed to fit out an expedition against the [[Barbary pirates]].

Southampton was a leader among the Jacobean aristocrats who turned to modern investment practices&amp;nbsp;— "in industry, in modernizing their estates and in overseas trade and colonization."&lt;ref&gt;Margot Heinemann, "Rebel Lords, Popular Playwrights, and Political Culture: Notes on the Jacobean Patronage of the Earl of Southampton," in Brown;  p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He financed the first tinplate mill in the country, and founded an ironworks at [[Titchfield]]. He developed his properties in London, in [[Bloomsbury]] and [[Holborn]]; he revamped his country estates, participated in the efforts of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] and the [[New England Company]], and backed [[Henry Hudson]]'s search for the [[Northwest Passage]].

A significant artistic patron in the Jacobean as well as the Elizabethan era, Southampton promoted the work of [[George Chapman]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[Thomas Heywood]], and the composer [[Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger]]. Heywood's popular, expansionist dramas were compatible with Southampton's maritime and colonial interests.&lt;ref&gt;Consider Heywood's ''[[The Fair Maid of the West]]'', ''[[Fortune by Land and Sea]]'', and ''[[The Travels of the Three English Brothers]]''; Heinemann, pp. 142–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virginia Company==
[[File:Henry Wriothesley 3rd Earl of Southampton after Daniel Mytens.jpg|left|thumb|The Earl of Southampton c.1618, after a portrait by [[Daniel Mytens]], [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]
Henry Wriothesley, whose name is included in the 1605 panel of the [[New World Tapestry]], took a considerable share in promoting the colonial enterprises of the time, and was an active member of the [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company]]'s governing council. Although profits proved elusive, his other visions for the Colony based at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] were eventually accomplished. He was part of a faction within the company with Sir [[Edwin Sandys (died 1629)|Edwin Sandys]], who eventually became the Treasurer, and worked tirelessly to support the struggling venture. In addition to profits, Southampton's faction sought a permanent colony which would enlarge British territory, relieve the nation's overpopulation, and expand the market for English goods. Although profits largely eluded the Virginia Company, and it was dissolved in 1624, the other goals were accomplished.

His name is thought by many to be the origin of the naming of the harbour of [[Hampton Roads]], and the [[Hampton River]]. Although named at later dates, similar attribution may involve the town (and later city) of [[Hampton, Virginia]], as well as [[Southampton County, Virginia]] and [[Northampton County, Virginia|Northampton County]]. However, the name [[Southampton]] was not uncommon in England, including an important port city and an entire region along the southern coast, which was originally part of [[Hampshire]]. There are also variations applied in other areas of the English colonies which were not part of the Virginia Company of London's efforts, making the origin of the word and derivations of it as applied in Virginia even more debatable.

==Later life and death==
In 1624 Southampton was one of four Englishmen appointed to command troops fighting in the [[Low Countries]] against the [[Spain|Spanish]]. Shortly after their arrival the earl's eldest son, [[James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley|James Wriothesley]], succumbed to a fever at Rosendael. Five days later, on 10&amp;nbsp;November 1624, Southampton died of the same cause at [[Bergen-op-Zoom]], aged&amp;nbsp;51. Both were buried in the parish church of [[Titchfield]], [[Hampshire]].

==Marriage and issue==
[[Image:Elizabeth Vernon Countess of Southampton c 1618.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Elizabeth, Countess of Southampton c.&amp;nbsp;1618]]
In August&amp;nbsp;1598 Southampton secretly married [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]], the daughter of John Vernon of [[Hodnet]], Shropshire, by his wife Elizabeth Devereux. Elizabeth Devereux's grandfathers were the Viscount Hereford and the Earl of Huntingdon; on her father John's side, Elizabeth's family were more obscure.

They had several children, including:
*Penelope Wriothesley, who married [[William Spencer, 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton]].
*[[James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley]] (1&amp;nbsp;March 1605 &amp;ndash; 5 November 1624), who died five days before his father, of the same illness.
*[[Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton]] (10&amp;nbsp;March 1607 &amp;ndash; 16&amp;nbsp;May 1667).
*Anne Wriothesley, who married [[Robert Wallop]] (20&amp;nbsp;July 1601 &amp;ndash; 19&amp;nbsp;November 1667) of Farley Wallop.

==Portraits==
There exist numerous portraits of Southampton, in which he is depicted with dark auburn hair and blue eyes, compatible with Shakespeare's description of "a man right fair." [[John Beaumont (poet)|Sir John Beaumont]] wrote a well-known elegy in his praise, and Gervase Markham wrote of him in a tract entitled ''Honor in his Perfection, or a Treatise in Commendation of ... Henry, Earl of Oxenford, Henry, Earle of Southampton, Robert, Earl of Essex'' (1624).

In 2002 a portrait in the Cobbe collection was identified as a portrait of the youthful Earl. Showing him as an androgynous-looking young man, it is now known as the Cobbe [[Cobbe portrait#Cobbe portrait of Southampton|portrait of Southampton]].&lt;ref name = "sou"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/apr/21/artsandhumanities.highereducation| author=Anthony Holden| title= That's no lady, that's...| publisher=[[The Observer]]| date=21 April 2002| accessdate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, a further portrait believed to be of Southampton, hidden beneath a portrait of his wife Elizabeth Vernon, was discovered when the work was X-rayed in preparation for an exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | title = X-rays uncover 'hidden portrait'  | publisher = BBC News  | date = 29 April 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7372629.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The Earl has been played on screen by several different actors:
*[[Peter Egan]] in the [[BBC]] mini-series ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', 1971.
*[[Nicholas Clay]] in the TV series ''[[Will Shakespeare (TV series)|Life of Shakespeare]]'', 1978.
*[[Eddie Redmayne]] in the [[Channel 4]] mini-series ''[[Elizabeth I (2005 miniseries)|Elizabeth I]]'', 2005.
*[[Shaun Evans]] in the mini-series ''[[The Virgin Queen (TV serial)|The Virgin Queen]]'', 2006.
*[[Xavier Samuel]] in the feature film ''[[Anonymous (film)|Anonymous]]'', 2011.
*Adam Harley in the sitcom ''[[Upstart Crow]]'', 2016.

[[File:Simmons-Hermia and Lysander. A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|268px|''Hermia and Lysander. A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1870)]]
'''''Hermia and Lysander''''' is a [[watercolor]] painting created in 1870 by British [[illustrator]] and [[Miniature art|miniature]] portrait painter [[John Simmons (painter)|John Simmons]]. Based on a scene from Act II, scene II of [[William Shakespeare]]'s comedy play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', it measures {{convert|89|by|74|cm}}.{{r|Sothebys}}

Paintings of [[fairies]] had a resurgence of popularity in the 19th century with many based on scenes from ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and Simmons produced several pieces in this genre.{{r|Bonhams}} According to Christopher Wood, an expert in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art,{{r|Telegraph}} the details included in Simmons' fairy paintings were "executed with an astonishing clarity"{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=124|ps=}} and gave the impression they had been painted on a glass surface.{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=124|ps=}} The majority of Simmons' depictions of fairies were of naked females and Wood considered them the "bunny girls of the Victorian era".{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=126|ps=}}

A watercolor painting using [[gouache]],{{r|Artnet}} the artwork shows [[Hermia]] with her lover [[Lysander (Shakespeare)|Lysander]] when they are lost in an enchanted wood.{{r|Sothebys}} The couple are surrounded by a community of fairies; some are pictured in flight using their delicate wings, others are transported in chariots shackled to mice.{{r|Sothebys}} The couple are tired and disorientated, appearing unaware of the crowds of animals and fairies around them.{{r|Sothebys}} Lysander is seated and touching Hermia's fingers with one hand while indicating the soft forest moss with his other hand. It is the point in the tale of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' when he invites her to rest, saying:{{r|Sothebys}}{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The painting achieved a sale price of £42,470 when auctioned in New York by [[Sotheby's]] in May 2012, a record price for work by this artist.{{r|Post}} It had previously been auctioned by Sotheby's in London on 19 June 1984 and a decade later by Sotheby's, New York, on 25 May 1994, when it was wrongly attributed to Julius Simmons.{{r|Sothebys}}

Normally, [[copper]] or [[zinc]] plates are used as a surface or matrix, and the incisions are created by [[etching]], [[engraving]], [[drypoint]], [[aquatint]] or [[mezzotint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mustalish|first=Rachel|editor=Lisa Mintz Messinger |title=African American Artists, 1929–1945: Prints, Drawings and Paintings in the Metropolitan of Museum of Art (Metropolitan Museum of Art)|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300098774|pages=86–88|chapter=Printmaking Techniques of the WPA Printmakers}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collography|Collagraphs]] may also be printed as intaglio plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mueller White|first=Lucy |title=Printmaking as Therapy: Frameworks for Freedom|year=2002|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|isbn=1843107082|pages=108–109|chapter=Intaglio Processes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
In intaglio printing, the lines to be printed are cut into a metal plate by means either of a cutting tool called a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], held in the hand – in which case the process is called ''engraving''; or through the corrosive action of acid – in which case the process is known as ''etching''.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Margaret Holben (1987).  ''The Care of Prints and Drawings''. Nashville: The American Association for State and Local History, 1987. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In etching, for example, the plate is covered in a resin ground or an acid-resistant wax material. Using an etching needle, or a similar tool, the image is engraved into the ground, revealing the plate underneath. The plate is then dipped into acid. The acid bites into the surface of the plate where it was exposed. Biting is a printmaking term to describe the acid's etching, or incising, of the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magical-secrets.com/studio/glossary|title=Glossary – Magical-Secrets: A Printmaking Community|work=magical-secrets.com|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the plate is sufficiently bitten, the plate is removed from the acid bath, and the ground is removed to prepare for the next step in printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artelino.com/articles/intaglio_printmaking.asp|title=Intaglio Printmaking – artelino|work=artelino.com|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To print an intaglio plate, ink is applied to the surface by wiping and/or dabbing the plate to push the ink into the recessed lines, or grooves. The plate is then rubbed with [[tarlatan]] cloth to remove most of the excess ink. The final smooth wipe is often done with newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top of the plate, so that when going through the press the damp paper will be able to be squeezed into the plate's ink-filled grooves.The paper and plate are then covered by a thick blanket to ensure even pressure when going through the rolling press. The rolling press applies very high pressure through the blanket to push the paper into the grooves on the plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289562/intaglio|title=intaglio – printing|work=britannica.com|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blanket is then lifted, revealing the paper and printed image.

==Brief history==
{{Main|old master print|line engraving}}
Intaglio printmaking emerged in Europe well after the [[woodcut]] print, with the earliest known surviving examples being undated designs for playing cards made in Germany, using drypoint technique, probably in the late 1430s.&lt;ref name="Harrison219"&gt;Harrison, Charles (2006). "The printed picture in the Renaissance." In Kim Woods (Ed.), ''Making Renaissance Art''. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Engraving had been used by [[goldsmith]]s to decorate metalwork, including armor, musical instruments and religious objects since ancient times, and the [[niello]] technique, which involved rubbing an alloy into the lines to give a contrasting color, also goes back to late antiquity. Scholars and practitioners of printmaking have suggested that the idea of making prints from engraved plates may well have originated with goldsmiths' practices of taking an impression on paper of a design engraved on an object, in order to keep a record of their work, or to check the quality.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, John (1990). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a7eRj_wbwzkC&amp;pg=PA65 Complete Printmaker]''. Revised and expanded edition. New York: The Free Press. p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Griffiths|Griffiths, Antony]] (1996). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nbxFOR8ujlYC&amp;pg=PA39 Prints and Printmaking: An introduction to the history and techniques]''. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison219"/&gt;

[[Martin Schongauer]] was one of the earliest known artists to exploit the copper-engraving technique, and [[Albrecht Dürer]] is one of the most famous intaglio artists. Italian and Dutch engraving began slightly after the Germans, but were well developed by 1500. [[Drypoint]] and etching were also German inventions of the fifteenth century, probably by the [[Housebook Master]] and [[Daniel Hopfer]] respectively.

In the nineteenth century, Viennese printer [[Karel Klíč]] introduced a combined intaglio and photographic process. [[Photogravure]] retained the smooth continuous tones of photography but was printed using a chemically-etched copper plate. This permitted a photographic image to be printed on regular paper, for inclusion in books or albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photogravure|url=http://notesonphotographs.org/index.php?title=Photogravure|website=Notes on Photographs|publisher=George Eastman House|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s and 1950s the Italian security printer [[Gualtiero Giori]] brought intaglio printing into the era of high-technology by developing the first ever six-colour intaglio printing press, designed to print banknotes which combined more artistic possibilities with greater security.&lt;ref name=leeuw&gt;K. M. M. de Leeuw, Jan Bergstra, ''The History of Information Security: a Comprehensive Handbook'' (2007), p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current use==
[[File:IntaglioBookPlateUniversityOfGeorgiaTerryCollegeBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|Intaglio plate used in printmaking]]
At one time intaglio printing was used for all mass-printed materials including banknotes, stock certificates, newspapers, books, maps and magazines, fabrics, wallpapers and  [[History of music publishing#Rastell|sheet music]]. Today intaglio engraving is largely used for paper or plastic currency, banknotes, passports and occasionally for high-value postage stamps. The appearance of engraving is sometimes mimicked for items such as wedding invitations by producing an embossment around lettering printed by another process (such as [[lithography]] or [[Offset printing|offset]]) to suggest the edges of an engraving plate.

At the time of its inception Intermedia aimed to create a centre of community resource in Vancouver where artists, architects, engineers, technologists and educators could come together and explore new models and formats for the purpose of intensifying and expanding the effectiveness of creative sensibility in the community.&lt;ref name=Westell1980 &gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As time passed the aims of the group changed to focus of individual artists and small groups:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The purpose/aim of Intermedia is to help the artist realize [their self] and [their] work by providing an umbrella/shelter of cooperatively-structured, contiguous and inter-related functioning artists' groups, often service-oriented.&lt;ref name=Westell1980 &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] hosted &lt;i&gt;Intermedia Nights&lt;/i&gt;, which enabled Intermedia to reach a wide audience. The artists associated with Intermedia explored different techniques, including performance art, experimental film, correspondence art, and other media, to expand popular concepts of art. In 1972, Intermedia ceased to function as an organization.

The '''International Child Art Foundation''' is a nonprofit organization founded in 1997. Head office is in Washington, D.C. They enhance academic performance and instill global citizenship by nurturing children's creativity and developing their empathy, which are key attributes of 21st century learners and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icaf.org/about/ |title=About Us |website=International Child Art Foundation |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Children's Festival they host on every 4 years and is the world's largest international children's celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dc.about.com/od/specialevents/a/WorldChildFest.htm World Childrens Festival in Washington, DC]. About.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Inspired by [[E. Paul Torrance]]'s longitudinal and cross-cultural studies of the "4th Grade Slump", Dr. Ashfaq Ishaq created the ICAF to help children overcome this slump. The ICAF became the first national arts organization for American children and the first international arts organization for the world's children.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Ask the Expert: Q&amp;A with Ashfaq M. Ishaq]]". ''CyberTherapy &amp; Rehabilitation''. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999 the ICAF has produced the [[Arts Olympiad#World Children's Festival|World Children's Festival]] every four years on The National Mall in Washington, D.C. to honor the Arts Olympiad winners at an event of children's co-learning and co-creation.&lt;ref name=impacts&gt;[http://www.icaf.org/impact/ "Impacts"]. International Child Art Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts Olympiad==
{{Main|Arts Olympiad}}
The ICAF's flagship program is the '''Arts Olympiad.''' This art and sport program for children ages 8 to 12 is the most prestigious and largest in the world. The Arts Olympiad winners represent their cities at the '''World Children's Festival''' at the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;"[[The 5th Arts Olympiad]]". ''The Visual Art Beat.'' Salzburg, Austria April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The deadline for the 5th Arts Olympiad is May 15, 2014.  The next World Children's Festival will be held in June 2015.

==Peace Through Art Programs==
The '''Peace Through Art Programs '''tap into the creativity of children so they can visualize with the importance of peace and co-existence. Their goal is to reduce the transmission of trauma and hatred from the current generation to the future one. The program develops empathy through art and imparts leadership skills so children can co-create a peaceful future for their communities. The program also aims to repair trust in humanity of children living in conflict zones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaf.org/pdfs/Lancet-Dec2006-Ishaq%20-%20Childrens-Creativity-to-Foster-Peace.pdf "Development of Children's Creativity to Foster Peace"]. ''The Lancelet.'' Vol. 368, December 2006

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healing Arts Programs==
The '''Healing Arts Programs''' was started in response to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Asian tsunami of December 2004]]. The organization wanted to transfer the knowledge and experience gained from the treatment of the child survivors of the 9/11 attacks to help the tsunami child survivors. The''' Tsunami Healing Arts Program''' was extended to the [[U.S. Gulf Coast]] as '''Katrina Healing Arts Program''' after [[Hurricane Katrina|Hur]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r[[hurricane Katrina|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]][[Hurricane Katrina|icane Katrina.]]The ICAF partnered with the [[World Bank]] Arts Program in 2005 on its "Destruction, Reconstruction and Prevention" program to broaden the understanding of natural disasters in the international development community.&lt;ref&gt;Hardman, Shirley. [http://www.icaf.org/pdfs/Katrina%20Healing%20Arts%20Program%20-%20A%20Schoolteacher's%20Perspective.pdf "Katrina Healing Arts Program: A Schoolteacher’s Perspective"].

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
&lt;ref name=impacts/&gt;
* Approximately 5 million children in 80 countries have produced art under the ICAF programs.
* The ICAF has the distinction of having hosted the first national children's art festival in U.S. history, which took place in Washington D.C. in September 1998.
* The Congressional Arts Caucus has endorsed the Arts Olympiad for "its important national and international implications" while the [[U.S. Olympic Committee]] has granted the ICAF a license to use the "Arts Olympiad" mark.

'''''Landscape, Branchville''''' (also '''''Branchville Lane''''' or '''''Branchville''''') is an oil on canvas painting by [[John Henry Twachtman]]. Painted c. 1888, it is Twachtman's largest known work, and was painted in front of the home of his friend [[J. Alden Weir]].&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Close friends, Twachtman and Weir were members of [[The Society of American Artists]], the [[Tile Club]], and the [[Ten American Painters]], and were instructors at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Twachtman was best man at Weir's wedding, and named his son "Alden" after Weir's middle name.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/wefa/historyculture/johntwachtman.htm  National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt; A frequent guest at Weir's farm in [[Branchville (Ridgefield)|Branchville, Connecticut]], in the southeast corner of [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]], Twachtman rented a home nearby in the summer of 1888 to work alongside Weir.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/wefa/historyculture/johntwachtman.htm  National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt; Of painting in the country Twachtman wrote Weir: "I feel more and more contented with the isolation of country life. To be isolated is a fine thing and we are then nearer to nature".&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/wefa/historyculture/johntwachtman.htm  National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

Working together in Branchville, Twachtman and Weir sought to bring the lightness of touch of their watercolors and pastels to oil painting; the import of their experiments was recognized by critics when they exhibited in New York the following winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flogris.org/learning/foxchase/html/essay_impress.php Florence Griswold Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Landscape, Branchville'' was painted three years after ''Arques-la-Bataille'', the only other canvas by Twachtman of similar size. However, whereas the earlier canvas was painted with the intention of exhibiting at the [[Paris Salon]], Twachtman's rationale for the scale of ''Landscape, Branchville'' is not known.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings are exceptional within Twachtman's ouvre: but for a few canvases that extend to 40 or 50 inches in width, most of his notable paintings are less than 30 inches wide.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Twachtman John Arques la Bataille.jpg|thumb|left|''Arques-la-Bataille'', [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the only other painting by Twachtman of similar scale.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Description==

The same height and just one inch wider than ''Arques-la-Bataille'', ''Landscape, Branchville'' is a work of vastly different effect, and represents a transitional moment in Twachtman's career.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a consciously formal and carefully arranged composition— ''Arques-la-Bataille'' was painted in the studio from sketches— ''Branchville'' is characterized by a vigorous spontaneity that suggests [[plein-air]] painting.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than choosing a subject of natural grandeur for large-scale treatment, as had painters of the [[Hudson River School]], Twachtman painted an apparently unremarkable and intimate view.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

''Landscape, Branchville'' depicts the landscape, looking to the west, from the front door of Weir's home.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Sky comprises the upper third of the painting, with the land carved into diagonals by a winding path. A large tree to the right of center, extending to the top of the canvas, is the sole vertical stanchion. Composed of patches of green and reddish ocher, the ground plane is loosely painted, with the undertone of the canvas showing through toward the bottom of the canvas. The handling gibes with Twachtman's prioritization of breadth over detail.&lt;ref name="P2"&gt;Peters, 131&lt;/ref&gt; It may also reflect an increasing interest in [[French Impressionism]], examples of which had been exhibited in New York in 1886.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The forms of a similar composition in pastel entitled ''Tree by a Road'' (Cincinnati Art Museum), have been further distilled, and may have been painted after the oil.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Twachtman John Spring Landscape.jpg|thumb|right|''Spring Landscape'', c. 1888, pastel on paper. [[Huntington Museum of Art]]. One of numerous pastels Twachtman made in Branchville, and closely related to the etching ''Branchville Fields''.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 232-233&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Provenance==
Ownership of the painting went from Twachtman to Weir, who once told an art collector "I would sooner lose my right arm than sell one of Johnnie Twachtman's paintings!"&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/wefa/historyculture/johntwachtman.htm  National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1957 it was in the possession of Twachtman's son Alden, and in 1968 was bought by Harry Spiro.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 ''Landscape, Branchville'' was given to the [[Columbus Museum of Art]], which deaccessioned the painting in 2004.&lt;ref name="P2"&gt;Peters, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lapidarium''''', also known as '''''Skeletal Horses''''', is a traveling public sculpture exhibition by Mexican artist [[Gustavo Aceves]]. The installation, which addresses immigration, was installed in front of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in [[Berlin]] during May 2–10, 2015 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of [[World War II]] in Europe. It consists of 22 bronze and marble horse statues that are broken or cracked, and have a skeletal and unfinished appearance. Some pieces include human skulls within, representing immigrants who died during their journey. The work's title refers to [[lapidarium]]s, or sites where archeological findings are exhibited, creating "an association between the fragmented artworks and our shared history and past". After Berlin, the work will be installed with minor differences in other cities around the world until 2017.&lt;ref name=Neuendorf&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neuendorf|first1=Henri|title=Skeletal Horses by Gustavo Aceves Installed at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin|url=https://news.artnet.com/in-brief/gustavo-aceves-lapidarium-berlin-293453|publisher=[[Artnet]]|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7826">[[Image:Manzoni-linee.jpg|thumb|"Linea 5m 70" and "Linea 10m 99".]]
'''''Linee''''' (lines) is an [[artist's book]] by the Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]], created in 1959. Each work consists of a cardboard tube, a scroll of paper with a black line drawn down it, and a simple printed and autographed label. This label contains a brief description of the work, the work’s length, the artist’s name and the date it was created. Most of the lines were made between September and December 1959. 68 are known to have been made,&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalog Generale'', vol 1, Celant&lt;/ref&gt; each with different length strips inside.

==First public exhibition==

The first public exhibition of the ''Linee'' was at Galleria Pozzetto Chiuso in Albissola Marina, between 18 and 24 August, occasion in which Lucio Fontana Buy the Linea m 9,48.&lt;ref&gt;Pola, Francesca. Una visione internazionale. Piero Manzoni e Albisola. Electa, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The second public presentation of the lines was at the inaugural exhibition of the Galleria Azimut, Milan, a space run by Enrico Castellani and Manzoni himself, between 4 and 24 December 1959. 11 lines were exhibited unopened on wooden plinths, whilst a twelfth strip was unrolled and attached directly to the entire length of one wall. The tubes were sold for between 25 and 80 thousand lire,&lt;ref&gt;''Corriere della Sera'', Milan, 1959-12-16, quoted in ''Piero Manzoni, Catalog Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; depending on their length, which ranged from 4m 89 to 33m 63. Manzoni seems to have changed his mind about the unveiling of the twelfth strip, as he wrote in May 1960 that the tubes ‘must not be opened.’&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Shozu Yamazaki, quoted in ''Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the strips are still occasionally unrolled when exhibited.

Originally the lines, when bought, would become a personal act of unveiling by the buyer, not dissimilar to an individual reading a book. There are documentary photos by Manzoni recording one such opening. Uliano Lucas, a friend and occasional collaborator of Manzoni is shown unravelling one such line, to discover the text '15 Capo Linea' (Head Line) at the end.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni, Catalog Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p61&lt;/ref&gt; 
Once the practice of demanding that the work remained hidden had been established, however, the tubes became objects that record an unseen artistic event, at a specific moment in time; what Duchamp called ‘a kind of rendezvous’.

The artistic act of drawing the lines becomes totally obscured, replaced by an imaginary idea of what they might look like, born witness by the labels on the tube, but not revealed.
The works elevate the external text whilst diminishing the art object, implying that only the visualisation of the work in the mind’s eye is valid. This idea was to be taken further with his ''[[Artist’s Shit]]'', where the contents are unknowable without destroying the container, and reached its logical conclusion with the ''Lines of Infinite Length'', where the line only exists as a metaphysical speculation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although the Lines are hidden from view, their labels identify them as events that occurred at a particular time; they are like pieces of evidence bearing witness to the artist's activity. The object of our gaze is therefore not a finished product, but rather the remnant of an act that has transpired.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni'', Suzanne Cotter, Serpentine Gallery, 1998, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Lines of Exceptional Length'' (''Linee dalla lunghezza eccezionale'', 1960-1961)===

There were three extra works that followed the original multiple; All were lines equal to or in excess of a kilometre long, and were contained in metal cylinders.
The first, a 7,200&amp;nbsp;m line made in the presence of witnesses, was drawn on a rotary press at the Printing press for the newspaper ''Herning Avis'', Denmark, on July 4, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The work was made with a bottle filled with ink with a stopper at the top. The continuous sheet was then placed inside a zinc cylinder covered in lead sheets. Two more ''Lines of Exceptional Length'' were made on 24 July 1961, one 1,000&amp;nbsp;m long, the other 1,140 metres.

These were then placed in steel containers, and marked the beginnings of a series of cylinders Manzoni planned to leave in the principal cities of the world, which, when the lines were joined together, would be equal to the circumference of the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; This work would remain unfinished at his death, 20 months later.

== Other related works==

Another  related work on this theme are the ''Linee di Lunghezza Infinita'' of 1960 (''Lines of Infinite Length''), made of a carved piece of wood, closely resembling the original ''Linee'', and similarly labelled, but citing the length of the strip contained inside as Infinite. Since the wood is solid, it cannot contain a strip inside, any more than if there were, it couldn’t be infinitely long. The piece takes ideas Manzoni had about works existing only in the viewers imagination to their logical conclusion; the work, in effect, is impossible, containing an impossible line, and therefore can only exist in the viewer’s mind.

Six were made before Manzoni’s death, although he printed and signed more labels, which have been used to complete the edition since his death.

The ‘disappearance of the artwork as literal object’, and the elevation of the text as central to the works meaning clearly anticipates the conceptual art movement of the late 1960s.

Manzoni also prepared a mock-up of three booklets, intended to be published as part of the avant-garde magazine ''Gorgona'', Zagreb. One of these, ''Table of Assessment #3'', was a booklet featuring a continuous line running the length of the booklet. The work was never realised due to lack of funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalog Generale'', vol 1, Celant pp. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==

[[Rauschenberg]]’s ''Automobile Tire Print'', 1951 is an obvious precedent, being a scroll containing a continuous (tyre) print, which can only be seen in sections. The work is also contemporaneous with [[Tinguely]]'s ''Cyclomatic'', a big machine made of a roll of paper 1&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; km long, bicycle parts and an inkpad. When ridden by two cyclists, the work would scatter continuous bicycle tyre prints into the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=P.|last=Hulten|title=Una magia più forte della morte|publisher= Bompiani |pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Marcel Duchamp]] also provides a number of reference points, being concerned with the removal of the artist’s hand from the artwork, and attempting to negate any aesthetic decisions.

The sale of different ''Lines'' at different prices recalls [[Yves Klein]]’s "Proposition: Monochrome" exhibition in Milan, 1957, which Manzoni is known to have seen and been deeply affected by.&lt;ref&gt;''Manzoni'', Clemant, Electa 2007. p 61&lt;/ref&gt; The lines of exceptional lengths are recalled in Martin Kippenberger's "Metro-Net", a series of subway entrances intended to be built into the ground of every major city in the world, metaphysically joining them. Like Manzoni, Kippenberger would die before more than a handful were completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmediastudies.com/art/mk.htm New Media Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Enthroned Madonna of Kłodzko''' (de: Glatzer Madonna) is a [[Bohemia]]n panel painting dating from 1343-1344&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Weniger, in: Suckale R, Weniger M, Wundram M, Gotika, 2007, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; that was originally the central part of a larger winged altarpiece. The altarpiece’s donor was Archbishop [[Arnošt of Pardubice]], who is portrayed in the bottom left-hand corner.

== History of the painting ==
[[File:Arnost pardubice.jpg|thumb|left|100 px|detail:[[Arnošt of Pardubice]]]]
The altarpiece for the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monastery in Kłodzko was commissioned before 1350 by Archbishop [[Arnošt of Pardubice]], the monastery’s founder, who spent his youth at the parish church there and, as a child, reputedly had a vision of the [[Virgin Mary]]. As archbishop he was the founder of the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|Marian cult]] in the Czech lands. He is buried in the Church of the Ascension of the Virgin Mary in Kłodzko.
 
The original winged altarpiece, which included another four panels with painted scenes depicting the life of Christ (the ''Birth of Jesus'', the ''Circumcision'', the ''Flight to Egypt'' and the ''Twelve-year-old Christ in the Temple'') was seen and described by [[Bohuslav Balbín]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Matějček, 1950, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; in his work ''Vita Venerabilis Arnesti primi archiepiscopi Pragensis'' of 1664. The monastery was taken over from the [[Augustinians]] by the [[Jesuits]] and until 1618 served as a Jesuit college. Although Kłodzko was besieged and damaged during the [[Thirty Years’ War]], the altar was saved by the burgrave Johann Georg Semling and the Lutheran nobleman Adrian von Eckersdorf. After 1625 the altarpiece was the pride of the local parish church and in the 19th century it was situated in the royal grammar school in Kłodzko. From there, the painting of the enthroned Madonna was purchased in 1902 by the Berlin Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum. It now belongs to the Berlin-Dahlem State Museum.

== Description ==
This monumental picture is 186 x 95&amp;nbsp;cm large and is tempera painted on stretched canvas over a poplar panel. It is a work that comes from the circle of the [[Master of Vyšší Brod|Master of the Vyšší Brod Altarpiece]] or his follower. The motif of the Enthroned Madonna surrounded by angels, the composition of space united by the perspective-based receding of lines, the dark-skinned complexion, the unusual size of the child and the fondness for precious fabrics all have their origin in northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Pešina J, 1976, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, a series of details indicate a direct influence mediated by the Rhineland. The Madonna’s crown of leaves and richly folded veil appear as archaic French models that emerged in Bohemian book painting as soon as the early 14th century. The architecture of the throne also relates to French ivory reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Antonín Matějček, Česká malba gotická, Melantrich v Praze, 1950, pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

The soft modelling of the faces links this picture with the work of the [[Master of Vyšší Brod]]. The appearance of the Madonna and angels links it with the panel paintings The Adoration of the Magi, The Annunciation, The Resurrection and The Lamentation of the Vyšší Brod  Altarpiece.

Both the "Madonna of Veveří" and the "Strahov Madonna" belong to the same period as the Kłodzko Madonna, while the artist who painted the [[Kaufmann Crucifixion]]&lt;ref&gt;Antonín Matějček, Česká malba gotická, Melantrich v Praze, 1950, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; also belonged to a broader circle perhaps linked by previous training in the workshop of the "Master of the Klosterneuberg Altarpiece".

Compared with the Vyšší Brod panels, the Kłodzko Madonna shows several important innovations, especially in the perspectival projection of the throne, the accentuating of spatial depth through the colour-based graduating of areas, the modelling of the high relief of the drapery and in the overall human warmth of the presentation from which the entire typology of Bohemian loving Madonnas was developed right through to the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kutal J, 1972, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Massacre of the Innocents''''' is a painting by the Italian [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] painter [[Guido Reni]], created in 1611 for the [[Basilica of San Domenico]] in [[Bologna]], but now in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna|Pinacoteca Nazionale]] in that same city.&lt;ref name=Ox&gt;"RENI, Guido." in ''[[Benezit Dictionary of Artists]]'', [[Oxford Art Online]], [[Oxford University Press]]. Accessed 21 October 2013. http://www.oxfordartonline.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting is based on the biblical episode of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. The work shows a series of episodes at the same time but is classically composed with each element carefully mirrored by an answering one.&lt;ref name=Ox/&gt;

Two killer soldiers, one portrayed from behind while rushing on a screaming woman, and one kneeling towards the mothers with their children, hold knives in the right hand. The mothers are reacting in different ways: one is screaming and attempting to escape the soldiers who has grabbed her hair, another is fleeing towards the right while embracing her child, while another, in the lower left corner, is holding her child on her shoulders; another mother tries to stop a soldier with her left hand, and a kneeling woman is praying towards the sky above the children which have already been slaughtered.

'''Merton Abbey Mills''' is a former [[textile]] [[factory]] in the [[parish]] of [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]] in [[London]], England near the site of the [[Medieval England|medieval]] [[Merton Priory]], now the home of a variety of businesses, mostly retailers.

The [[River Wandle]] flowing north towards [[Wandsworth]] drove [[watermill]]s and provided water for a number of industrial processes in Merton. Merton Abbey Mills were established by [[Huguenot]] [[silk]] throwers in the early eighteenth century; there were already textile works nearby from 1667.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mertonpriory.org/history/index.html History of Merton Priory]&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbey was restructured for [[textile printing]] in the early nineteenth century and was acquired by the artist and [[textile designer]] [[William Morris]] in June 1881 as the new home of [[Morris &amp; Co.]]'s workshops. The complex, on {{convert|7|acre|m2}}, included several buildings and a [[dyeing|dyeworks]], and the various buildings were soon adapted for [[stained glass]] making, textile printing, and fabric, [[tapestry]], and [[carpet]]-[[weaving]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry, ''William Morris'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;  Morris refused to destroy existing buildings, and adapted them or built new ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mertonpriory.org/history/morris.html Merton Priory – Morris &amp; Co] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101073817/http://www.mertonpriory.org/history/morris.html |date=2008-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris employed a number of former [[Spitalfields]] silk weavers at Merton Abbey to produce hand-woven textiles, and used the gardens to grow dye plants and the water of the River Wandle to dye and rinse his fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhide, p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liberty (department store)|Liberty &amp; Co.]] had been involved with the site since the 19th century, as their popular ranges of fabrics for dress and furniture were nearly all made there by Littler and Co, Morris's immediate neighbours to the south.  In 1904 Liberty &amp; Co took over the Littler site, and then in 1940 the Morris facilities as well.  They continued to operate the Merton Abbey Mills until 1972, and textile production was continued by other firms until 1982. During World War II part of the site was used to construct gun-turrets for the [[Bristol Blenheim]] fighter-bomber.&lt;ref name="Merton Priory - Calico"&gt;[http://www.mertonpriory.org/history/calico.html Merton Priory – Calico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201123235/http://www.mertonpriory.org/history/calico.html |date=2009-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Merton Abbey Mills is a [[craft]]s market and the site of a summer theatre and music festival called Abbeyfest. A number of buildings from the Morris period, and even earlier, survive, and there are displays on the history of the site. A water-mill still turns in the summer, and the "colourhouse", a mid-18th century industrial building,&lt;ref name="Merton Priory - Calico"/&gt; is now a [http://colourhousetheatre.co.uk/rebrand children's theatre].

'''''Metropolis Symphony''''' for Orchestra (1988–93) by American composer [[Michael Daugherty]] is a five-movement [[symphony]] inspired by [[Superman]] comics. The entire piece was created over the span of five years with separate commissions for each movement. Individual movements may be performed separately; however, it is preferred that the 41 minute symphony be performed in its entirety. [[Metropolis (comics)|''Metropolis'']] ''Symphony'' was premiered by the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]], [[David Zinman]] conducting, in January 1994, at the [[Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall|Meyerhoff Concert Hall]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peermusicclassical.com/catalog/catalog_detail.cfm?catalog_id=974&amp;composer_ID=8&amp;ensemble_type_id=&amp;title=&amp;ensemble_ID=999&amp;ensemble_detail_ID=&amp;Theme_id=&amp;position=10&amp;totalcount=21 Metropolis Symphony at Peermusic Classical]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Monument to the laboratory mouse'''''  is a sculpture in the city of [[Novosibirsk]] in Siberia, [[Russia]]. It is located in a park in front of the [[Institute of Cytology and Genetics]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and was completed on July 1, 2013, coinciding with the 120th anniversary of the founding of the city.

According to Nikolai Kolchanov, the director of the institute, the monument commemorates the sacrifice of the mice in genetic research used to understand biological and physiological mechanisms for developing new drugs and curing of diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2014/01/17/a-monument-to-laboratory-rats.html|title= A monument to laboratory rats and mice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The monument, which sits on a [[granite]] pedestal, is of a laboratory [[mouse]] wearing pince-nez on the tip of its nose. The mouse holds knitting needles in its paws and is shown knitting a double helix of [[DNA]]. The bronze figure is itself only 70 cm (27½”) high, but the total height of the monument including the pedestal is 2.5 meters (98"). As a point of interest, the DNA spiral emerging from the knitting needles winds to the left, thus showing that it is the still poorly understood [[Z-DNA]] - this symbolic of scientific research that is still to be done.{{cn|date=August 2018}} In contrast, the basic form, [[B- DNA]], the form as it is depicted in school lessons, winds to the right. Schoolchildren visiting the monument are often asked what is unusual about the DNA spiral that the mouse is knitting.

==The background to the statue==
The foundation stone of the monument was laid on June 1, 2012 in honor of the 55th anniversary of the founding of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics. The design for the mouse was the creation of the [[Novosibirsk]] artist Andrey Kharkevich, who made more than ten sketches before settling on a final design. It was from among the different versions of the classic and stylized image animals that a mouse knitting the DNA helix was selected.

Andrei Kharkevich described the statue as: "Here, the images of a laboratory mouse and a scientist are combined because they are connected to each other and serve one cause. The mouse is shown at the exact time of scientific discovery. If you peer into its eyes, you can see that this mouse has already invented something. But the whole symphony of scientific discovery, joy, "Eureka!" has not yet sounded."

Sculptor Alexei Agrikolyansky, who made the statue, confessed that it had not been easy to capture that moment as the mouse was obviously not human and yet he had to produce a character and emotions for the mouse that were believable and, while maintaining the anatomical proportions, create something that neither looked like a cartoon character nor a real mouse.

The sculpture was cast from bronze in [[Tomsk]] by Maxim Petrov.

'''Native Earth Performing Arts''' is a Canadian [[theatre]] company located in [[Toronto]]. Canada’s oldest professional Indigenous theatre company, Native Earth is dedicated to developing, producing and presenting professional artistic expressions of the Indigenous experience in Canada.

Through stage productions (theatre, dance and multi-disciplinary art), new script development, apprenticeships and internships, Native Earth seeks to fulfill a community of artistic visions. It is a vision that is inclusive and reflective of the artistic directions of members of the Indigenous community who actively participate in the arts.

Native Earth Performing Arts helms Aki Studio, a 120-seat black box creation/rehearsal/performance space in Regent Park's Daniels Spectrum.

==Background==
Founded in 1982, it is the oldest professional Indigenous performing arts company in Canada. They have been central in the development of a community of Indigenous artists, and have contributed to the creation of several plays which have become canonical in Canadian drama, such as [[Tomson Highway]]'s award-winning ''[[The Rez Sisters]]'' and ''[[Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing]]'', [[Daniel David Moses]]'s ''Almighty Voice and His Wife'', [[Drew Hayden Taylor]]'s ''Someday'', and Cliff Cardinal's ''Huff''.  Native Earth hosts the annual Weesageechak Begins to Dance festival which is a showcase for emerging Indigenous theatre, dance, and multi-discipline artists.&lt;ref name = "canencyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Native Earth was able to secure government funding, which brought stability to the organization. This funding allowed Native Earth the possibility to program a season and open its own office with full-time staff.

In the same year Native Earth presented its first scripted work, [[Tomson Highway]]'s [[The Rez Sisters]] which became a hit and attracted large audiences across Canada. The Play was so successful that it was also invited to the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and received the [[Dora Mavor Moore Award]] and the [[Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award]].

In 1989 Native Earth created Weesageechak Begins to Dance an annual play festival which developed plays that often turned into full production the following year. One of the plays which was developed through this process was John McLeod's Diary of a Crazy Boy.

In 2012, the organization was described as "a formidable artistic hub for all things related to contemporary Indigenous performing arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Native Earth moved their administrative headquarters to the Daniels Spectrum, an arts and cultural centre located in Toronto's revitalized Regent Park (part of the [[Regent Park Revitalization Plan]]). They also launched Aki Studio – a 120-seat creation and performance black box space located on the main floor of the Daniels Spectrum.

The '''Netherlands Bach Society''' ({{lang-nl|'''De Nederlandse Bachvereniging'''}}) is the oldest ensemble for [[Baroque music]] in the [[Netherlands]], and possibly in the world. The ensemble was founded in 1921 in [[Naarden]] to perform [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' on [[Good Friday]] and has performed the work annually since then in the Grote of Sint-Vituskerk (Great Church or St Vitus Church). From 1983 until 2018, [[Jos van Veldhoven]] was artistic director and conductor. On May 11 in 2017, [[Shunsuke Sato]] was appointed as artistic director of the Netherlands Bach Society, beginning from June 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bachvereniging.nl/index.php/en/page/3934l ''SHUNSKE SATO NEW ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF THE NETHERLANDS BACH SOCIETY'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In 2021 the ensemble will be 100 years old. In preparation the Society is publishing a new and freely accessible recording every week, including [[HD video]] of all 1080 works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], performed by members of the ensemble and guest musicians under the title ''All of Bach''.

== History ==

=== First years ===

''De Nederlandse Bachvereniging'' was officially founded on 13 September 1921. [[Johan Schoonderbeek]] was one of the founding members and the first conductor.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;[http://www.allesopeenrij.nl/index.html?page=http://www.allesopeenrij.nl/lijsten/muziek/dirigent_matthauspas.html De dirigenten Matthäus-Passion in Naarden ] allesopeenrij.nl 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He had already conducted the ''St Matthew Passion'' with the Koninklijke Oratorium Vereniging Excelsior (Royal Oratorio Society Excelsior) in [[The Hague]]. The Netherlands Bach Society performed the ''St Matthew Passion'' first on Good Friday, 14 April 1922.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt; Following the praxis of the period, the work was not performed completely. Performances of the work became a tradition which has been kept since.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Matthew Gurewitsch: [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/arts/music/15gure.html Playing the Numbers When Putting Voice to Bach] [[The New York Times]] 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After Schoonderbeek's death in 1927, [[Evert Cornelis]], conductor of the Utrechts Symfonie Orkest, took over and was the first to conduct the complete work. He died in 1931.&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;

=== Anthon van der Horst ===

His successor was [[Anthon van der Horst]], who also was the organist of the church. He established regular performances of the ''St Matthew Passion'' and the ''[[Mass in B minor]]'' from 1931 until shortly before his death in 1965, attracting listeners from the Nederlands and abroad. He studied [[facsimile]]s and tried to keep close to the composer's intentions.&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Horst-Anthon-van-der.htm Anthon van der Horst (Conductor)] bach-cantatas.com 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In great contrast [[Willem Mengelberg]] conducted regularly on [[Palm Sunday]] in the [[Concertgebouw]] a shortened version of the ''St Matthew Passion'', in a romantic approach with choirs of 450 singers. Nevertheless the performances in Naarden and Amsterdam were similar at first, because orchestra players of the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|Concertgebouworkest]] and soloists were the same.

=== Charles de Wolff ===

[[Charles de Wolff]] was the successor of Van der Horst in 1965. During this period the Concertgebouw tradition was continued by [[Eugen Jochum]]. The [[historically informed performance]], initiated by [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]] among others, won friends within the Netherlands Bach Society, who pursued performances with smaller ensembles on period instruments. Therefore De Wolff left the Bach Society in 1983, to work with the ''Bachkoor Holland''.&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Wolff-Charles-de.htm Charles de Wolff (Conductor, Organ)] bach-cantatas.com 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program ==

Since 1983 the Netherlands Bach Society has a group of instrumentalists and singers specialized on music of the 17th and 18th century. The Bach Society performs about 50 concerts a year, concentrating on works of Bach and his [[Bach family|family]], his contemporaries and predecessors, such as [[Dietrich Buxtehude|Buxtehude]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]], [[Alessandro Grandi|Grandi]], [[Georg Friedrich Händel|Handel]], [[Servaes de Koninck|De Koninck]], [[Johann Kuhnau|Kuhnau]], [[Domenico Mazzocchi|Mazzocchi]], [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], [[Cornelis Padbrué|Padbrué]], [[Christian Ritter|Ritter]], [[Samuel Scheidt|Scheidt]], [[Johann Hermann Schein|Schein]], [[Heinrich Schütz|Schütz]], [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck|Sweelinck]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and [[Matthias Weckmann|Weckmann]].

The artistic director since 1983 has been [[Jos van Veldhoven]],&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; who conducts about half of the concerts. Guest conductors have included [[Gustav Leonhardt]], [[Paul McCreesh]], [[Philippe Herreweghe]], [[Frans Brüggen]], [[Iván Fischer]] and [[Masaaki Suzuki]]. To keep the experience of the ''St Matthew Passion'' "fresh not only for himself but also for the players and for audiences", guest conductors have been invited every other year. Some of them conducted the work for the first time in Naarden, such as [[Ton Koopman]] and [[René Jacobs]].&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; [[Atzo Nicolaï|Atzo Nicolai]], minister of the Netherlands who regularly attends, stated: "St. Matthew’ during Holy Week is bigger in the Netherlands than [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] at Christmas anywhere else".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

== Education ==

The Netherlands Bach Society has collaborated with schools in a project to create interest in Bach's [[St Matthew Passion]], reaching several hundred students and their teachers.

'''Nkisi''' or '''Nkishi''' (plural varies: ''minkisi'', ''zinkisi'', or ''nkisi'') are spirits, or [[Fetishism|an object that a spirit inhabits]]. It is frequently applied to a variety of objects used throughout the [[Congo Basin]] in [[Central Africa]] that are believed to contain spiritual powers or spirits. The term and its concept have passed with the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palomayombe.netfirms.com/beliefs.html|title=Palo Deities|date=13 April 2008|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413072928/http://palomayombe.netfirms.com/beliefs.html|archivedate=13 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
The current meaning of the term derives from the root, ''*-kitį''- referring to a spiritual entity, or material objects in which it is manifested or inhabits in Proto-Njila, an ancient subdivision of the [[Bantu language]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Vansina, ''Paths in the Rainforest:  Toward a History of Political Tradition in Equatorial Africa'' (Madison:  University of Wisconsin Press, 1990), p. 146 and 297; but see also Vansina's corrective statements in ''How Societies Are Born:   Governance in West Central Africa Before 1600 (Charlottesville, VA and London:  University of Virginia Press, 2004), pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its earliest attestations in [[Kikongo]] dialects in the early seventeenth century it was transliterated as "mokissie" (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]), as the mu- prefix in this noun class were still pronounced. It was reported by Dutch visitors to [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] in the 1668 book ''[[Description of Africa (1668 book)|Description of Africa]]'' as referring both to a material item and the spiritual entity that inhabits it.&lt;ref&gt;Olfert Dapper, ''[[Description of Africa (1668 book)|Naukeurige Beschrijvinge der Africa Gewesten]]'' (Amsterdam, 1668), p. 548 (see English translation in John Ogilby, ''Africa'' (London, 1670), p. 514).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the sixteenth century, when the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] was converted to [[Roman Catholic Church in Kongo|Christianity]], ''ukisi'' (a substance having characteristics of nkisi) was used to translate "holy" in the Kikongo [[Catechism]] of 1624.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton, "The Development of an African Catholic Church in the Kingdom of Kongo, 1491-1750," ''Journal of African History'' 25 (1984):  156-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighteenth century, the ''mu-'' prefix evolved into a simple nasal ''n-'', so the modern spelling is properly n'kisi, but many orthographies spell it nkisi (there is no language-wide accepted [[orthography]] of Kikongo).

==Use==
Close communication with ancestors and belief in the efficacy of their powers are closely associated with minkisi in [[Kongo people|Kongo]] tradition. Among the peoples of the [[Congo Basin]], especially the [[Bakongo]] and the [[Songye]] people of Kasai, exceptional human powers are frequently believed to result from some sort of communication with the dead. People known as [[nganga|banganga]]&lt;ref&gt;The plural varies according to dialect, can also be nganga with class 2 concords or zinganga.&lt;/ref&gt; (singular: [[nganga]]) work as healers, diviners, and mediators who defend the living against black magic (witchcraft) and provide them with remedies against diseases resulting either from witchcraft or the demands of [[bakisi]] (spirits), emissaries from the land of the dead.

Banganga harness the powers of bakisi and the dead by making minkisi. Minkisi are primarily containers - ceramic vessels, gourds, animal horns, shells, bundles, or any other object that can contain spiritually-charged substances. Even [[graves]] themselves, as the home of the dead and hence the home of bakisi, can be considered as minkisi. In fact, minkisi have even been described as portable graves, and many include earth or relics from the grave of a powerful individual as a prime ingredient. The powers of the dead thus infuse the object and allow the nganga to control it.&lt;ref&gt;Moncia Blackmun Visona, Robin Poynor, Herbert M Cole, ''A History of Art in Africa'' (New York:  Prentice-Hall, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The metal objects commonly pounded into the surface of the power figures represent the minkisis' active roles during ritual or ceremony. Each nail or metal piece represents a vow, a signed treaty, and efforts to abolish evil. Ultimately, these figures most commonly represent reflections upon socially unacceptable behaviors and efforts to correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/50013887|work=Power Figure (Nkisi N'Kondi: Mangaaka)|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The substances chosen for inclusion in minkisi are frequently called "''bilongo''" or "''milongo''" (singular ''nlongo'') a word often translated as "medicine."   However, their operation is not primarily pharmaceutical, as they are not applied to or ingested by those who are sick, and perhaps ''bilongo'' is more accurately translated as "therapeutic substances".  Rather they are frequently chosen for metaphoric reasons, for example, bird claws in order to catch wrongdoers, or because their names resemble characteristics of spirits in question.

Among the many common materials used in the minkisi were [[fruit]] ("luyala" in [[Kikongo]]), [[charcoal]] ("kalazima"), and [[mushrooms]] ("tondo").&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt MacGaffey, "Complexity, Astonishment and Power:  The Visual Vocabulary of Kongo ''Minkisi''" ''Journal of Southern African Studies''14:  188-204&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Minerals]] were collected from various places associated with the dead, such as earth collected from graves and riverbeds. White clay was also very important in the composition of minkisi due to the symbolic relationship of the color white and the physical aspects of dead skin as well as their moral rightness and spiritual positivity. White contrasted with black, the color of negativity. Some minkisi use red ochre as a coloring agent. The use of red is symbolic of the mediation of the powers of the dead.

Minkisi serve many purposes. Some are used in [[divination]] practices, rituals to eradicate evil or punish wrong-doers, and ceremonies for protective installments. Many are also used for healing, while others provide success in hunting or trade, among other things. Important minkisi are often credited with powers in multiple domains. Most famously, minkisi may also take the form of [[anthropomorphic]] or [[zoomorphic]] wooden carvings.

==Types==
[[File:Mangaaka.jpg|thumb|Nkisi Mangaaka power figure in [[Manchester Museum]]]]

Minkisi and the afflictions associated with them are generally classified into two types; the "of the above" and the "of the below". The above minkisi are associated with the [[sky]], [[rain]], and [[thunderstorms]]. The below minkisi are associated with the [[earth]] and [[body of water|waters]] on land. The above minkisi were considered masculine and were closely tied to violence and violent forces.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Claude Dupré,"Les système des forces ''nkisi'' chez le Kongo d'après le troisième volume de K. Laman,"  ''Africa'' 45 (1975): 12-28&lt;/ref&gt; The minkisi of the above were largely used to maintain order, serve justice, and seal treaties.

[[Birds of prey]], [[lightning]], [[weapons]], and [[fire]] are all common themes among the minkisi of the above. They also affected the upper body. Head, neck, and chest pains were said to be caused by these nkisi figures. Some figures were in the form of animals. Most often these were dogs ("''kozo''"). Dogs are closely tied to the spiritual world in Kongo mythology. They live in two separate worlds; the village of the living, and the forest of the dead. ''Kozo'' figures were often portrayed as having two heads – this was symbolic of their ability to see both worlds.

==Nkondi==
{{Main|Nkondi}}

[[Nkondi]] (plural varies ''minkondi'', ''zinkondi'') are a subclass of minkisi that are considered aggressive.  Because many of the nkondi collected in the nineteenth century were activated by having nails driven into them, they were often called "nail fetishes" in travel writing, museum catalogs, and art history literature.  Many nkondi also feature reflective surfaces, such as mirrors, on their stomach areas or the eyes, which are held to be the means of vision in the spirit world.  Although they can be made in many forms, the ones featuring a human statue with nails are the best described in anthropological and scholarly literature.

Nkondi are invoked to search out wrongdoing, enforce oaths, and cause or cure sicknesses. Perhaps the most common use was the locating and punishing of criminals, by hunting down wrongdoers and to avenging their crimes.  An oath taker may declare him or herself vulnerable to the disease caused by an nkondi should he or she violate the oath.  People who fall sick with diseases known to be associated with a particular nkondi may need to consult the nganga responsible for mediating with that spirit to determine how to be cured.

Although nkisi nkondi have probably been made since at least the sixteenth century, the specifically nailed figures, which have been the object of collection in Western museums, nailed nkondi were probably made primarily in the northern part of the Kongo cultural zone in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

==Modern impact==

The nkisi figures brought back to Europe in the nineteenth century caused great interest in stimulating emerging trends in modern art, and Bantu themes previously considered primitive or gruesome were now viewed as aesthetically interesting. The pieces became influential in art circles and many were acquired by art museums. The intentions of the banganga who created minkisi were practical, that is their characteristics were dictated by the need of the object to do the work it was required to do—hence the nails which caused a sensation were never seen as decorative items but as a requirement of awakening the spirit; or the gestures were part of a substantial metaphor of gestures found in Kongo culture.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt MacGaffey, "'Magic, or as we usually say 'Art': A Framework for Comparing African and European Art," in Enid Schildkrout and Curtis Keim, eds. ''The Scramble for Art in Central Africa,'' (Cambridge and New York:  Cambridge University Press, 1998) pp. 217-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently some modern artists have also been interested in creating nkisi of their own, most notably [[Renee Stout]], whose exhibition "Astonishment and Power" at the Smithsonian Institution coupled her own versions of nkisi with a commentary by noted anthropologist Wyatt MacGaffey.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Harris and Wyatt MacGaffey. eds. ''Astonishment and Power'' (London and Washington, DC:  Smithsonian Institution Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Organist at Lausanne Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|A cathedral organist in [[Lausanne Cathedral]]]]
An '''organist''' is a musician who plays any type of [[organ (music)|organ]]. An organist may play [[organ repertoire|solo organ works]], play with an [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] or [[orchestra]], or accompany one or more [[singers]] or [[instrumentalist|instrumental soloists]]. In addition, an organist may accompany congregational [[hymn]]-singing and play [[liturgy|liturgical music]].

==Classical and church organists==
The majority of organists, amateur and professional, are principally involved in [[church music]], playing in churches and cathedrals. The [[pipe organ]] still plays a large part in the leading of traditional [[western Christian]] worship, with roles including the accompaniment of [[hymn]]s, choral [[anthem]]s and other parts of the worship.  The degree to which the organ is involved varies depending on the church and denomination.  It also may depend on the standard of the organist.  In more provincial settings, organists may be more accurately described as pianists obliged to play the organ for worship services; nevertheless, some churches are fortunate to have trained organists capable of more elaborate "voluntaries" (the solo music before, during and after the service) and [[improvisation]].  As most churches can afford to employ only one musician, the organist is usually also responsible for directing and rehearsing the [[choir|choir(s)]]. In the twentieth-century, many pipe organs were replaced by pipe-less [[electronic organ|electronic and digital organ]]s, often as a low-cost alternative to rebuilding older pipe organs.  

In the English [[cathedral]] tradition the organist is now generally called "Director of Music", although their function is mainly in the training and direction of music rather than actual playing; there will generally be one or more assistant or sub-organists who play for most services and some recitals.  Sometimes the organist will be assisted by an [[organ scholar]].  The post of organist at most of the great cathedrals includes recital work and choral training. Another function of an organist is often as teacher to future players. Few organists hold historically special positions such as [[Carol Williams (organist)|Carol Williams]] who is the Civic Organist of San Diego, the last true Civic Organist position still active in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Medina, "Year That Began Like a Dirge for San Diego’s Organist Ends in Joy," ''New York Times'' 26 December 2011[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/27/us/san-diegos-civic-organist-survives-to-welcome-another-year.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Frederik Magle playing organ 2011 (III).jpg|thumb|The concert organist [[Frederik Magle]] in [[Koncerthuset]], Copenhagen]]
Since the strengths and weaknesses of the organ are difficult to understand without a good deal of playing experience, most music composed for organ has been written by organists.  Since the majority of pre-twentieth-century organs were installed in churches, classical organ literature was almost exclusively written for liturgical use.

Many composers, therefore, are equally known for their performance talents, some historical examples being [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[César Franck]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], [[Charles-Marie Widor]], [[Louis Vierne]], and [[Marcel Dupré]].  In Europe, the historical importance of churches as employers of musicians meant that many composers who now are very seldom remembered for their association with the organ were, nevertheless, engaged as professional organists: for example, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Edward Elgar]].

{{for| a list of notable organists | List of organists}}

===Ancient titles still in current use===
In English churches, chapels and cathedrals the Organist may also be known as ''[[Organist and Master of the Choristers|Master of the Choristers]]'', ''Choirmaster'' or ''Director of Music''; however, there are some ancient titles still in current usage:

* [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] – ''Organist and Informator Choristarum''
* [[Savoy Chapel]] – ''Master of the Music''
* [[York Minster]] – ''Master of the Music''
* [[Westminster Cathedral]] – ''Master of Music''
* [[Chichester Cathedral]] – ''Organist &amp; Master of the Choristers''
* [[Southwell Minster]] – ''Rector Chori''
* [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Armagh Cathedral]] – ''Organist &amp; Master of the Boys''
* [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent]] – ''Master of the Song School''

==Theatre organists==
The [[theatre organ]] has a separate repertoire and playing style, and in its heyday (during the first third of the twentieth century) there were considerable numbers of organists employed, many of whom played on [[Wurlitzer]] organs. A few carry on the tradition today.

==Organists in popular music==
There are many organists employed in the production of popular and jazz music.  In the United States most of them play the [[Hammond organ]], and many are classically trained, often in piano rather than organ. In England and Japan, one of the most popular series of instruments is the [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] [[Electone]]; while Electones of recent decades are more properly characterized as digital [[synthesizer]]s rather than as organs, the player interface, and the skills and coordination required to play, mean that it may be effectively regarded by some, as an organ in these respects.

== Organizations ==
The [[Royal College of Organists]] (RCO) in the [[United Kingdom]] is the oldest institution of organ studies. From that sprang the [[American Guild of Organists]] (AGO), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Gesellschaft der Orgelfreunde|de}} (GdO) in Germany, and the [[Royal Canadian College of Organists]] (RCCO). The '''Incorporated Association of Organists''' is an international society fulfilling a similar role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Incorporated Association of Organists (IAO) |url=http://iao.org.uk/ |website=iao.org.uk |publisher=IAO |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these institutions are oriented toward the organist involved in [[European classical music|classical music]] rather than [[popular music]]. There is also the [[American Theatre Organ Society]].

'''The Buen Retiro Park''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Parque del Buen Retiro'', literally "Park of the Pleasant Retreat", or simply ''El Retiro'') is one of the largest parks of the city of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The park belonged to the [[Spanish Monarchy]] until the late 19th century, when it became a public park.

==Location==
The Buen  Retiro Park is a large and popular {{Convert|1.4|km²|acre|abbr=on}} park at the edge of the city centre, very close to the [[Puerta de Alcalá]] and not far from the [[Prado Museum]]. A magnificent park, filled with beautiful sculptures and monuments, galleries, a peaceful lake, and a host to a variety of events, it is one of Madrid's premier attractions. The park is entirely surrounded by the present-day city.

==History of the park and palace==
In 1505, at the time of [[Isabella I]] (r. 1474–1504) the Jeronimos monastery was moved from an unsuitable location elsewhere to the present site of [[Iglesia de San Jerónimo el Real|San Jeronimo el Real Church]], and a new monastery built in [[Isabelline Gothic]] style. The royal family had a retreat built as part of the church.

King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] (r. 1556–1598) moved the Spanish court to Madrid in 1561. Philip had the Retiro enlarged by his architect [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]], and formal [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] of trees were laid out.

The gardens were extended in the 1620s, when [[Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares]], [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]'s powerful favourite, gave the king several tracts of land in the vicinity for the Court's recreational use. Olivares determined to build, in a place that the king liked, a royal house which should be superior to those villas that Roman nobles had been setting up in the hilly outskirts of Rome during the previous century. Although this second royal residence was to be built in what were then outlying areas of Madrid, it was actually not far from the existing [[Alcázar]] or fortress residence, and the location in a cool, wooded area proved to be ideal.

In the 1630s, under the supervision of architects [[Giovanni Battista Crescenzi]] and [[Alonso Carbonell]], several buildings were erected in great haste, two of which are still standing: the "Casón del Buen Retiro" which served as a ballroom, and the "[[Salón de Reinos]]" (Hall of Kingdoms), its wall decorated with paintings by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] and [[Zurbarán]] and frescoes by [[Luca Giordano]].&lt;ref&gt;The creation of Buen Retiro is narrated in Jonathan Brown and J.H. Elliott, ''A Palace for a King: the Buen Retiro and the Court of Philip IV'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Count-Duke of Olivares commissioned the park in the 1630s, worked on by [[Cosimo Lotti]], a garden designer who had worked under [[Bernardo Buontalenti]] on the layout of the [[Boboli Gardens]] for [[Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany]]. Water was a distinguishing trait of the garden from the outset: the great pond, ''Estanque del Retiro'', which served as the setting for mock naval battles and other aquatic displays, the great canal, the narrow channel, the chamfered or bellflower pond, created —along with the chapels— the basic layout of the gardens. Buen Retiro was described as "''The world art wonder of the time''",&lt;!--by whom, so that it is not mere puff?--&gt; probably the last great creation of the [[Renaissance in Spain]]. Buen Retiro became the center of [[Habsburg]] court life at a time when Spain was the foremost power in the world. During the reigns of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] and [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] several magnificent plays were performed in the park for the royal family and the court.

The gardens were neglected after the death of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] in 1665, but have been restored and changed on many occasions, notably after being opened to the public in 1767 and becoming the property of the municipality in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenvisit.com/garden/parque_del_buen_retiro|title=Parque del Buen Retiro|work=gardenvisit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] (1700–1746) ordered the creation of a [[parterre]], the only French-style garden in the complex. During the reign of [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]], Buen Retiro was the setting for magnificent Italian operas. [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] (1759–1788) saw to the beautification of its perimeter, replacing the old walls with elegant wrought-iron railings. [[Juan de Villanueva]]'s Astronomical [[Royal Observatory of Madrid|Observatory]] was built during the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] (1788–1808).

The [[Buen Retiro Palace]] was used until the era of Charles III. Most of the palace was destroyed during the [[Peninsular War]] (1807–1814) with the [[First French Empire]].

The reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabella II]] saw profound changes in the "Retiro". During the queen's minority, the gardens enjoyed a particularly prosperous period, with the planting of shade and fruit trees, and previously unplanted areas like the "Campo Grande", were landscaped as well. The gardens eventually passed to public ownership in 1868, at the time of the overthrow of Queen Isabella. In 1883 it hosted the [[Exposición Nacional de Minería (1883)|Exposición Nacional de Minería]].

''El Retiro'' gradually became the green heart of the city. At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Monument to Alfonso XII of Spain]] was erected next to the pond, designed by architect [[José Grases Riera]]. Countless statues, fountains and commemorative monuments have filled the park and converted it into an open-air sculpture museum.

The nineteen-thirties and forties witnessed the creation of new gardens attributed to Chief Gardener Cecilio Rodriguez who designed and built the [[rose garden]].

[[File:Fonte do Anjo Caído.jpg|thumbnail|Fountain of the Fallen Angel (detail)]]

==Features of the Park==
Close to the northern entrance of the park is the ''Estanque del Retiro'' ("''Retiro  Pond''"), a large artificial pond. Next to it is the monument to King [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]], featuring a semicircular colonnade and an equestrian statue of the monarch on the top of a tall central core.

The Rosaleda rose garden. Among the many rose bushes of all kinds stands the [[Fountain of the Fallen Angel]], erected in 1922, whose main sculpture ''El Angel Caído'' (at the top) is a work by [[Ricardo Bellver]] (1845–1924) inspired by a passage from [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'',&lt;ref name="Milton"&gt;''Catálogo de la Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes'' ("''Catalogue of the National Fine Arts Exhibition''"), Madrid, 1878, p. 86-87. Also mentioned, among others, by professor Carlos Reyero in his book ''Escultura, museo y estado en la España del siglo XIX: historia, significado y catálogo de la colección nacional de escultura moderna, 1856-1906'', [[Alicante]], 2002, {{ISBN|84-931949-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents [[Lucifer]] falling from Heaven. It is claimed that this statue is the only known public monument of Satan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The few remaining buildings of the Buen Retiro Palace, including Casón del Buen Retiro and the [[Salon de Reinos]], now house museum collections. The Casón has a collection of 19th- and 20th-century paintings, including art by the Spanish painter [[Joaquín Sorolla]]. The Ejército, one of Spain's foremost Army museums, has moved to Toledo.

Since assuming its role as a public park the late 19th century, the "Parque del Retiro" has been used as a venue for various international exhibitions. Several emblematic buildings have remained as testimony to such events, including the Mining building, popularly known as the [[Velázquez Palace]] (1884) by architect [[Ricardo Velázquez Bosco]], who also designed the ''[[Palacio de Cristal]]'' ("''Crystal Palace''"), a glass pavilion inspired by [[The Crystal Palace]] in [[London]], undoubtedly the gardens' most extraordinary building. Built along with its artificial pond in 1887 for the Philippine Islands Exhibitions, the Palacio de Cristal was first used to display flower species indigenous to the archipelago. The landscape-style gardens located in the former "Campo Grande" are also a reminder of the international exhibitions that have taken place here in the past.

The Paseo de la Argentina, also popularly known as '''Paseo de las Estatuas''' ("''Statue Walk''"), is decorated with some of the statues of kings from the [[Royal Palace, Madrid|Royal Palace]], sculpted between 1750 and 1753.

There are now art galleries in the ''Crystal Palace'', ''[[Palacio de Velázquez]]'', and ''Casa de Vacas''.

In the Retiro Park is also the [[Forest of Remembrance]] (''Bosque del recuerdo''), a memorial monument to commemorate the 191 victims of the [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks]].

==Activities==
From late May through early October,&lt;ref name="WebberReviewBandaSinfonica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zarzuela.net/ref/reviews/banda_0605.htm |title= Banda Sinfónica Municipal de Madrid |author= Christopher Webber |work= |date= 21 May 2006 |quote= One of Madrid's most pleasant summer traditions is that of band music in the Parque de el Retiro. The Banda Sinfónica de Madrid gather in the handsome bandstand close to the Calle de Alcalá every Sunday lunchtime between late May and early October to present varied repertoire extending from [[Isaac Albéniz|Albéniz]] and [[Enrique Granados|Granados]] through [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] to [[zarzuela]] selections and popular [[pasodoble]]s. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  every Sunday at midday, the Banda Sinfónica de Madrid gives free concerts from the [[bandstand]] in the park near the Calle de Alcalá. [[Manuel Lillo Torregrosa]] composed 'Kiosko del Retiro' to this bandstand.

The Park also features an annual Book Fair. Not only is there an annual book fair, but shelves for used books where people will drop off their used books, magazines, or newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://showmespain.blogspot.com/2007/06/walk-through-retiro-part-i.html|title=Show Me...

There is also an outdoor exercising area for both the old and the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/11/05/videos/1194276479.html|title=Un gimnasio al aire libre para mayores|work=elmundo.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the older one includes equipment to stretch,  keep arthritis in check, and keeps the elderly active with things such as bicycle pedals. The younger portion includes bars for triceps dips, pull-ups, sit-ups, and locals have brought bigger stones to use as weights.

Around the lake, Retiro Pond, many puppet shows perform, and all manner of street performers and fortune tellers. Rowboats can be rented to paddle about the Estanque, and horse-drawn carriages are available. If rowing is not your forte there is a solar powered boat you can book passage on.&lt;ref name="Madrid Infantil"/&gt;

Retiro provides multiple different sports courts that are managed by the city.&lt;ref name="Madrid Infantil"/&gt;

For children there are multiple playground areas as well as ponds throughout the park with ducks you can feed.&lt;ref name="Madrid Infantil"/&gt; The inside of the [[Palacio de Cristal]] has been modified to include the edition of a stone slide in the interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museoreinasofia.es/actividades/gymkana-cultural-retiro|title=Actividad - Gymkana cultural en el Retiro -|work=museoreinasofia.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major paths and walkways are used by families, runners, bikers and rollerbladers.

'''''Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV''''' is a 2011 book by political commentator [[Ben Shapiro]]. In it he argues that [[TV producer|producers]], executives and [[screenwriting|writers]] in the [[entertainment industry]] are using [[television]] to promote a [[Socialism|socialist]] political agenda.

==Content==
As one part of the evidence, Shapiro presents statements from taped interviews made by celebrities and TV show creators from Hollywood whom he interviewed for the book. The book include quotes from, among others, the co-creator of ''[[Friends]]'', [[Marta Kauffman]], and the creator of ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' and ''[[the Golden Girls]]'', [[Susan Harris]]. Another argument is that [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] are shunned in the industry.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/02/us-hollywood-idUSTRE7517JQ20110602 |title= TV executives confirm Hollywood's liberal agenda |author= Paul Bond |date= June 2, 2011|work= |publisher= Reuters |access-date=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Vin Di Bona]], a producer responsible for many hit television shows, agreed during an interview with Shapiro that Hollywood promotes a liberal political agenda, commenting, "I'm happy about it, actually." Di Bona also said that ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'', the cult hit show on which he was a producer, promoted an [[anti-gun movement]] position, as the character of MacGyver does not use a gun, but rather his own intelligence. People involved with television shows ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' and ''[[Happy Days]]'' told Shapiro that they possessed [[pacifistic]] and anti-[[Vietnam War]] agendas.&lt;ref name="The Data Lounge"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/sesame-streets-pinko-puppets-brainwash-our-kids-2290418.html |title=Sesame Street's pinko puppets brainwash our kids |author=Guy Adams | publisher = The Independent |date=May 29, 2011 |access-date=June 15, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'' which is accused of deliberately spreading left-wing propaganda to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/elmo_really_pinko_ppKu2hreGFpo4QFm8PG9DO|title=Elmo's really a pinko|last=Fagen|first=Cynthia R.|date=May 31, 2011|publisher=''[[New York Post]]''|access-date=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer [[Leonard Goldberg]] stated to Shapiro that in the industry liberalism is "100 percent dominant, and anyone who denies it is kidding, or not telling the truth", and when Shapiro asked if politics are a barrier to entry replied, "Absolutely".

Producer and director [[Nicholas Meyer]] replied "Well, I hope so," when asked if conservatives are discriminated against, and stated regarding the 1983 made-for-TV film ''[[The Day After]]'' that, "My private, grandiose notion was that this movie would unseat [[Ronald Reagan]] when he ran for re-election."

Executive [[Fred Silverman]] stated regarding TV comedy nowadays that "...there’s only one perspective, and it’s a very progressive perspective. And if you want the other perspective... well it's just not there right now."

TV series ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'' creator [[John Langley]] stated that he prefers showing segments where whites are the criminals because he fears that he would be promoting negative stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tv-executives-admit-taped-interviews-193116 Paul Bond, "TV Executives Admit in Taped Interviews That Hollywood Pushes a Liberal Agenda" (Exclusive Video), June 1, 2011, ''The Hollywood Reporter'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro states that he was "...shocked by the openness of the Hollywood crowd when it came to admitting anti-conservative discrimination inside the industry".&lt;ref name="The Data Lounge"/&gt; He argues that [[nepotism]] in Hollywood rarely is familial, but rather is ideological by friends hiring friends with the same ideological views:&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; "The same people who talk about tolerance and diversity have no tolerance for ideological diversity."&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; He also states: "...the liberal content we see on primetime television and in daytime soaps is typically hidden in plot and character...I go through probably 100 shows in detail in Primetime Propaganda – and virtually all of them are messaged, either blatantly or subtly."&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

Portions of some of the interviews which were released onto the internet to promote the book, particularly the Di Bona interview, caused director and producer [[Lionel Chetwynd]] to resign from the [[Caucus for Producers, Writers &amp; Directors]]. In an open letter, he wrote about the reaction of other members of the caucus to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politicians: "In preparing his book, Mr. Shapiro interviewed a large number of our Hollywood notables on the subject of diversity -- not the sacrosanct melange of race, religion, gender orientation and the like, but a more challenging diversity: that of opinion and policy. The vast majority felt quite comfortable endorsing discrimination against those whose political philosophy was not rooted in the reflexive Leftism of Hollywood," and "I knew most of my fellow members looked upon the political positions of these people as distasteful; what I now understand is the disgust was not for their views, but for their very person".&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038054 |title= TV tome: Left has heft |author= Ted Johnson |date= June 6, 2011 |work= |publisher= Variety |access-date=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument by Shapiro is that Hollywood has overemphasized the importance of the 18–49-year-old market for advertisers. Initially, as admitted by executives during the taped interviews, this view was promoted by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the late 1960s since the [[television network|network]] had poor ratings and needed to increase advertising revenue in some way.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/269181/switching-tv-right-interview|title=Page not found|author=|date=June 15, 2011|website=National Review|access-date=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro argues that the situation may change quickly in the future since new technologies, such as content delivered by the Internet, may dramatically change the media landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/06/primetime_propaganda.html Carol A. Taber, "Primetime Propaganda", June 2, 2011, ''American Thinker'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interview techniques===
Shapiro explained how he was able to interview numerous celebrities for the book: "I...told them I was profiling the biggest names in Hollywood over the last 50 years...They must have assumed that with a name like Shapiro and a [[Harvard Law]] credential, there was no need to Google; I would have to be a leftist.  When I spoke with them, I used certain liberal code words – 'social justice,' 'tolerance,' 'diversity.'  And they spoke freely with me, with permission to tape."&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frontpagemag.com/2011/05/31/primetime-propaganda/ |title=Primetime Propaganda Interview with Ben Shapiro |author= Jamie Glazov|date= May 31, 2011 |access-date=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vin Di Bona stood by the statements quoted from his interview but added that the material "was obtained in a duplicitous manner", accusing Shapiro of misrepresenting the nature of his book prior to interview.&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt; Marta Kauffman said that "The idea that we are pushing an agenda is nonsense," adding that "...the dangerous thing about the book is it implies we don't want a dialogue."&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt; Another of the interviewees, [[George Schlatter]], rejected suggestions that Hollywood is conspiring to exclude the conservative perspective and accused the right wing of being "guilty of everything they accuse the left wing of".&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing the book and interviewing Shapiro, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reporter Patrick Goldstein questioned Shapiro citing ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as examples, as Goldstein argued those shows have ..."gone over like gangbusters with middle America."&lt;ref name="LAT 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Patrick|title='Propaganda' is hard to prove|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2011/jun/13/news/sns-lat-propaganda-hard-to-prove-20110613|accessdate=June 27, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Private press''' is a term used in the field of [[book collecting]] to describe a [[printing press]] operated as an artistic or craft-based endeavor, rather than as a purely commercial venture. The term is also used in the [[Gramophone record|record]] collecting field to describe records released in small runs by individuals, as opposed to records released by record labels.

== Private press movement ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The term "private press" is often used to refer to a movement in book production which flourished around the turn of the 20th century under the influence of the scholar-artisans [[William Morris]], Sir [[Emery Walker]] and their followers. The movement is often considered to have begun with the founding of Morris' [[Kelmscott Press]] in 1890, following a lecture on printing given by Walker at the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] in November 1888. Those involved in the movement created books by traditional printing and binding methods, with an emphasis on the book as a work of art and manual skill, as well as a medium for the transmission of information. Morris was greatly influenced by medieval printed books and the 'Kelmscott style' had a great, and not always positive, influence on later private presses and commercial book-design. The movement was an offshoot of the Arts and Crafts movement, and represented a rejection of the cheap mechanised book-production methods which developed in the Victorian era. The books were made with high-quality materials (handmade paper, traditional inks and, in some cases, specially designed typefaces), and were often bound by hand. Careful consideration was given to format, page design, type, illustration and binding, in order to produce a unified whole. The movement dwindled during the worldwide depression of the 1930s, as the market for luxury goods evaporated. Since the 1950s, there has been a resurgence of interest, especially among artists, in the experimental use of [[letterpress printing]], paper-making and hand-bookbinding in producing small editions of 'artists' books', and among amateur (and a few professional) enthusiasts for traditional printing methods and for the production 'values' of the private press movement.

In [[New Zealand]] university private presses have been significant in the private press movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vangioni|first1=Peter|title=Pressed Letters: Fine Printing in New Zealand since 1975, 30 August – 24 September 2012|date=2012|publisher=Christchurch Art Gallery|location=Christchurch, NZ |url= http://christchurchartgallery.org.nz/media/uploads/2012_11/Pressed_Letters_booklet.pdf |accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private presses are active at three New Zealand universities: Auckland ([[Holloway Press]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Holloway Press|url=http://www.hollowaypress.auckland.ac.nz/|website=The University of Auckland |publisher=The University of Auckland|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Victoria (Wai-te-ata Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wai-te-Ata Press|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/wtapress/|website=Victoria University of Wellington |publisher=Victoria University of Wellington|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Otago (Otakou Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Otakou Press|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/library/exhibitions/burns/otakou.html|website=University of Otago Library, Special Collections Exhibitions|publisher=University of Otago|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10037">'''RUCAPS''' (Riyadh University Computer Aided Production System) was a [[computer aided design]] (CAD) system for [[architect]]s, first developed during the 1970s and 1980s, and today credited as a forerunner of [[Building Information Modelling]] (BIM). It ran on [[minicomputer]]s from [[Prime Computer]] and [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC).

==Development==
The system was initially developed by two graduates of [[Liverpool University]], Dr John Davison and John Watts in the early 1970s. They took their work to architects Gollins Melvin Ward ([[GMW Architects]]) in London in the late 1970s, and developed it whilst working on a project for [[Riyadh University]]. It became the Really Universal Computer Aided Production System (RUCAPS), and from 1977 was sold through GMW Computers Ltd in several countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=Port&gt;{{cite book|last1=Port|first1=Stanley|title=The Management of CAD for Construction|date=1989|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781468466058}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'building model' (in the sense of BIM as used today) was first used in papers in the mid-1980s: in a 1985 paper by Simon Ruffle,&lt;ref&gt;Ruffle S. (1985) "Architectural design exposed: from computer-aided-drawing to computer-aided-design" Environments and Planning B: Planning and Design 1986 March 7 pp 385-389.&lt;/ref&gt; and later in a 1986 paper by Robert Aish&lt;ref&gt;Aish, R. (1986) "Building Modelling: The Key to Integrated Construction CAD" CIB 5th International Symposium on the Use of Computers for Environmental Engineering related to Building, 7–9 July.&lt;/ref&gt; - then at GMW Computers - referring to the software's use at London's Heathrow Airport.&lt;ref&gt;cited by Laiserin, Jerry (2008), Foreword to Eastman, C., ''et al'' (2008), ''op cit'', p.xii&lt;/ref&gt;

RUCAPS was a significant milestone in the development of building modellers, selling many hundreds of copies during the early 1980s when CAD was rare and expensive, and introducing thousands of architects to computer aided design. It is regarded as a forerunner to today's BIM software,&lt;ref name=Eastman1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastman|first1=Chuck|last2=Tiecholz|first2=Paul|last3=Sacks|first3=Rafael|last4=Liston|first4=Kathleen |title= BIM Handbook: a Guide to Building Information Modeling for owners, managers, designers, engineers, and contractors |date=2008|publisher=John Wiley|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9780470185285|edition=1st|pages=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eastman2&gt;{{cite book |last1= Eastman |first1=Chuck |last2=Tiecholz |first2=Paul |last3=Sacks |first3=Rafael |last4=Liston |first4=Kathleen |year = 2011 |title= BIM Handbook: A Guide to Building Information Modeling for Owners, Managers, Designers, Engineers and Contractors | location = Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=John Wiley|edition=2nd |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen by some writers, e.g.: Jerry Laiserin, as the inspiration behind [[Autodesk]]'s [[Autodesk Revit|Revit]]:

:''While Autodesk Revit may not contain genomic snippets of Reflex code, Revit clearly is spiritual heir to a lineage of BIM "begats" — RUCAPS begat Sonata, Sonata begat Reflex, and Reflex begat Revit.''&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://laiserin.com/features/issue17/feature02.php LaiserinLetterLetters]" (see Laiserin's comment to letter from John Mullan), ''The Laiserin Letter'', January 06 2003.{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RUCAPS was superseded in the mid-late 1980s by [[Sonata (building design software)|Sonata]], developed by Jonathan Ingram. This was sold to T2 Solutions (renamed from GMW Computers in 1987),&lt;ref name=Port /&gt; which was eventually bought by Alias|Wavefront&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite news|last1=Day|first1=Martyn|title=Intelligent Architectural Modeling|url=http://www.caddigest.com/subjects/aec/select/Intelligent_modeling_day.htm|accessdate=15 June 2015|work=AEC Magazine|date=September 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072947/http://www.caddigest.com/subjects/aec/select/Intelligent_modeling_day.htm|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then "disappeared in a mysterious, corporate black hole, somewhere in eastern Canada in 1992."&lt;ref name=Crotty&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crotty|first1=Ray|title=The Impact of Building Information Modelling: Transforming Construction|date=2012|publisher=SPON/Routledge|location=London|isbn=9781136860560|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingram then went on to develop [[Reflex (building design software)|Reflex]], bought out by Parametric Technology Corporation ([[PTC (software company)|PTC]]) in 1996.&lt;ref name=Crotty /&gt;

===Comparison with BIM===
In 1984, RUCAPS was described as a 2½ [[dimension]]al interactive system, closer to the philosophy of 2D interactive systems such as ARK/2 or DAISY,&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;Reynolds, R.A. (1984) ''Computer Methods for Architects'', Butterworths, London. pp 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt; and concentrating on the rapid production of 2D drawings (plans, [[Elevation (view)|elevation]]s and sections). During the early 1980s, Ingram worked on a supplementary 3D file structure for RUCAPS, where, by running a separate program and with manual intervention, a flat 3D file could be generated, allowing the production of perspectives and images. RUCAPS did carry the 'weather vane' concept from UK-based Applied Research's Building Design System, BDS,{{efn|developed at Cambridge by Paul Richens; not to be confused with [[Charles M. Eastman|Charles Eastman]]'s Building Description System, also BDS}} now found in most modern BIM systems, but did not have interactive 3D windows or rule-based language - core characteristics of today's BIM applications.

==The system==
RUCAPS was a building modelling system. It used the concept, introduced by BDS,&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; of 2½ dimensional representation of components, straddling the divide between two dimensions (2D, i.e. flat) and three (3D). Here, all the elements of the design were placed in space in three dimensions, but each element, such as a window, door, chair or wall, was modelled in a series of 2D views. These views were of the plan and two elevations, each of which were drawn conventionally, as though on the side of a glass box. The "box" was then moved about the design and placed. By looking down on the model the plan view of the whole model was visible, and from the side just the elevation was seen. Because moving the component, or "box", moved both the plan view and the elevations for it, the plans and elevations remained in harmony, and designer's time was saved.

RUCAPS consisted of 38 different programs. For example, there was a program to generate the geometry for building components, another to assemble them into groups, and another to assemble those sub-assemblies into a model of the building. A dozen or more modules took care of printing, copying of floors, printing schedules, and so on. In the way of the time, the user directed operations by calling up the relevant program module rather than, as today, selecting from a menu.

A large computer screen displayed the building model. The screen, or sometimes two screens, was controlled from a keyboard for launching programs, and typing in coordinate data. Basic components were given several 2D views, from the top and sides. The information was usually coded onto A4 sheets of paper, and typed in as a series of coordinates. Once available to use in the building module, the components would be located using a large digitizer. This permitted a base drawing to be taped down, and used for locating the new components. The screen was then used to help ensure accuracy.

Along the bottom of the digitizer was a template with commands which could be selected as required, so the keyboard was often not required. Assembly was aided for many users by the familiar look of the large digitizer, which looked much like the drawing boards common at the time. To aid the process of aclimatistion, the digitizer was used with an electronic pen, which made placing components both quick and accurate.

MIni computers were used to power the system. Initially single-user, the system soon graduated to larger computers that could handle eight or more workstations simultaneously. The nature of building modeling systems is that very little information needs to be transferred from the database to the workstation, so performance levels were good despite what looks like limited equipment. Most early display screens were monochrome, but later RUCAPS systems were colour. All were using vector graphics, which was a step up from the earlier storage tubes. Plotters were large format and pen based, using amid of roller ball pens and Rotring wet ink pens of several thicknesses and colour.

RUCAPS was expensive, as was all CAD at the time, so its use was confined to large building projects. It was then necessary to have several people working on the same model. An early multi-user system was developed, allowing single building models to be worked on simultaneously by many people. It was a system that employed layers, where components were allocated categories allowing groups of them to be switched off or on when the drawings were produced. Layering allowed, for example, drainage to be printed separately from electrical components, but still maintained on the single model. No 3D was available in RUCAPS though a totally separate 3D modelling and perspective hidden-line program called AUTOPROD written by Col. Nigel Hitch was sold alongside RUCAP. There was no database or modelling connection of any sort between RUCAPS and AUTOPROD.

No clash-detection or calculations were undertaken on the model, but some hiding of one component by another was possible so that external walls showed on elevations while the internal elements were concealed in a 2½D fashion.

The Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards is an independent award system, set up by Marco Rebora &lt;ref name="Marco Rebora"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rebora|first1=Marco|title=Marco Rebora|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3836546683|url=http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/design/all/02882/facts.restaurant_bar_design.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 in the [[United Kingdom]] with the encouragement of a panel of judges, including the editor-in-chief of [[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper*]], Tony Chambers.

Since the first awards in 2009 there have been over 5,000 entries from [[design]] and [[architectural]] industries and [[hospitality]] organisations around the world.

Each year the awards are judged by a new panel of representatives from the fields of [[art]], [[architecture]], [[design]] and [[gastronomy]].  Notable judges have included [[Ian Callum]], [[Mark Hix]],&lt;ref name="Mark Hix"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hix|first1=Mark|title=Chicken and Steak|url=http://www.cntraveller.com/recommended/food/restaurant-and-bar-style-awards|website=Condé Nast Traveller|publisher=Condé Nast Traveller|accessdate=1 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerry Judah]], [[Yotam Ottolenghi]], [[Thomas Heatherwick]], [[Julia Peyton-Jones]] and [[Karim Rashid]]. The winners are awarded at annual ceremonies at a chosen host venue affiliated with the award. In 2012 the ceremony was held at The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA).

Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards organises a year-round programme of events based in the UK and most recently Internationally with an aim to build a network between entrants, judges, partners and sponsors.
 
In 2014 [[Taschen]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiedemann|first1=Julius|title=Restaurant &amp; bar design|date=2014|publisher=TASCHEN|location=Köln|isbn=978-3836546683|url=http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/design/all/02882/facts.restaurant_bar_design.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; publications published a book, ''Restaurant &amp; Bar Design'' dedicated to the ongoing work of the Awards.

== Categories==
Each year the Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards acknowledges two overall winners under the categories of Best [[Bar (establishment)|Bar]] and Best [[Restaurant]].

The number of additional category winners varies each year. The inaugural award in 2008/2009 was open to entrants from UK and identified nine category winners. In 2009/10 the awards became International and introduced two more category winners under the titles International [[Restaurant]] and International [[Bar (establishment)|Bar]]. The awards also have a number of sub-categories.

{{Portal |Children's literature}}

'''''Roald Dahl's Guide to Railway Safety''''' was published in 1991 by the [[British Railways Board]].  The British Railways Board had asked [[Roald Dahl]] to write the text of the booklet, and [[Quentin Blake]] to illustrate it, to help young people enjoy using the railways safely.

The booklet is structured as a conversation with children.  In the introduction, Dahl laments that adults are always telling children what to do and what not to do, and says he would not have agreed to write the booklet, which tells children what to do, if not for the importance of what he is about to discuss.  He then goes on to list the "dreaded DOs and DON'Ts" of railway safety – such as not to ride a bicycle or skateboard on a station platform, stand on platform edges, walk along rail tracks, or open train doors while the train is moving.

Many of the rules of safety given in the booklet are accompanied by humorous or sobering Blake illustrations.  Some of the DOs and DON'Ts also include anecdotes from Dahl—sometimes personal, sometimes statistical—reinforcing why they are important rules to follow.

==Distribution==

The booklet was distributed in UK primary schools to pupils in 1991, often alongside video presentations of railway safety films, such as ''[[Robbie (film)|Robbie]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9607">{{Other uses|Street Wars (disambiguation){{!}}Street Wars}}
'''StreetWars''' is a three-week-long [[water gun]] "assassination" tournament that travels to cities around the world. Created by Franz Aliquo and Liao Yutai, the tournament is based on the college and high school game [[Assassin (game)|Assassin]].

The June 2007 issue of [[Maxim (magazine)|''Maxim'' magazine]] has an article written by one of the participants of the 2006 London Streetwar.

==History and background of the tournament==
The tournament is loosely based on the game [[Assassin (game)|Assassin]], popular among some high school and college students. Aliquo and Liao took the game citywide and opened it to anyone above the age of 18, and changed it to a 3 week long, 24/7 format. Featured in the book "Spray," by Harry Edge, as a tournament known as Water Wars, with different directors than the actual game.

The first StreetWars took place in the summer of 2004 in [[New York City]]; subsequent tournaments took place in [[Vancouver]] (2004), [[Vienna]] (2004), [[New York City]] (2005, 2006, 2008, 2009), [[San Francisco]] (2005, 2007, 2010), [[Los Angeles]] (2006), [[London]] (2006, 2007,2010), [[Chicago]] (2007), and [[Paris]] (2007).

==Controversy==
===Mayor Bloomberg blasts StreetWars===
In July 2005, when asked of his opinion on StreetWars, Mayor [[Mike Bloomberg]] of [[New York City]] said that the creators of StreetWars could probably 'use some psychiatric help'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/17576?page_no=1 Bloomberg Says Creator of StreetWars Could Probably 'Use Some Psychiatric Help'], [[New York Sun]], July 26, 2005. Accessed 25 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police concerns in London===
Before the start of the game in London in July 2006, police voiced concerns that the associated suspicious activities might lead to deployment of officers and waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/5211998.stm Water pistol game 'irresponsible'], [[BBC]] online, 25 July 2006. Accessed 13 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Shadow Government==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mustache-commander-with-plumber.jpg|frame|thumb|right|Mustache Commander and Agent Plumber in the SF2005 game]] --&gt;
While StreetWars was created by Aliquo and Liao, the tournament itself is operated by an organization that calls itself "The Shadow Government", led by two mysterious figures known only as "Supreme Commander" and "Mustache Commander". His signature is a [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]], [[Cheongsam|mandarin gown]], [[pipe (material)|pipe]], bottle of [[Jack Daniel's|Jack Daniels]], and [[mustache]]. The "Mustache Commander" is the fictional alter ego of Yutai Liao, and the "Supreme Commander" – of Franz Aliquo.

Alter ego of StreetWars co-creator, Yutai Liao, Mustache Commander made his first appearance in StreetWars during the San Francisco 2005 game. Previous to the SF 2005 game, there has only been the Supreme Commander and the mysterious "Assigner".

The now famous giant bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]] that greets each and every player at the beginning of every tournament, started with the second appearance of the Mustache Commander (the first was with his signature fedora), in an underground tunnel in Golden Gate Park in the SF 2005 tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://streetwars.net/media/Weekend_America2005-streetwars.mp3 The Warriors], radio show Weekend in America follows the Mustache Commander as he meets his players in an underground tunnel in San Francisco (links to an MP3 file)&lt;/ref&gt; The Mustache Commander is now often portrayed with a bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]] in hand.

{{italic title}}
'''''Světozor''''' ("Seeing the World") was a [[Czech language]] illustrated magazine published in 19th and 20th century.

==History and profile==
''Světozor'' was created by [[Pavel Josef Šafařík]] in 1834. Šafařík was inspired by the British [[penny press]] and the German ''[[Das Pfennig-Magazin|Pfennig-Magazin]]''. The newspaper, trying to entertain the readers with curiosities, did not incite much interest and closed down in two years.

In 1867 the magazine was reestablished by [[František Skrejšovský]] (1837–1902), an entrepreneur and politician. A substantial portion of the weekly was dedicated to the literature and the arts. Since 1899 for more than 30 years the magazine was owned by the publishing house of [[Jan Otto]]. Between 1933–1939 the magazine was owned by leftist journalist and photographer [[Pavel Altschul]] (1900–1944).

==Other notable uses==
''Světozor'' is also name of a large (700 seats) cinema built in 1918 in [[Prague]]. There seems to be no relation with the magazine. The building serves as a cinema and an [[arthouse]] until today: [http://www.kinosvetozor.cz/ website], [http://www.kinosvetozor.cz/_download/svetozor_history.pdf history].

The book was first published in Lebanon in 1948 and was initially written in English, with Na'ima later translating it into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boullata|first=Issa J.|title=Mikhail Naimy: Poet of Meditative Vision|journal=Journal of Arabic Literature|date=July 1993|volume= 24|issue= 2|page=175|doi=10.1163/157006493x00041|jstor=4183302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Na'ima initially sought to have the book published in London, where it was rejected for "[advancing] a religion with 'a new dogma'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matar|first=Nabil I.|title=Adam and the Serpent: Notes on the Theology of Mikhail Naimy|journal=Journal of Arabic Literature|year=1980|volume= 11|pages=56–61|doi=10.1163/157006480x00045|jstor=4183028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the book was adapted into a three-act play by Padukone Ramanand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramanand|first=Padukone|title=Mirdad: Mikhail Naimy's Famous Work 'The Book of Mirdad' Made Into a Play in Three Acts|year=1973|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mirdad_Mikhail_Naimy_s_Famous_Work_The_B.html?id=DuHNiWmguwEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is presented as a series of dialogues between Mirdad, the abbot of a monastery, and his disciples. ''The Book of Mirdad'' draws on a variety of philosophies, including that of [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Sufi Islam]]. Through the allegories in the book presented by Mirdad, Na'ima presents several themes and calls for the unity of different people groups in universal love, as well as criticizing materialism and empty religious rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Aida Imangulieva|title=Gibran, Rihani &amp; Naimy: East-West Interactions in Early Twentieth-Century Arab Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWH62rLHcg8C&amp;pg=PA153|year=2010|publisher=Anqa Publishing|isbn=978-1-905937-27-1|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mirdad's dialogs gives out teachings which show us how it is possible to transform our consciousness and uncover the God within, by dissolving our sense of duality. The Book of Mirdad is ranked among the great religious classics of the twentieth century and a must have constant companion of any spiritual seeker.

==Reception==
A reviewer for ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'' praised the book, citing Na'ima's "power of enthusiasm and persuasion" as a highlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scaligero|first=Massimo|title=Review: The Book of Mirdad, A Lighthouse and a Haven by Mikhail Naimy|journal=Philosophy East and West|date=March 1960|volume= 11|issue= 1|pages=54–55|jstor=29754226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian mystic [[Rajneesh|Osho]] mentioned ''The Book of Mirdad'' in his book ''A Song Without Words'', saying that it "can be of immense help if you don't expect, and it is a book worth reading thousands of times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osho|title=A Song Without Words|year=2006|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|isbn=8171827357|pages=130, 140, 143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ii6_XQlvv3UC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=The+Book+of+Mirdad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OHCoUOnwDorn0QH--ICAAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Book%20of%20Mirdad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Mirdad is considered a masterpiece of spiritual wisdom to rank alongside [[The Prophet (book)|The Prophet]]. The book has been compared to [[John Bunyan|John Bunyan's]] ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' in that both stories are largely allegorical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al Maleh|first=Layla|title=Arab Voices in Diaspora: Critical Perspectives on Anglophone Arab Literature|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9042027185|pages=3, 61, 430|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ji1YrUwThkIC&amp;pg=PA430&amp;dq=%22The+Book+of+Mirdad%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MzgOTrydIYjIhAeH9eyADg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Book%20of%20Mirdad%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Book of Mirdad'' has also been compared to [[Ameen Rihani|Ameen Rihani's]] ''[[The Book of Khalid]]'', with the book being believed to have had an influence on Na'ima's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumann|first=Christoph|title=Liberal Thought in the Eastern Mediterranean|year=2008|publisher=Brill Publishers|isbn=9004165487|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgfVNLWuy80C&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22Book+of+Mirdad%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2HKoUIaSL4-40AGwrYHABQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Book%20of%20Mirdad%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Na'ima has described the work as the "pinnacle of his thought and a summary of his view of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Roger|title=Essays in Arabic Literary Biography III: 1850-1950|year=2010|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=3447061413|pages=252, 260–261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FAp1uVaBaQIC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=%22The+Book+of+Mirdad%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MzgOTrydIYjIhAeH9eyADg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Book%20of%20Mirdad%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thread Routes''''' is a 16mm film series by artist [[Kimsooja]].

Divided into six chapters, ''Thread Routes'' takes place in six different cultural zones around the world. The artist considers her approach to this film as a 'visual poem' and a 'visual anthropology', in that it juxtaposes and presents structural similarities in performative elements of textile culture with the structures in nature, architecture, agriculture and gender relationships in different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heartmus.dk/kimsooja-3472.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226023659/http://www.heartmus.dk/kimsooja-3472.aspx |archivedate=26 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biaci.org/en/kim-sooja/&lt;/ref&gt; These non-descriptive and unnarrative documentary films were conceived after being inspired in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]], in 2002, by the performative elements of traditional [[Bobbin lace|lace making]], and the city's architectural structure.

The first chapter, completed in 2010, explores [[Peru]]vian weaving culture, and its tight alignment with its landscapes and historic archeological structures. This piece journeys throughout the country, from the Sacred Valley around [[Cusco]] and [[Machu Picchu]] to the Taquila Island villages, forming a non-linear timeline of the connection between people and their geographical environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://broadstrokes.org/2014/09/09/artist-spotlight-kimsoojas-threads-of-culture-and-landscape/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mello, Laeticia, "The Pilgrimage of Our Own existence"- Arte Al Limite, Published by Arte Al Limite ltd. March 2012, pp 30-38&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter II, which finished filming in the summer of 2011, focused on [[Europe]]an lace making actions such as bobbin lace-making from Bruges (Belgium), [[Lepoglava]] and [[Pag (town)|Pag]] ([[Croatia]]); industrial lace-making in [[Calais]] ([[France]]); needle point lace-making by nuns in a monastery in [[Hvar]] ([[Croatia]]) who use threads from dry [[aloe vera|aloe]] leaves; and traditional needlepoint on the small island of [[Burano]] ([[Italy]]). These scenes are set against representative European architecture such as the [[Duomo of Milan|Duomo in Milan]]; the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]]; and the [[Sedlec Ossuary]] in [[Kutna Hora]] ([[Czech Republic]]), which is decorated by human bones and skulls. Local vegetation and flowers overlap with scenes from [[Alhambra|La Alhambra]] in [[Granada]] ([[Spain]]) which, in its detailed and complex decorative Islamic architectural forms, conveys a spatial sensibility and a spiritual dimension that is mirrored in lace-making. The bold, masculine, and power-oriented monumental architectural forms are revealed as similar acts to the delicate, feminine, and ephemeral textile making.

The third chapter (2012) journeys to [[India]] and studies the traditions of dyeing, sewing, weaving, embroidery, tattoo and woodblock printing; juxtaposing them with the archeological structures and temporary housing structures of the nomadic communities in [[Gujara]], as well as the Step Well and the Sun Temple in [[Ahmedabad]].

Most recently, [[Kimsooja]] filmed Chapter IV in China, where she encountered the specific weaving, dyeing and garment culture of the [[Miao people|Miao minority]] in the [[Guizhou]], [[Hainan]] and [[Yunnan]] provinces. These are depicted alongside elaborate silver adornment and paper making, as well as the ancient local housing structures in [[Fujian]], the rice terraces of [[Yunnan]] and the landscapes of [[Guizhou]] and [[Hainan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://guggenheim-bilbao.es/en/exhibitions/kimsooja-thread-routes/&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in preproduction phase, ''Thread Routes - Chapter V''  will explore [[Native Americans in the United States|native American]] textile culture.

The first three chapters were presented at [[Guggenheim Bilbao]] between March and July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://guggenheim-bilbao.es/en/exhibitions/kimsooja-thread-routes/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dijon Philippe le Hardi Tombeau5.jpg|thumb|400px|pleurants]]
The '''Tomb of Philip the Bold''' is a  [[Funerary art|funerary monument]] commissioned by the [[Duke of Burgundy]] [[Philip the Bold]] (d. 1404) for his burial at Chartreuse de Champmol. The monument was primarily built by [[Claus Sluter]],&lt;ref name="f172"&gt;Foss, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; with contributions by [[Jean de Marville]] and [[Claus de Werve]]. [[Jean Malouel]], official painter to the duke, is responsible design aspets.&lt;ref name="f172" /&gt; Today it is housed in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon]]. The tomb was influential; [[John, Duke of Berry|Jean, Duke of Berry]] commissioned a similar work for his own burial.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument is made from [[alabaster]], marble, gilt and paint.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Napoli. ''The Ethics of Ornament in Early Modern Naples''. Routledge, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows Philip's [[sarcophagus]] [[effigy]] in repose with his hands upright and clasped in prayer. An angel with gilded wings holds a cushion for his head. He rests on a black marble slab, with a lion at his feet. Below him are 41 [[pleurants]] standing in pairs in Gothic niches, arranged in a mourning procession. &lt;ref&gt;Jugie, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip acquired the domain of Champmol, near [[Dijon]], in 1378 to build the [[Chartreuse de Champmol]], a [[Carthusian]] monastery, intended to house the tombs of his dynasty. He was buried in the choir of Chartreuse de Champmol on 16 June 1404, with his organs sent to the church of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]] at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]]. In 1792, his body was re-interred at [[Dijon Cathedral]]. The following year his tomb was damaged by revolutionaries and looters. It was restored in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jugie, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''Two Moons'' is a 2010 [[mixed media]] [[collage]] by artist India Cruse-Griffin, which depicts a couple holding various objects, standing in front of two houses and several trees, while two moons float in the sky.

'''Victor Arthur James Willing''' (15 January 1928 – 1 June 1988) was a British painter, noted for his original nude studies. He was a friend and colleague of many notable artists, including [[Elisabeth Frink]], [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]] and [[Francis Bacon]]. For his talent and enthusiasm, Willing was dubbed the 'spokesman for his generation'. He was married to Portuguese feminist artist [[Paula Rego]].

==Life and work==
Victor Willing was born in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], the only son of George Willing, professional soldier, and his wife Irene Cynthia Tomkins.  The first four years of his life were spent there and, briefly, in [[Malta]].  On returning to the UK his father was posted to various parts of southern England including the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Bordon, Hampshire]].  Willing's education was in consequence rather disrupted until the family moved permanently to [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]] and he was able to attend The [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Royal Grammar School]] there, 1940–45.  A year was then spent at Guildford School of Art while he awaited call-up to National Service which duly followed, 1946–48.

He secured a commission as second-lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, serving in [[Northern Ireland]] and at [[Dover]].  On release he was accepted by the [[Slade School of Fine Art]], University of London but only to start in 1949, so he returned for a year to Guildford Art School studying sculpture under [[Willi Soukop]].  A fellow student and friend there at the time was [[Elisabeth Frink]].  He produced two accomplished stone carvings during this year, a female [[torso]] and a head (private collections).

Willing's start at the Slade coincided with [[William Coldstream]]'s arrival there as Director and Professor.  Fellow entrants that year included [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]], Henry Inlander&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=1335&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio |title=Inlander short biography |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date=1925-01-14 |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and James Burr, while [[Euan Uglow]], [[Craigie Aitchison (painter)|Craigie Aitchison]], [[Paula Rego]] and Myles Murphy also overlapped subsequently.  Other close friends, [[Keith Sutton]] and Peter Snow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstable.co.uk/gallery.php?cat=10545 |title=Peter Snow short biography |publisher=Theartstable.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; had started the previous year.

Willing was admired by his fellow students for his adventurous talent and intellectual zest and was denoted 'spokesman for his generation' by the critic [[David Sylvester]].  He was deeply fascinated by one of [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]]'s first exhibitions, in 1949, and he invited him to talk at the Slade.  They subsequently became friends and saw a good deal of each other especially after Willing left the Slade in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;see "Walking Wounded" in 1992 and 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Another artist who became a long-standing friend was [[Rodrigo Moynihan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=1674&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio |title=Moynihan short biography |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each painted the other's portrait.  Willing's portrait of Moynihan is with the [[Royal College of Art]] but Moynihan's of Willing was stolen and was, it is thought, destroyed by the thief.

Willing took his diploma in 1952 and then stayed on for a further year.  Of work produced during these student years rather little survives.  Four paintings, ''Head of a Man (John Mills)'', ''Boy on a Tricycle'' (both private collection), ''Head of a Girl (Paula Rego)'' (Dumfriesshire Educational Trust) and ''Standing Nude'' (Tate Gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2150&amp;page=1 |title=Paintings by Victor Willing in the Tate Gallery collection |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are still extant however and possibly two other 'summer compositions', ''Europa and the Bull'' and ''Musicians''.  His diploma painting ''Act of Violence'' is still with University Art Collections, [[University College London|University College]].

In 1951 Willing had married his long-time Guildford girlfriend, Hazel Whittington, and they lived first at [[Shalford, Surrey|Shalford]] near Guildford and, from 1954, in a large maisonette at Lancaster Gate ([[Bayswater]]), London.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, John ''Which Yet Survive: Impressions of Friends, Family and Encounters'', Quartet Books, London, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  He was able to paint there and also in a small studio that he had in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].

In 1955 [[Erica Brausen]] of the Hanover Gallery gave him a show which was a considerable critical success.  Paintings were bought by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] and also by Sir Colin Anderson, a notable supporter of young artists.  A star piece of the show, ''Reclining Nude'', went to a Belgian purchaser and has disappeared from view.  Unfortunately there was no catalogue nor, it seems, were the exhibits photographed.

Paintings from around this time, which may have been in the exhibition, are ''Runners'' and ''Man Explaining'' (private collection) and ''Winter Machine'' (Arts Council Collection).  ''Man with a Kitten'' no longer exists but was published in monochrome.&lt;ref&gt;''The Listener'', 15 September 1955 vol LIV no. 1385, p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; An impressive ''Man Watching'' (a sentry standing in front of red railings), which was shown at the ICA in 1953, is believed lost.  There were also a few portraits: ''Andrew Forge'', ''Natasha Spender'' and ''[[Lawrence Alloway]]'' (the last two, whereabouts unknown).

By 1956 Willing's marriage was failing and at the end of that year he left home and the country, eventually to join [[Paula Rego]] in Portugal.  Rego's parents were supportive and the two were able to live quietly at the family quinta in [[Ericeira]] where they both continued to paint.  They were married in 1959 following Willing's divorce from Hazel Whittington.  From 1962 they also had a base in London, a house in Albert Street, [[Camden Town]] which Rego's father, José Figueiroa Rego, had given them.

Although many paintings were produced during this period most were destroyed or painted over.  Survivals&lt;ref&gt;All illustrated in 2000(a)&lt;/ref&gt; include ''Self Portrait'' and ''Standing Figure and Nude'' (1957; two parts of an unfinished triptych).  Willing was discouraged when the more adventurous ''Lech'', ''Precarious Drag'' and ''Untitled'', which relate more closely to his late work, were viewed unfavourably by a critic friend and he reverted to painting (as he put it) 'stodgy nudes'.

The year 1966 brought major upsets to his career as an artist.  Both his father and his father-in-law died and he saw no option but to take on the management of the latter's business interests in Lisbon.  At the same time he was diagnosed as suffering from the early stages of [[multiple sclerosis]].  Art took on a lesser role for the next eight years until the [[Portuguese revolution of 1974]] led to the failure of the business and the eventual return of the family – which now included Caroline, Victoria and [[Nick Willing]] – to live permanently in London.

Willing had decided that he must now return to his true ''métier'' and he rented a room in a disused school in [[Stepney]], east London and began to paint.  Alone for long periods, and standing only with difficulty, he often just sat and looked at the wall.  During these periods of 'reverie' pictures would appear to him of an intense and visionary quality which he was then able to draw.  Many of these drawings were subsequently enlarged into oil paintings and both were exhibited in 1978 at the AIR (Artist Information Registry) Gallery, then in [[Shaftesbury Avenue]], central London.  This exhibition was a critical success and during the next ten years was followed by several others most notably at the [[Serpentine Gallery]] (1982) and the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] (1986), the latter a major retrospective.

In 1982 he was Artist in Residence, [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]] and [[Kettle's Yard]] art gallery, [[Cambridge]].  His paintings entered important collections including the [[Tate Gallery]], the Arts Council and the [[Saatchi Collection]].  His many drawings were also widely exhibited and collected.  Particularly striking was the series of ''Masks'' which were shown at the [[Hayward Gallery]] Annual (sponsored by the Arts Council) in 1985.

With his increasing disability the large paintings of the earlier eighties gave place to smaller, his last exhibition being of a series of Heads at the Karsten Schubert Gallery in 1987.  Also towards the end of his life he designed and had made some small sculptures, painted and gilded, resembling some of the standing figures in his drawings.  Another idea, surviving in small models, was the creation of the 'aedicola' or 'shelter', a place of refuge or retreat, which had featured in his drawings and paintings.

Willing died at home in [[Hampstead]], north London, on 1 June 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Obituaries: ''The Times'', 2 June; ''The Telegraph'', 2 June 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  In the years since then several important publications and exhibitions have taken place.  In 1993 Karsten Schubert published a selection of his writings and two conversations with John McEwen while in 2000 appeared the August Media multi-authored study of his work.  Five works were included in the 'New Displays' at the Tate Gallery in 1999 and in 2000 there was a solo exhibition of his work at Marlborough Fine Art, London.

In late 2008 the [[Pallant House Gallery]], Chichester exhibited their holdings of his paintings, bequeathed to them by the architect [[Colin St John Wilson]], alongside some loans of early work.  An extensive retrospective exhibition, curated by Helmut Wohl, opened at the Casa das Historias Paula Rego, [[Cascais]], [[Portugal]] on 9 September 2010 and closed on 2 January 2011.

The '''Xuande Emperor''' ({{zh|c=宣德帝|p=Xuāndédì}}; 16 March 1399&lt;ref&gt;《宣宗章皇帝實錄》. “仁宗昭皇帝嫡長子，母今太皇太后，以己卯歲二月九日生上於北京。” {{zh-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{ndash}} 31 January 1435), personal name '''Zhu Zhanji''' (朱瞻基), was the fifth emperor of the [[Ming dynasty]] of [[China]], ruling from 1425 to 1435. His [[Chinese era name|era name]] "Xuande" means "Proclamation of Virtue".

==Life==
Zhu Zhanji was the eldest son of the [[Hongxi Emperor]] and [[Empress Zhang (Hongxi)|Empress Chengxiaozhao]]. He was described as a crown prince who was endowed with the quality of an excellent monarch in a section surrounded by superstition, of his biography. His grandfather, Yongle Emperor, had high hopes that he might play an important part to assist his father.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Ming, [https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%98%8E%E5%8F%B2/%E5%8D%B79 Vol.9]''&lt;/ref&gt;

He was fond of poetry and literature. Although he continued to refer to [[Beijing]] as the secondary capital on all official documents, he maintained it as his residence and continued to rule there in the style of his grandfather, the [[Yongle Emperor]]. He permitted [[Zheng He]] to lead the [[Treasure voyages|seventh and last of his maritime expeditions]].

The Xuande Emperor's uncle, [[Zhu Gaoxu|Zhu Gaoxu (the Prince of Han)]], had been a favorite of the Yongle Emperor for his military successes, but he disobeyed imperial instructions and in 1417 had been exiled to the small fief of [[Le'an]] in [[Shandong]]. When Zhu Gaoxu revolted, the Xuande Emperor took 20,000 soldiers and attacked him at Le'an. Zhu Gaoxu surrendered soon afterward, was reduced to the status of a commoner. Six hundred rebelling officials were executed, and 2,200 were banished. The emperor did not wish to execute his uncle at the start, but later events angered the emperor so much that Zhu Gaoxu was executed through fire torture. All his sons were executed as well. It is very likely that Zhu Gaoxu's arrogance, well detailed in many historic texts, offended the emperor. A theory states that when the emperor went to visit his uncle, Zhu Gaoxu intentionally tripped him.

In 1428, the Xuande Emperor granted King [[Shō Hashi|Hashi]] of [[Chūzan]] the family name Shang (尚, Shō in Japanese), gave him the title of ''Liuqiu Wang'' (琉球王, Jap: ''Ryūkyū-Ō'', King of [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryūkyū]]), and gifted him a red lacquered tablet with ''Chung Shan'' (中山, ''Chūzan'' in Japanese) inscribed in gold, which was then placed on the [[Chūzonmon]] gate near [[Shuri Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, George. ''Okinawa: History of an Island People''. 1958, Tokyo, Charles E. Tuttle Company. Page 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xuande Emperor wanted to withdraw his troops from Việt Nam, but some of his advisors disagreed. After Ming garrisons suffered heavy casualties, the emperor sent [[Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan|Liu Sheng]] with an army. These were badly defeated by the Vietnamese. The Ming forces withdrew and the Xuande Emperor eventually recognized the independence of Việt Nam. In the north, the Xuande Emperor was inspecting the border with 3,000 cavalry troops in 1428 and was able to retaliate against a raid by the Mongols of the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]]. The Ming government let Arughtai's Eastern Mongols battle with Toghon's Oirat tribes of the west. The Ming imperial court received horses annually from Arughtai, but he was defeated by the [[Oirats]] in 1431 and was killed in 1434 when Toghon took over eastern Mongolia. The Ming government then maintained friendly relations with the Oirats. China's diplomatic relations with Japan improved in 1432. Relations with Korea were generally good with the exception of the Koreans resenting having to send virgins occasionally to the Xuande Emperor's imperial harem.

A privy council of eunuchs strengthened centralized power by controlling the [[Jinyiwei]] (secret police), and their influence continued to grow. In 1428, the notorious censor [[Liu Guan]] was sentenced to penal servitude and was replaced by the incorruptible [[Gu Zuo]] (d. 1446), who dismissed 43 members of the Beijing and Nanjing [[censorate]]s for incompetence. Some censors were demoted, imprisoned, and banished, but none were executed. Replacements were put on probation as the censorate investigated the entire Ming administration including the military. The same year the emperor reformed the rules governing military conscription and the treatment of deserters. Yet the hereditary military continued to be inefficient and to suffer from poor morale. Huge inequalities in tax burdens had caused many farmers in some areas to leave their farms in the past forty years. In 1430, the Xuande Emperor ordered tax reductions on all imperial lands and sent out "touring pacifiers" to coordinate provincial administration, exercising civilian control over the military. They attempted to eliminate the irregularities and the corruption of the revenue collectors. The emperor often ordered retrials that allowed thousands of innocent people to be released.

The Xuande Emperor died of illness in 1435 after ruling for ten years. He ruled over a remarkably peaceful period with no significant external or internal problems. Later historians have considered his reign to be the height of the Ming dynasty's golden age.

The Xuande Emperor was known as an accomplished painter, particularly skilled at painting animals. Some of his art work is preserved in the [[National Palace Museum]], Taipei and [[Arthur M. Sackler Museum]] (a division of [[Harvard Art Museum]]) in Cambridge. [[Robert D. Mowry]],  the curator of Chinese art at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, described him as "the only Ming emperor who displayed genuine artistic talent and interest."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/05/imperial-salukis.html Imperial Salukis: Speedy hounds, portrayed by a Chinese emperor]". [[Harvard Magazine]],  May–June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the Xuande mark and period (1426–35) is often considered one of the most sophisticated periods in the history of Chinese Blue and White porcelain crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yi Ching|first1=Leung|title=2016 Top 20 Chinese porcelain auctions (Sotheby's/ Christie's)|url=http://www.zentopia-culture.com/single-post/2017/01/13/2016-Top-20-Chinese-porcelain-auctions-Sothebys-Christies|website=www.zentopia-culture.com/|publisher=Leung Yi Ching|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an '''Émile Bernard chronology''' of the life and career of French artist, art critic and writer [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], based on documents hitherto published - however, most of the relevant sources remain unpublished. To a certain extent, these gaps can be filled by information derived from letters and biographies of e.g. [[Vincent van Gogh chronology|Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Émile Schuffenecker]]. Bernard and his work is associated with [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Cloisonnism]] and [[Synthetism]].

Since 1891, Bernard used to date his letters.

*'''1871, February 14''': Birth of his sister Madeleine
*'''1876''': The family moved to Loos (near Lille) and prospered economically.
*'''1877''': Émile attended Collège de la Monnaie at Lille whilst staying with his maternal grandmother, Sophie Bodin-Lallement. She ran a successful laundry business with some 20 employed. One of her lodgers encouraged Bernard to draw.
*'''1878''': The family moved to Paris, Émile attended L'institut des Francs-Bourgeois (later named Institution Nollet), but also enrolled at École des arts décoratifs.
*'''1879-1880''': Due to the children's poor health, the family moved to Nogent-sur-Marne, but returned to Paris in autumn 1880.

==1880s==
*'''1881''': Émile started to study at ''Collège Sainte Barbe'' at ''Fontenay-aux-Roses;'' in the autumn moved to the Paris branch of same college. Became fond of poetry.
*'''1882–1884''': During summer holidays, Émile copied masterpieces from the museum of Dunkerque as well as prints by [[Honoré Daumier]] and [[Gustave Doré]], and made sketches from life.
{{Anchor|1884}}
*'''1884–1886''': Stayed near Asnières (a fashionable suburb of Paris), argued with his father for wanting to become a painter, and entered the well-known atelier of [[Fernand Cormon]] in September. &lt;br/&gt;At that time, [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Louis Anquetin]], [[Eugène Boch]] and [[Paul Tampier]] (1859–1940) were studying with Cormon.&lt;ref name=SF&gt;Lit. ''A Sourcebook of Gauguin's Symbolist Followers ...,'' pp. 159-172&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br/&gt;At [[Père Tanguy]]'s shop, he first saw some of [[Cézanne]]'s paintings. Toulouse-Lautrec and Anquetin introduced young Bernard to [[Montmartre]]'s night life. In 1885, Bernard created his first important work, the woodblock ''La Nativité.''

==1886==
After having been expelled by Cormon for insubordinate behaviour&lt;ref name=SF/&gt; in early spring, 1886, his parents tried to convince him to work in business, which he refused.  &lt;br/&gt;Financially supported by the parents, Bernard instead went on a foot trip to Brittany. Recommended by [[Claude-Émile Schuffenecker]], whom he had met at Concarneau, he went to Pont-Aven in July, to see [[Paul Gauguin]] who however at first did not recognize Bernard's talent. Returned home after two months, he moved in with his parents, visited the exhibition of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]] and saw the work of [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]].

*'''April/September''': on a foot trip to and through Brittany. Leaving Paris on April 6, bernard arrives via Nonancourt and Verneuil in Saint-Briac, at the end of the month in Le Ribay. The second half of May he spends in Cancale, June in Saint-Briac. Via Saint-Brieuc, Tréguier, Morlaix, Landerneau, Pougastel-Daoulas, Douarnenez, Le Faouët, Quimper and Concarneau he arrives in Pont-Aven. Lorient, Carnac, Auray, Vannes and Rennes are the final places he visits, before he is back to Paris/Asnières - evidently before the closing of the exhibition of the ''Indépendants'':
*'''August 21''': Opening of the 2nd exhibition of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Artistes Indépendants]]; running through September 21.

==1887==
When his parents rented a house in Asnières, Émile was able to exhibit pointillist works there, early in the year, and was invited by Seurat to visit his studio. Bernard and Anquetin however soon decided to break with Neo-Impressionism and go their own way, painting flat colour areas but strong black contours.

At Tanguy's, Bernard met [[Lucien Pissarro]] and [[Charles Angrand]] at that time.

In spring, he returned to Brittany and stayed two months in Saint-Briac-sur-Mer, where he created stained glass windows. After his grandmother started to live with the family, they moved to a bigger house and built a studio for Émile.

*'''December/January (?)''': [[Vincent van Gogh]] arranges an exhibition of paintings by himself, Bernard, [[Louis Anquetin|Anquetin]], Koning and (probably) [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] in the ''Restaurant du Chalet'', 43 Avenue de Clichy, on Montmartre. Bernard and Anquetin sell their first painting, Vincent exchanges work with Gauguin.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent van Gogh: Letter [http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/510.htm  510] to his brother Theo, July 15, 1888. - There are two short accounts of this exhibition, one by Maurice de Beaubourg, based on information supplied by Seurat and published in ''Revue indépendante'' XVI/47, September 1890, pp. 391-402; the other one, written by Émile Bernard in summer 1890 for Aurier's ''Moderniste,'' remained unpublished for a century. See Roland Dorn: ''Bernard on Van Gogh'', in: MaryAnne Stevens, ed.: Appendix B, pp. 381-383&lt;/ref&gt;

==1888==
[[File:Émile Bernard 1888 - Self-portrait with Gauguin portrait for Vincent.jpeg|thumb|''Self-portrait with portrait of Paul&amp;nbsp;Gauguin,'' 1888]]
On occasion of the Salon des Indépendants in March 1888, the art critic [[Édouard Dujardin]] coined Bernard's and Anquetin's new style [[Cloisonnism]].

*'''February''': The day before Van Gogh left for Arles, Bernard helped him to decorate his room in Theo's apartment.
*'''May?''': leaves for another three months in Saint-Briac.
*'''August''': travels to Pont-Aven once more, where his mother and his sister joined him. Madeleine was in love with 23 years older Gauguin for a while, and he and her brother worked together quite closely.

Others however joined, and Bernard took the chance to expose 23 works, plus two more under the pseudonym ''Ludovic Nemo''.

:As his father prohibited him to visit Gauguin in Pont-Aven, he spent the summer in St. Briac, where he met one ''Charlotte Buisse'' whom he had liked to marry, but was repelled by her father for not being able to maintain a family.

*'''October 4''': Bernard is back to Asnières.&lt;ref&gt;Theo van Gogh: Letter [http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/T18.htm T18] to his brother Vincent, 4 October 1889&lt;/ref&gt;

Deciding to go abroad, together with Maria,&lt;ref&gt;Amongst other reasons, he did so to avoid pending military service.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard was supported by [[Count Antoine de La Rochefoucauld]] and [[Andries Bonger]]. He first travelled Italy: On visits in Genova, Pisa, Rome and Florence he admired Perugino, Botticelli, Giotto, Simone Martini, Taddeo Gaddi and Fra Angelico. When meeting [[Dal Médico]], a fellow from Pont-Aven, he decided to accompany him to Constantinople via Samos. There, he got the commission to paint the chaple of Les Missionnaires de Lyon. He afterwards moved on to Smyrna, where Maria left him for a French photographer. Via Jerusalem and Alexandria, he arrived in Cairo by the end of the year. There, he had some income from decorating the chapel of the ''Pères de la Mission africaine de Lyon,'' but still was supported by Bonger and de La Rochefouauld.

==1894==

Married ''Hannénah Saati,'' of Libanese descent, on July 1 and started living like an Arab, whilst reading Fathers of the Church (St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas) and philosophers like Hegel, Aristotle and Plato, for becoming inspired. Still was, to some extent, supported by his family. To the 5th album of André Marty's L'Estampe originale, he contributed a print.

==1895==

Bernard's first son, Otse, was born. The painter was commissioned with frescoes for the chapel of Cairo's Cathédrale de la Vierge and looked for inspiration in Michelangelo's oeuvre.

His sister Madeleine, terminally ill with tuberculosis, moved to Cairo, where she died on November 19.

==1896==

For their difficult financial situation, the family moved to Spain, reaching Granada in August and Seville in December. Hannénah became ill of tuberculosis.

==1897==
In spring, Bernard met Spanish painter Zuloaga; after the birth of a second son, Fortunato, they moved back to Cairo to live with Hannénah's family. Both sons died of tuberculosis, soon later.

==1898==
Birth of a third son, Odilon. Bernard participated at the Salon de l'Art Religieux and published the first one of 17 volumes of poetry. Besides, he started a major paintings series on life in Cairo.

==1899==
In an exhibition in honour of Odilon Redon, organized by de La Rochfoucauld and held at Durand-Ruel gallery, Bernard exhibited a tapestry and a cupboard panel.

==1900s==
*'''1900''': Travelling towards France, the family stayed in Venice for a while before returning to Cairo due to Odilo's illness. The child died there shortly after arrival, but a fourth son, Antoine, was born same year.
*'''1901''': Prompted by de La Rochefoucauld, Bernard went to France for three months, exhibited in Ambroise Vollard's gallery and met (not for the first time) poet and theatre manager Paul Fort, becoming involved with his sister Andrée who would accompany him to Cairo.
*'''1902''': Daughter Irène, born to Hannénah.
*'''1903''': After founding Le Parnasse, a short-lived review publication, Bernard left Cairo for Venice in March, accompanied by Andrée, Irène and Antoine. He returned to Cairo in October to definitely separate from Hannénah and went back to France, taking both children with him.
*'''1904''': On the way to Paris, Bernard stopped for a visit at Cézanne's place in Aix-en-Provence, then decided to establish his more-or-less permanent home in Tonnerre-sur-Yonne (Bourgogne), whilst spending the winter in Naples.
*'''1905—1912''': On return from Naples, Bernard met Cézanne again. La Rénovation esthétique was founded to propagate increasingly reactionary Catholic points of view. He from now mostly travelled between Paris and Tonnerre and produced a vast output of art critic's essays, poems, plays, book illustrations, but also paintings (towards 1910, mainly landscapes). Around 1907, he visited Andries Bonger in the Netherlands and portrayed him and his wife. In 1908, he exposed three of his paintings at the Post-Impressionist exhibition in Prague, having been invited by Milos Marten, who admired his art. In 1910, he had a whole room in the Musée Baudouin (Paris) to exhibit his Orientalist work. At that time, working on his career, he was hardly concerned about Andrée and the children. In December 1911, heirship after his father's death allowed him a better life.

==1910s==
*'''1910''': Bernard's friend [[Eugène Boch]] moves to his new house Villa La Grimpette &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugeneboch.com/grimpette.htm "La Grimpette, house of Eugène Boch"]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Monthyon]] - Émile Bernard becomes a fréquent guest to this house.
*'''1913—1921''': Bernard showed some of his woodcuts at the Circle des librairies, in 1913. Having fallen in love with Persian Armène Ohanian, he lived with her in Villeneuve-les-Avignon for three years, where he decorated the church with frescoes. Besides, created woodcuts for Les Amours de Ronsard, Les Fleurs du mal, and François Villon. After Armène had left him, he stayed in Tonnerre until the end of the war; in 1919, returned to Paris and lived with one Mme Duchâteau and Irène.

==1920s==
*'''1922-1925''': Stayed in Italy, where he was well respected: Exhibited at the 1922 Venice Biennale and at the 1923 Rome Biennale. Major paintings created during that period were Le Christ guérissant les malades, Les Héros et les dieux, Le Doute, La Construction du temple. Le Cycle humain is to be mentioned.
*'''1927''': Having left Italy by the end of 1925, he travelled the Loire Valley, gave lectures and organized conferences on art.

==1930s==
*'''1937''': death of his wife Hannénah
*'''1938''': Bernard marries Andrée Fort, but prefers living alone in Pont-Aven until 1940.

==1940s==
*'''1941, April 16''': Bernard dies in his studio at 15, quai Bourbon in Paris; [[Maurice Denis]] delivered an oration, following his funeral at Île-Saint-Louis.

'''Šovinistička farsa''' ({{lang-sr|Шовинистичка фарса}}), ''Chauvinistic Farce'' in [[English language|English]] is a theatre play, written by [[Radoslav Pavlović]] that performed across former [[Yugoslavia]] prior to and during its dissolution. A total of 4 sequels of the play were produced from 1985 to 1998, and according to one of the main actors, [[Predrag Ejdus]], the play was performed more than 1800 times,&lt;ref name=ejdus/&gt; and was performed in almost every city in former [[Yugoslavia]] that had a decent theatre.&lt;ref name=nadlanu/&gt; Thanks to its great popularity with the audience, the play launched the carriers of then young and later famous, main actors [[Josif Tatić]] and [[Predrag Ejdus]].

The play is mostly set as a dialog between a stereotypical [[Serbs|Serb]], Slobodan Mihajlovic (played by [[Josif Tatić|Tatić]]) and a stereotypical [[Croats|Croat]], Bernard Drah (played by [[Predrag Ejdus|Ejdus]]), both of whom drink heavily. The script derives its capacity to make the audience laugh from the everlasting differences between Serbs and Croats, and the destiny of two people historically, culturally and geographically bound to one another. At first the play may have been seen as controversial due to its departure from then omnipresent dogma of [[Brotherhood and unity]] of the two people. The later events of dissolution of [[Yugoslavia]] have shown the script to be the predictor of an inevitable divorce.

[[Radoslav Pavlović]] received an award for Best script at 11th Satire days ({{lang-hr|Dani satire}}) in [[Zagreb]], 1986.&lt;ref name=kerempuh/&gt;

==Trivia==
[[Petar Božović]] and [[Lazar Ristovski]] were initially cast to play the main roles but abandoned the project during rehearsals. The director then replaced them by [[Josif Tatić|Tatić]] and [[Predrag Ejdus|Ejdus]].
In addition to the main production of the play that toured across the country, independent plays based on the script of ''Šovinistička farsa'' were also produced in [[Zagreb]],  (with Željko Vukmirica and Mladen Crnobrnja playing the main two roles), [[Kruševac]], [[Sombor]], [[Banja Luka]], [[Rijeka]] and [[Varaždin]]. The version of the play produced in [[Zagreb]] was performed for more than 300 times.
