'''ASA style''' is a widely accepted format for writing university research papers in the field of [[sociology]]. It specifies the arrangement and punctuation of [[footnote]]s and [[bibliography|bibliographies]]. Standards for ASA style are specified in the ASA [[Style Guide]], which is published by the [[American Sociological Association]], the main scholarly organization for academic sociologists in the [[United States]]. The ''ASA Style Guide'', published by the [[American Sociological Association]], is designed to aid authors preparing manuscripts for ASA journals and publications.

==General features==

ASA style is closely related in appearance and function to APA (American Psychological Association) style. As with [[APA style]], the general format for citing references is [[parenthetical referencing]]. All references are to be included at the end of the paper in a section titled "References," rather than "Works Cited" as in [[MLA style]]. Also unlike MLA style, parenthetical references include the year of publication. The "author-date" in text citation system is a readily recognizable feature of ASA style. This emphasis on dates is carried over into the references section, where the date is the first piece of information to follow the author's or authors' name(s).

==Software support==

ASA style is supported by most major [[reference management software]] programs, including Endnote, Procite, Zotero, Refworks, and so forth, making the formatting of references a fairly straightforward task.

'''Apache''', or '''La Danse Apache''', '''Bowery Waltz''', '''Apache Turn''', '''Apache Dance''' and  '''Tough Dance'''  is a highly dramatic [[dance]] associated in popular culture with [[Paris]]ian street culture at the beginning of the 20th century. The name of the dance (pronounced ''ah-PAHSH'', not ''uh-PATCH-ee'', like the English pronunciation of the [[Apache|Native American tribe]]) is taken from the term for [[Apache (gang)|Parisian underworld]] of the time.

The dance is sometimes said to reenact a violent "discussion" between a [[pimp]] and a [[prostitute]]. It includes mock slaps and punches, the man picking up and throwing the woman to the ground, or lifting and carrying her while she struggles or feigns unconsciousness. Thus, the dance shares many features with the theatrical discipline of [[stage combat]].  In some examples, the woman may fight back.

In many films and cartoons depicting the Apache dance, the music traditionally used is "Valse des Rayons" from the ballet ''[[Le papillon (ballet)|Le Papillon]]'' by [[Jacques Offenbach]].

==Origin==
In [[fin de siècle]] Paris young members of street gangs were labelled [[Apache (gang)|Apaches]] by the press because of the ferocity of their savagery towards one another, a name taken from the native North American indigenous people, the [[Apache]].  In 1908, dancers [[Maurice Mouvet]] and   [[Max Dearly]] began to visit the low bars frequented by Apaches in a search for inspiration for new dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  They formulated the new dance from moves seen there and gave to it the name ''Apache''.  Max Dearly first performed it in 1908 in Paris at the [[Les Ambassadeurs (restaurant)|Ambassadeurs]] and Maurice in [[Ostend]] at the Kursaal. A short while later, in the summer of 1908, Maurice and his partner Leona performed the dance at [[Maxim's Paris|Maxim's]], and Max Dearly made an even bigger impact with it, partnered with Mistinguett, in the [[Moulin Rouge]] show, ''La Revue du Moulin''.

==Depictions==
A 1902 Edison movie of two Bowery dancers, Kid Foley and Sailor Lil doing a ''Tough dance'' which is similar in style, survives.

The "Valse des rayons" (also called the "Valse chaloupée") from [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s ballet "[[Le Papillon (ballet)|Le Papillon]]" was used in a 1908 production at the [[Moulin Rouge]] and has become the music most associated with the dance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In ''[[The Mothering Heart]]'',  a 1913 short drama film directed by [[D. W. Griffith]], an Apache dance is shown in a restaurant cabaret.

The famous French 10-part 7-hour [[silent film]] ''[[Les Vampires]]'' (1915, re-released on DVD in 2005) about an Apache gang "Vampires" contains a number of Apache dance scenes performed by real street Apache dancers, rather than actors. A notable detail is that during part of the waltz the man holds firmly onto the woman's hair, rather than her body.

''[[Parisian Love]]'' (1925) shows [[Clara Bow]] as an Apache dancer, with the dance itself being the first scene in the film.

In 1934's [[Limehouse Blues (film)]], nightclub owner Harry Young, [[George Raft]], does an Apache dance with his star performer and lover Tu Tuan [[Anna Mae Wong]].

Also in 1934 the Adagio Dancers, artists Alexis and Dorrano, perform the 'Danse Apache' in a British Pathe short set in a seedy French bar and watched by some "toffs".

In the 1935 movie ''[[Charlie Chan in Paris]]'', Charlie Chan's agent (played by [[Dorothy Appleby]]) is murdered following her performance of an Apache dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sonny Watson |url=http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3aposh.htm |title=APACHE Dance &amp;#124;Dance of the Underworld&amp;#124;Gunmen of Paris&amp;#124;Gang dance |website=Streetswing.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the opening scene of ''[[The Woman of My Dreams (1944 film)|Die Frau Meiner Träume]]'' (The Woman of My Dreams), one of the last major [[Agfacolor]] musicals produced in Nazi Germany, features the actress-dancer [[Marika Rökk]] in an acrobatic Apache dance with two men. The film was extremely popular not only in Germany, but made it to the Soviet film distribution after the war, enjoying similar popularity. The big production finale was taken into the curriculum of the Soviet Film Institute and served as an example of a well crafted musical staging. 
 
In the 1946 film, "The Razor's Edge", the main characters visit the Rue de Lappe and experience apache dancers in a rather seedy bar. One of the main characters Sophie (portrayed by Ann Baxter) has fallen into alcoholism following the death of her husband and child. Having lost touch with the rest of her friends, they happen upon her at the bar with her 'apache' lover - they dance.

In the 1947 film ''[[Crime Doctor (character)|Crime Doctor's Gamble]]'', Dr. Robert Ordway (played by [[Warner Baxter]]) visits a seedy Parisian cabaret with an Apache dance sequence. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The dance ends with the male dancer Don Graham twirling the female dancer Dolores Graham around by her hair.

In the 1949 comedy film ''[[Totò Le Mokò]]'', Antonio Lumaconi (Totò Le Mokò, played by [[Totò]]) performs an Apache dance with [[Flora Torrigiani]].

An episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', "The Adagio" (1951, season one, episode twelve), revolved around Lucy wanting to learn an Apache dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ofj_ZU2hEKI |title=YouTube |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another episode, ''The French Revue'' Fred and Ethel perform an Apache dance in the hopes of starring in an act at the club with a French singer.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Apache Dancers Don &amp; Dolores Graham performed the apache dance in ''[[Phantom of the Rue Morgue]]'' (1954).

On October 9, 1955 an Apache dance was performed on The Jack Benny Program entitled "Massage and Date with Gertrude".  Jack, and his date Gertrude were trying to eat their dinner at a French Nightclub while French Apache dancers kept interrupting their meal.  The female dancer actually picked Benny up and tossed him out onto another diner's lap.

Also in 1955, the movie "''Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy"'' features an apache dance in the scene introducing the title characters, where some of the dance interrupted in a predictably slapstick manner.

An example of an Apache dance number is seen in Twentieth Century Fox's film "Can Can" (1960) starring Frank Sinatra, Shirley MacLaine and Maurice Chevalier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053690/usercomments|title=Reviews &amp; Ratings for ''Can-Can''|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Can-Can-Frank-Sinatra/dp/B000ND91YU |title=Can-Can: Frank Sinatra, Shirley MacLaine, Maurice Chevalier, Louis Jourdan, Juliet Prowse, Marcel Dalio, Leon Belasco, Nestor Paiva, John A.

In this version she fights back and eventually "kills" all five dancers with a knife.

An episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', (1976, season one, episode five), included a "French tango"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fee8TeGNzws |title="The Muppet Show" Rita Moreno french tango scene |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2006-05-11 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed by guest Rita Moreno.

An Apache dance also figures in the musical ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' (1968).  When [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] set out to create a more than usually fascinating musical mix and included a wide variety of musical genres in this show, he added a very French number.  When Joseph's brothers are explaining their impoverished state, after selling Joseph into slavery and experiencing the seven lean years, they sing about "Those Canaan Days" reminiscing of better days.  Included within that number is an Apache Dance, a brief joyous celebration of what once was and a poignant expression of their regret for their actions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In the movie ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001), "El Tango de Roxane" is performed as a [[Tango dance|tango]] with Apache elements.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In the [[Apocalyptica]] video ''[[I Don't Care (Apocalyptica song)|I Don't Care]]'' (2007), Apache dance is featured in a scene between [[Adam Gontier]] and a woman.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In the [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] video ''[[Try (Pink song)|Try]]'' (2013), the singer and male dancer Colt Prattes can be seen performing an interpretation of the Apache dance&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Donnelly |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/11/entertainment/la-et-mg-pink-try-video-colt-prattes-costar-dance |title=Pink's "Try" music video costar Colt Prattes talks to the Ministry - latimes |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=2012-10-11 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; choreography by The golden Boyz - R J Durrell and Nick Florez - and aerial choreographer [[Sebastien Stella]].&lt;ref name=Glasswerk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasswerk.co.uk/news/national/16600/Pink+Premieres+New+Video+For+Try |title=Pink Premieres New Video For Try - Glasswerk Magazine |website=Glasswerk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''ArtPremium''''' is a quarterly magazine specializing in [[contemporary art]].

== History ==
ArtPremium is an independent, ad-free, sales-driven magazine focused on exhibitions and the international contemporary art market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/6269989|title=Art premium : la revista de arte de Puerto Rico in Stanford University Libraries catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latindex.org/latindex/ficha?folio=13563|title=Latindex|last=Regional On Line Information System for Latin American Scientific Reviews|first=el Caribe|date=1997-02-17|website=Bases de datos de revistas nacionales|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://frontart.org/2017/03/11/the-front-row-triennial/|title=The Front Row Triennial|date=2017-03-11|work=FRONT International: Cleveland Triennial for Contemporary Art|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was created by Corinne Timsit and Eric Bonici in 2003 in Puerto Rico and is now based in [[Paris]] since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://conucopr.org/Search.do;jsessionid=14DB0DB714CFD7348986602033FFEE86?query=Bonici,+Eric&amp;scope=author_browse&amp;b_ind=0|title=Indices Conuco de Puerto Rico|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ArtPremium begins as a magazine in Spanish dedicated to the Puerto Rican art scene, its first issues are subtitled: ''La revista de arte de Puerto Rico''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/6269989|title=Art premium : la revista de arte de Puerto Rico in Stanford University Libraries catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ArtPremium remain the art magazine of Puerto Rico until 2008, when Corinne Timsit and Eric Bonici decide to internationalize the magazine. They create ArtPremium Newspaper to locally replace their magazine, ArtPremium then becomes a magazine entirely dedicated to contemporary art and ArtPremium TV to broadcast content adapted to the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/artpremium|title=ArtPremium|website=Vimeo|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel with its activities, ArtPremium develops a network of partners in major contemporary art fairs worldwide, by forming partnerships with : [[Art Basel]], Art Basel [[Miami]], Art Basel [[Hong Kong|Hong-Kong]], Fiac [[Paris]], Art Paris art fair, [[The Armory Show (art fair)|The Armory Show]] New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbasel.com/miami-beach/exhibitors|title=Art Basel|last=Basel|first=Art|website=Art Basel|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbasel.com/hong-kong/exhibitors|title=Art Basel|last=Basel|first=Art|website=Art Basel|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artparis.com/fr/media_partners|title=ART PARIS ART FAIR - PARTENAIRES MÉDIAS 2018 -  Art paris Art Fair, 5 &gt; 8 avril 2018 Grand Palais|work=Art Paris Art Fair 2018|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its distribution focus on major bookstores, concept stores, and museums such as: [[Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art]], [[Palais de Tokyo]], [[Pompidou Center]], [[Guggenheim Museum]] (Bilbao), [[Reina Sofia Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.librairieflammarion.fr/recherche/?q=ArtPremium|title=www.librairieflammarion.fr|last=Flammarion|first=Librairie|website=www.librairieflammarion.fr|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine has published background articles on: [[Andres Serrano]], [[Aziz + Cucher]], [[Bill Viola]], [[Lee Ufan]], [[Anish Kapoor]], [[Nils Udo]], [[Subodh Gupta]].

In 2006, the magazine ArtPremium organizes and produces in [[Puerto Rico]], the first retrospective of [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/artnetnews/artnetnews10-24-06.asp|title=Artnet News - artnet Magazine|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/40871/basquiat-an-anthology-for-puerto-rico/|title=Basquiat: An anthology for Puerto Rico - Announcements - e-flux|website=www.e-flux.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition takes place at the Muséo de arte de Puerto Rico in order to pay a national tribute to Jean-Michel Basquiat (born in [[New York (state)|New York]]), who was of Puerto Rican origins by his mother. Lourdes I Ramos-Rivas (named in 2016 president of the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach), as chief curator of the museum, is also the curator of this retrospective which brings together more than 135 original works by JMB, and contributes to the book: ''Jean-Michel Basquiat, an anthology for Puerto Rico'', also produced by ArtPremium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-molaa-lourdes-ramos-20170320-story.html|title=Lourdes Ramos named president of the Museum of Latin American Art — first Latina to hold the post|website=www.latimes.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tmlarts.com/jean-michel-basquiat/|title=Jean-Michel Basquiat|website=www.tmlarts.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abaa.org/book/1086387996|title=ABAA {{!}} Jean-Michel Basquiat: Una Antologia para Puerto Rico by BASQUIAT {{!}} Search for rare books|website=www.abaa.org|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/jean-michel-basquiat-una-antologia-para-puerto-rico/oclc/156945938|title=Jean-Michel Basquiat: una antología para Puerto Rico.|last=Basquiat|first=Jean Michel|last2=Navarra|first2=Enrico|last3=Ramos Collado|first3=Lilliana|last4=Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico (San Juan|first4=P.R.)|date=2006|publisher=Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico : ArtPremium|isbn=0615134637|location=San Juan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the entire spring issue is dedicated to [[Kiro Urdin]] to celebrate the long term achievements in his international career. During an interview, and to the question of what he thought to be so exposed, Urdin will say: "It doesn't happen frequently to the artists, but it is good when an important magazine is dedicated to one artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/4798605|title=Kiro Urdin ArtPremium Collection|website=Vimeo|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Website artpremium.com ==
Between 2011 and 2015, ArtPremium abandons its paper version to focus on its digital development,  the magazine becomes completely free and readable online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.el-status.com/knowledge.html|title=El Status - Independent Platform for Contemporary Puerto Rican Art|website=www.el-status.com|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results having been inconclusive, the paper version of the magazine returns in 2016 with a new English-language version. The ArtPremium website is now an extension of the paper review, it includes uploads of unpublished articles and a layout adapted to digital reading.

==ArtPremium TV==
Since 2008, ArtPremium has been broadcasting its ArtPremium TV channel on the [[vimeo]] social network. Web-based content can be used to relay artist interviews such as [[Kiro Urdin]], [[Carlos Betancourt]] or [[Aziz + Cucher]], exhibition montage views, or reports on contemporary art fairs such as FIAC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2836">'''Charles Taylor''' (died 1816) was a Manchester [[calico printer]] and dyer, who later became Secretary of the [[Society of Arts]].

==Biography==

Little is known about his origins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henderson,|first=W. O.|title=Industrial Britain under the Regency|year=1968|pages=169, n43}}&lt;/ref&gt; but  he was an M. D. He was a partner in the Manchester firm of Taylor and Maxwell, [[fustian]] manufacturers, dyers and printer, and was involved with the development of printing machinery for calico in about 1770.  About 1785 Taylor set up a dye-house in Manchester for [[Turkey Red]] dyeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Musson, A. E.|first=Robinson, Eric |title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution|year=1969|pages=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor and Maxwell were early experimenters in the use of 'dephlogisticated marine acid' (chlorine) following the work of [[Berthollet]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Scheele|Scheele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Musson, A. E.|first=Robinson, Eric|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution|year=1969|pages=251–337}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was suggested to Taylor by Dr [[Richard Kirwan]] F.R.S. and according to the article on 'Bleaching' in ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'', which Taylor wrote:
:''... a whole piece of calico, in the state received from the loom, was in the spring of 1788 actually bleached white, printed in permanent colours and produced in the Manchester market ready for sale, having undergone all these operations in less than 48 hours by the joint efforts of Mr. Cooper, Mr. Baker and Mr Taylor, which is perhaps the first time an entire piece, either in France or England, that fully ascertained the real merits of a new mode of bleaching, and certainty that it might be generally useful in commerce.''

In 1788 they took as an apprentice [[James Watt, Jr.]] (1769-1848)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hills|first=Revd Dr Richard L.|title=James Watt :adversity through trial|year=2006|publisher=Landmark Publishing|isbn=1-84306-193-7|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor retired from his Manchester business in 1800 and in February of that year was appointed Secretary to the [[Society of Arts]], a post he held until his death in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Transactions of the Society of Arts|year=1818|volume=35|pages=viii–ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Henry Trueman|title=A History of the Royal Society of Arts|year=1913|pages=344–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
For ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' he contributed articles on:
*Bleaching, vol 4, 1805
*Crimson, vol 10, 1808
*Dying, history of, vol 12, 1808
*Fustian. vol 15, 1810

'''The Chicago Society of Artists''' is a non-profit organization. The "CSA is the oldest continuing association of artists in the United States. Since its inception and incorporation in 1889, the Chicago Society of Artists has had two primary objectives – the advancement of art in the [[Chicago]] area and cultivation of the production and display of member art works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagosocietyofartists.org|title=Home - Chicago Society of Artists|website=chicagosocietyofartists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6402">[[Image:Chinesisches Haus Sanssouci.jpg|thumb|The Chinese House]]
The '''Chinese House''' (German: ''Chinesisches Haus'') is a garden pavilion in [[Sanssouci Park]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] had it built, about seven hundred metres southwest of the [[Sanssouci|Sanssouci Summer Palace]], to adorn his flower and vegetable garden. The garden architect was [[Johann Gottfried Büring]], who between 1755 and 1764 designed the pavilion in the then-popular style of [[Chinoiserie]], a mixture of ornamental [[rococo]] elements and parts of Chinese architecture.

The unusually long building time of nine years is attributed to the [[Seven Years' War]], during which Prussia's economic and financial situation suffered significantly. Only after the end of the war in 1763 were the chambers inside the pavilion furnished. As the building served not only as a decorative piece of garden architecture but also as a setting for small social events, Frederick the Great ordered the building of a ''Chinese Kitchen'', a few metres south-east of the Chinese House. After a conversion in 1789, only the [[hexagonal window]]s show the Oriental character of the former outbuilding. A few years later, the [[Dragon House (Sanssouci)|Dragon House]] was built in the form of a Chinese [[pagoda]] on the northern edge of Sanssouci Park bordering Klausberg. The building was Frederick the Great's attempt to follow the Chinese fashion of the 18th century, which began in France before spreading to England, Germany, and Russia.

[[Image:Ehemalige Chinesische Küche.jpg|thumb|right|The former ''Chinese Kitchen'' following its conversion]]

== Chinoiserie ==
In the 17th century, Dutch traders brought Chinese [[nacre|mother-of-pearl]], lacquer, silks and porcelain to Europe. In the noble courts of the [[baroque]] era, an interest in Oriental arts grew during the [[rococo]] period into Chinoiserie, a genuine fashion for all things Chinese. In addition to the enthusiasm for Asian luxury goods which harmonized with the certain forms of rococo, travelogues and exhibitions portrayed the carefree living of the Chinese, which corresponded with the European courts' ideal of a relaxed lifestyle. Whole rooms of palaces were decorated with porcelain, small Chinese-style furniture and wall murals which presented the ideal world that was supposedly China.

== Architecture ==
Frederick the Great modeled the Chinese House on the ''Maison du trefle'', a 1738 garden pavilion in the palace grounds of [[Lunéville]], France. This [[trefoil]]-shaped building was created by the French architect [[Emmanuel Héré de Corny]] for the Duke of Lorraine, [[Stanisław Leszczyński]], former King of Poland, who lived in exile in France. An exemplar of one of the etchings of the ''Maison'' published by Héré in 1753 was in the possession of Frederick the Great.

=== Outer design ===
[[Image:Teehaus1.jpg|thumb|right|Northern entrance to the Chinese House]]
The Chinese House has the shape of a trefoil. The rounded central building contains three cabinet rooms regularly interspersed with free spaces. Rounded windows and French windows that reach almost to the ground let light into the pavilion's interior. The rolling tented copper ceiling is supported in the free space by four gilded [[sandstone]] columns, the work of the Swiss ornamental sculptor [[Johann Melchior Kambly]], who was in the employ of Frederick the Great from 1746.

The gilded sandstone sculptures that sit at the feet of the columns and stand at the walls of the rooms originate from the workshops of the sculptors [[Johann Gottlieb Heymüller]] (ca. 1715-1763) and [[Johann Peter Benckert]] (1709-1769). People from the area stood as models for the eating, drinking and music-making Chinese figures, which explains the statues' European features.

The [[cupola]] crowning the roof is surmounted by a gilded Chinese figure with an open parasol. Friedrich Jury created it in copper after a design by the sculptor [[Benjamin Giese]]. Light falls into the central chamber through the long oval window openings of the cupola as it does through the windows in the façade.

=== Interior design ===
The wall of the circular central chamber, accessible by the north side, is coated with [[stucco]] marble. Monkeys with musical instruments worked in stucco over the French windows, brackets holding porcelain and wall sconces between the windows are all coated with gold leaf. Likewise coated is a richly decorated chandelier which hangs from the cupola.

The ceiling painting on the higher circuit of the room is the work of Thomas Huber, dating from 1756. Huber also painted the ceilings of the empty chambers on the exterior surface. The plans of the French artist [[Blaise Nicholas Le Sueur]], who taught as an art master at the [[Berlin Academy of Arts]], served as a model for the interior. The ceiling paintings show Oriental men behind a balustrade, some looking into the room, others chatting with one another. They are surrounded by parrots, monkeys and [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] sitting on posts.

The walls between the central room and the adjoining chambers are decorated with brightly coloured, silken wall coverings painted with floral patterns, at the time a desired and valuable wall textile known as "Pekings". As may be seen here, Frederick the Great preferred to use for the interiors of his buildings only the highest quality materials manufactured by Prussian silk factories. Small fragments of this wall covering were used as a model for the reconstruction of the original during a restoration of 1990&amp;ndash;1993.

[[File:Eli Harvey's lions at the Eaton Family mausoleum in Toronto.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Eaton family]]'s mausoleum at [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]] in Toronto, with lions by Eli Harvey]]

'''Eli Harvey''' (September 23, 1860 – February 10, 1957) was an American sculptor, painter and [[animalier]].  Harvey was born in [[Ogden, Ohio]], a [[Quaker]] community in [[Clinton County, Ohio|Clinton County]], to William P. and Nancy M. Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;Proske, Beatrice Gilman, ''Brookgreen Gardens Sculpture'', Brookgreen Gardens, SC, 1968 p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; He attended art school in the [[Cincinnati Art Academy]] where he studied painting with [[Thomas Satterwhite Noble]] and sculpture with [[Louis Rebisso]].  In 1889 he moved to [[Paris, France|Paris]] where he continued his studies, with [[Lefebvre]], [[Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant|Constant]], [[Henri Lucien Doucet|Doucet]] and finally [[Frémiet]].  In 1897 he began exhibiting sculptures of animals at paris salons and continued doing so until returning to the United States in 1900, by which time he was ''firmly committed to animal sculpture.''&lt;ref&gt;Craven, Wayne, '’Sculpture in America'’, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, New York, 1968 pp. 537–538&lt;/ref&gt;

His work was exhibited at both the [[Pan-American Exposition]] ([[Buffalo, New York]], 1900) and at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition ([[Saint Louis, Missouri]], 1904) and a decade later at the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]] (San Francisco, California, 1915).  Harvey also produced [[architectural sculpture]] for the lion house at the [[New York Zoological Park]] and two lions for the [[Eaton family]] mausoleum in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada.

Harvey's most popular work was a life-sized elk produced for the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]] and used at their buildings and in cemeteries around the United States.

His home is included on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Clinton County, Ohio]].

==Elk, or Elk at Rest==
"The Order of Elks commissioned him to create a statue of the elk. and so pleased were they with the result that they ordered numerous replicas to be made."&lt;ref&gt;Craven, Wayne, '’Sculpture in America'’, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, New York, 1968 p. 540&lt;/ref&gt; These include the following:

'''Haitian Vodou art''' is art related to the [[Haitian Vodou]] religion. This religion has its roots in West African traditional religions brought to [[Haiti]] by slaves, but has assimilated elements from Europe and the Americas and continues to evolve. The most distinctive Vodou art form is the ''drapo Vodou'', an embroidered flag often decorated with sequins or beads, but the term covers a wide range of visual art forms including paintings, embroidered clothing, clay or wooden figures, musical instruments and assemblages. Since the 1950s there has been growing demand for Vodou art by tourists and collectors.

==Origins==

Art historians disagree on the origins of Haitian Vodou arts. [[Suzanne Blier]] makes the case that they come from the coastal areas of [[Benin]] and [[Togo]]. [[Robert Farris Thompson]] makes a plausible connection with Central Africa based on similarities with ''[[nkisi]]'' figures from the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]], and cosmograms, flags, drums and dances from that region.{{sfn|Vanhee|2002|p=244}}

The first slaves from West and Central Africa were brought to the Caribbean in the 16th century. Europeans often claimed that the slaves were being rescued from devil worship. 
However, the slaves maintained their religious practices in secret, and their priests were among the leaders of the first revolt in [[Haiti]] in 1791.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}}
Haiti became the first independent nation of African people in the [[Western Hemisphere]] in 1804 under President [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]].{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The traditional religion continued to be banned, and as late as the 1940s the Catholic church undertook a campaign against Vodou, ransacked temples and burned religious artifacts. 
Many of the techniques of sacred art have now been forgotten, and few sculptures were being made by 2001.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}}
The Vodou religion was finally recognized officially in 2002.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

The great majority of Haitians still practice the Vodou{{efn|The word ''Vodou'' means spirit.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}}} religion. 
The religion continues to evolve, and in addition to the traditional West African ''lwo'' (spirits) it now includes the spirits of heroes of resistance to the colonial forces, and spirits of powerful religious leaders.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The iconography of the Haitian Vodou religion combines elements from Africa, Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Cosentino|2013}}
Thus a ''drapo'' made for an African spirit may include an image of a Catholic saint. 
The saint's image was originally in part designed to deceive Catholic missionaries, but also was chosen in recognition of similarity between the saint and the ''lwa''.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}}
Since then the saint and the spirit have become [[Syncretism|syncretized]].{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}

==Interpretation==
[[File:Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou Voudun rites.jpg|thumb|Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou rites]]
Vodou art can be difficult to classify in Western terms. 
Rachel Beauvoir-Dominique, writing of Marianne Lehmann's{{efn|Marianne Lehmann is a former Swiss diplomat who made her home in Port au Prince, Haiti, where she collected about 2,000 examples of Haitian sacred art over a twenty year period. [[UNESCO]] has contributed some funds towards indexing and photographing the collection, which includes musical instruments, figures dressed in costumes and other artifacts.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}} }} Vodou art collection, notes that "even today, the Creole language does not possess any word to designate what Western civilization qualifies as 'art'."{{sfn|Benedicty-Kokken|2014|p=244}}
Poet and critic [[André Breton]] dismissed Haitian art, noting that Haiti had no museums or art collections. 
He apparently saw no value in the art associated with the "backward" Vodou religion.{{sfn|Benedicty-Kokken|2014|p=245}}

Some scholars distinguish narrative Haitian art, which may include depictions of events or ceremonies in which there are many images from Vodou, from "Vodou art" in the sense of art that has a sacred function. The latter would be designed for use in ceremonies or for placement in temples or on altars. 
Given the omnipresence of Vodou in Haiti, most narrative art would also include Vodou images.{{sfn|Crown|Rivers|Wilson|2013|p=110-111}}
However, the fluid and adaptive nature of Vodou makes it hard to clearly distinguish religion, art and religious art.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}

Alessandra Benedicty points out that Western scholars are led by their [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] intellectual framework into trying to explain Vodou art in terms of "intellectual truths". 
Vodou is open-ended and sometimes purposely dissimulates. 
Benedicty writes that in "the Vodou/Haitian aesthetic system, the ''objet d'art'' nurtures ambivalence and demands that the reader or the spectator interpret and thus participate in the production of an artistic text's meaning."  If there is a ''[[veve]]'' in the work, there is a possibility that the ''[[lwa]]'' the work was made for will possess the viewer.{{sfn|Glover|2010|p=194}}
The purchaser of a Vodou altar or other artwork may be possessed by their purchase.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}
A 1995 exhibit at the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in California of "The Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou"  included dramatic ritual interactions between Vodouists and ''lwa'' that may have included possession.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}

==Drapo==
A ''drapo Vodou'' is a handmade flag, typically embroidered and decorated with beads and sequins.
Although flags may have been made in West Africa before the arrival of Europeans, the flags widely used there by 1600 were derived from European flags. 
They were used as symbols of ethnic, military or religious allegiance.
The ''drapo Vodou'' also drew on Yoruba beadwork, Catholic vestments and Masonic aprons.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
In the 19th century and early 20th century most ''drapo Vodou'' were made from one or two colored fabric pieces decorated with embroidery, metal bangles and glass beads, with an image of the ''lwa'' made of shiny fabrics [[appliqué]]d to the cloth using techniques still followed in West Africa.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
Flags and banners used in the 21st century in rural areas often still have stylistically simple designs, in part due to the high cost of decorative material.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=18}}

With the older flags the background field that frames the image was usually decorated with widely spaced sequins or beads. 
Modern flag makers often completely cover the fabric of the field with sparkling sequins of one color, or with intricate geometrical patterns. 
Borders, which were either simple or did not exist on early ''drapo Vodou'', have evolved into highly elaborate patterns.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=21}}
The use of sequins in modern ''drapos'' dates to 1940, when Joseph Fortine saw a troupe of Afro-Brazilian samba dancers wearing sequin costumes in a Carnival parade. Fortine began to decorate the costumes of [[Rara]] band players with sequins, and in 1943 made a ''drapo Vodou'' for [[Damballa]] from a burlap coffee sack which he stretched on a wooden frame.
He made the image from sequin lines on a satin background, and added random sequins surrounding the image. 
Fortine taught his techniques to sequin artists such as Edgard Jean Louis, Sylva Joseph, Clotaire Bazile, and Yves Telemak. 
The youngest of these, Telemak, was the first to sign his work.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

There are two kinds of ''drapo Vodou''. The ''drapo servis'' are made for ceremonial use, and art flags are made for sale.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

===Drapo servis===
[[File:Trop Pou Te Haitian Vodou banners.jpg|thumb|Haitian Vodou drapos. The front flag is for Trop Pou Te.]]
The ''drapo servis'' are important religious icons. 
They are kept in shrine rooms, and carried by flag bearers in elaborate ceremonies in the main chamber of the temple. A ''drapo servis'' will include an image of a Catholic saint or a ''vèvè'' (trace-work emblem) of an ''lwa''{{efn|The ''lwas'' serve as intermediaries between humans and the supreme god.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} }} (spirit) such as [[Papa Legba]] or [[Ogun]] of the [[Yoruba religion]].{{sfn|Cosentino|2013}}
There are many ''lwas'', including [[Erzulie]], [[Guédé]], Damballa and [[La Sirene]].{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
The purpose of a ceremonial ''drapo'' is to flatter the ''lwa'' in the hope of gaining favor in return.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
Usually ''drapo servis'' are made in pairs, for example representing Ogun and Damballa.
Ogun was the ''lwa'' who led the slaves to freedom, and Damballa is the snake, representing the life force.
Ogun may be paired with other ''lwas''.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

A ''drapo servis'' will have a central image surrounded by a diamond-shaped border, will often have a fringe, and will be {{convert|36|by|36|in}} in size. The image may depict a Catholic saint associated with an ''lwa'' or may be a ''veve'' that represents the ''lwa'' symbolically and provides a gateway for it to enter the world of humans.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The image may be a [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]], a vividly colored paper image from Italy, Mexico or Spain of a Catholic saint that has been syncretized with the corresponding African spirit of the drapo.  The image may be an outline of the saint traced from a chromolithograph, or may be a detailed and faithful copy of a chromolithograph in beads and sequins.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}

The most widely used images of saints are those of [[Isidore of Chios|Saint Isidore]], [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James Major]], [[Saint Patrick]] and the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]].{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}
Veves include the ship of [[Agwé]], the cemetery cross of [[Baron Samedi]], the crossroads of Legba and so on.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=19}}
An image of a mermaid is used on flags for the water spirit [[LaSiren]]. 
This does not derive from ''veve'' or Catholic origins, but seems to have come from European nautical sources.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}
The image of a fish is important in Vodou as in Christian art, but the Vodou symbol comes from [[Fon people|Fon]] mythology rather than Christianity.{{sfn|Desmangles|1992|p=151}}
It represents Agwé, who corresponds to the Fon sea deity Agbê.
Agbê took the shape of a fish when he was given responsibility for the sea.{{sfn|Desmangles|1992|p=152}}

===Art flags===
[[File:VoodooValris.jpg|thumb|Flag by George Valris]]
Art flags show much wider variation in size and theme than ''drapo servis'', and rarely have a fringe. Some flags are closer to tapestries.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
In the 1950s collectors started to buy ''drapo Vodou'', and the ''oungan'' (priests) began to make them for sale as a source of income. 
The next generation of artists, active in the 1990s, included Eviland Lalanne, Joseph Oldof Pierre, Le Petit Frere Mogirus, Wagler Vital, Georges Valris, Roland Rockville, Ronald Gouin, and Antoine Oleyant. They introduced various innovations, in part driven by the shortage of materials for flagmaking. Antoine Oleyant has been called "the artist who really brought the flags into the realm of fine art."{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

In [[Port-au-Prince]] the skilled ''drapo'' artists have ready access to beads and sequins brought in from Canada and the United States. 
These artists earn their living from sales to tourists and to art galleries.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=18}}
In the 21st century there have been considerable changes to ''drapo Vodou'' as an art-form, in which artists such as Myrlande Constant{{efn|Myrlande Constant, born in 1970, was taught seamstress and beading techniques by her mother, and worked in a factory making wedding dresses. She taught herself flagmaking, using beads rather than sequins, and has since become internationally recognized.{{sfn|Ulysse|2011}} }} have introduced new themes and techniques.
Other contemporary ''drapo'' artists include Evelyne Alcide, Roudy Azor, Gabriel Chery, Lindor Chiler, Mireille Delice, Christian Dorleus and Josiane Joseph.
Their large and elaborate ''drapo'' represent in greater details the interactions with the ''lwas'' in events such as Vodou ceremonies and weddings.
They may also represent evangelical Christian themes, or have secular subjects.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
Edgard Jean Louis, a well-known flagmaker, made a flag called "Diana Erzulie" that included a photograph of the English [[Princess Diana]].{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
There is growing demand for such ''drapo'' by international art collectors.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}}

==Other objects==
[[File:Haitian vodou altar to Petwo, Rada, and Gede spirits; November 5, 2010..jpg|thumb|Altar to Petwo, Rada, and Gede spirits; 2010]]
In the 1940s Haitian professional artists began to create imitations of images provided by foreign entrepreneurs. The images represented the foreigners' view of the essence of Vodou art. This interaction was later dismissed and the Haitian works were stated to be [[Authenticity in art|authentic]].{{sfn|Richman|2008|p=203}}
In 1949 fifteen artists decorated the Episcopal Saint Trinite Cathedral in Port-au-Prince with murals that contrast Vodou art and traditional scenes from the bible.
Thirteen of the artists were Catholics and/or Vodouists.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=190}}
In the 1950s the murals became world famous. African gods were found in the symbolism of Christian images. Thus the "Damballah Virgin" by Andre Dimanche was identified as [[Erzulie]], a lwa connected to Aphrodite, Mater Dolorosa, health and an angry Madonna.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=191}}

A doll incorporated in a work of Vodou art can be animated so it can perform supernatural work, protecting the home. The Haitian Vodou priest Georges René explains the process, saying "anything can do mystique if you believe in it... you have to turn it into mystic. You baptize it. You make a ceremony. You put the food the ''lwa'' eats... after that you can work with it. It gets a soul. You can put it on an altar."{{sfn|Apter|Derby|2009|p=357}}

[[Pierrot Barra]] (1942–99) and Marie Cassaise made sacred altar installations from everyday objects such as dolls, sunglasses, sequins, speedometers, rosaries, mirrors and tinsel.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=9}}
Barra said his work was inspired by the Vodou spirits, who sometimes demanded it. He said, "When I sleep, while I'm dreaming, I see the Mysteries. When I sleep I see the spirits...they show me a design, some face, some kind of thing. Then when I wake up I create it."{{sfn|Cosentino|1999|p=16}}
A visitor to Port-au-Prince in 1991 described an altar installation Barra made for the mother goddess [[Ezili Dantor]]. Her head came from a plaster doll, with rouge, lipstick and white synthetic hair. She held a cutout picture of the baby Jesus, which represented the goddess's daughter Anais.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=9}}
A red fabric snake was wrapped round the body of the goddess, and a small rubber baby doll was at the foot of the statue. The whole was decorated with sparkles and cheap jewelry. This was not a traditional design, but was immediately recognized by Vodouists as authentic Vodou art.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=10}}

{{Hinduism small}}
Over the millennia of its development [[Hinduism]] has adopted several [[iconography|iconic symbols]], forming part of  '''Hindu iconography''', that are imbued with spiritual meaning based on either the [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]] or cultural traditions. The exact significance accorded to any of the icons varies with region, period and denomination of the followers. Over time some of the symbols, for instance the [[Swastika]] has come to have wider association while others like [[Om|Aum]] are recognized as unique representations of Hinduism. Other aspects of Hindu iconography are covered by the terms [[murti]], for icons and [[mudra]] for gestures and positions of the hands and body.

== Hindu Sacraments  ==
Hindu sacraments are physical objects or markings that are considered sacred and used as a sign of devotion by the followers of Sanathana dharma (Hinduism). These are often objects associated with a [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] (prayer) or religious ceremony.
[[File:জী. ডি. ব্লক সল্টলেক দূর্গা পুজো ২০১৮.jpg|thumb|right|Goddess [[Durga]] and a pantheon of other gods and goddesses being worshipped during [[Durga Puja]] Festival in Kolkata. This image was taken in Block - G.D, Saltlake Durga Puja 2018 in North Kolkata.]]

=== Tilaka ===
The ''[[tilaka]]'' (or ''tilak'') is a mark worn on the forehead or other parts of the body as a sign of  spiritual devotion. Hindus may wear a tilaka regularly or especially on religious occasions. The shape of the ''tilaka'' is often an indicator of devotion to a certain deity. For example, a [[Vaishnavism#Vaishnava tilak|'U' shape tilaka]] usually denotes devotion to [[Vishnu]], while [[Shiva]] devotees often wear it in the form of three horizontal lines. It may be made of [[saffron]], [[vermilion]], [[turmeric]], [[clay]] or simply ash.

To denote marriage and auspiciousness, married Hindu women commonly wear a decorative vermilion dot or bindu, or ''[[bindi (decoration)|bindī]]'' on the forehead. This is analogous to a [[wedding ring]] worn in western countries. In southern India, the mark is called pottu (or bottu). The exact shape, size and location of the bindi or pottu shows regional variation; for instance, in northern India the bindi is often worn just below the hairline, while in southern India it is more common to wear it between the eyebrows. In east India, especially in [[West Bengal]], traditionally larger ''bindis'' are worn as mark of  devotion towards Goddess [[Durga]].

=== Vibhuti ===
[[Vibhuti]] is the holy ash obtained from sacred [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] rites involving fire. Also a variant called Basma used as Vibhuti is prepared from the purified ashes of cow dung. Ash as the product of fire is considered intrinsically pure{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. It is used on the forehead, normally as three horizontal lines representing [[Shiva]]. Some Hindus meld both the three horizontal vibhuti lines of Shiva and the 'U' shape thilaka of Vishnu in an amalgam marker signifying ''[[Harihara|Hari-Hara]]'' (Vishnu-Shiva). In addition, sacred ash signifies that the body's origin is from dust and ash and to dust and ash it shall return. The ash is a marker of impermanence. Everything in the interim is but an illusion (''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'').

Vibhuti, when applied to the forehead, also symbolizes the '''willingness''' to destroy negative thoughts and qualities (jealousy, envy, anger, greed, etc.), as these negative qualities, if not destroyed, will bring all kinds of pains in life.

=== Rudraksha ===
[[Rudraksha]] are seeds of the [[Elaeocarpus ganitrus|rudraksha tree]] that, in [[Hinduism]], represent the tears of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] (also known as, [[Rudra]]). They are often threaded into a necklace and used as a [[rosary]] to accompany prayer and meditation.

== Universal symbols ==
Among the most revered symbols in Hinduism, three are a quintessential part of its culture, and are most representative of its general ethos:

=== Om (pronounced Aum) ===
{{main article|Om}}
''[[Om]]'' (or Aum, '''ॐ''') is the sacred [[sound symbol]] that represents Universe; the ultimate reality ([[Brahman]]). It is prefixed and sometimes suffixed to all Vedic [[mantra]]s and prayers. Aum is often said to represent God in the three aspects of  Brahman (A),  Vishnu (U) and Shiva (M). As the Divine primordial vibration, it represents the one ultimate reality, underlying and encompassing all of nature and all of existence.  The written syllable  '''ॐ''' called [[Om|omkara]] serves as a deeply significant and distinctly recognizable symbol for Hindu dharma. The pronunciation of Aum moves through all possible human [[natural language|linguistic]] [[vowel]] sounds and is different from the pronunciation of Om.  Both are often symbolically equated, although they are [[sound|sonic]]ally distinct.

=== Swastika ===
''[[Swastika|{{IAST|Swastika}}]]''  is a symbol connoting general auspiciousness.  It may represent purity of soul, truth, and stability  or, alternatively, [[Surya]], the sun.&lt;ref name="karelwerner1"&gt;Karel Werner, A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism 147-48 (Curzon Press 1994) {{ISBN|0-7007-0279-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its rotation in four directions has been used to represent many ideas, but primarily describes the four directions, the four Vedas and their harmonious whole. Its use in Hinduism dates back to ancient times.

=== Sri Chakra Yantra ===
''[[Sri Chakra]]''  Yantra of [[Tripura Sundari]] (commonly referred to as Sri Yantra) is a [[mandala]] formed by nine interlocking triangles.  Four of these triangles are oriented upright, representing [[Shiva]] or the Masculine.  Five of these triangles are inverted triangles representing  [[Shakti]], or the Feminine.  Together, the nine triangles form a web symbolic of the entire cosmos, a womb symbolic of creation, and together express [[Advaita Vedanta]] or [[non-duality]].  All other yantras are derivatives of this supreme yantra.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Symbols associated with individual deities==
[[File:Ravi Varma-Lakshmi.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Goddess [[Lakshmi]] holding and standing on a lotus.]]
Several symbols (animals, flora, instruments, weapons, or even color) in Hindu iconography are associated with particular [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], and vice versa. In certain cases the deities themselves are personifications of natural forces, for instance [[Agni]] (fire), [[Vayu]] (wind), [[Surya]] (Sun) and [[Prithvi]] (Earth). In other instances, the associations arise from specific incidents or characteristics related in [[Hindu theology]]. The iconography serve to identify the particular deity in their pictorial or sculptural representations. The symbolism also often links the deities with a particular natural or human attribute, or profession.

It is important to understand the symbolism, in order to appreciate the allegorical references in not only Hindu scriptures (for instance, [[Puranas|Puranic tales]]), but also in both ancient and modern secular works of authors from the Indian subcontinent. The art and science of designing temples includes the study of sculpture and the ornamentation of religious significance as described in [[Religious text|sacred texts]] (shilpa shaastra aagamas). In [[History of India|Ancient India]] twelve years of theoretical and practical training used to be given to the student by an able experienced teacher.

=== Shiva Lingam ===
[[File:Shivalinga Nutan Dal Arnab Dutta 2010.JPG|thumb|right|[[Shiva Lingam]]]]
The [[Lingam|Shiva Lingam]] represents the divine being [[Shiva]], and is used as a symbol of the power of fertility and strength {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. Shivalinga (Sivalinga) is the most important and a popular symbolic representation of Lord Shiva (Siva) in Hinduism. It represents God Himself in His all the three aspects – Creator, Sustainer or Protector and Destroyer (Dissolutor).&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.7"&gt;Harshananda, Swami, ''Principal Symbols of World Religions'', Sri Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore, Chennai, - 600 004 ({{ISBN|81-7120-176-8}})  p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meaning====
The word ‘Shivalinga’ is a combination of the words ‘Shiva’ (auspiciousness) and linga (sign or symbol). Thus ‘Shivalinga’ is a representation of God in His all-auspicious aspect. Again ‘Shiva’ also means ‘One in Whom all creation sleeps after dissolution’. ‘Linga’ also means the place of dissolution of the disintegrated universe.&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.7"/&gt;
The Shiva linga represents the supreme creator, the cause behind the creation, protection, and destruction of everything visible and invisible and the god shiva.

====TYPES====
Based on the mobility of the object of worship, Shivalingas are broadly divided into two categories – ‘Cala’ and ‘Acala’&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.8"&gt;Harshananda, Swami, ''Principal Symbols of World Religions'', Sri Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore, Chennai, - 600 004 ({{ISBN|81-7120-176-8}})  p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cala Shivalingas=====
These are made of stone, crystal, metals, clay, rice, dough, etc. These can be moved from one place to another.&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.8"/&gt;

=====Acala  Shivalingas=====
The sacred texts describe many types of shiva linga based on variations in the proportions. The following is the description of sarvatobhadra shiva lingam preferably constructed in black spotless hard stone which can be worshiped by every living being.
These Shivlingas are  installed in temples and are fixed to ground or a base. They are usually made of stones or metals.
The sacred texts suggest that the shiva linga must have three parts. A bottom most 1/3rd part that is in the earth - '''Brahma bhaagam''' (represents Brahma, the Creator of the World) it is rectangular in cross section.&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.8"/&gt; 
A middle 1/3rd part is called '''Vishnu Bhaagam''' or Vishnu Bhaga (it represents Vishnu, the Protector and sustainer of the world ); it is octagonal in cross section. Both the Brahma bhaagam and Vishnu Bhaagam are embedded in peetham (the ornamental pedestal).&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.9"&gt;Harshananda, Swami, ''Principal Symbols of World Religions'', Sri Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore, Chennai, - 600 004 ({{ISBN|81-7120-176-8}})  p.9&lt;/ref&gt; 
A visible 1/3rd '''Shiva Pooja bhaagam''' or Pooja bhaga( also known as Rudra  bhaagam or Rudra  bhaga) which is top most part which is worshiped. It is circular in cross section and cylindrical in shape. It represents Rudra (Shiva), the Dissoluter or Destroyer of the World. It is known as Pooja bhaagam because this part is worshipped.&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.9"/&gt; 
'''Brahmasutras''':
These are certain essential lines present on the Rudra  bhaagam (Rudra  bhaga). Without them a Shivlinga is unfit to be worshipped.&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.9"/&gt; 
The Shiva linga is at the level of ground and easily accessible to the worshipers irrespective of their caste, social or economic status.

=== The Lotus ===
The [[Nelumbo nucifera#Religious symbolism|Lotus]] is associated with the [[creation theology]] as well as the gods [[Vishnu]], [[Brahma]], and [[Lakshmi]].
It is the symbol of beauty and fertility. "In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], a human is adjured to be like the lotus; they should work without attachment, dedicating their actions to [[God]], untouched by [[sin]] like water on a lotus leaf, like a beautiful flower standing high above the mud and water." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lotussculpture.com/my_articles_lotus.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Veena ===
The musical instrument [[Veena]] is associated with the Hindu goddess [[Saraswati]] and the sage [[Narada]]. It represents arts and learning.

=== Conch ===
[[File:Hindu priest blowing conch during punja.jpg|thumb|A Hindu pundit (priest) blowing the conch during [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]].]]
{{Main article|Shankha}}
The conch shell is a major Hindu article of [[prayer]], used as a trumpeting announcement of all sorts. The God of Preservation, [[Vishnu]], is said to hold a special conch, Panchajanya, that represents life as it has come out of life-giving waters. In the story of Dhruva the divine conch plays a special part. The warriors of ancient [[India]] would blow conch shells to announce battle, such as is famously represented in the beginning of the war of Kurukshetra in the [[Mahabharata]], a famous Hindu epic. The conch shell is also a deep part of Hindu symbolic and religious tradition. Today most Hindus use the conch as a part of their religious practices, blowing it during worship at specific points, accompanied by ceremonial bells. Shankha also symbolizes the sound that created the universe and stands for knowledge.

=== Chakra ===
The [[Sudarshana Chakra|Chakra]] or disc-like weapon of [[Vishnu]] is often found mounted on the top of [[Vaishnava]] temples or incorporated into architectural designs. Images depicting Vishnu's four-armed [[Narayana]] form almost always include the Chakra in one of his hands. It is a general symbol for protection. Chakra is also known to symbolize the need to follow dharma and to condemn adharma.

=== Multiple heads and arms ===
[[File:Indian-dance-multiple-arms.jpg|thumb|In [[Dance in India|Indian dance]], the idea of multiple arms is often shown by several dancers standing behind each other with their arms in different positions.]] {{expand section|date=July 2011}}
An array of Hindu, Buddhist, and some Jain deities are often depicted with multiple heads, arms, and other body parts, creating what one author refers to as a "multiplicity convention" in religious iconography.&lt;ref name="manyarms"&gt;Srinivasan, Doris Meth, Many Heads, Arms, and Eyes: Origin, Meaning, and Form of Multiplicity in Indian Art, in ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', 121(2):279-280, 2001, {{OCLC|208705592}}; as a book by the same title: Leiden, New York, Brill, 1997, {{ISBN|978-9004107588}}, at pp. 3-4, et seq.., with preview available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=vZheP9dIX9wC Google books].&lt;/ref&gt; Such multiple body parts represent the divine [[omnipresence]] and [[immanence]] (ability to be in many places at once and simultaneously exist in all places at once), and thereby the ability to influence many things at once.&lt;ref name="manyarms" /&gt; The specific meanings attributed to the multiple body parts of an image are symbolic, not literal in context.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; In such depictions, the visual effect of an array of multiple arms is to create a kinetic energy showing that ability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/view?exhibitionId=%7b7EA7152E-99D7-45D4-A5F1-0BC1BC8CC8A8%7d&amp;oid=60005542&amp;pg=1&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=19&amp;ft=* The Goddess Durga Killing the Buffalo Demon (Mahishasura Mardini)], The Metropolitan Museum of Art, metmuseum.org, 2012 (last update). Accessed 2012-7-5. The Met notes that with sculptural depictions of multiple-armed deities viewed by the flicker of oil lamps in a dimly lit shrine, the visual kinetic energy of their many arms are no doubt made the more powerful to the viewer by the movement of light upon the sculpture.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vāhana ===
{{main article|Vāhana}}
Vāhana or vehicle, sometimes called a mount, is an animal or mythical entity closely associated with a particular deity in Hindu theology. Sometimes the deity is iconographically depicted riding and/or mounted on the vahana; other times, the vahana is depicted at the deity's side or symbolically represented as a divine attribute.

===Vishnu===
Vishnu is the Protector-God. Of the three gods of the Hindu Triad, Vishnu, being the Preserver, appears most human.
The Rig Vedic Vishnu is conceived as the sun in three stages - rising, zenith and setting. The Vedic Vishnu strides through the heavens in three steps. This is Vishnu's great deed and constitutes his great glory. With these three steps Vishnu, a solar deity, courses through the three divisions of the universe, "the god being manifest in a threefold form, as Agni on earth, Indra or Vayu in the atmosphere and Surya in the sky". He is said to have taken these three steps for the preservation and benefit of mortals. The zenith is appropriately called Vishnu's place. His third step cannot be seen with human eyes. It is here that Indra dwells.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4933">'''Integrated design''' is an approach to [[design]] which brings together specialisms usually considered separately.  For example:
*Design of a building which considers [[architecture]], [[structural engineering]], [[passive solar building design]] &lt;ref name="Shahabian"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Aryan |last=Shahabian |title=Integration of Solar-Climatic Vision and Structural Design in Architecture of Tall Buildings |format=PDF |conference=International Conference CISBAT 2015 Future Buildings and Districts - Sustainability from Nano to Urban Scale| pages=179–184 |date=9-11 September 2015 |location=Lausanne |publisher=Lausanne, LESO-PB, EPFL | url=https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/213316/files/2_SHAHABIAN.pdf |access-date=8 July 2018 |archive-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281906226_Integration_of_solar-climatic_vision_and_structural_design_in_architecture_of_tall_buildings |archive-date=September 2015 |doi=10.5075/epfl-cisbat2015-179-184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[HVAC]].  The approach may also integrate [[building lifecycle management]] and a greater consideration of the end users of the building.  The aim of integrated building design is often to produce [[sustainable architecture]].&lt;ref name="Moe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moe |first=Kiel |date=2008 |title=Integrated Design in Contemporary Architecture |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RzuEiv4Rvu4C |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |isbn=1568987455}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Design of both a product (or family of products) and the assembly system that will produce it.&lt;ref name="DeLitDelchambre"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Lit |first1=Pierre |last2=Delchambre |first2=Alain |date=2011 |title=Integrated Design of a Product Family and Its Assembly System |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rZzzBwAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=1461504171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chedmail"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Chedmail |editor-first=Patrick |date=2013 |title=Integrated Design and Manufacturing in Mechanical Engineering: Proceedings of the Third IDMME Conference Held in Montreal, Canada, May 2000 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=833oCAAAQBAJ |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9401599661|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Design of an electronic product that considers both hardware and software aspects, although this is often called co-design (not to be confused with [[participatory design]], which is also often called co-design).

The requirement for integrated design comes when the different specialisms are dependent on each other or "coupled". An alternative or complimentary approach to integrated design is to consciously reduce the dependencies. In  computing and systems design, this approach is known as [[loose coupling]].

==Dis-integrated design==
Three phenomena are associated with a lack of integrated design:&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://shura.shu.ac.uk/544/1/fulltext.pdf | title = Design Dis-integration Silent, Partial, and Disparate Design | last1 = Stevens | first1 = John, | last2 = Moultrie | first2 = James | last3 = Crilly | first3 = Nathan | date = 2009 | publisher =  Sheffield Hallam University | book-title = In: Undisciplined! Design Research Society Conference 2008 | id = http://shura.shu.ac.uk/544}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Silent design: design by default, by omission or by people not aware that they are participating in design activity.
*Partial design: design is only used to a limited degree, such as in superficial styling, often after the important design decisions have been made.
*Disparate design: design activity may be widespread, but is not co-ordinated or brought together to realise its potential.

A committee is sometimes a deliberate attempt to address disparate design, but [[design by committee]] is associated with silent design.

==Methods for integrated design==

The integrated design approach incorporates methods and tools to encourage and enable the specialists in the different areas to work together to produce an integrated design.&lt;ref name="TichkiewitchBrissaud"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1= Tichkiewitch |editor-first1=Serge |editor-last2= Brissaud |editor-first2=Daniel |date=2013 |title=Methods and Tools for Co-operative and Integrated Design| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=di34CAAAQBAJ |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9401722560}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such method is a [[charrette]] with all specialists present, early in the design process.&lt;ref name="ToddLindsey"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Todd |first1=Joel Ann |last2=Lindsey |first2=Gail |date=2013 |title=Planning and Conducting Integrated Design (ID) Charrettes |url=https://www.wbdg.org/resources/charrettes.php |work=Whole Building Design Guide |publisher=[[National Institute of Building Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
When Oliver Whynacht and his brother Jackie return home for their estranged father's funeral, Oliver is surprised to find out that he has inherited his father's estate which includes a funeral home. Shortly after arriving Henry, the handyman tells Oliver that the funeral home is facing bankruptcy. A stressed Oliver goes out for a night of drinking with Roberta Knickel after which he hits and kills a hiker with his truck. Roberta, who is both the local coroner and funeral home embalmer, helps Oliver stage the body so that it appears like an accident. This becomes Oliver's first paying customer, encouraging the duo to intentionally kill again. Suspicion is raised as the two fight to stay out of jail and stage "accidents" all over town. Due to their mutual partnership Oliver and Roberta begin to fall in love despite Oliver's seductive stepmother Luanne. After Roberta reveals that she is pregnant, the two get married. Shortly after the truth comes out that Roberta murdered Oliver's father to lure him back into town. Roberta was using Oliver to regain ownership of the funeral home which originally belonged to her mother. The film concludes as Roberta kills Oliver and gains possession of the funeral home.

== Reception ==
The film received mixed reviews from critics and users. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film was given a 33% by critics with an average rating of 4.7/10. Reviewers favored the dark comedic charm of the film however, the film lost points due to the uneven plot and characters. [[IMDb]] users were more forgiving of the quirky feature and gave the film a 6.1/10. 

Andrew Barker of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film "Bloody and irredeemably misanthropic" stating that the film "has enough charm to make for a sporadically enjoyable if wildly uneven entry in the growing body of cheeky corpse comedies." This review also calls attention to several actor's performances in the film including those of [[Jay Baruchel]] whom he found misplayed the role. Barker states that the two standout performances were that of [[Graham Green]] who played Henry Sanipass, and Christopher Shore who played Wayne Snarr. &lt;ref name="andrewbarker.variety"&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Barker

Suppl. 1.]] In the left foreground is a waterfall divided in the middle by a rock ; to the left is a tree-trunk lying half in the stream. In the right foreground is a rocky bank with a birch stem bent to the right. In the 
right middle distance is a great oak wood, traversed by a road on which stand a man and boy conversing with a woman who sits nursing a child. 
To the left of the road is the stream, through which two persons apparently men drive a flock of sheep. Beyond is a wooded slope. In the centre is a view over a cornfield with sheaves ; in the distance is a village with two wind-mills and a church. A fine evening, with rolling clouds and sunlight falling on the cornfield and wood. "This excellent 
picture, in addition to its being one of the largest works of the artist, is singularly grand and rich in its composition, combined with unusual clearness and brilliancy of colouring and the most masterly execution, justly entitling it to the appellation of a chef d'oeuvre" (Sm.).

Signed in full on a stone on the right at foot ; canvas though the Amsterdam catalogue says it is on oak panel 56 inches by 76 1/2 inches. Exhibited at Amsterdam, 1845, No. 134. 
Bought by [[Blount baronets|an ancestor of Sir Charles Blount, Bart.]], on the Continent about the year 1740 (Sm.). In the collection of Sir Charles Blount, Bart., who sold it to Sm. in 1836. Sold by Sm. to [[Adriaan van der Hoop|A. van der Hoop]], Amsterdam, 1837 (for 1450). Bequeathed by A. van der Hoop to Amsterdam with his collection in 1854. In the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, Van der Hoop bequest, 1910 catalogue, No. 2075."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/67/mode/1up  Entry 198 for ''''A Waterfall near an Oak Wood''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael made of waterfalls. As a warning of the forces of nature, these often included logs or broken tree stumps as silent witness to a more flooded scene than the one depicted. These must have sold well, as most of what remains today of Ruisdael's oeuvre are waterfall scenes. Inspired by the dramatic works of [[Allaert van Everdingen]], Ruisdael also made more Nordic versions (such as ''[[A Waterfall in a Rocky Landscape]]''), which included pine trees and mountains.

This is a list of the '''highest known prices paid for paintings'''. The current record price is approximately [[United States dollar|$]]450 million paid for [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Salvator Mundi (Leonardo)|''Salvator Mundi'']] in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Lost' Leonardo da Vinci to go on display, says National Gallery|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8632230/Lost-Leonardo-da-Vinci-to-go-on-display-says-National-Gallery.html|publisher=Telegraph|date=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Gallery Exhibition Catalogue|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/media/15705/exhibition-guide_leonardo-da-vinci.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The most famous paintings, especially [[old master]] works done before 1803, are generally owned or held at [[museum]]s, for viewing by patrons. Since the museums rarely sell them they are considered priceless. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' as having the highest ever [[insurance]] value for a painting. On permanent display at the [[Louvre]] in Paris, the ''Mona Lisa'' was assessed at US$100 million on December 14, 1962. Taking [[inflation]] into account, the 1962 value would be around US${{Inflation|US|100|1962|r=-1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}.{{Inflation-fn|US}}

The earliest sale on the list below (''[[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]]) is from March 1987; with a price of £24.75 million (£{{Inflation|UK|24.75|1987|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars). This sale tripled the previous record, and introduced a new era in top art sales. Before this, the highest absolute price paid for a painting was £8.1 million (£{{Inflation|US|8.1|1985|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) paid by the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] for [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Mantegna)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' at [[Christie's]] in London on April 18, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;William Wilson, [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-19/entertainment/ca-15137_1_mantegna-paintings Getty Pays $10.5 Million For Painting], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 19, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[constant dollars]], the highest price paid before 1987 was by the [[National Gallery of Art]] when in February 1967 they acquired [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Ginevra de' Benci]]'' for around $5 million (${{Inflation|US|5|1967}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) from the [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein]]. The sale of Van Gogh's ''Sunflowers'' was the first time a "modern" (in this case 1888) painting became the record holder, as opposed to the [[old master painting]]s which previously had dominated the market. In contrast, there are currently only nine pre-1875 paintings among the listed top 89, and none created between 1635 and 1874.

An exceptional case is graffiti artist [[David Choe]], who accepted payment in [[share (finance)|shares]] for painting graffiti art in the headquarters of a fledgling [[Facebook]]. His shares were of limited value when he was given them, but by the time of Facebook's [[IPO]] they were valued at around $200m.&lt;ref name="NYT Facebook"&gt;Nick Bilton, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/technology/for-founders-to-decorators-facebook-riches.html?_r=2 For Founders to Decorators, Facebook Riches]," ''The New York Times'', 1/1/12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Van Gogh, Picasso, and Warhol ==
[[File:Red vineyards.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[The Red Vineyard]]'' (1888), the only painting [[Vincent van Gogh]] sold during his lifetime]]
[[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Andy Warhol]] are by far the best-represented artists in the list. Whereas Picasso and Warhol became wealthy men, Van Gogh is known to have sold only one painting in his lifetime, ''[[The Red Vineyard]]'', for 400 francs (approximately $2,000 in 2018 dollars) to the impressionist painter and heiress [[Anna Boch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annaboch.com/theredvineyard/|title=The Red Vineyard Painting at annaboch.com|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices realised for just his nine paintings listed below, when adjusted for inflation to 2017, add up to over $900&amp;nbsp;million.

== Most expensive painting by a female artist ==
[[Georgia O'Keeffe]] holds the record for the highest price paid for a painting by a woman. On 20 November 2014 at Sotheby's, the [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] bought her 1932 painting ''Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1'' for $44.4 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|44.405|2014|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/most-expensive-female-artists-at-auction-2016-500096|title=The Most Expensive Female Artists 2016 - artnet News|date=2016-05-24|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2014/american-art-n09229.html|title=American Art Auction Results|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of highest prices paid &lt;!-- at auctions or private sales (inflation adjusted) --&gt;==
This list is ordered by [[consumer price index]] inflation-adjusted value (in bold) in millions of [[United States dollar]]s in {{Inflation-year|US}}.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Wikipedia template uses a yearly average inflation. Using monthly averages gives slightly different numbers, most significantly for paintings sold early or late in a year with significant inflation.&lt;/ref&gt; Where necessary, the price is first converted to dollars using the [[exchange rate]] at the time the painting was sold. The inflation adjustment may change as recent inflation rates are often revised. A list in another currency may be in a slightly different order due to exchange-rate fluctuations. Paintings are listed only once, i.e. for the highest price sold.

[[Neil Young]] skipped most of the acoustic set (the exceptions being his compositions "Mr. Soul" and "Wonderin'") and joined [[Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash]] during the electric set, but refused to be filmed; by his own report, Young felt the filming was distracting both performers and audience from the music. Despite his refusal, footage does exist of him performing "Mr. Soul" and "Long Time Gone." The "Mr. Soul" performance can be found as an Easter Egg on his Archives 1963-1972 DVD box set, however because of his resistance to being filmed during much of the performance the camera remains focused on Stills. Young's "Sea of Madness," heard on the album, was drawn from the Fillmore East concert, one month after the festival.  The original recording was later restored on the six-CD boxed set ''Woodstock: 40 Years On [Back To Yasgur's Farm]''

{{italic title}}
The '''''Collectanea''''', or '''''Magna glossatura''''' as it came to be known, is a collection of commentaries on the [[Psalms]] and the [[Pauline Epistles]] written by [[Peter the Lombard]] between 1139 and 1141.

==Origin and characteristics==

The ''Magna glossatura'' is a set of [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]es written beside passages from the [[Latin Vulgate Bible]]. These glosses were written by Peter the Lombard during his teaching career and before he became the bishop of Paris (1159–1160). His gloss of Psalms and his gloss of the Pauline Epistles (referred to as the ''Collectanea'') were compiled and became a part of the official gloss on the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection of glosses would take on the name of ''Magna glossatura'' and would, during the 12th century, replace the ''Glossa ordinaria'' as the most frequently studied and copied exegetical gloss of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colish|first1=Marcia L.|title=Peter Lombard|date=1994|publisher=Brill's Studies in Intellectual History|location=New York|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other works included the ''Libri Quatuor Sententiarum'' (or the ''[[Sentences|Four Books of Sentences]]'') and his commentaries in the ''glossa Ordinaria''. The ''Magna glossatura'', along with other systematic glosses, would have been developed at theological schools such as Laon and St.-Victor of Paris, and would have been used for the research conducted by theologians as well as the teaching of students in biblical exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouchard|first1=Constance B.|title=The Cistercians and the "glossa Ordinaria"|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|date=2000|volume=86 |issue=2|pages=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout of text in the ''Magna glossatura'', is written in the ''intercisum'' (or intercut) format, which was developed by Peter Lombard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Lesley|title=The Glossa Ordinaria : The Making of a Medieval Bible Commentary|date=2009|publisher=Brill|location=Boston|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed as a way of distinguishing scripture from the commentaries by writing the biblical verses in a larger script and on alternate lines next to the commentary, which would be ordered into columns. Blocks of scripture were then placed on the left edge of the columns to balance the biblical verses with the commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''intercisum'' method, from ca.1160, began to be applied to glosses on all the books of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This layout also gave glosses and their commentators greater influence in their relationship with the Word of God, as these glosses played a larger role in theological books by forming an essential reading in connection with the biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Lombard's gloss of the Pauline Epistles features not only commentaries concerning the traditional mode of reflection on the Christian faith, which regards the biblical text as ''sacra pagina'', but also commentaries of systematic theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Lombard writes on specific theological themes which deal with issues such as the nature of the Trinity. Lombard's glosses also include references to the works of other ecclesiastical figures and theologians, [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] to name a few. The biblical commentaries and ideas present in the ''Magna glossatura'' are also present in the various sermons given by Peter Lombard to his peers and to his cathedral's congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mimir''''' is an outdoor 1980 bronze and concrete sculpture by [[Keith Jellum]], located in northwest [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]]. The sculpture was commissioned by the Portland Development Commission and Tom Walsh of Tom Walsh Construction, and is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]].

==Description and history==
[[File:Oden vid Mims lik.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The sculpture is based on [[Mímir]] of [[Norse mythology]]. Pictured is a 19th-century depiction of [[Odin]] discovering Mímir's beheaded body.]]

''Mimir'' is an {{Convert|8|ft|adj=on}} bronze and concrete sculpture designed by Portland artist Keith Jellum, whose other works in the city include ''[[Electronic Poet]]'' (1984) and ''[[Transcendence (Jellum)|Transcendence]]'', a fish sculpture above Southpark Seafood  at Southwest Salmon Street and Ninth Avenue.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jennifer|title=Stumptown Stumper|url=http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=92227|accessdate=September 27, 2014|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|publisher=[[Pamplin Media Group]]|date=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mimir'' is based on the [[Mímir|figure of the same name]] in [[Norse mythology]], renowned for his knowledge and wisdom, and who is beheaded during the [[Æsir–Vanir War]]. Afterward, the god [[Odin]] carries around Mímir's head, which serves as an oracle and recites secret knowledge and counsel to him.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name=PAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Mimir|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/mimir|publisher=Public Art Archive|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Anderson of the ''[[Portland Tribune]]'' said the sculpture is a "combination of Norse mythology, gibberish, fish and space creature".&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; In 2007, Jellum recalled of its origin: "I'm not sure where [the image] came from. It's just at the time I was doing a whole lot of drawings, and it just popped out and sort of appealed to me. It's part fish, part space creature."&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

''Mimir'' was installed at Northwest 27th Avenue between Northwest Upshur and Thurman Streets in 1980, after being commissioned by the Portland Development Commission and Tom Walsh of Tom Walsh Construction.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; The [[Abstract art|abstract]] sculpture measures approximately {{Convert|24|in|cm}} x {{Convert|15|in|cm}} x {{Convert|13|in|cm}}, which rests on a concrete and stone base that measures {{Convert|7|ft|m}} x {{Convert|30|in|cm}} x {{Convert|30|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Mimir, (sculpture).|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!323725~!0#focus|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smithsonian Institution]] described the work as follows: "Decorative obelisk with a mask mounted at the top. The mask has a cone-like nose and tusks. It wears a layered breastplate with shoulder pads."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; The base includes a plaque with no legible text. Anderson described the plaque as "a few lines of illegible chicken scratch as if it's an alien artifact that landed in the middle of the city."&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; Jellum described the hieroglyphic inscription as a "play upon plaques", explaining: "You see all these plaques around and they give all this 'important' information. I thought it was just irrelevant to the piece. I like the idea of putting something up there that didn't have any information on it."&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

The sculpture's condition was deemed "treatment needed" by Smithsonian's "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in October 1993.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; It is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]].&lt;ref name=CN&gt;{{cite web|title=Mimir, 1980|url=http://culturenow.org/entry&amp;permalink=06318|publisher=cultureNOW|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Anderson of the ''Portland Tribune'' contributor called the sculpture a "curiosity" and "whimsical", and said the plaque adds to its mystique.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

A '''monologist''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|ɪ|s|t|,_|-|ɡ|ɪ|s|t}}), or interchangeably '''monologuist''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|l|ə|ɡ|ɪ|s|t}}), is a solo artist who recites or gives [[oral interpretation|dramatic readings]] from a [[monologue]], [[soliloquy]], [[poetry]], or work of literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monologue |title=Monologue |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the entertainment of an audience.  The term can also refer to a person who monopolizes a conversation; and, in an obsolete sense, could describe a bird with an unchanging, repetitive song.&lt;ref&gt;"Monologist."

==Dramatic monologist==
A '''dramatic monologist''' is a term sometimes applied to an actor performing in a [[monodrama]] often with accompaniment of [[music]]. In a monodrama the lone player relays a story through the eyes of a central character, though at times may take on additional roles.&lt;ref&gt;Pavis, Patrice (1998). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tIXwrduoDMoC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217 Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis]''.  Translated from the French by Christine Shantz. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|9780802081636}}. "Monodrama", pp.&amp;nbsp;217–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era the more successful practitioners of this art have been actresses frequently referred to by the French term “diseuse”.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Technique  By Joseph Twadell Shipley 1964 p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - the December 21, 1935 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tennyson's Rapture: Transformation in the Victorian Dramatic Monologue  By Cornelia D. J. Pearsall 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diseuse==
'''Diseuse''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|d|iː|ˈ|z|ɜː|z}}, {{IPAc-en|us|d|iː|ˈ|z|uː|z}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|diseuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|diseuse}}&lt;/ref&gt; French for "teller", also called talkers, storytellers, dramatic-singers or dramatic-talkers,&lt;ref&gt;Theater Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beaver County Times (Earl Wilson column) March 9, 1972 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  is a term, at least on the English-speaking stage, that appears to date back only to the last decade of the 19th century. The early uses of “diseuse” as a theatrical term in the American press seem to coincide with [[Yvette Guilbert|Yvette Guilbert’s]] tour of New York City in the mid-1890s.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Mars Semi-Weekly Sentinel''. Lemars, Iowa. January 09, 1896. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cosmopolitan Magazine]]'' in a February 1896 article on Guilbert described the term as a "newly-coined and specific title".&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmopolitan''. February 1896. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TheaterDictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Diseuse is the feminine form of the French word ''diseur'' "teller", a derivative of ''dire'' "to say, to tell", which in turn came from [[Latin]] ''dīcere''.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster's Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that over the last century or so few male actors became noteworthy performing solely as a dramatic monologist, though many well known actors have played in monodramas over their careers.

The publication ''Theatre World'' wrote in a 1949 piece: "In our time we have fallen under the spell of three remarkable women practising the art of the diseuse—[[Ruth Draper]], [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]], and [[Joyce Grenfell]]. Each of these great artists has the gift of crowding the stage with imaginary figures who become so vivid as to be practically visible, but as all of these artists happen to be members of the fair sex it could be assumed that they possess a magic denied the mere male of the theatre." The article goes on to suggest that [[Sid Field]] was an actor of comparable talents.&lt;ref&gt;"Whispers from the Wings", by "Looker On". ''Theatre World''. April 1949 (vol. 45, no. 291), p.&amp;nbsp;32. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WVNXAAAAIAAJ Snippet preview on Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book "''The Guest List''" by Ethan Mordden, the art of the diseuse is defined as "a speaker of lyrics: in effect, one who uses the music to get to the words".&lt;ref&gt;The Guest List: How Manhattan Defined American Sophistication—from the Algonquin Round Table to Trumam capote's Ball” by Ethan Mordden (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 21, 1935, edition of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' an entertainment columnist wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The English language does not contain a word which perfectly describes the performance of Ruth Draper, who comes to the [[Regional Enterprise Tower|Nixon]] next Thursday for the first time in several years to give a different program at each of her four performances here. "Speaking Portraits" and "Character Sketches" are the two terms most frequently applied to Miss Draper's work; and yet it is something more than that. "Diseuse" is the French word, but that is more readily applicable to an artist like Yvette Guilbert or Raquel Meller. Monologist is wholly inadequate. The word "Diseuse" really means "an artist in talking" so that may be the real term to use in connection with Miss Draper.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joyce Grenfell wrote in ''Darling Ma: Joyce Grenfell's Letters to her Mother 1932–1944'', "What makes a good diseuse is a capacious verbal (and visual) imagination, and an excellent oral delivery. Call these witty ladies Diseuses of the Heart and Lungs. I do."&lt;ref&gt;Darling Ma: letters to her mother, 1932–1944 by Joyce Grenfell  1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral interpretation==

'''Oral interpretation''', sometimes called dramatic reading or interpretative reading, is the oral staging of a work of literature, prose or poetry, by a person who reads rather than memorizes the material. Typically they are performed by solo artists who – unlike players in a monodrama – do not assume or tell the story through any one character, but do so instead with oral nuances to bring the story alive with their interpretation of how the creator of the piece intended the story to be told.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Communication  By James Fernandes  2005 p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studygs.net/interpretive.htm |title=Studyygs.net |publisher=Studygs.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soliloquist==

The term soliloquist can apply to a monologist reciting a [[soliloquy]], usually from a play, to entertain an audience. Passages in which characters orally reveal their thoughts are probably most associated with the works of [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/soliloquy |title= definition of soliloquy by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |title=Soliloquy – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Media Distribution/Irjax Enterprises''' was a [[comic book]] [[distributor]] and boutique [[publisher]] active in the 1970s and early 1980s during the growth of the [[direct market]]. After the distribution arm of the company went out of business in 1982, its processing centers and warehouses formed the basis for [[Diamond Comics Distributors]], the now-dominant comics distributor. New Media's publishing arm continued in the business until 1985.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Hal Shuster, his father, Irwin, and his brother, Jack, formed the paper distribution company '''Irjax Enterprises''' (a play on the names "'''Ir'''win" and "'''Jack'''"), based in [[Rockville, Maryland]], in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="DuinDD"/&gt;

=== Entering the direct market ===
After [[Phil Seuling]] established the [[direct market]] in 1972, his company [[Sea Gate Distributors]] maintained a virtual monopoly on comic book distribution, until a lawsuit brought by Irjax in 1978.&lt;ref name="DuinDD"&gt;"Direct Distribution," in Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s). ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998), pp. 126-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Irjax sued the comic book publishers [[DC Comics|DC]], [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], [[Archie Comics|Archie]], and [[Warren Comics|Warren]] for their anti-competitive arrangement with Seagate.&lt;ref&gt;Rozanski, Chuck. [http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg104.html "Tales From the Database: Chuck Goes to New York Part I,"] Mile High Comics (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the lawsuit Irjax gained "a sizeable chunk of the direct-distribution market,"&lt;ref name="DuinDD"/&gt; with distribution centers in Boston and Tampa.&lt;ref name=Diamond-timeline&gt;[http://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/597?articleID=117735 "Diamond Timeline Chronicles 30 Years of Service &amp; Success,"] [[Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc.]] official website. Accessed Feb. 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston-area division was known as '''Solar Spice and Liquors'''&lt;ref&gt;David, Peter. [http://www.peterdavid.net/archives/001238.html "Carol,"] PeterDavid.net (December 11, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; (named after a fictional corporation created by science fiction writer [[Poul Anderson]]).

=== Steve Geppi ===
{{main|Diamond Comic Distributors}}
Meanwhile, Baltimore retailer [[Steve Geppi]] had four comic book stores&lt;ref name="Resume"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/1997/36/b3543113.htm Resume for "Stephen A. Geppi" at BusinessWeek, September 8, 1998]. Accessed March 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Success"&gt;Warshaw, Michael. "From Mailman to Tycoon," in DeGarmo, Scott (ed.), ''[[SUCCESS (magazine)|Success]]'' (June, 1994), pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and was acting as a sub-distributor, "doing a little informal distributing . . . for smaller retailers." By 1981, Geppi was one of New Media/Irjax's biggest accounts.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; In late 1981, the company, now known as '''New Media Distribution''', or '''New Media/Irjax''', filed for Chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: NM in Trouble, to File for Chapter 11," ''The Comics Journal'' #70 (January 1982), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the "last loyal customers" when New Media began having fiscal difficulties, Geppi made a deal with Shuster: "[t]he owner was going into retail," so Geppi agreed to provide Shuster with "free books for a period of time in return for his account list."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt;

When Hal Shuster relocated to Florida early in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: New Media Publications Relocates to Florida," ''The Comics Journal'' #71 (March 1982), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; he asked "Geppi to service more accounts for a bigger discount,"&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; thereby effectively selling Geppi the distribution end of the business.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: New Media Distribution out of Business," ''The Comics Journal'' #72 (May 1982), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Geppi immediately founded [[Diamond Comics Distributors]]. Geppi took over New Media/Irjax's office and warehouse space and had to "sort out the good customers from the bad overnight," negotiating with creditors to continue Shuster's distribution business as Diamond Comic Distributors.&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"&gt;"Diamond Comic Distributors," in Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s). ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998), pp. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing ==
In addition to its distribution business, New Media/Irjax acted as a small publisher from 1976 until 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Bethke, Marilyn. "New Media's Publishing Empire," ''The Comics Journal'' #76 (October 1982), pp. 154-161.&lt;!-- concerns New Media/Irjax, ''Comics Feature'', and ''RBCC'' (''Rocket's Blast Comicollector'')--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Under the names '''Irjax Enterprises''' and then '''New Media Publishing''', it mostly produced periodicals for comics and fantasy/science fiction enthusiasts, the most notable title being ''[[Comics Feature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Headlines: New Media Expands Publishing Base, Comics and Commentary Magazines to Begin!" ''Comics Feature'' #6 (October 1980), pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The company also published a few original comic book titles (in the adventure and fantasy genres),&lt;ref&gt;"Headlines: New Media Expands: Heroines, Romance Titles Added," ''Comics Feature'' #12/13 (Sept./Oct. 1981), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; usually featuring creators pulled from the ranks of [[fandom]]. The company published out of [[Largo, Florida]]; [[Tampa, Florida]]; and finally [[Studio City, California]].

Notable names who worked for New Media/Irjax as editors and/or writers include [[Carol Kalish]], [[Kurt Busiek]], and [[Peter B. Gillis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Headlines: NMP Editorial Shake-Up," ''Comics Feature'' #12/13 (Sept./Oct. 1981), p. 18: Peter Gillis leaves New Media Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7598">'''OBERIU''' (Russian:  ОБэРИу - Объединение реального искусства; English: the '''Union of Real Art''' or the '''Association for Real Art''') was a short-lived [[Russian avant-garde|avant-garde]] collective of [[Russian Futurist]] writers, musicians, and artists in the 1920s and 1930s. The group coalesced in the context of the "intense centralization of Soviet Culture" and the decline of the avant garde culture of [[Leningrad]], as "leftist" groups were becoming increasingly marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Kharms, Daniil.  ''Today I Wrote Nothing''.  2009, p21-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in [[1928 in poetry|1928]] by [[Daniil Kharms]] and [[Alexander Vvedensky (poet)|Alexander Vvedensky]], OBERIU became notorious for provocative performances which included circus-like stunts, readings of what was perceived as nonsensical verse, and theatrical presentations, such as Kharms's ''Elizabeth Bam'', that foreshadowed the European [[Theatre of the Absurd]]. The presentations took place in venues ranging from theaters and university auditoriums to dormitories and prisons. The group's actions were derided as "literary [[hooliganism]]" in the ever-more conservative press of the late 1920s. It was chastised even more in the early 1930s, and many of its associates were arrested. The OBERIU has often been called "the last Soviet avant-garde."&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Phillipe Jaccard's book on Daniil Kharms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Some scholars say that the OBERIU manifesto was penned mostly by the poet [[Nikolay Zabolotsky]] with the help of Kharms. The core of the group included [[Daniil Kharms]], [[Alexander Vvedensky (poet)|Alexander Vvedensky]], [[Nikolay Zabolotsky]], [[Konstantin Vaginov]], Igor Bakhterev, and others, including actors, musicians and filmmakers. 

The Russian artist [[Kazimir Malevich]] gave the OBERIU shelter in his newly created arts institute, letting them rehearse in one of the auditoriums. It is reported that he said to the young "Oberiuty" (as they are called in Russian): "You are young trouble makers, and I am an old one. Let's see what we can do." Malevich also gifted a book of his own ("God Is Not Cast Down") to founder Daniil Kharms with the relevant inscription "Go and stop progress!"

==Decline==
In the 1930s, Socialist Realism and Stalin's purges precluded the formation of any such "leftist" or "radical" public artistic groupings. After about 1931, The OBERIU held no more public performances, and most of those involved showed their writing only to a small circle of friends, though Zabolotsky went on to become a marginally accepted Soviet poet. 

Though the group was held together for a while by common interest, some split away. Zabolotsky seems to have had a falling out with Vvedensky. In the 1930s Kharms and Vvedensky became more closely involved with a group of friends who met semi-regularly for what they called "conversations."{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Yakov Druskin]], a Christian philosopher and music-theorist (he wrote on [[Bach]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and [[Anton Webern|Webern]]), was a key member of this group. Druskin and his friend Leonid Lipavsky (a children's writer under the name of Leonid Savelyev, and an amateur mathematician and author of philosophical tracts) had known Alexander Vvedensky in high-school, and had become friends with Kharms and Zabolotsky as well. Lipavsky actually wrote down a number of the "conversations." [[Nikolay Oleynikov]], an editor at the children's publishing house which had long employed the young poets of the OBERIU as writers and translators of children's literature, became part of this group by the mid-thiries. 

This later grouping, which had no public outlet, is generally called the "chinari" (i.e. "the titled ones") group in Russian literary scholarship, though it is uncertain that they ever formalized a name for the group, nor that they called themselves "chinari" with any consistency. Thus, the names "OBERIU" and "chinari" are somewhat interchangeable in the scholarship. The borders between the two groups are (and were) permeable, and the only basic continuity is the presence of Kharms and Vvedensky.

==Influence==
Though short-lived, the OBERIU seems to have had lasting effects on Russian culture. Since the late 1980s a kind of cult fervor has grown in Russia around these long-forgotten writers. And, in fact, the ideas and art of the OBERIU had been influential even in the 1960s and 1970s, in what is called the "unofficial" art world of the Soviet Union. Some writers and artists of that period would proudly admit the influence of the OBERIU, in others it is clear enough. The OBERIU was seen as something of a missing link from the old Russian avant-garde to the new one. Poets like [[Genrikh Sapgir]], [[Alexei Khvostenko]], [[Anri Volokhonsky]], [[Lev Rubinstein]], [[Dmitri Prigov]], [[Timur Kibirov]], [[Eduard Limonov]] were certainly familiar with the OBERIU writers through "[[samizdat]]" publications circulating in the underground art scene, and their writing reflects that knowledge, though in very different ways for all of them. Leningrad avant garde musical group [[N.O.M.]] borrows heavily from OBERIU movement citing [[Kharms]] and [[:ru:Олейников, Николай Макарович|Oleynikov]] as lyrical influences. They paid homage to Kharms, Oleynikov by releasing An Album Of Real Art with songs based on their lyrics. Novosibirsk [[punk rock]] musician [[Egor Letov]] cited [[Alexander Vvedensky (poet)|Vvedensky]] as an influence for his lyrics.

==OBERIU in English==

An anglophone edition of OBERIU writings translated by [[Eugene Ostashevsky]], [[Matvei Yankelevich]], [[Genya Turovskaya]], Thomas Epstein and Ilya Bernstein was published by the Northwestern University Press in 2006. Several translations of Kharms's short stories, notebooks, letters, poems and diaries have been published over the years, for instance by George Gibian (Norton Library, 1974), Matvei Yankelevich (Overlook Press, 2007), Anthony Anemone and Peter Scotto (Academic Studies Press, 2013) and most recently Alex Cigale (Northwestern University Press, 2017). Kharms's poems were also translated by [[Roman Turovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/lit.html&lt;/ref&gt; Poems by Kharms (8), Vvedensky (1) and Zabolotsky (6) are included in The Penguin Book of Russian Poetry edited by Robert Chandler, Boris Dralyuk and Irina Mashinski published 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3940">'''Orphaned technology''' is a descriptive term for [[computer]] products, programs, and platforms that have been abandoned by their original developers.  Orphaned technology refers to [[software]], such as [[abandonware]] and [[Vintage computing|antique]] software, but also to [[computer hardware]] and practices.  In computer software standards and documentation, [[deprecation]] is the gradual phasing-out of a software or [[programming language]] feature, while orphaning usually connotes a sudden discontinuation, usually for business-related reasons, of a product with an active user base.

For users of technologies that have been withdrawn from the market, there is a choice between maintaining their software support environments in some form of [[emulation (computing)|emulation]], or switching to other supported products, possibly losing capabilities unique to their original solution.

&lt;!-- Suggest adding the year of discontinuance, and sorting in that order; See Talk:Orphaned technology --&gt;
Some well-known examples of orphaned technology include:
* [[Coleco ADAM]] - 8-bit [[home computer]]
* [[TI 99/4A]] - 16-bit [[home computer]]
* [[Mattel Aquarius]]
* [[Apple Lisa]] - 16/32-bit graphical computer
* [[Apple Newton|Newton PDA]] (Apple Newton) - tablet computer
* [[DEC Alpha]] - 64-bit [[microprocessor]]
* [[HyperCard]] - hypermedia
* [[ICAD (software)|ICAD (KBE)]] - knowledge-based engineering
* [[Javelin Software]] - modeling and data analysis
* [[LISP machines]] - LISP oriented computers
* [[Classic Mac OS]] - [[m68k]] and [[PowerPC]] operating system
* [[Microsoft Bob]] - graphical helper
* [[Windows 9x]] - x86 operating system
* [[OpenDoc]] - compound documents ([[Mac OS]], [[OS/2]])
* [[Prograph]] - visual programming system
* [[Poly-1]] - parallel networked computer designed in New Zealand for use in education and training
* [[Mosaic notation program]] - music notation application by [[Mark of the Unicorn]]&lt;ref&gt;(19 August 2008).

Symbolics Inc's operating systems, [[Genera (operating system)|Genera]] and OpenGenera, were twice orphaned, as they were ported from [[LISP machines]] to computers using the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] [[64-bit]] CPU.{{elucidate|date=May 2014}}

User groups often exist for specific orphaned technologies, such as The [[Hong Kong]] [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] User Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crmloyalty.com/hknug/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311170255/http://www.crmloyalty.com/hknug/ |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Symbolics Lisp [Machines] Users' Group (now known as the Association of Lisp Users),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alu.org/alu/about|title=About Us|publisher=Association of Lisp Users|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Newton Reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panix.com/~clay/newton/ |title=Newton Reference |website=Panix.com |date=1998-02-27 |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Sibelius_(scorewriter)#'Save_Sibelius'_campaign|Save Sibelius]] group sprang into existence because [[Sibelius (scorewriter)]] users feared the application would be orphaned after its owners [[Avid Tech]] fired most of the development team, who were thereafter hired by [[Steinberg]] to develop the competing product, [[Dorico]].

'''Pilane''' in Klövdal, [[Tjörn]], [[Bohuslän]], Sweden, is an [[Iron Age Scandinavia|Iron Age]] settlement site and [[grave field]], dated to 0-600 AD. The grave field consists of approximately 90 ancient monuments, including [[Stone circle (Iron Age)|stone circle]]s, [[burial mound]]s, circular stone [[grave marker]]s and [[standing stone]]s. The site is under the care of the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]] and the land is leased as sheep pasture.

In the summer of 2007 the Pilane site started to be used for a seasonal [[outdoor sculpture]] exhibition: '''''Skulptur i Pilane''''' (''Sculpture in Pilane''). During its first year the exhibition had 60,000 visitors. The art activities are coordinated by the private, non-profit '''Pilane Heritage Museum''', which is financed by the entry fees.

The site occupies a prominent position, with extensive views over land and sea. The [[Basteröd rock carvings]] site is nearby.

[[Image:Frauenchiemsee Torhalle - Michelskapelle Museum 5 Diptychon Dichter Muse.jpg|right|thumb|Poet and Muse diptych]]
The '''Poet and Muse diptych''' is a [[Late Antique]] [[Diptych|ivory diptych]] that appears to commemorate, and to flatter, the literary pursuits of the aristocrat who commissioned it, so that it stands somewhat apart from the [[consular diptych]]s that were carved for distribution to friends and patrons when a man assumed the [[Roman consul|consular dignity]] during the [[later Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Poet and Muse diptych was briefly discussed and illustrated (p. 18, fig. 10) in Kathleen J. Shelton, "The Consular Muse of Flavius Constantius" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''65'''.1 (March 1983), pp. 7-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The original inscription in this example, unusually,&lt;ref&gt;In the ordinary layout the inscription runs unbroken, from left to right across the raised top framing of both leaves legible when the diptych was fully opened.&lt;/ref&gt; will have been carried out on the borders of the reverse side, which was infilled with a layer of wax for writing on, the ivory diptych being a very grand example of a [[wax tablet]]; the inscription has not survived, so there can be no way to identify the writer for whom it was made. In the literature that has accumulated about this diptych, various prominent figures have been offered as candidates: [[Ausonius]], [[Boethius]], and [[Claudian]],&lt;ref&gt;Identifications with the court poet Claudian involve moving the date of this diptych impossibly far back in time, to ca 400 CE, inconsonant with its artistic style.&lt;/ref&gt; and even earlier figures, like [[Ennius]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], with whom the donor wished to be associated&lt;ref&gt;Shelton 1983, p. 18 note 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The muse represented is [[Erato]], muse of [[lyric poetry]], with her usual attribute, the [[cithara]], which she rests upon an ornately fluted column. The poet on the facing panel is seated, roused from his contemplation by the inspiring presence of his [[Muse]]. His writings, a scroll and writing tablets or small [[codices]], lie scattered at his feet. His face is carefully characterized as a portrait,&lt;ref&gt;The delineation of the particularity of his features is a pagan, not a Christian concern; "The whole temper of the new religion was opposed to anything in the nature of an image or idol: its aim was to represent ideas, not isolated figures", succinctly observes [http://serdar-hizli-art.com/history_of_art/constantinian_basilicas_sculpture.htm Serdar Hizli, "The Constantinian Basilicas - Sculpture"].&lt;/ref&gt; a man of middle age, balding, his features furrowed in thought. The classicizing realism and the [[iconography|iconographic]] situation, and the complete absence of any Christian symbolism whatsoever — Christian authors write under the inspiration of angels — combine to suggest a man who has been schooled in the [[Roman paganism|pagan tradition]], which no longer led to the traditional public ''[[cursus honorum]]'', however, by the 5th century, and would instead have implied a man who was living secluded from public life, which had become resolutely Christian.&lt;ref&gt;The Theodosian decrees of 391 had closed the temples and criminalized pagan acts of piety. The [[Platonic Academy|Neoplatonic Academy]] was closed by order of [[Justinian]] in 529 CE: see [[End of Hellenic Religion]].&lt;/ref&gt; W.F. Volback characterized this as a "private" diptych, with the implication of a limited public, perhaps even retained by its patron;&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Volback, ''Elfenbeinarbeiten der Spätantike und des frühen Mittelalters'', 3rd ed. (Mainz) 1976, cat. no 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Delbrueck held it apart from the consular diptychs he published&lt;ref&gt;Delbrueck, ''Consulardiptychen'' Berlin/Leipzig, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; and published it separately, noting that it was difficult to ascertain the purpose and occasion for its facture.&lt;ref&gt;Delbrueck, ""Denkmäler Spätantiker Kunst", ''Antike Denkmaeler'' '''4''' (1931) p. 9f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The diptych is conserved in the Treasury of the [[Monza Cathedral|Duomo of Monza]], near [[Milan]].

'''Prudence Risley Residential College for the Creative and Performing Arts''', commonly known as '''Risley Residential College''', '''Risley Hall''',  or just '''Risley''', is a program house (themed [[residence hall]]) at [[Cornell University]]. Unlike most other dormitories on campus, Risley is a [[residential college]]; house members, or "Risleyites," have some say in the administration of the residence hall, can continue to reside there as long as they are enrolled at Cornell, are encouraged to eat together at the in-house dining hall, and participate in educational activities such as guest lectures within the dormitory. The building houses 192 students, chosen by Risleyites from a number of applications, as well as one or two Artists-In-Residence ("AIRs"), who live in the building and organize regular programs in which the house members participate. Currently, Risley's Artist-In-Residence is Adam J. Boggs. Previous AIRs include Patrick Gray, Carolina Osorio-Gill, Natalie Tyler, [[Abraham Burickson]], [[Gregory Halpern]], and [[Brandon Bird]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brandon Bird resume|url=http://brandonbird.com/resume.html|website=The official website of Brandon Bird|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many famous people have visited the house for intimate discussions with the Risleyites, such as [[Anthony Rapp]], [[John Cleese]], who hosted a question and answer session after the showing of his film ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandonbird.com/photos/cleese_big.jpg|format=JPG|title=Photographic image|website=Brandonbird.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Samuel R.

==History==
[[File:RisleyRC Circa 1920s.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Risley as seen on a postcard, circa 1910s]]
In 1911, [[Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage|Mrs. Russell Sage]] donated $300,000 (roughly $7.5M in 2018 adjusted for inflation) to the University for the construction of a women's dormitory.  At her request, the building was named after her [[Russell Sage|husband's]] mother, Prudence Risley.  The building was opened to students in 1913. It was unusually luxurious, with sculptures and expensive furnishings in common areas, many of which were donated by Cornell co-founder [[Andrew Dickson White]].

In 1970, under the guidance of Ruth Darling, the University converted Risley into a co-ed creative-arts-themed dormitory, the campus's first program house. Judith Goodman had been looking for a house to share with some of her more artistic friends. When she asked Cornell about the house she wanted, they said it had just been given away, but offered Risley instead. The cost of running the fancy all-female dorm was too much, and Cornell was going to shut Risley down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/98/10.22.98/obit.html|title=Obituary|website=News.cornell.edu|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several attempts to develop an acceptable plan for running Risley as an arts dorm, and much Cornell paperwork aided by Darling, Goodman and her friends finally got her vision of Risley approved. In the first year, the college received over 1000 applications for the roughly 200 spots in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.housing.cornell.edu/docs/Demo%20documents/risley%20newsletter%202006.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909103603/http://housing.cornell.edu/docs/Demo%20documents/risley%20newsletter%202006.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-09 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Their system of government in 1970 is similar to the current one today, though there have been many amendments to the Risley Charter in the intervening years.

Notable former Risley residents from before the creation of Risley Residential College include [[Margaret Bourke-White]]&lt;ref&gt;''Portrait of Myself' by Margaret Bourke-White, p 30&lt;/ref&gt;', [[Elspeth Huxley]],&lt;ref&gt;''Elspeth Huxley: A Biography'' by C.

==Facilities==
[[File:Risley hall, backyard.gif|thumb|right|250px|Risley Residential College as seen from its [[courtyard]]]]
As a dormitory, Risley offers a unique living experience.  The [[Gothic Revival|Tudor Gothic]] building itself is shaped like a large red castle, modeled directly on [[Hampton Court Palace]] in England. The architect, [[William Miller (architect)|William H Miller]], was requested to design the floor plan such that no two rooms would be identical. Consequently, the rooms vary greatly. Sizes range from a single room that is 93 square feet (9 m²), a former maid's room, to a double room that is 273 square feet (25 m²), the largest double on campus.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Room features include balconies, fireplaces, [[dumbwaiter (elevator)|dumbwaiter]] shafts, secret stairwells, [[bay window]]s, [[embrasure]]s, and [[turret]]s. At the request of [[Andrew Dickson White]], the Risley [[Great Hall]] was constructed as a smaller scale replica of [[Oxford]]'s [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]'s own dining hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campuslife.cornell.edu/housing_residential/risley.asp|title=Living at Cornell|website=Campuslife.cornell.edu|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to campus legend, its gargoyles represent the fourteen stages of botulism.

In order to fulfill its purpose of encouraging creativity, the residence offers a variety of outlets. All residents have access to [[Risley Theatre]] (the only fully student-operated theater at Cornell), [[music]] practice rooms, [[piano]]s, workshops for [[art]], digital [[music]], [[jewelry]], [[sewing]], [[letterpress]], [[video editing]], [[woodworking]], [[metalworking]], [[stained glass]], and [[pottery]], as well as a [[recording studio]], a [[darkroom]], and a small [[library]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Unlike other houses{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, the affairs of the building are managed by an elected student government, "Kommittee," which determines the budget, use of facilities, and allocation of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.risley.org/kommittee.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001224500/http://www.risley.org/kommittee.php |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Kommittee even allows students to paint the interior walls of the building, which has resulted in numerous [[murals]] on all the hallways painted by the residents{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. On many Fridays or Saturdays throughout the school year, the students run a [[coffee house]], "Tammany," where regional bands come to perform{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Students have created numerous special interest groups/clubs to meet their interests including a debate society ("The Society for Individualists"), Superhero Club (commonly referred to as Ris-S.H.I.E.L.D.), and a classic video gaming group ("[[Nintendo]] Church") among others. Risley has a semi-known secret society, commonly referred to as Fork &amp; Pancake, believed to be a band mischievous night owls who terrorize the kitchens of the building.

===Risley Theatre===
Risley Theatre is an 81-seat [[black box theater]] built by Risley Residents in a converted ballroom left over from Risley's days as a women's dorm{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}.  Until 1971, it was used to teach dance as a part of the Women's Physical Education program{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. The seating was added in 1972. It is the only fully student-operated theater on the [[Cornell University|Cornell]] campus.

Risley Theatre is run by the Risley Theatre Subcommittee ("T-Sub"), a subcommittee of the governing body of Risley Hall, Kommittee. T-Sub meets weekly in Risley's Central Living Room (CLR). T-Sub is responsible for producing regular seasons in the space, allocating theatre resources, funding student-run productions, and managing the theatre space. Any member of the [[Ithaca, NY|Ithaca]] community is eligible to participate in T-Sub.

Risley Theatre has two seasons, based around Cornell's major breaks. Each season is planned out near the end of the previous season during a competitive process called "Play Selection."  Any member of the Cornell and greater Ithaca community may submit proposals for productions during play selection to be included in the upcoming season.  The theatre hosts a wide variety of productions, which have included [[musical theatre]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] plays, student works, and comedy groups in the past. Performances are open to anyone, and tickets can be bought at the door.

==Traditions==
[[File:Risley Hogwarts.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Risley's great hall on [[Harry Potter]] Night]]
The hall hosts numerous annual events. For example, on the weekend before [[Halloween]], students host a large costumed dance party called MasqueRave. Since 1991, on the weekend following Halloween, an in-house group, the "Denton Drama Troupe," has hosted a live performance of the [[Rocky Horror Picture Show]] in the Great Hall. Because both of these events draw hundreds of people, they generate the revenue that supports smaller projects. Other notable events include themed dinners, such as [[Harry Potter]] Night, first organized in 2005 by Risley Resident, Charlene Morales, who was at the time a junior in Industrial and Labor Relations.  The event included a menu akin to several beloved dishes, snacks, and drinks such as "butter beer" unique to the Harry Potter film, drawing over 200+ guests.  All dishes were uniquely crafted by kitchen director, Lorna McNab.  The event was so beloved by all that it was then decreed a tradition.  Another notable tradition is the reading of [[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]].

In addition to annual events, there are also several weekly events (programs), most of which involve free food. Kommittee allocates money every semester to fund events like Eat This!, in which one or more Risleyites cook food for everyone else on Wednesdays at 10:30PM, RisBrunch (RizBrunch), in which one or more Risleyites cook food for everyone else on Saturdays at noon, and Lost Coffee, in which one Risleyite makes coffee and tea, which is placed somewhere in the building along with some cookies, on Monday nights and sends out clues as to where to find it.

Legend says that Prudence Risley, affectionately known as "Auntie Prue," haunts the building, flickering the lights whenever she appears. Some doubt the stories, though, and wonder if these "hauntings" might actually be the result of old wiring and the imaginations of overtired students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Big Red gives up the ghosts|journal=Cornell Alumni Magazine Online|date=September 2004|volume=107 (No 2)|issue=Cornelliana: Spirit of the Season|url=http://cornellalumnimagazine.com/Archive/2004sepoct/depts/Cornelliana.html|accessdate=13 June 2015|publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Robin Boyd Award for Residential Architecture''' is an [[Australia]]n architectural prize presented by the [[Australian Institute of Architects]] since 1981.

The award is presented in memory of the Australian architect [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] (1919 - 1971) and is awarded to houses that set new benchmarks in terms of meeting the client’s needs, responding to its site and providing shelter which is at the leading edge of house design. While the award recognises private residences, their outstanding design excellence has resulted in many of these homes being widely recognised as residential icons.

'''Seated Bodhisattva (left attendant of a triad)''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: ''{{lang|ko|목조보살좌상}}''; [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''{{lang|zh|木造菩薩坐像}}'') is a statue of a [[Bodhisattva]] belonging to mid-17th century, [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon dynastic]] period of [[Korean peninsula]]. The statue, made of gilt wood, was originally one of the two attendant [[Bodhisattva]] figures that flanked a central [[Shakyamuni]] or [[Amitabha]] Buddha statue. It is believed that this Bodhisattva was the left attendant Bodhisattva of the triad. The tall ornate crown, oblong face and drapery with cascading folds of the statue indicate that the statue was probably produced in a Buddhist sculpture school in [[Jeollanam-do|South Jeolla province]], [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/72485 |title=Seated bodhisattva (left attendant of a triad) |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |language=en |author= |accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statue was granted to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] by Mary and Jackson Berke Foundation in 2015.&lt;ref name=mary /&gt;

== Description==
This elaborate statue depicts an image of a [[Bodhisattva]]. [[Bodhisattva]]s are considered as compassionate, enlightened beings who are destined to be the protectors of their followers in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism. Also [[Bodhisattva]]s are the beings who are qualified to attain the enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=《菩薩與羅漢的故事（上集）》 |author=海濤法師 |isbn=957-29607-7-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Made of gilt wood, this statue was created in the mid-17th century AD, during [[Korean peninsula]]’s [[Joseon dynasty]] period. The features of the statue such as the tall ornate crown, oblong face and cascading folds of the drapery indicate that this statue was likely to produced by an esteemed school of Buddhist monk sculptors led by Ingyun (active during 1615–1663 AD) for a Buddhist temple in [[Jeollanam-do|South Jeolla province]], [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=met /&gt; This area was then an important centre of [[Korean Buddhism]]. A decorative element in the shape of flames can be seen in the crown. This statue measures 51.4&amp;nbsp;cm in height, 35.6&amp;nbsp;cm in width and 36.2 in depth. From base to the flame statue measures 54.6&amp;nbsp;cm in height.&lt;ref name=met /&gt; The statue, which was originally in the Mary Griggs Berke Collection, was later given to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]], [[United States]] by Mary and Jackson Berke Foundation in 2015.&lt;ref name=mary&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://burkecollection.org/catalogue/868-seated-bodhisattva-left-attendant-of-a-triad |title=Seated Bodhisattva (left attendant of a triad) |publisher=The Mary Griggs Burke Collection |author=Mary and Jackson Burke Foundation |accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statue has been exhibited four times in the Metropolitan Museum of Art before and after it was granted to the museum.&lt;ref name=met /&gt;

'''Shivta''' ({{lang-he|שבטה}}, {{lang-ar|شبطا}}) is an ancient city in the [[Negev Desert]] of [[Israel]] located 43 kilometers southwest of [[Beersheba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segal|first=Arthur|date=1985-01-01|title=Shivta-A Byzantine Town in the Negev Desert|jstor=990111|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=44|issue=4|pages=317–328|doi=10.2307/990111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shivta was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in June 2005.

==History==
Long considered a classic [[Nabataean]] town on the ancient spice route, archaeologists are now considering the possibility that Shivta was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] agricultural colony and a way station for [[pilgrims]] en route to the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]].

Roman ruins from the first century BCE have been unearthed in the southern part of the town, but most of the archaeological findings date to the Byzantine period. Shivta’s water supply was based on surface runoff collected in large reservoirs.&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;[http://www.parks.org.il/parks/ParksAndReserves/shivta/Pages/default.aspx Shivta National Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Street in Shivta ruins in the Negev.jpg|thumb|left|Shivta ruins]]

Three Byzantine churches (a main church and two smaller churches), 2 wine-presses, residential areas and administrative buildings have been excavated at Shivta. After the [[Muslim conquests|Arab conquest]] in the 7th century CE, the population dwindled. It was finally abandoned in the 8th or 9th Century CE.

In 1933-34, American archaeologist Harris D. Colt conducted a dig at Shivta. The house he lived in bears an inscription in ancient Greek that reads: “With good luck. Colt built (this house) with his own money."&lt;ref name="parks"/&gt;

The wine presses at Shivta give an insight into the scale of wine production at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-08-16|title=Deep in the desert|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-208557525.html|journal=|volume=|access-date=29 September 2016|website=highbeam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the calculations of archaeologists, the Nabatean/Byzantine village of Shivta  produced about two million liters of wine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-190054243.html No sour grapes, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjacent to the site is a large farm that uses Nabatean agricultural techniques of irrigation, sowing and reaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Travel/Around-Israel/A-hop-skip-and-a-jump-into-the-past|title=A hop, skip and a jump into the past|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Smile''''' (stylized as '''''SMiLE''''') is an [[unfinished creative work|unfinished album]] by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[the Beach Boys]] that was projected to follow their 11th studio album, ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966). After bandleader and principal songwriter [[Brian Wilson]] abandoned large portions of music recorded over a ten-month period with outside lyricist [[Van Dyke Parks]], the band substituted its release with ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' (1967), an album containing stripped-down remakes of some ''Smile'' material. Over the next four decades, few of the original ''Smile'' tracks were officially released, and the project came to be regarded as the most "legendary" unreleased album in the history of [[popular music]].{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=63}}

Wilson touted ''Smile'' as a "teenage [[symphony]] to God". It was to be a twelve-track [[concept album]] assembled from short, interchangeable musical fragments—the same novel production method used for the group's biggest-selling hit yet, "[[Good Vibrations]]". Its contents ranged from musical and [[spoken word]] to [[sound effect]]s and [[role playing]], featuring innovative sounds and vocal arrangements, references to early [[Americana]] and [[Romantic poetry]], [[comedy sketch]]es, [[found object (music)|found object]] explorations,  and influences drawn from [[classical music|classical]], [[folk music|folk]], [[doo-wop]], [[traditional pop|pre-rock and roll pop]], [[spirituality]], and the nascent [[psychedelic movement]]. The [[lead single]] would have been "[[Heroes and Villains]]", a [[Western (genre)|Western]] musical comedy, or "[[Vega-Tables]]", a satire of [[physical fitness]].

[[Collapse of Smile|Numerous issues prevented the album's completion and release]]. Most of the backing tracks were produced between August and December 1966, but few vocals were ever recorded, and the album's structure was never finalized. A deadline set for January 1967 was missed, and Parks soon distanced himself from the project. In June, the Beach Boys reconvened at [[Brian Wilson's home studio|Brian's makeshift home studio]] to record ''Smiley Smile''. Afterward, there were many attempts to finish the original ''Smile'' tracks, most of which were derailed by Wilson, who became [[psychological trauma|psychologically traumatized]] by the album's difficult sessions. In the 1980s, [[The Beach Boys bootleg recordings|bootlegged tracks]] began circulating widely among [[Record collecting|record collectors]] and other music circles. The potential of what ''Smile'' could have been inspired many musicians, particularly those in [[indie rock]], [[post-punk]], and [[chamber pop]] scenes, and in the absence of an official album, fans were moved to assemble their own various interpretations of ''Smile'' using bootlegs and tracks released to that point.

As a solo artist, Wilson reinterpreted the project for concert performances in 2004, and then followed up with the studio album ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]''. Although he had ostensibly completed the work, Wilson stated that his 2004 arrangement differed substantially from how he had conceptualized the LP in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; On October 31, 2011, ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' was released containing an approximation of what the Beach Boys' completed ''Smile'' might have sounded like based on the structure of ''Brian Wilson Presents Smile''. It received universal acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smile Sessions – The Beach Boys|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-smile-sessions|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the compilation was ranked number 381 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s list of "[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]".&lt;ref name="RS500list"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time  | title = The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time | publisher = Rolling Stone | date=November 18, 2003 | accessdate = June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it won the [[Best Historical Album]] award at the [[2013 Grammy Awards|55th Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref name="eonline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://au.eonline.com/news/386489/2013-grammy-awards-winners-the-complete-list|title=2013 Grammy Awards Winners: The Complete List|date=February 10, 2013|accessdate=April 12, 2013|author=Alyssa Toomey and Rosemary Brennan|work=[[E!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Van Dyke Parks 1967.png|thumb|right|[[Van Dyke Parks]] circa 1967. Besides providing the majority of ''Smile'''s lyrics and thematic direction,&lt;ref name="NYbooks" /&gt;&lt;ref name=paste2004/&gt; he also participated in sessions as an instrumentalist.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=129}}]]

The Beach Boys' album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', issued on May 16, 1966, was massively influential upon its release, containing lush and sophisticated orchestral arrangements that raised the band's prestige as rock innovators.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}} [[Brian Wilson]] had already begun planning a follow-up single, "[[Good Vibrations]]". During the recording sessions for ''Pet Sounds'', he started changing [[Musicianship of Brian Wilson#Process|his writing process]]. Rather than going to the studio with a completed song, he would record a track containing a series of chord changes he liked, take an [[acetate disc]] home, and then compose the song's melody and write its lyrics.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=42}} He explained, "I had a lot of unfinished ideas, fragments of music I called 'feels.' Each feel represented a mood or an emotion I'd felt, and I planned to fit them together like a mosaic."{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=42}} Throughout the mid 1960s, he was in the process of expanding his social circle to include a mix of worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers from the developing Los Angeles "hip" scene. He also took an increasing interest in recreational drugs (particularly [[marijuana (drug)|marijuana]], [[LSD]], and [[Desbutal]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanchez|2014|p=92|loc=wordly-minded mix}}; {{harvnb|Gaines|1986|pp=155, 163|loc=fascination with hip}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid 1965, multi-instrumentalist [[Van Dyke Parks]] was introduced to Wilson by mutual friends [[David Crosby]] and [[Terry Melcher]].{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p = 129}} About a year later, Wilson asked Parks to collaborate as lyricist for the Beach Boys' upcoming album project, then titled ''Dumb Angel'', to which Parks agreed.{{sfn|Henderson|2010|pp=38, 40–41}}

Wilson prepared for the writing and recording of ''Smile'' by purchasing about two thousand dollars' worth of [[marijuana]] and [[hashish]].&lt;ref name="Nolan1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nolan|first=Tom|title=The Beach Boys: A California Saga|journal=Rolling Stone|date=October 28, 1971|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-beach-boys-a-california-saga-19711028|issue=94|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he famously installed a [[hotboxing]] tent in his home and relocated a grand piano to a sandbox in his living room.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p = 130}}{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=36}} Between April and September 1966, Wilson and Parks spent many "all night sessions" co-writing a number of songs in the sandbox,&lt;ref name="Vosse1969"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Vosse|first=Michael|title=Our Exagmination Round His Factification For Incamination of Work in Progress: Michael Vosse Talks About ''Smile''|magazine=Fusion|date=April 14, 1969|volume=8|url=http://i351.photobucket.com/albums/q476/marcus1970/|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; including "[[Heroes and Villains]]", "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]", "[[Wonderful (The Beach Boys song)|Wonderful]]", "[[Cabin Essence]]" and "[[Wind Chimes (song)|Wind Chimes]]".{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=117}}{{refn|group=nb|Wilson removed the sandbox installation once he realized his pets were using it as a [[litter box]].&lt;ref name="BDW" /&gt;}} Throughout the summer of 1966, Wilson also concentrated on finishing  "Good Vibrations",{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=5}} ''Dumb Angel'' was renamed to ''Smile'' around October 1966.{{sfn|Matijas-Mecca|2017|p=50}} [[Carl Wilson]] said that this was because the group was focusing on spirituality and "the concept of spreading goodwill, good thoughts and happiness".&lt;ref name=Rave1967&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Mike|title='Our influences are of a religious nature': the Beach Boys on Smile|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/11/beach-boys-smile-brian-wilson|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian wrote that the stylized version of the title, ''SMiLE'', "was partly about forgetting the ego".{{sfn|Wilson|Greenman|2016}}

Brian envisioned ''Smile'' as an outlet for all of his intellectual occupations,{{sfn|Priore|1995|p=230}} such as his fascination with [[spirituality]] and its relationship to [[humor]] and [[laughter]].{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=36}} Music journalist [[Jules Siegel]] famously recalled that, during one evening in October, Wilson announced to his wife and friends that he was "writing a teenage symphony to God".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=101}} At the time, Wilson was reading works such as the ''[[I Ching]]'', [[Subud]] philosophy, tracts on astrology, detailed charts of the stars and planets, various topics of [[mysticism]], ''[[The Little Prince]]'', the novels of [[Hermann Hesse]], works by [[Kahlil Gibran]], [[Rod McKuen]], and [[Walter Benton (poet)|Walter Benton]]'s ''This is My Beloved''.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=247}}{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=19}} According to an unnamed participant, "If you came up to the house and introduced something new to Brian's thought processes—astrology, a different way to think about [[History of Sino-Russian relations|the relationship of Russia to China]], anything at all—if all of a sudden he was into that, it would find its way into the music. You could hear a bit and say, 'I know where that feeling came from.'"&lt;ref name="Nolan1971"/&gt;

==Associates and media hype==
Before ''Pet Sounds'' was released, the Beach Boys hired former [[Beatles]] press agent [[Derek Taylor]] as their publicist. Wilson requested that Taylor establish a new image for the group as fashionable counterculture icons, and so a promotional campaign with the tagline "[[Brian Wilson is a genius]]" was created and coordinated by Taylor.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=92–93}}{{refn|group=nb|Taylor is widely recognized as instrumental in the album's success with the British due to his longstanding connections with the Beatles and other industry figures in the UK.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=152}}}}  Meanwhile, Wilson became acquainted with former [[MGM Records]] agent [[David Anderle]] thanks to a mutual friend, singer [[Danny Hutton]] (later of [[Three Dog Night]]). Anderle, who was nicknamed "the mayor of hip", acted as a conduit between Wilson and the "hip".{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=155–156, 158}} Parks said that, eventually, "it wasn't just Brian and me in a room; it was Brian and me ... and all kinds of self-interested people pulling him in various various directions."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=117}} The album held a grandiose importance among those involved, as David Anderle said, "''Smile'' was going to be a monument. That's the way we talked about it, as a monument."{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p = 130}} 

Additional writers were brought in as witnesses to Wilson's [[CBS Columbia Square|Columbia]], [[Gold Star Studios|Gold Star]], and [[United Western Recorders|Western]] recording sessions, who also accompanied him outside the studio. Among the crowd: [[Richard Goldstein (writer born 1944)|Richard Goldstein]] from the ''[[Village Voice]]'', Jules Siegel from ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', and [[Paul Williams (music journalist)|Paul Williams]], the 18-year-old founder and editor of ''Crawdaddy!''{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=94}} As Wilson made more connections, his social circle "enlarged to encompass a whole new crowd," biographer [[Steven Gaines]] writes. "Some of these people were 'drainers,' [but others] were talented and industrious".{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=158}}  Other notable friends of Brian in this era included [[Michael Vosse]], Anderle's assistant, and Paul Jay Robbins, a journalist from the [[underground press]].{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=33}}

Released on October 10, 1966, "Good Vibrations" was the Beach Boys' third US number-one hit, reaching the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in December, and became their first number one in Britain.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=155–156}} That month, the record was their first single certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=86}} [[Dennis Wilson]] told a reporter that the new album "makes ''Pet Sounds'' stink—that's how good it is!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Altham|first=Keith|title=The Beach Boys: 'Don't you just love people?'—a classic interview from the vaults|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/03/beach-boys-1966-rocks-backpages|work=Rock's Backpages|publisher=The Guardian|location=London|date=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Priore|1988|p = 198}}  The Beach Boys were soon voted the number-one band in the world in an annual readers' poll conducted by ''NME'', ahead of the Beatles, [[the Walker Brothers]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[the Four Tops]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=86–87}} ''[[Hit Parader]]'' wrote: "The Beach Boys' album ''Smile'' and single "Heroes And Villains" will make them the greatest group in the world. We predict they'll take over where The Beatles left off."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=102}}

In November 1966, Brian was filmed performing a solo version of "Surf's Up" on grand piano for a CBS News special on popular music: ''[[Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution]]''. The special was not aired until April 1967.{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=37}} In the interim, Capitol sent promotional materials to record distributors and dealers, and ads were placed in ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 105}}  and teenage magazines{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=118}} including ''Teen Set''.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=96}} One ad compared the album to the films ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', both directed by [[Orson Welles]].{{sfn|Priore|1995}} Capitol circulated a promotional ad for employees at its label, using "Good Vibrations" as the backdrop against a voice-over reciting the album's promotional tagline: "With a happy album cover, the really happy sounds inside, and a happy in-store display piece, you can't miss! We're sure to sell a million units... in January!"{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=96}}

Several months after [[Collapse of Smile|the project's collapse]], a memoir written by Jules Siegel was published in an article for ''Cheetah'' magazine entitled "[[Goodbye Surfing, Hello God!]]" Many of the project's subsequent myths and legends derived from this single article.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=103–105}}{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=102}} Commenting on the reliability of figures such as Anderle, Siegel, and Vosse, journalist [[Nick Kent]] wrote that their claims are oftentimes "so lavish [that] one can be forgiven, if only momentarily, for believing that Brian Wilson had, at that time orbited out to the furthermost reaches of the celestial stratosphere for the duration of this starcrossed project."{{sfn|Priore|1995|p=264}} Gaines acknowledged that the "events surrounding the album differed so much according to each person's point of view, that no one can be certain."{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=162}}

==Production==
===Modular approach===

The ''Smile'' sessions were intentionally limited to recording short interchangeable fragments also referred to as "modules".&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt; With "Good Vibrations", Wilson further expanded his modular approach to recording, experimenting with compiling the finished track by editing together the numerous sections from multiple versions recorded at the lengthy tracking sessions.{{refn|Wilson honed his atypical production methods over several years. In the 1960s, it was common for pop music to be recorded in a single take, but the Beach Boys' approach differed.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=116}} Using multitrack technology, elements such as backing vocals and guitar solos were often recorded independently and would later be combined to the basic track. From 1964 onward Wilson also began to physically cut tape to craft his recordings, allowing hard-to-sing vocal sections to be recorded, cut and attached with sticky tape to the start or endings of songs. By the time of the ''[[Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)|Summer Days]]'' album in 1965, Wilson was becoming more adventurous in his use of tape splicing. An example is the ''a cappella'' track "And Your Dream Comes True", which was recorded in sections and then carefully edited together to create the final song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Matt|title=The Resurrection of Brian Wilson's Smile|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Oct04/articles/smile.htm|work=Sound on Sound|publisher=soundonsound.com|accessdate=July 16, 2013|date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group = nb}} Instead of taping each backing track as a more-or-less complete performance—as had been the model for previous Beach Boys recordings—he split the arrangement into sections, recording multiple takes of each section and developing and changing the arrangements and the production as the sessions proceeded. He sometimes recorded the same section at several different studios, to exploit the unique sonic characteristics or special effects available in each. Then, he selected the best performances of each section and edited these together to create a composite which combined the best features of production and performance. This meant that each section of the song was presented in its own distinct sonic envelope, rather than the homogeneous production sound of a conventional "one take" studio recording. The [[cut-up technique|cut-up]] structure and heavily edited production style of ''Smile'' was unique for its time in mainstream popular music,{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=117}}&lt;ref name="FreakyMike"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AZCentral /&gt; and to assemble an entire album from short musical fragments was a relatively bold undertaking.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=116}}

{{quote box

[[Carl Wilson]] likened the assembly process to [[film editing]], a view shared by ''Smile'' archivist [[Alan Boyd]] who stated: "I think he was right about that. The kind of editing that the project required seemed more like the process of putting a film together than a pop record."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolk|first1=Douglas|title=The Smile Sessions: The Story Behind the Box|url=http://www.wonderingsound.com/interview/the-smile-sessions-the-story-behind-the-box/|date=October 31, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105194949/http://www.wonderingsound.com/interview/the-smile-sessions-the-story-behind-the-box/|archivedate=January 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BrittPopMatters&gt;{{cite web|last1=Britt|first1=Thomas|title=The Beach Boys: The SMiLE Sessions|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/152324-the-beach-boys-the-smile-sessions/|publisher=''[[PopMatters]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|When compiling ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'', Boyd made use of film editing software [[Final Cut Pro]]. In a ''Mojo'' interview with Harvey Kubernik, Linett recounts that someone once said, "Brian was trying to do [[digital editing]] 20 or 30 years before it was invented."&lt;ref name=BrittPopMatters/&gt;}} This fragmentary approach can be related to "dangling clauses", a concept defined by [[David Bordwell]] thusly: "An unresolved action is presented near the end of one section that is picked up and pushed further in a later section. Every scene will tend to contain unresolved issues that demand settling further along."&lt;ref name=BrittPopMatters/&gt; This results in ambiguity for when and where most ''Smile'' songs begin and end, as many of them lack clearly defined song structures.&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt;

Marshall Heiser interpreted the album's style of jumpcuts a "striking characteristic", and that they "must be acknowledged as compositional statements in themselves, giving the music a sonic signature every bit as noticeable as the performances themselves. There was no way this music could be 'real.' Wilson was therefore echoing the techniques of ''[[musique concrète]]'' and seemed to be breaking the audio 'fourth wall'—if there can said to be such a thing."&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt; Parks said that the duo was conscious of ''musique concrete'', and that they "were trying to make something of it", naming Brian as a pioneer for its application in pop music.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=70}} Music journalist [[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] suggested that Brian Wilson may well have been one of the earliest pioneers of [[sampling (music)|sampling]].{{sfn|Williams|2010|p=86}} Author [[Domenic Priore]] argued that Brian "manipulated sound effects in a way that would later be extremely successful when [[Pink Floyd]] released ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' in 1973, the best-selling album of the entire [[progressive rock]] period".{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=79}} Other methods of tape manipulation used on ''Smile'' included [[varispeed]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=83}}

===Recording history===
{{Further|#Reconstructions}}
Fifty hours of tape was amassed from a ten-month-long course of album recording sessions.&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt; Music sessions occurred mainly at Hollywood recording studios [[United Western Recorders]], [[Gold Star Studios]], [[Sunset Sound Recorders]] and [[CBS Columbia Square]]. Oftentimes, [[Chuck Britz]] and [[Larry Levine]] assisted Brian with engineering, who produced every session, while most instrumentation was played by [[the Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]]. The vocal sessions for ''Smile'' were usually done at CBS Columbia, which had the only 8-track audio recorder available amongst the major recording studios at the time.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Work on what would have been the core album track "Good Vibrations" begun in February 1966 during the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' era. Three months later in May, an early tracking of "[[Heroes and Villains]]" was attempted. The ''Smile'' sessions officially began on August 3, 1966 with "[[Wind Chimes (song)|Wind Chimes]]", and from then on, Wilson led a long and complex series of sessions—approximately 50 overall, discounting the 17 sessions needed for "Good Vibrations"—that continued in earnest until April 14, 1967.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=188}} In December 1966, Brian informed Capitol that ''Smile'' would not be ready by January 1, but he advised that he would deliver it prior to January 15.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=167}} Once he missed that deadline, he continued work mostly on "Heroes and Villains" and "Vega-Tables" as potential singles.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=111}} After a final backing track session designated for "[[Love to Say Dada]]" on May 18, 1967, ''Smile'' was abandoned.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=188}}

''[[Smiley Smile]]'' sessions immediately followed at [[Brian Wilson's home studio]] on June 3. In November 1968 and June–July 1971, the tracks "[[Cabinessence]]", "[[Our Prayer]]", and "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]" would be treated with [[overdub]]s and completed by [[Carl Wilson|Carl]] and [[Dennis Wilson]] for other Beach Boys albums.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=188}}

In 1966 after being asked by a journalist how he would label his new music, Wilson responded, "I'd call it contemporary American music, not rock 'n' roll. Rock 'n' roll is such a worn out phrase.

"[[Heroes and Villains]]" was the ultimate keystone for the musical structure of the album, and the considerable time and effort that Wilson devoted to it is indicative of its importance, both as a single and as part of the ''Smile'' narrative. Like "Good Vibrations", it was edited together from many discrete sections. Additionally, most individual tracks on ''Smile'' were composed as potential sections of "Heroes and Villains".{{refn|This includes "[[Do You Like Worms?]]", "[[I'm in Great Shape]]", "[[Vega-Tables]]", "[[Love to Say Dada]]", "[[He Gives Speeches]]", "[[Cabin Essence]]", and "[[My Only Sunshine]]". The complexity of Wilson's production at this time can be gauged by the sheer bulk of session material that has survived—more than 60 tracks in the five-CD ''The Smile Sessions'' boxed set are session recordings for "Heroes and Villains".&lt;ref name="Smile Sessions" /&gt;{{better source|date=August 2015}}|group = nb}} Nearly thirty sessions for the various versions of "Heroes and Villains" spanned from May 1966 to July 1967.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=113}} There are dozens of takes spanning each section of the song, multiple versions of both the variant sections, and many attempts to splice together final mixes. One of the other centerpieces of ''Smile'' was to be "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]", which had been for many years perceived as the intended ending climax of ''Smile'', preceding a section described as a "[[amen|choral amen]] sort of thing."&lt;ref name="Vosse1969"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Domenic Priore reported in 2011: "I don’t always subscribe to things Brian Wilson may say now because, a lot of the time, I think Brian is kind of reading ad copy, in a way, when you talk to him.

All of the other tracks were either not recorded or only exist in part-completed form, and many ''Smile''-era recordings lack their full vocal arrangements, lyrics and melodies.

In 1988, Wilson also mentioned to [[Andy Paley]] that the musical reference of Johnny Mercer's song 'I Wanna Be Around' was specifically used to invoke the lyrical phrase 'I wanna be around to pick up the pieces of our broken love affair' – that is to say, picking up the pieces after the fire. In two places, and in two different eras, Brian had laid down clues to collaborators that the 'I Wanna Be Around'/’Workshop' combination was a cool-out and reconstruction after '[[Mrs. O'Leary's Cow (instrumental)|Mrs O'Leary's Cow]]'."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=83}}}}

{{quote|It was just more textural, more complex and it had a lot more vocal movement. "Good Vibrations" is a good example of that.

Each movement had its own texture and required its own session. ... "Cabin Essence" was a tough one. Just the alacrity of the parts and the movements. There was wind driven part in the parts around "''who ran the iron horse''" – a lot of challenging vocal exercises and movements in that one. But we enjoyed those challenges. There was almost like a competition among us between who could do their part better than the other guy – but a healthy one. ... there was one part that I'd forgotten about where we sang this dissonant chord – this strange chord, which sounded like the [[train whistle|whistle of a train]].

The concept of ''Smile'' did not lend itself to any formal narrative development, only to themes and experiences; though ''Smile'' references some specifically, it is only in passing.&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt; Most of the album's thematic direction was given to Parks with hardly any instruction from Wilson. Together, the two desired a back-to-basics approach to songwriting, as Wilson summarized, "We wanted to capture something as basic as the mood of water and fire."&lt;ref name=paste2004/&gt;

It is generally acknowledged that Wilson and Parks intended ''Smile'' to be explicitly American in style and subject, a conscious reaction to the overwhelming [[British invasion|British dominance]] of popular music at the time.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=117}} It was conceived as a musical journey across America from east to west, beginning at [[Plymouth Rock]] and ending in Hawaii, traversing some of the great themes of modern American history and culture including the impact of white settlement on Native Americans, the influence of the Spanish, the [[Wild West]] and the opening up of the country by railroad and highway.&lt;ref name=paste2004/&gt;{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=66}}{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=117}} Some historical events touched upon range from [[Manifest destiny]], [[American imperialism]], [[Territorial evolution of the United States|westward expansion]], the [[Great Chicago Fire]], and the [[Industrial Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|right|thumb|''Smile'' was partly intended to combat the [[British Invasion]] sparked by [[the Beatles]] in 1964]]

In reference to how [[George Gershwin]] "Americanized" jazz and classical music, Wilson in his own words intended to "'Americanize' early America and mid-America".&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; Parks said that the duo "kind of wanted to investigate … American images. … Everyone was hung up and obsessed with everything totally British.

Aside from focusing on American cultural heritage, ''Smile'''s themes include scattered references to [[childhood]], [[physical fitness]], [[poetry]], and [[God]].&lt;ref name=ZahlThatTime2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zahl|first1=David|title=That Time The Beach Boys Made a Teenage Symphony to God|url=http://www.mbird.com/2011/11/the-beach-boys-smile-a-teenage-symphony-to-god/|publisher=Mockingbird|date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many traits in ''Smile'' lyrics are reminiscent of [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] period imagery{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=143}} and the [[Romantic poetry]] movement that began in the mid-to-late 18th century, with the biggest focus being on the ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'' collection of poems written by English poet [[William Blake]]. Thematic links to ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience'' by concept of childhood and spirituality carry throughout other songs and tracks. However, the piece "[[My Heart Leaps Up]]" by [[William Wordsworth]] originated the idiom "''[[Child Is Father of the Man]]''" later recycled by Wilson and Parks.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Other general ''Smile'' themes have been recited by ''Smile'' visual artist [[Frank J. Holmes|Frank Holmes]] to have included "travel, [[nature]], history, communications, [[Romance (love)#In literature|love stories]], [[virtue]], [[betrayal]], bucolic splendor, [[astrology]], [and] [[mystery fiction|mystery]]".&lt;ref name="Smile Sessions" /&gt;{{better source|date=August 2015}}

''Smile'' drew heavily on American popular music of the past; Wilson's original compositions were interwoven with snippets of significant songs of yesteryear including "[[The Old Master Painter]]", the perennial "[[You Are My Sunshine]]" ([[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] of [[Louisiana]]), [[Johnny Mercer]]'s [[jazz]] standard "[[I Wanna Be Around]]" (recorded by [[Tony Bennett]]), "[[Gee (The Crows song)|Gee]]" by the 1950s [[doo-wop]] group [[the Crows]] and quotations from other 20th century pop culture reference points such as the [[Woody Woodpecker]] theme and "[[Twelfth Street Rag]]". These references tended to thematically blur with the other ''Smile'' elements, and there was no definite line drawn between the established Americana and spirituality themes.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Perhaps the least obvious example of this blur would be "The Old Master Painter"—the "master painter" described in the song's lyrics refers to God.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=68}} This is continued in the lyrics to the Wilson/Parks original "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]", which imagines [[religious experience]], "canvassing the town", and "[[Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford|brushing the backdrop]]". Various 18th–20th century works such as "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]", "[[This Land Is Your Land]]", "[[See See Rider]]", "[[Frère Jacques]]", "[[Auld Lang Syne]]", "[[My Prayer]]", "[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]", and ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' are also alluded to in song lyrics or titles.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Arthur Koestler]]'s book, ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', had a profound effect on Wilson that carried deeply into the ''Smile'' project, specifically the human logistics of [[laughter]]. Wilson pointed to the book's three-category division of the human mind: Humor, Discovery, and Art;&lt;ref name="IJWMFTT" /&gt; he has admitted that he was most influenced by Koestler's first rule of [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]], Humor, as he explained in 2005: "''The Act of Creation'' by Arthur Koestler turned me on to some very special things…it explains that people attach their egos to their sense of humor before anything else.

==="The Elements"===
[[File:Chicago-fire1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Artist's rendering of the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, an event which "[[The Elements: Fire|Fire]]" was based on]]

"The Elements" was a reputed four-part movement which encompassed the four [[classical element]]s: [[Air (classical element)|Air]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], and [[Water (classical element)|Water]].{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=163}}{{refn|"[[The Elements: Fire|Fire]]" (also known as "[[The Elements: Fire|Mrs. O'Leary's Cow]]") is the only surviving recording that is certain to have been part of any identifiable movement on the original ''Smile'' album, while "[[Vega-Tables]]' was considered to fulfill the "Earth" portion of the movement. For ''Brian Wilson Presents Smile'', the other missing components were filled in "[[Wind Chimes (song)|Wind Chimes]]" (Air) and "[[Love to Say Dada]]", which lost its birth/rebirth origins and was instead repurposed as "[[In Blue Hawaii]]" (Water).{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=163}}|group = nb}} According to Domenic Priore, conversations between him and Van Dyke Parks have told that "The Elements" were meant to invoke the increasing attention to health, fitness, and environmentalism by [[anti-war]] [[peace movement]]s.&lt;ref name="Domenic2002" /&gt; Alternatively, [[Darian Sahanaja]]—a close associate of Wilson and Parks—has said: "Brian never ever referred to any of the pieces as being part of some Elemental concept, and whenever I did bring up the concept he didn’t seem to react to it with any enthusiasm. I brought it up again while Van Dyke was around and didn’t get a clear reaction from him either. My gut feeling is that it was one of many subplots and underlying themes being tossed around back in the day.

{{quote|[H]e was really into the elements. He ran up to [[Big Sur]] for a week, just 'cause he wanted to get into that, up to the mountains, into the snow, down to the beach, out to the pool, out at night, running around, to water fountains, to a lot of water, the sky, the whole thing was this fantastic amount of awareness of his surroundings. So the obvious thing was to do something that would cover the physical surroundings. … We were aware, he made us aware, of what fire was going to be, and what water was going to be; we had some idea of air.

During the latter half of the 1960s, Wilson began an obsession with fitness that led him to move the furniture out of his living room in order to make room for tumbling mats and exercise bars; later briefly serving as the co-owner of his own [[health food store]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=270, 430}} Wilson reported in 1967, "I want to turn people on to vegetables, good natural food, organic food. Health is an important element in spiritual enlightenment. But I do not want to be pompous about it, so we will engage in a satirical approach."{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=160}} Derek Taylor remembers: "He'd be sitting with me in this restaurant going on and on about this supposedly strict vegetarian diet of his, preaching vegetarianism at me while at the very same moment he'd be whacking down some massive hamburger."{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=31}}

==Artwork and packaging==
[[File:SMiLE The Beach Boys (logo).jpg|thumb|The ''Smile'' logo that was pictured on the original cover art]]

Capitol began production on a lavish gatefold cover with a twelve-page booklet in December 1966. Considered by some to be one of the most legendary album covers in rock,{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=101}} its artwork was commissioned from [[Frank J. Holmes|Frank Holmes]], a friend of Van Dyke Parks.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 100}} Holmes based the cover art on an abandoned jewelry store he'd seen near his home in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], added onto several visual interpretations of the album's lyrics that were illustrated by Holmes for the bonus ''Smile'' booklet scheduled for its packaging.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 100}} According to Michael Vosse, the "Smile shop" portrayed on the cover came from Brian's desire for a humor album, "and everybody who knew anything about graphics, and about art, thought that the cover was not terribly well done... but Brian knew better; he was right. It was exactly what he wanted, precisely what he wanted."&lt;ref name="Vosse1969"/&gt;{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=36}} The cover image would have been one of the earliest instances of a popular music group featuring original commissioned artwork.&lt;ref name=Oteri2011/&gt;

Holmes met with Wilson and Parks in June 1966, and suggested to Capitol Records executives that the album be packaged with a booklet of his illustrations. Holmes explains his role in the project: "So I came up with that store-front idea ... I thought that was a good image because of the way, any time you go into a store, you’re entering something, and the door opens and you go in, but its designed; it’s like a funnel. So I thought, 'Well, this would be a good graphic image on the front cover'—something that would pull you in. I knew that sales were important in selling music. This was something that would be pulling you into the world of ''Smile''—the Smile Shoppe—and it had these little smiles all around. There’s two people in there, too, a husband and wife—a kind of early-Americana, old-style, 19th-century kind of image."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=102}} By October, Holmes had completed his contributions.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=102}}

Parks considered work by Holmes to be the "third equation" of ''Smile'', and that they would have not continued on the project the way they did without thinking of it in cartoon terms: "To me, it was a musical cartoon, and Frank showed that, without being told anything. There is ''some'' reference: Frank was supposed to do something 'light-hearted', but there were no specific instructions and he came up with the perfect video vessel for realizing what we were doing, something I thought was an integral part of the situation. I think that still stands; I think of ''Smile'' in visual terms."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=100}} Capitol later added the repeated written instances of "Good Vibrations" on the album cover, which were not featured on the original design by Holmes.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=167}} Color photographs of the group were also taken by [[Guy Webster]]. 466,000 covers and 419,000 booklets were printed by early January 1967; with the aforementioned track list displayed on the back cover, along with a photographed depiction of the group minus Brian surrounded by astrological symbols.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=100}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=173}}

===''Smiley Smile''===
{{Main|Smiley Smile}}

After ''Smile'' was cancelled, the Beach Boys still needed to complete an LP record to fulfill their obligations to Capitol Records, so an album replacement was recorded throughout June and July 1967. As Wilson retreated to [[Brian Wilson's home studio|his recently acquired Bel Air mansion]], it became the venue for the recording of much of the Beach Boys' next album, ''[[Smiley Smile]]''.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p = 132}} Released that September, the album included newly stripped-down recordings of several ''Smile'' tracks. It was received with confusion by critics and was the group's lowest-selling album to date in the US, making only number 41 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], although it fared considerably better in Britain, where it reached number nine on the album chart.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=119}} The album was later described by Carl Wilson as "a [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]] instead of a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]]".&lt;ref name="SmileySmileliner"&gt;{{cite AV media notes| title = Smiley Smile/Wild Honey | others= [[The Beach Boys]]| year = 1990| first = David| last = Leaf|authorlink=David Leaf|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|type=CD Liner|url=http://www.albumlinernotes.com/Smiley_Smile_Wild_Honey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-June 1967, before the release of ''Smiley Smile'', Capitol A&amp;R director Karl Engemann began circulating a memo which discussed conversations between him and Wilson of a 10-track ''Smile'' album. It would have followed up the release of ''Smiley Smile'', and would not have included the selections "Heroes and Villains" nor "Vegetables".{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=195}}{{sfn|Priore|1988|p=160}} During promotion for the June 24 release of the "Heroes and Villains" single, Bruce Johnston told ''NME'' that the ''Smile'' album was expected for release within two months.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=131}} By July, the group's dispute with Capitol was resolved; it was then agreed that ''Smile'' would not be the band's next album.{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=134}} Carl would soon frequently revisit the session tapes, taking into mind the possibility of salvaging them for future release.&lt;ref name="Domenic2002" /&gt; This amounted to a portion of "Workshop" being recycled for the closing of the 1969 single "[[Do It Again (The Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]", in addition to him and Dennis completing the tracks "Our Prayer" and "Cabin Essence" for the Beach Boys' album ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{refn|group=nb|Elsewhere a portion of "[[Vega-Tables]]" was rerecorded for ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'' as "Mama Says", while a section written for "[[Child Is Father of the Man]]" appears in "[[Little Bird (The Beach Boys song)|Little Bird]]" for ''[[Friends (The Beach Boys album)|Friends]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}}}

Since portions of the instrumental track were missing a lead vocal, one was overdubbed by Carl.

A contract signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1970 following the group's departure from Capitol included a clause that stipulated a finished ''Smile'' to be delivered by May 1, 1973. Later in 1970, Brian spoke in a radio interview with Jack Rieley—who was then a DJ that Brian had recently met at his health food store called [[The Radiant Radish]]—about the track "Surf's Up", saying "It's just that it's too long. Instead of putting it on a record, I would rather just leave it as a song. It rambles. It's too long to make it for me as a record, unless it were an album cut, which I guess it would have to be anyway. It's so far from a singles sound. It could never be a single."{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=273}} Rieley then became the group's manager and adviser. With permission from Brian, between mid-June and early July 1971, Rieley and Carl retrieved most of the original ''Smile'' multi-tracks for careful examination. The primary reason for this trawl was to locate the masters for "Surf's Up", which was decided for inclusion on the Beach Boys forthcoming [[Surf's Up (album)|album of the same name]]. As progress continued, Brian gradually withdrew from the song's assembly, presumably due to the negative memories associated with the ''Smile'' sessions. Yet, the ''Surf's Up'' album was completed and released in August 1971 with its title track serving as the album's closer.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=293}} Besides its title track, ''Surf's Up'' bears no connection to ''Smile'' neither thematically nor musically, and no other tapes from the latter's sessions were used. Sometime after, Brian and [[American Spring]] contributed guest vocals for a cover of "Vegetables" by [[Jan and Dean]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=120}}

Early in 1972, the Beach Boys announced that they would be finishing ''Smile'' to follow up on the critical and commercial success of ''Surf's Up''. By the end of the year, the idea was either abandoned or forgotten, with Brian refusing to participate in any further ''Smile''-related reworkings, leading the group to pay a $50,000 fine.&lt;ref name="LostPopSymphony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Domenic2002"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alpert|first=Neal|title=That Music Was Actually Created|url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/05-06-02/ftr-smile.html|work=Gadfly|publisher=Gadfly Online|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|When asked about ''Smile'' in a 1973 interview at his home, Brian told ''Melody Maker'' that there wasn't enough material to put together the album, and that it would never be released.

He expounded that its release could only satisfy a highly-[[niche market|niche audience]], deeming the material too inaccessible for mainstream record-buyers, and explained, "Sometimes, you're kind of let down. Say you discover the tapes and you say, 'Oh yeah?' It's been talked about so much…It would live up to your expectations [only] if you were [[Zubin Mehta]] analyzing a young composer's work."{{sfn|Leaf|1978}}

In 1981, Johnston announced that there were plans to issue a brief six-minute compilation of the album's recording sessions without Brian's knowledge. He reasoned, "It's better to do it that way, because musically now, as opposed to '66 or '78, it would be more interesting to just give you a peek at it than to do the whole thing.

By the beginning of the 1990s, ''Smile'' gained status as the most famous unreleased pop album, and was a focal point for [[bootleg recording]] makers and collectors.&lt;ref name="P4k"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Mark|title=The Smile Sessions review|journal=Pitchfork|date=November 2, 2011|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16000-the-smile-sessions/|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s, cassette bootlegs of the album's sessions were being passed around various musician circles.&lt;ref name="Aquarium" /&gt;&lt;ref name="justwasntmadeliner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Was|first=Don|title=1995 liner notes|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/I_Just_Wasnt_Made_For...html|work=I Just Wasnt Made For These Times album}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recordings made it clear that ''Smile'' had been much closer to completion than had previously been thought,{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=118}} and this prompted much excitement by fans over what additional songs might exist, and debate about how the songs fit into the ''Smile'' running order.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Unofficial reconstructions of the album were often attempted by fans in order to give the recordings a cohesive listening structure, thus "completing" the album.&lt;ref name="p4k2004"&gt;{{cite web|last=Leone|first=Dominique|title=Brian Wilson: Smile|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8781-smile/|work=Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork|accessdate=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, fan-created playlists were the only way for the public to listen to an approximation of ''Smile'' as it would have been heard performed by the Beach Boys.&lt;ref name=paste2004/&gt;{{refn|One of the most popular of which, ''Purple Chick presents: The Beach Boys Smile'', was an online [[mix tape]] assembled shortly after Wilson began performing the ''Smile'' material in 2004.

With the emerging popularity of the Internet in the mid-1990s, the bootlegged ''Smile'' recordings became more widely available through a series of websites and "tape trees". A few websites offered full downloads of the tracks, and fan edits and arrangements started to appear. Beginning in 1997, the bootleg label [[The Beach Boys bootleg recordings#Sea of Tunes|Sea of Tunes]] (named after [[Sea of Tunes|the Beach Boys' original publishing company]]) began releasing a series of CDs featuring high quality outtakes, session tracks and alternate recordings that ranged across the group's entire career. Among these was a three-CD set featuring over three hours of sessions for "Good Vibrations", and several multi-CD sets containing a significant number of the tracking, overdubbing and mixing sessions for ''Smile''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beachboys.com/raritiesII.html BeachBoys.com (unofficial website) – Rarities: Sea of Tunes III]&lt;/ref&gt; Those involved with releasing these bootlegs were later apprehended by authorities, and it was reported that nearly 10,000 discs were seized.&lt;ref name="Forever Frown"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilonsky|first=Robert|title=The Forever Frown|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/music/the-forever-frown/|work=Phoenix New Times Music|publisher=phoenixnewtimes.com|accessdate=July 29, 2013|date=December 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its chosen focus being "new American music that is outside the commercial mainstream", online publication ''[[NewMusicBox]]'' made an exception with ''Smile'', citing its standing as "an album recorded more than 45 years ago by one of the biggest (and most financially lucrative) musical acts of all time".&lt;ref name=Oteri2011/&gt; The site's reviewer, Frank Oteri, wrote: "Wilson’s experiments in 1966 and 1967 seem normative of the kinds of things most interesting musicians in any genre were up to at that point and even tamer than some of them. The blurring of boundaries between musical genres was pretty much commonplace at that time, as was the attitude, however real or imagined, that just about any musical undertaking was somehow an expansion beyond anything that had come before it." According to Oteri, "the same pride of place in American music history held by other great innovators" such as [[Charles Ives]], [[George Gershwin]], [[John Cage]], [[John Coltrane]], and [[James Brown]] would "probably" never include ''Smile'', since, "For many people, the Beach Boys will always be perceived as a light-hearted party band that drooled over '[[California Girls]]' while on a '[[Surfin' Safari|Surfing Safari]]'."&lt;ref name=Oteri2011/&gt;

Reviewing the available bootlegs and officially released tracks for [[AllMusic]], [[Richie Unterberger]] acknowledged that "numerous exquisitely beautiful passages, great ensemble singing, and brilliant orchestral pop instrumentation" were in circulation, yet "the fact is that Wilson somehow lacked the discipline needed to combine them into a pop masterpiece that was both brilliant and commercial."&lt;ref name="Smile AllMusic" /&gt; Writing in ''[[The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'', [[Dave Marsh]] bemoaned the hype that continued to surround Wilson and the ''Smile'' project throughout the 1970s, saying: "''Smile'' would have been a great album, we were assured each time the Beach Boys released a mediocre one. This myth remains forceful even though the title track of ''Surf's Up'' … was far less forceful and arguably less innovative than Wilson's surf-era hits." Marsh concluded: "The ''Smile'' legend is an exercise in myth-mongering almost unparalleled in show business: Brian Wilson became a Major Artist by making music that no one outside of his own coterie ever heard."{{sfn|Marsh|Swenson|1983|p=31}}

Toop argues that attempts to complete ''Smile'' are "misguided", naming ''Smile'' a "labyrinth" which exists "in a memory house into which Wilson invited all those who could externalize its elements" notwithstanding the user's familiarity with the album's fragments. He then proposes the inquiry: "Can a song say it all, depth breadth and flow, break its banks in flood yet still be a song?"&lt;ref name="Toop2011"/&gt; ''Freaky Trigger'' shared the same view, writing: "There is no ‘correct’ track sequence, there is no completed album, because ''Smile'' isn’t a linear progression of tracks. As a collection of modular melodic ideas it is by nature organic and resists being bookended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Fred|title=SMiLE!|journal=Freaky Trigger|date=June 6, 1999|url=http://freakytrigger.co.uk/ft/1999/06/smile/|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Anderle believed "there never was a ''Smile''" while Marshall Heiser says "Possibly the best term offered yet to describe the project is: 'sonic menagerie'".&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt;

Among musicians, [[Elvis Costello]] describes a ''Smile'' piano demo of "Surf's Up" as akin to an original recording of [[Mozart]] in performance, and added "It's such an amazing tune. The words are very much of the time, they sound beautiful when they're sung—and quite of lot of that is true with the rest of the songs that come from this period, where obviously there was a stress and strain in realizing the music."&lt;ref name="Endless Harmony" /&gt; [[Matthew Sweet]] felt: "Van Dyke's lyrics are so cool and Brian did right by them. He and Brian are trying to capture an impressionistic thing. That time is so experimental, and looking at it now, it's easy to see why it could be overlooked — because people just don't instantly understand really abstract stuff. It takes time to have a conversation about it before we realize what an amazing thing they did."{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=150}} Referring to a ''Smile'' track where "a whole bunch of tubas [are] having a conversation with trumpets," [[Questlove]] of [[neo soul]] band [[the Roots]] said "[Brian Wilson]'s a modern-day Stravinsky … The way he constructs his music, he's a madman. … He was doing stuff [40 years ago] that modern people do now, looping his work and stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=Corey|title=Chili Peppers, Backstreet Salute Beach Boys' Brian Wilson|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1496895/chili-peppers-backstreet-salute-beach-boys-brian-wilson/|publisher=MTV|accessdate=July 24, 2014|date=February 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Torff, referring to ''Smile''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s advanced structures, noted: "Here was a guy who could craft something that was almost symphonic. … Not many people had that craft in pop music at that time. … [He was] really expanding the boundaries of what rock and pop music could be."&lt;ref name="CNN2012" /&gt;  {{clear left}} &lt;!----

Authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz write that it is "likely" that the release of ''Smile'' would have reformed the public perception of the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=119}} Mark Richardson of [[Pitchfork Media]] has described the album as a "rite of passage for students of pop music history", and adds: "If you're wired a certain way, once you learn the ''Smile'' story, you long to hear the album that never was. It looms out there in imagination, an album that lends itself to storytelling and legend, like the aural equivalent of the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. … So you might start hunting down bootlegs, poring over the fragments, and finding competing edits and track sequences, which only feeds your desire to know what the 'real' ''Smile'' could have been."&lt;ref name="P4k" /&gt; Writing for the same website, Spencer Owen says that the album could have dramatically altered the course of popular music history, such that "Perhaps we wouldn't be so monotheistic in our pop leanings, worshiping only at the Beatles' altar the way some do today."&lt;ref name="P4kSmileySmile"&gt;{{cite web|last=Owen|first=Spencer|title=Smiley Smile/Wild Honey review|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11667-smiley-smilewild-honey/|work=Pitchfork|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=March 29, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former ''[[Record Collector]]'' editor [[Peter Doggett]] states that ''Smile'' would most likely have had the same reception as that afforded Parks' ''Song Cycle'' – namely, critical acclaim but a commercial disaster.{{sfn|Doggett|2015|p=373}}

In a special ''Smile'' edition of the ''33 1/3'' book series, Luis Sanchez writes:

{{quote|If the counterculture had suddenly made it possible for a generation of Americans to define themselves against their cultural inheritance, Brian and Parks weren't convinced. Their work spoke of an urge to explore their native culture not as outsiders, but to identify with it emphatically and see where it led them. If Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys were going to survive as the defining force of American pop music they were, ''Smile'' was a conscious attempt to rediscover the impulses and ideas that power American consciousness from the inside out. It was a collaboration that led to some incredible music, which, if it had been completed as an album and delivered to the public in 1966, might have had an incredible impact.

Considering the material that does survive, on its own terms, we can try to understand why ''Smile'' remains vital, and why it still matters as music. ... The music appeals not through any kind of detached countercultural outlook, but by taking the best aspects of The Beach Boys' music–scope of studio production, vocal harmonies, a sense of possibility–and shifting in a way that makes them sound total, ''consummate'', as if this music is the music Brian was ''meant'' to make. There is nothing phony or fawning about any of it.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=112, 114}}}}

Geoffrey Himes of ''[[Paste Magazine]]'' suggested that ''Smile'' would have had a greater impact than the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper'', since: "There have been countless rock opera, [[art rock]] and [[prog rock]] projects, but most have merely dressed up mediocre rock 'n’ roll in the gowns of grandiosity. But Wilson used the moving parts and shifting textures of art music not to show off but to reflect adulthood's mixed emotions. He used the through-line of classical composition not to replace pop's intimacy but to reinforce it, linking one personal moment to the next."&lt;ref name=paste2004/&gt; David Howard, writing in his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', says that "Had Wilson been able to connect all the dots, ''Smile'' would most certainly be regarded as one of pop's major artistic statements, rather than an infamous, unfortunate footnote.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=77}} Arizona publication ''AZ Central'' wrote in 2011: "If ''Smile'' had arrived in 1967, it would have placed the Beach Boys on the front lines of pop's psychedelic revolution, out there with the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'', Pink Floyd's ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'', [[The Doors (album)|the Doors' first album]] and [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]]'s ''[[Are You Experienced?]]'' It doesn't sound like any of those albums, but it clearly shares their spirit of adventure in a way that would have been unthinkable just two years earlier."&lt;ref name=AZCentral /&gt;

In 1999, ''Freaky Trigger'' wrote that the album was not "the best album ever," but that it is "astoundingly original" for being antithetical to contemporary rock music, and that the nature of its "twilight existence challenges the legitimacy of that legend of rock which puts ''Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' at its summit." It concludes that:

{{quote|''Smile'' is so attractive is because it's the tangible evidence of an alternative rock history which turned out differently ... None of which would matter a damn if the record was boring. It isn't ... The very idea of basing an album around laughter and good health seems cracked, naive and baffling, but that's what ''Smile'' allegedly is: a humour record. And given that every year the angst, contrariness and cynicism of rock’n’roll culture gets more tedious, more oppressive, maybe even more dangerous, the more people exposed to Wilson’s damaged but beautiful humanism the better.&lt;ref name="FreakyTrigger1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ewing|first1=Tom|title=Dumb Angles: The Myth and Promise Of Smile|journal=Freaky Trigger|date=June 5, 1999|url=http://freakytrigger.co.uk/ft/1999/06/dumb-angles-the-myth-and-promise-of-smile/|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====The Beach Boys' views====
[[File:The Beach Boys Smile (7300302550).jpg|thumb|right|The reunited Beach Boys in 2012, performing "[[Heroes and Villains]]" during [[the 50th Reunion Tour|their 50th anniversary tour]]]]

For many years after its shelving, Brian Wilson was terrified of ''Smile'', repeatedly denouncing the album while associating its music with all of his failures.&lt;ref name=paste2004 /&gt; At various points, he considered the recordings "contrived with no soul",{{sfn|Toop|1999|p=136}} being imitations of Phil Spector without "getting anywhere near him",{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=43}} and "corny drug influenced music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kamer|first1=Gijsbert|title=Altijd bang|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2676/Cultuur/article/detail/723272/2004/07/09/Altijd-bang.dhtml|language=Dutch|date=July 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in a 1987 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview whether ''Smile'' would have topped the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper'', Wilson replied: "No. It wouldn't have come close. ''Sgt. Pepper'' would have ''kicked our ass''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Steve|last=Pond|title=Brian Wilson|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=November 5 – December 10, 1987|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, he gradually became more comfortable discussing the work, calling it "too advanced" to have been released in 1967. Biographer [[Peter Ames Carlin]] disputes this, saying that Wilson invented this story as a generic line to feed journalists in 2004, and that "[being] ahead of his time is exactly what they were looking for."&lt;ref name=AZCentral /&gt; In 1993, Mike Love believed that ''Smile'' "would have been a great record," but in its unfinished state is "nothing, it's just fragments."&lt;ref name=mojo1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holdship|first=Bill|journal=MOJO magazine|date=August 1993|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Jardine felt "There's performances we probably should have finished. I can't tell you exactly what they are, but that's the way I feel."&lt;ref name=Sharp2013 /&gt; In the early 1990s, Carl said that he loved the ''Smile'' lyrics.&lt;ref name="IJWMFTT"/&gt;

Love has asserted that whatever misgivings he had toward ''Smile'' laid specifically toward some of the lyrics and not the music.&lt;ref name="CBS2012"&gt;''CBS Sunday Morning'', 2012 {{YouTube|id=S0aV3ku-ha8|title=CBS Sunday Morning – The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MOJO2011"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Beach Boys ''Smile''|journal=Mojo Magazine|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His statements were corroborated by Carl in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="IJWMFTT"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[Don Was|Was, Don]] (Director)|year=1995|title=Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made for These Times|medium=[[Documentary film]]|url=|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Al Jardine spoke regarding Love: "He's a big [[Chuck Berry]] fan and he loves those kind of lyrics. … Mike was always trying to pinpoint Van Dyke saying, 'What does that mean?' And he would go, 'I don't know, I was high' (''laughs''). Mike would go, 'That's disgusting, that doesn't make any sense.'"&lt;ref name=Popmatters /&gt;

| quote = The potential of what ''Smile'' would have been was the primary thing that inspired us ([[Elephant 6]]). When we started hearing ''Smile'' bootlegs, it was mind-blowing. It was what we had hoped it would be, but a lot of those songs weren't finished, so there was still this mystery of not hearing the melodies and lyrics. We wondered, "What are these songs and how do they fit together? Is this a verse?"

''Smile'' became the progenitor for [[indie rock]],&lt;ref name=Oteri2011/&gt; and its saga became a touchstone for the more art-inclined branches of [[post-punk]].&lt;ref name=BBCMozart&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Carl|title=The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson: America's Mozart?|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150608-is-this-americas-mozart|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various artists have cited ''Smile'' and its themes as a major influence. [[Kevin Shields]] of the Irish [[shoegaze]] band [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] has said that the 2013 album ''[[MBV (album)|MBV]]'' was inspired by ''Smile'', expounding "The idea was to bring a lot of parts together, riffs or chord changes without making a song out of it. … I wanted to see what would happen if I worked in a more impressionistic way, so that it only comes together at the end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/my-bloody-valentine/64118|title=Kevin Shields: The new My Bloody Valentine album was influenced by The Beach Boys &amp;#124; News|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=June 2, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Elephant 6 Recording Company]], a collective of [[independent music|independent artists]] which include [[Apples in Stereo]], [[the Olivia Tremor Control]], [[Neutral Milk Hotel]], [[Beulah (band)|Beulah]], [[Elf Power]], and [[Of Montreal]], was founded through a mutual admiration of 1960s pop music, with ''Smile'' being "their [[Holy Grail]]".{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=136}}  According to [[Kevin Barnes]], of Montreal's album ''[[Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse]]'' (2001) was partially based on ''Smile''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Labate|first=Steve|title=The complete Paste interview|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/11/of-montreals-kevin-barnes-the-complete-paste-inter.html|work=Paste}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Olivia Tremor Control 2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Olivia Tremor Control]] in 2005]]

The album ''[[Black Foliage: Animation Music Volume One]]'' (1999) by the Olivia Tremor Control has been compared to ''Smile'' for its dichotomous vocal harmony pop and avant-garde tape manipulation.&lt;ref name="Forever Frown" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|title=Black Foliage: Animation Music, Vol. 1|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/black-foliage-animation-music-vol-1-mw0000236976|work=AllMusic|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domenic Priore believes that ''Smile'' influence is evident on [[the Flaming Lips]]' ''[[The Soft Bulletin]]'' (1999), [[Mercury Rev]]'s ''[[All Is Dream]]'' (2001), the Apples in Stereo's ''[[Her Wallpaper Reverie]]'' (1999), [[Heavy Blinkers]]' 2000 eponymous LP, [[the Thrills]]' ''[[So Much for the City]]'' (2000), and [[XTC]]'s ''[[Oranges &amp; Lemons (album)|Oranges &amp; Lemons]]'' (1989).{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=155}}

Independent musicians and groups such as [[Ant-Bee]], [[Melt-Banana]], [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]], [[Adventures in Stereo]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[Secret Chiefs 3]] have all recorded cover versions of ''Smile'' tracks. ''[[Smiling Pets]]'' (1998) is a tribute album which largely focuses on various artists' interpretations of ''Smile''-era recordings by the Beach Boys.&lt;ref name="Forever Frown" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/weddle/reviews/smiling.html|publisher=Web of Mimicry|title=Smiling Pets review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the [[Wondermints]] performed a live cover of "Surf's Up" at the Morgan-Wixon Theater in Los Angeles with Brian in the audience, who was then quoted saying "If I'd had these guys back in '66, I could've taken ''Smile'' on the road."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=156}}

Outside the realms of alternative music, composers for the 1994 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] [[role-playing video game]] ''[[EarthBound]]'' cited ''Smile'' and related work as major influences on the game's soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1101.com/MOTHER_music/index.html (translation: http://www.artcorekirbies.fr/perso/mother/suzutana/)&lt;/ref&gt; Priore also reported that [[Lindsey Buckingham]] accessed ''Smile'' master tapes for research purposes during the making of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'' (1979), and that the tracks "That's All For Everyone" and "Beautiful Child" most strongly exemplify the results.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=193}}

Both albums ''[[Making God Smile: An Artists' Tribute to the Songs of Beach Boy Brian Wilson]]'' (2002) and ''[[Smiles, Vibes &amp; Harmony: A Tribute to Brian Wilson]]'' (1990) features cover artwork reworked from the original ''Smile'' album artwork. The cover artwork for [[power pop]] band [[Velvet Crush]]'s ''Teenage Symphonies to God'' (1994) was based on Frank Holmes' artwork for ''Smile''.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=155}} Dutch [[avant-garde]] group Palnickx paid homage to ''Smile'' on their 1996 rock-themed concept album ''The Psychedelic Years''; the tracks "Phase Ten/Thirteen (Brian Wilson)" and "Phase Twelve (Fire/Rebuilding After the Fire)" feature multiple references to the project's themes, tracks, and legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Couture|first=François|title=The Psychedelic Years|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-psychedelic-years-mw0000969766|work=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weird Al Yankovic]] recorded a song on his 2006 album ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'' modeled after ''Smile'''s aesthetic, entitled "Pancreas". Brian Wilson himself would later revisit ''Smile''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s themes and cut-up structure within his eponymous debut solo album ''[[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson]]'' (1988), which features the eight-minute-long psychedelic western saga "[[Rio Grande (song)|Rio Grande]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthew|first=Matthew|title=Rio Grande review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/rio-grande-mt0011287213|work=Allmusic|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenes from the films ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'' and ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]'' both feature homages to ''Smile''. The latter contains the song "[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (soundtrack)|Black Sheep]]", a parody of Brian Wilson's music style composed by Van Dyke Parks. The album's sessions were dramatized in the [[made-for-television]] [[biopics]] ''Summer Dreams: The Story of the Beach Boys'' and ''[[The Beach Boys: An American Family]]''. Portions of the ''Smile'' sessions are also dramatized in the 2014 Wilson biopic ''[[Love and Mercy (film)|Love and Mercy]]'', featuring [[Paul Dano]] as Brian Wilson and [[Max Schneider]] as Van Dyke Parks. The 1993 science fiction novel ''Glimpses'' by [[Lewis Shiner]] contains a chapter in which the protagonist travels back in time to November 1966 and helps Wilson complete ''Smile''.&lt;ref name="Forever Frown" /&gt; References to ''Smile'', its bootlegs, and the Beach Boys are made in the 2006 novel ''Eat the Document'' by [[Dana Spiotta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Radical on the Run, Determined to Escape the Past|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/03/books/03kaku.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|date=February 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spanish Trail Playhouse''' is a [[community theatre]] located in [[Chipley, Florida|Chipley]], [[Florida]]. The Playhouse was founded in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanishtrailplayhouse.com/history.html |title=History of The Spanish Trail Playhouse in Chipley, Florida |publisher=Spanishtrailplayhouse.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its first run ended in 1968. The Playhouse was re-chartered in 2007 and has performed a total of eleven consecutive seasons to date. The Spanish Trail Playhouse is a [[501(c)|non-profit organization]], with all of its staff operating as volunteers.

==History==

'''THE CURTAIN RAISES IN 1962'''

The Spanish Trail Playhouse started in 1962. It began under the leadership of Ann Jensen, Howard Pelham, Mickey Balaban, and Ralph Nolan, who had a dream of bringing live theatre into the little town of Chipley Florida. The first Executive Committee for the playhouse consisted of Ann Jensen as Chairman, Robbie Stanton as Secretary/ Treasurer, and directors Mickey Balaban, Leon Rice, and Bob Goss. The group decided upon three plays per year and on September 7, 1962 the Spanish Trail Playhouse opened its curtains for the first time with “Southern Exposure”, a 1950’s romantic comedy, under the Direction of Mickey Balaban. The second show was “New Moon”, a musical by Sigmund Romberg, under the direction of Ralph Nolan followed by the final show for the first season, “Dial M For Murder”. The Playhouse was really beginning to make an impression on the local community and opened its second season in 1963 with the musical, “Picnic” and “Sabrina Fair”, directed by Mickey Balaban, and the musical, Carousel completed the Playhouse’s second season. The Florida Arts Council recognized, following two successful seasons, the Spanish Trail Playhouse in 1964 as a Charter Member, a position they would hold for the next four years.

'''THE CURTAINS CLOSE IN 1968'''

The year was 1964, and the Spanish Trail Playhouse opened its 3rd Season with “Blithe Spirit”, a comical play written by Noel Coward. “Showboat”, a well-known musical, directed by Ralph Nolan, choreographed by Bob Goss, with the musical assistance of Edna Myers followed in 1965. The season ended with “Candita”, also in 1965. The first “La Cima” Awards and Beaux Arts Ball were held in 1964. The La Cima Awards awarded the Directors and Actors for their accomplishments in the previous season. The 4th season consisted of Pygmalion, Kiss Me Kate, and Solid Gold Cadillec. The 5th season stormed in with “The Importance of Being Earnest, Mikado, and Arsenic and Old Lace. In came season 6th with memorable shows such as Night Must Fall, Oklahoma starring Ann Jensen as Aunt Eller, and A Man Called Peter, directed by Winona Vanlandingham. In 1968, the members of the Spanish Trail Playhouse presented Dan and Ann Jensen, who were instrumental in the establishment of the playhouse, a crystal punch set. Ann was stepping down as President after five years of service to the playhouse and Roger Vanlandingham was to be installed as the new President. The Spanish Trail Playhouse ran for seven very successful years but after their final performance of “The Sound of Music”, the playhouse closed its curtains for the last time in fall of 1968.

'''A NEW BEGINNING IN 2006'''

In August of 2006, under the leadership of Kevin Russell, work began to bring the Spanish Trail Playhouse back to Washington County and its citizens. A womanless Beauty Contest, held at the Historic Chipley High School Auditorium, raised over $1,000.00 toward the reestablishment.

The Spanish Trail Playhouse became incorporated through the State of Florida on April 8, 2007. The first public organization meeting, held at the Washington County Public Library, took place on September 4, 2007. A second meeting followed on December 3, 2007. In an effort to introduce the playhouse to the community, the group sponsored a Halloween costume contest on October 31, 2007.

On December 3, 2007, Kevin Russell selected the first Board of Directors which included, Kevin Russell as President, Zedra Hawkins as Vice President, Cheryl Withrow as Secretary, Tiffani Wolfe as Treasurer, and Valerie Park and Trish Payne as Members at Large. Trish Payne became Secretary and Polly Kneiss became Vice President within the following 3 months.

'''IT'S OFFICIAL - THE SPANISH TRAIL PLAYHOUSE IS BACK!'''

The Spanish Trail Playhouse presented the fundraiser, Skits-O-Phrenia, on January 10, 2008 at the Chipley High School Auditorium. Skits-O-Phrenia, written by Chris Calton and Kevin Russell as a night of comedy scenes and songs, and become a favorite of the local communities for the next few years.

On September 5, 2008, merely one year since its reestablishment, the Spanish Trail Playhouse officially opened its curtain again with a 3-day performance of Steel Magnolias. This production was sponsored by the Washington County Tourist Development Council and the Washington County Arts Council and took place at the Chipley High School Auditorium as the Playhouse did not have a permanent home. Under the direction of Kevin Russell, the show gained rave reviews and highlighted the talents of women from two different counties.

In July 2008, the Spanish Trail Playhouse took over the lease of the Historic Chipley High School Auditorium. The auditorium was in need of many extensive repairs. Chris Kneiss of Plantation Builders was the Chairman of the renovation process. The first community work day was held on November 1, 2008 with a second work day to follow in January 2009.

'''2009 BOARD OF DIRECTORS'''

In January 2009, Zedra Hawkins and Tiffani Wolfe stepped down from the board due to term expirations and a board of 14 individuals took on the task of continuing the legacy of the Spanish Trail Playhouse. The 2009 Board of Directors were:

Kevin Russell - President
Polly Kneiss - Vice President

Marvin &amp; Elaine Engram - Honorary Members at Large

'''THE FIRST MUSICAL IN OVER 40 YEARS'''

In April 2009, the Spanish Trail Playhouse presented "A Stroll Down Broadway". This was the first musical produced the Spanish Trail Playhouse in over 40 years. The cast included 35 individuals with a variety of ages.

'''MEMBERSHIP AND SPONSORSHIP CAMPAIGN'''

The Spanish Trail Playhouse held its first membership and sponsorship campaign in February 2009 under Chairman Joe Johnson. The first Season Tickets were created in March 2009.

'''''The Fall of Man''''', '''''Adam and Eve''''' or '''''Adam and Eve in the earthly paradise''''' is a 1628-1629 painting by [[Rubens]], now in the [[Prado]] in Madrid. Once attributed to the minor Dutch artist [[Karel van Mander]],{{cn|date=October 2018}} it is now recognised as a work by Rubens.

It is a copy of [[The Fall of Man (Titian)|the painting of the same subject]] by [[Titian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/adam-and-eve/ |title=Titian catalogue entry |publisher=Museodelprado.es |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; seen by Rubens during his 1628-1629 trip to Madrid for peace negotiations to end the [[Dutch Revolt]]. It reflects [[Raphael]]'s influence on Titian and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]'s influence on Rubens, who adds a parrot and changes Adam's posture, musculature, age and expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/adam-and-eve-1/ |title=Rubens catalogue entry |publisher=Museodelprado.es |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hebrew Hammer''''' is a 2003 American [[comedy film]] written and directed by Jonathan Kesselman. It stars [[Adam Goldberg]], [[Judy Greer]], [[Andy Dick]], [[Mario Van Peebles]], and [[Peter Coyote]]. The plot concerns a [[Jewish]] [[blaxploitation]] crime fighter known as the Hebrew Hammer who must save [[Hanukkah]] from the evil son of [[Santa Claus]], who wants to destroy Hanukkah and [[Kwanzaa]] and make everyone celebrate [[Christmas]].

The film parodies blaxploitation films, and features [[Melvin Van Peebles]] in a cameo as "[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song|Sweetback]]".

==Plot==
The film begins with a flashback to a young Mordechai Jefferson Carver. At school, Mordechai is tormented by his fellow students and his teacher for being a Jewish child in a public school predominantly attended by Christians, and for celebrating Hanukkah while everyone else celebrates Christmas. He feels further alienated as he walks through his neighborhood and sees a seemingly endless number of Christmas decorations and window displays celebrating the holiday and announcing that Jews aren't welcome. As he lies down on the sidewalk in front of a store saying "Jews Welcome (for about 5 minutes)" and spins his [[dreidel]] to cheer himself up, Santa Claus walks by and crushes the toy under his foot, then gives Mordechai the [[middle finger|finger]].

The scene then changes to the present with Mordechai as the Hebrew Hammer, a certified [[Male circumcision|circumcised]] [[Detective|dick]] who has dedicated his life to defending Jews. His snappy dress (a cross between that of a pimp and a [[Hasidic Jew]]) and tough-guy demeanor have made him a local hero within the Jewish community. Jews and African-Americans have enjoyed a tenuous peace with the White Christians over the previous few decades, because the current Santa (the son of the cruel Santa who stomped Mordechai's dreidel years earlier) has pursued a policy of inclusion and tolerance.  This Santa is murdered and replaced by his son, Damian, who seeks to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa thus reserving December for Christmas alone. Mordechai is reluctantly recruited to stop Damian, gaining allies along the way, including love interest and daughter of the Chief of the Jewish Justice League Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal and the Kwanzaa Liberation Front's leader Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim.

The fight takes them to exotic locales such as [[Israel]], [[K-Mart]], the Jewish Atomic Clock outside [[Jerusalem]] and the final battle at the [[North Pole]].

==Controversy==
''The Hebrew Hammer'' parodies many common [[stereotype]]s about Jews. During filming, the movie came to the attention of the [[Anti-Defamation League]], which were concerned that it might promote unfavorable images of Jews; the film happens to include a direct parody of the ADL as members of the fictional Jewish Justice League. After viewing the film, Warren Katz of the ADL brought legal action against the producers of the film, but lost in a summary ruling handed down by the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]]. The film also drew criticism from some Christian groups, who argued that the film portrayed most Christians as being anti-Semitic and intolerant. 

Many scenes were shot in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Brooklyn]], which has a large community of Hasidic Jews. Filmmakers were initially concerned that members of the Hasidic community might protest the movie, as they did with the 1998 film ''[[A Price Above Rubies]]'', and shut down filming. Reaction of the Hasidim in Borough Park was mixed, however. No organized protest was pursued, and some residents of the neighborhood actually agreed to appear as extras in the film.

==Reception==
The film received a rating of 52% on aggregate review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|hebrew_hammer|The Hebrew Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In 2017, plans for a sequel titled ''The Hebrew Hammer Vs. Hitler''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2568284/|title=The Hebrew Hammer vs. Hitler}}&lt;/ref&gt; were announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TheHebrewHammerII|title=The Hebrew Hammer II|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/life/film/1.824074|title=The Hebrew Hammer Is Set to Fight His Biggest Foes Yet - Hitler and anti-Semitism|last=|date=|website=Haaretz|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel will be funded in part by crowd funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://app.microventures.com/crowdfunding/hebrew-hammer-2|title=MicroVentures - The Hebrew Hammer Vs. Hitler|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will begin in the present day, with the Hammer coming out of retirement to fight the increase in racism brought on by Donald Trump's election. He does this by going back in time to fight the worst source of antisemitism in the 20th century.

[[File:Transfigurazione (Raffaello) September 2015-1a.jpg|thumb|[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Raphael's ''Transfiguration'']], [[Vatican_Museums#Pinacoteca_Vaticana|Vatican Pinacoteca]]]] 
'''''The Raising of Lazarus''''' is a large [[altarpiece]] of 1517–1519 by the Italian [[High Renaissance]] artist [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], for which [[Michelangelo]] supplied drawings for some figures. Intended for [[Narbonne Cathedral]] in France, it is now normally in Room 18 of the [[National Gallery]] in London, where it is "NG1", the first painting catalogued at the founding of the gallery in 1824.  Until 25 June 2017 it is in the exhibition ''Michelangelo &amp; Sebastiano'' at the National Gallery, together with several of the preparatory drawings for it by both artists, and letters between them.

It was commissioned by Cardinal [[Pope Clement VII|Giulio de' Medici]], then [[Archbishop of Narbonne]] and later Pope Clement VII (r. 1523–24), in what was effectively a contest engineered by Michelangelo, using Sebastiano as "a kind of deputy",&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 111&lt;/ref&gt; or "cat's paw",&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150&lt;/ref&gt; in a rivalry between the two and [[Raphael]], whose ''[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]'' (now in the [[Vatican_Museums#Pinacoteca_Vaticana|Vatican Pinacoteca]]) is the same size of 381 cm × 299 cm (150 in × 118 in) and was commissioned for the same cathedral.  The verdict of Roman critical opinion was that Raphael's painting won. 

According to [[Michael Levey]], the painting is "a tour de force of massed, gesticulating bodies and glittering colour ... Perhaps all the elements have not been quite successfully fused, but the grand manner of the composition is impressive, and in its conscious rhetoric the painting looks forward to the Baroque."&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 62&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sebastiano, who had arrived in Rome from [[Venice]] in 1511,&lt;ref&gt;Lucco&lt;/ref&gt; may have intended to dazzle the Roman critics with the colouring for which the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian School]] was famous, giving "the greatest and most subtly varied range of colours ever seen in a single painting".&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 36&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the complicated restoration history of the painting, and aspects of Sebastiano's technique combined with effects of age, have led to a general darkening of the painting, and significant changes in some of the large number of colour shades.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject and description==
[[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]'s resurrection from the dead was the most frequently depicted of the [[miracles of Jesus]] in medieval and Renaissance art, as both the most remarkable and the easiest to recognize visually, because of the grave-cloths. As well as following the Transfiguration in traditional sequences of the [[Life of Christ in art]],&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150, these sequences generally followed the liturgical calendar but the celebrations of both Lazarus and the Transfiguration had variable dates until the end of the Middle Ages&lt;/ref&gt; the subject was especially appropriate for the cathedral at Narbonne, which had relics of Lazarus. The [[Medici]] family, whose name means "doctors" in Italian, were often attracted to subjects showing Christ as a healer (or ''medicus'').&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150; Jones &amp; Penny, 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The account in [[John 11|Chapter 11]] of the [[Gospel of John]] of the [[Raising of Lazarus]] from the dead is followed closely, though different moments in it are combined in the picture.  For Sebastiano and his contemporaries, Mary the sister of [[Lazarus of Bethany]] was the same person as [[Mary Magdalene]], though today even the Catholic Church agrees with Protestants that [[Mary of Bethany]] was a separate person.&lt;ref&gt;By coincidence, it was in 1517 that [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] published ''De Maria Magdalena et triduo Christi disceptatio'', his suggestion that the medieval Mary Magdalene was actually three different people in the Bible.&lt;/ref&gt;  She is the figure kneeling in front of Christ, which in the gospels precedes the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 242–243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Biblegateway |title=John 11:1–46 |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2011:1-11:46&amp;version=NIV|publisher=NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main moment shown is just after John 11:45 when : "Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go".  But in the upper left background a group of Jews and [[Pharisees]] are depicted discussing the event, which completes the story in the gospels.  The standing female in orange is [[Martha of Bethany]], sister of Lazarus and Mary; in the gospel, before the tomb is opened, she protests that the body will smell, and her gesture suggests she was right.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 242–243; Langmuir, 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Biblegateway |title=John 11:1–46 |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2011:1-11:46&amp;version=NIV|publisher=NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Twelve Apostles]] are crowded to the left of Christ and behind him.  The younger man standing at the left, seen in profile, is Saint [[John the Evangelist]],&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 35&lt;/ref&gt; and the bearded kneeling man at lower left is [[Saint Peter]], given an orange overgarment, as often in art.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 42&lt;/ref&gt;  The others are probably not intended to be individually identifiable.  By this stage of the [[High Renaissance]], not even Christ is given a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], making it harder to pick out any specific individuals from the crowd that the gospel account mentions.  Michael Levey said the painting was "full of obvious portrait heads",&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 62&lt;/ref&gt; but there has been much much less speculation as to the individuals with inserted likenesses than for Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' of a few years earlier.

The painting is signed in Latin "SEBASTIANVS. VENETVS. FACIE|BAT" ("Sebastian the Venetian made this") on the stone platform below Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 242&lt;/ref&gt; Born Sebastiano Luciani, after coming to Rome he had become "Sebastiano Veneziano", until in 1531 he became the Keeper of the Seal to the Papacy, and so got the nickname ''del Piombo'' thereafter, meaning "of the lead", from his new job title.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150–151; Lucco&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus (cropped4).jpg|thumb|The landscape]]
The painting was begun some five years after Sebastiano had moved from his native [[Venice]] to Rome, and shows that his adaption to a monumental and classical Roman style was effectively complete, though the colours "retain a Venice-like luminosity that enchants the eye".  Despite being conceived as a move against Raphael, with the help of Michelangelo, in its general composition it shows a good deal of influence from Raphael, and although the two paintings for Narbonne have only ever been seen together for a few days in 1520, and were both painted in conditions of great secrecy by the rival artists, in many ways they are a well-matched pair, showing how much Sebastiano had absorbed from Raphael.&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 113–115&lt;/ref&gt;

The help received from Michelangelo was limited to the main male figures (see below), and the crowd and landscape background was Sebastiano's composition.&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 113; Langmuir, 150; Gould, 244&lt;/ref&gt;  The landscape has ruins and a bridge that look like a Roman setting, but the cloudy sky and other aspects suggest a Venetian landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Michelangelo, lazaro, per pala sebastiano del piombo.gif|thumb|Drawing of Lazarus and attendants by [[Michelangelo]], which Sebastiano used for the painting, [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=716129&amp;partId=1 British Museum page]; M&amp;S, 25&lt;/ref&gt;]]
===In Rome===
In 1516 Cardinal [[Pope Clement VII|Giulio de' Medici]], then [[Archbishop of Narbonne]] and later Pope Clement VII (r. 1523–24), commissioned a ''Raising of Lazarus'' from Sebastiano in competition with [[Raphael]]'s late masterpiece the ''[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]'', commissioned earlier that year.  The original declared intention was for both paintings to go to Narbonne Cathedral, which it is unlikely the cardinal ever visited.  It seems likely that the idea for what inevitably became a contest was suggested by Michelangelo,&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny, 238; Langmuir, 150&lt;/ref&gt; who the previous year had enlisted Sebastiano as "as a kind of deputy for him in painting", with the specific intention of contesting Raphael's primacy in painting in Rome, Michelangelo himself having returned to his backlog of promised projects in sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 111&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being a friend of Sebastiano, he was eager to show up his bitter rival Raphael.  The cardinal fell in with this idea.&lt;ref&gt;Lucco&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vasari]], who knew both artists in later years, described the collaboration by saying that the picture was made "''sotto ordine e disegno in alcune parti''" of Michelangelo, rather vague phrasing that has been much discussed.  One translation could be "under the direction and in certain parts to the designs" of Michelangelo, but this and other possibilities leave room for a wide range of interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;  Sebastiano intended to charge for the painting based on the number of figures in it, a common way of valuing paintings at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Compositional drawings for the figures of Lazarus and his two attendants were supplied by Michelangelo.  In addition to the drawing in the [[British Museum]] illustrated here, there are other drawings by Michelangelo there and in [[Bayonne]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=716128&amp;partId=1 British Museum; the other main drawing]&lt;/ref&gt; all of Lazarus and the two men supporting him, except for one of a foot, perhaps relating to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 243–244&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern imaging techniques show that a different figure of Lazarus exists in the underdrawing, which was apparently changed to match one of Michelangelo's drawings (illustrated below) while painting was in progress, perhaps when Michelangelo visited Rome in January 1518.&lt;ref&gt;M&amp;S, 24, 25&lt;/ref&gt;  A drawing by Sebastiano seems to contain a sketch for this figure as well as one for the Saint Peter in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;M&amp;S, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In Frankfurt there is a drawing by Sebastiano of the figure of Martha, which is close to the painted figure.&lt;ref&gt;M&amp;S, 23; Gould, 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of more drawings by Michelangelo, now lost, for at least the figure of Christ, has been postulated by some scholars. In addition, there are a number of letters between the artists and others which record the progress of the commission. These reflect that Michelangelo was away from Rome during the period of painting, and would only have seen the half-finished work when he made a visit in January 1518.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 243–244; M&amp;S, 28–33&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular [[Leonardo Sellaio]] was a trusted assistant to Michelangelo, who remained in Rome reporting on progress.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 26; M&amp;S, 28, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Although completed by the start of 1519,&lt;ref&gt;Lucco; Freedburg, 113&lt;/ref&gt; the completed painting was apparently only exhibited to a wider public in the Vatican in late December 1519 and then again in the following April, before being sent to [[Narbonne]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 245; Jones &amp; Penny, 238&lt;/ref&gt;  In the second exhibition, from 12 April 1520, it was shown together with Raphael's ''Transfiguration''.  Raphael had died on April 6th, and his ''Transfiguration'' came straight from being displayed by his body as it lay in state in his studio.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 243; Jones &amp; Penny, 238&lt;/ref&gt;  In the event, as described by [[Vasari]], both paintings were praised, but the Raphael much preferred, and only the Sebastiano was sent to Narbonne.&lt;ref&gt;Lucco; [http://members.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariSebastianoPiombo.html Vasari, "Life of Sebastiano"]: "These altarpieces, when finished, were publicly exhibited together in the Consistory, and were vastly extolled, both the one and the other; and although the works of Raffaello had no equals in their perfect grace and beauty, nevertheless the labours of Sebastiano were also praised by all without exception."&lt;/ref&gt;

===France and England===
[[File:Cathédrale Saint-Just de Narbonne - Chapelle Saint-Martin.jpg|thumb|The copy now in Narbonne Cathedral.  The original plinth of the frame can be seen below the painting.]]
[[File:Cathédrale Saint-Just de Narbonne - Chapelle Saint-Martin (cropped).jpg|thumb|Enlarged detail from above; the 16th-century base of the frame, copied in the new London frame.]] 
In 1722, the Regent of France, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], persuaded the Narbonne authorities to let him have the painting for the [[Orleans Collection]] in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 243–245&lt;/ref&gt; which was soon effectively open to the public in the magnificent setting of the [[Palais-Royal]], the Paris seat of the Dukes of Orléans.  He died the following year, and the replica replacement promised as part of the purchase was eventually sent around 1750; it was probably by [[Charles-André van Loo]] and still hangs in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;NGBT, 29; Gould, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The making of the frames had been a cause of argument between Raphael and Sebastiano.  Perhaps as a tactic to prevent a public side-by-side display in Rome, Raphael wanted the frames made on arrival in France, but Sebastiano insisted they be made in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Sebastiano evidently prevailed, as below the replica in Narbonne the altar still has part of a "sophisticated" frame in gold on blue that carries above the two [[festoon]]s the Medici ''[[Heraldic badge|impresa]]'' of a diamond ring with feathers rising through it, and the motto ''SEMPER'' ("always"), and is presumed to be from Rome.  This is now treated as a [[predella]] or shelf below the frame of the copy.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 26; Von Teuffel, Christa Gardner. "Sebastiano Del Piombo, Raphael and Narbonne: New Evidence", ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', vol. 126, no. 981, 1984, pp. 765–766., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/881800 JSTOR], gives fuller details.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably in 1771, Sebastiano's painting was [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred from wooden panel to canvas]] and some of the pigments have as a result lost their brightness, most notably the red of Christ's robe, which has turned pink.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150–151; Gould, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

No doubt because it soon left Rome for the artistic backwater of Narbonne, the earliest print of the painting was remarkably late, in an illustrated account of the Orleans Collection, published in 1786 on the eve of its dispersal.  This was by R. De Launay, and in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was sold in 1792, included in a [[Orleans_Collection#Dispersal_in_London|block purchase of the Orleans Collection]].  It came to London in 1793 and was eventually acquired by the English consortium set up to disperse the collection.  In one of the auction sales dedicated to the collection beginning on 26 December 1798 ''The Raising of Lazarus'' was bought by the [[London]] banker [[John Julius Angerstein]], apparently at the urging of Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 245–246&lt;/ref&gt; The price was very high at 3,500 guineas.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 28–39&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of its importance it was catalogued as No. 1 in Angerstein's catalogue, and when the Angerstein collection was bought by the British government in 1824 for the foundation of the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] the canvas was now catalogued as NG1,&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 29&lt;/ref&gt; making it officially the first painting to enter the National Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 242–245&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, for their exhibition of Michelangelo and Sebastiano, the National Gallery gave the painting a new frame, with the bottom copying the original element still in Narbonne Cathedral.  This is in blue and gold, with a [[cartouche]] and Medici devices, and there are two gilded and decorated classical columns at the sides, with an elaborate pediment above.  It is thought possible that the original frame was designed by Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;M&amp;S, 22 "The Frame..."; [http://theartnewspaper.com/comment/reviews/exhibitions/sebastiano-s-debt-to-michelangelo-made-clear-in-london-show/ "Sebastiano's debt to Michelangelo made clear in London show"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407143953/http://theartnewspaper.com/comment/reviews/exhibitions/sebastiano-s-debt-to-michelangelo-made-clear-in-london-show/ |date=2017-04-07 }} by Donald Lee, 16 March 2017, ''The Art Newspaper'', with photo&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration history==
Despite its large size, the painting was originally painted on [[panel painting|wood panels]].  The wood used cannot now be identified, but it seems that, like Raphael's ''Transfiguration'', the panel used a number of vertical boards, where a Venetian painting would be more likely to use horizontal ones.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1770s there was a large campaign of restoration of the paintings in the Orleans Collection, which included transferring this and many others [[Transfer of panel paintings|from panel to canvas]].  According to the National Gallery's detailed account of the restoration history and current condition of the painting: "There can be little doubt that this drastic and dangerous intervention was totally unnecessary".  Much damage to the painting seems to have resulted, and the connoisseur and art theorist [[Richard Payne Knight]] wrote that "those who have only seen it since that fatal operation ... can form but very imperfect notions of what it was before".&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1820s the artist [[Benjamin West]], the painting's "most vocal admirer", is recorded as restoring and repainting damaged areas on Lazarus' right leg.  It was re-varnished in 1834, 1852, and 1867, and cleaned and re-varnished in 1881, after which a sheet of glass was added to protect it from London's air.  After the painting was evacuated in 1939 to [[Penrhyn Castle]] to protect it from the risk of German bombing in World War II, losses of paint from flaking were noticed, and various attempts in the following years to stabilize the situation failed.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 29&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus (cropped5).jpg|thumb|The central figures]]

In 1958 a major re-structuring of the support was done, aimed at reducing the presence of glue in several layers of canvas underneath the paint.  These layers were contracting, causing the paint to lift and flake. It was thought that there were four canvas layers, of which it was planned to remove three. However, as the work was carried out the "alarming discovery" was made that the layer nearest to the paint was actually not canvas but sheets of paper, badly decayed and partly separated from the ground to the paint.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan was changed to add layers of warm wax-resin in which an inert synthetic textile was fixed, before attaching to a composite board and paper honeycomb solid support. This method would be unlikely to be used today, but did stabilize the flaking.  By 2009 it was tending to flex when the painting is moved, so this is now avoided as far as possible.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

After the new support was added much old varnish was removed, and limited retouching performed.  The extensive work, and condition of the painting, allowed the taking of an unusually large number of paint samples, which have now been re-examined using the more advanced scientific techniques available in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;  This has allowed a good idea of the many complex mixtures of pigments used.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 33–44&lt;/ref&gt;

With the equipment available in 2009, full examination with imaging techniques that allow [[underpainting]] to be seen was not possible.  It was thought that this might shed more light on any contribution by Michelangelo to the underpainting, as it has for the Viterbo ''Pietà'', Sebastiano's first major collaboration with Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 33&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2017, imaging had indeed revealed that the present figure of Lazarus, based on Michelangelo's drawing, lay over a different figure, presumably designed by Sebastiano.&lt;ref&gt;M&amp;S, 24, 25, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting depicts a [[Depictions of nudity|nude]] standing upright between an opening in the rocks and holding in her hands a [[Pitcher (container)|pitcher]], from which water flows. She thus represents a [[Source (hydrology)|water source]] or [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] which, in [[Classics|classical literature]], is sacred to the [[Muses]] and a source of poetic inspiration.&lt;ref name="Symbols"&gt;{{cite book |title=A dictionary of literary symbols |author=Ferber, Michael |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-87042-9 |pages=75ff, 80f, 104f, 170ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stands between two flowers, with their "vulnerability to males who wish to pluck them",&lt;ref name="Symbols"/&gt; and is framed by [[ivy]], plant of [[Dionysus]] the god of disorder, regeneration, and ecstasy.&lt;ref name="Symbols"/&gt; The water she pours out separates her from the viewer, as rivers mark boundaries of which the crossing is symbolically important.&lt;ref name="Symbols"/&gt;

==Theme==
[[Art historians]] Frances Fowle and Richard Thomson suggest that there is a "symbolic unity of woman and nature" in ''The Source'', where the flowering plants and water serve as a background which Ingres fills with woman's "secondary attributes".&lt;ref name="FowleThomson2003"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fowle, Francis |author2=Thomson, Richard |title=Soil and stone: impressionism, urbanism, environment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udT3p5pusY8C&amp;pg=PA23 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-7546-3685-4 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The first exhibition of ''The Source'' was in 1856, the year it was completed.&lt;ref name="Stoddart1990"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stoddart, David Michael |title=The scented ape: the biology and culture of human odour |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYBux6MdmbIC&amp;pg=PA131 |year=1990 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-39561-8 |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was received enthusiastically.&lt;ref name="Magi1999"/&gt; [[Tanneguy Duchâtel|Duchâtel]] acquired the painting in 1857 for a sum of 25,000 francs. The state assumed title to the painting in 1878 and it passed to the [[Musée du Louvre]]. In 1986 it was transferred to the [[Musée d'Orsay]].&lt;ref name="Musée d'Orsay"/&gt; The painting has been frequently exhibited and widely published.&lt;ref name="Musée d'Orsay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fried1998"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fried, Michael |title=Manet's modernism, or, The face of painting in the 1860s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aV9bPK-vE6cC&amp;pg=PA518 |year=1998 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=978-0-226-26217-8 |page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haldane Macfall in ''A History of Painting: The French Genius'' describes ''The Source'' as Ingres' "superb nude by which he is chiefly known".&lt;ref name="Macfall2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Macfall, Haldane |title=A History of Painting: The French Genius (vol. 6) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UWrGyKyc60oC&amp;pg=PA275 |date=August 2004 |publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-4179-4511-5 |page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Clark]] in his book ''Feminine Beauty'' observed how ''The Source'' has been described as "the most beautiful figure in French painting."&lt;ref name="Strobel1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry A. Strobel |title=Reflections: personal essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wac58KGK1sC&amp;pg=PA62 |year=1999 |publisher=Henry Strobel Publisher |isbn=978-1-892210-01-2|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Friedländer]] in ''David to Delacroix'' referred to ''The Source'' simply as the most famous of Ingres' paintings.&lt;ref name="Friedlaender1952"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Walter Friedländer|Friedländer, Walter F.]] |title=David to Delacroix |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhm0pV_t-Z0C&amp;pg=PA87 |year=1952 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=978-0-674-19401-4 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for the painting was the young daughter of Ingres' [[concierge]].&lt;ref name="Macfall2004"/&gt; In his ''[[Confessions of a Young Man]]'', Irish novelist [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] wrote, with relation to the [[Art and morality|morality of artistic production]], "What care I that the virtue of some sixteen-year-old maid was the price for Ingres' ''La Source''? That the model died of drink and disease in the hospital is nothing when compared with the essential that I should have ''La Source'', that exquisite dream of innocence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/430264 |title=The Morality of Artistic Production |author=Barrett, Cyril |journal=[[The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism]] |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year=1982 |volume=41 |number=2 |pages=137–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4530">'''Unrealised Projects''' is an artist run web-based project established in London by [[Sam Ely and Lynn Harris]] in 2003. Unrealised Projects investigates the potential of unrecognised, unfinished or unfulfilled ideas. The project is ongoing.

[[Lisa Le Feuvre]] writing on Art Failure states:

:“Other, more recent, catalogues of unrealised projects are [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]]’s Unbuilt Roads or the online archive Unrealised Projects devised by artist [[Sam Ely and Lynn Harris]]. These collections show proposals that have been deemed failures before they have been realised, yet nonetheless they are released into the space of critical engagement.” &lt;ref&gt;Le Feuvre, Lisa, February 2008, [[Art Monthly]] 313, ‘Art Failure’, {{ISSN|0142-6702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Ely and Lynn Harris are research-led artists who have worked together since September 2002. In this time, they have worked on several contextually specific projects with such artists/curators as [[Per Hüttner]], [[Lisa Le Feuvre]], [[Apolonija Šušteršič]], Simon Morris, [[Dallas Seitz]] and [[Denise Hawyrsio]]. They are interested in understanding how critical cultural production has the potential to create better living conditions through analysing and responding to existing systems/situations.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonskiene, Lolita, October 2008, Printed Project, Issue 10, 'The Art of Living with Strangers', p132, ISSN 1649-4075.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unrealised Projects have participated in [[Publish And Be Damned]], an annual independent publishing fair in both 2009 and 2006, in June 2009 Volume 4 publication (a partial introduction to a process in progress) was launched at the [[Liverpool Artists Book Fair]] at [[A Foundation]].

'''''Verre Églomisé''''' is a French term referring to the process of applying both a design and gilding onto the rear face of glass to produce a mirror finish. The name is derived from the 18th-century French decorator and art-dealer Jean-Baptiste Glomy (1711–1786), who was responsible for its revival.

Glomy’s technique was a relatively simple one of applying decorative designs in a combination of plain colour and gilding, usually to glass picture frames.  However, over time it has come to be used to describe nearly any process involving back-painted and gilded glass, however elaborate.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NSFFAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=verre+eglomise+glomy+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E9Yi6wSlsl&amp;sig=2d9lmccqCCcGJjIQPRw58E-zrC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwq77W1qHSAhWjOsAKHYZ5DGk4ChDoAQgoMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=verre%20eglomise%20glomy%20history&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of back-painting glass actually dates back to pre-Roman eras. One of the key historical periods of the art was in Italy during the 13th to 16th centuries. Small panels of glass with designs formed by engraved gilding were applied to reliquaries and portable altars. The method used is described by Cennino Cennini.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Cennini/11M.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Other practitioners include Jonas Zeuner and Hans Jakob Sprungli (1559–1637).

It has also been used throughout Europe since the 15th century, appearing in paintings, furniture, drinking glasses and similar vessels and jewellery. It is also often seen in the form of decorative panels of mirrors, clock faces, and in more recent history, as window signs and advertising mirrors.

In the gilding process, the silver, gold or other metal leaf is fixed using a gelatin adhesive which, after steaming, results in a mirror-like, reflective finish. The design can be applied by various techniques, often by reverse painting prior to gilding, or by engraving the design into the gilded layer, or even into the glass. When painting an elaborate design such as a flower, the artist’s natural methodology is reversed, with highlights applied first and the background applied last.

The metal leaf may also be applied using oil-based adhesives (goldsize varnish) to achieve a matte finish. It is to be distinguished from "sandwiched" gold glass where gold leaf is glued to a piece of glass, and often then scraped off to form a design, and a further layer of hot glass is then applied on top and fused to seal the gold inside.

In recent years the term Verre Églomisé has also been used to describe gilded and distressed mirrors which have no actual design or pattern applied, but this is taking it a further step away from its source. A better term for these would be the less exotic sounding ‘Distressed Hand-Gilded Mirror’.
