==Events==
* 1826 – [[Nicéphore Niépce]] takes the first known photograph in history. (See [[View from the Window at Le Gras]]).
* 1832 – [[Joseph Plateau]] (Belgium) and [[Simon von Stampfer]] ([[Vienna]]) introduce simultaneously a scientific demonstration device that creates an [[optical illusion]] of movement by mounting drawings on the face of a slotted, spinning disk. Plateau's version was variously known as the "[[Phenakistoscope]]", "Phenakistiscope", "Fenakisticope" or "Fantascope", while Stampfer's version became known as the [[Stroboscope]]. The device, originally developed to demonstrate "persistence of vision", was soon marketed as a novelty toy.
* 1834 – The [[Zoetrope]] is invented. The device was a hollow drum with a strip of pictures around its inner surface. When the drum was spun and the pictures viewed through slots on the side of the drum, the pictures appeared to move. The device was first marketed only in the second half of the 1860s when several patents were taken. It was known as "Zoetrope", "Zootrope", "Wheel of Life", etc.
* 1870s – French inventor [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] improved on the [[Zoetrope]] idea by placing mirrors at the center of the drum. He called his invention the [[Praxinoscope]]. Reynaud developed other versions of the Praxinoscope too, including a Praxinoscope Theatre, where the device was enclosed in a viewing box, and the Projecting Praxinoscope. Eventually he created the "[[Théâtre Optique]]", a large machine based on the Praxinoscope, but able to project longer animated strips. In the United States, the McLoughlin Bros. from New York released in 1879 a simplified (and unauthorized) copy of Reynaud's invention under the name "Whirligig of Life".
* 1878 – Railroad tycoon [[Leland Stanford]] hires British photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] to settle the questions of whether a galloping horse ever had all four of its feet off the ground. Muybridge [[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|successfully photographed]] a horse in fast motion using a series of 12 cameras controlled by trip wires. Muybridge's photos showed the horse with all four feet off the ground. Muybridge went on a lecture tour showing his photographs on a moving-image device he called the [[zoopraxiscope]]. Muybridge's experiments inspired French scientist [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] to invent equipment for recording and analyzing animal and human movement. Marey called his invention the chronophotographic camera, which was able to take multiple images superimposed on top of one another.
* 1879 – American [[George Eastman]] invents an emulsion-coating machine which enables the mass production of [[photography|photographic]] dry plates.
* 1880 – American [[George Eastman]] begins to commercially manufacture dry plates for [[photography]].
* 1880 – [[Eadweard Muybridge]] holds a public demonstration of his [[Zoopraxiscope]], a magic lantern provided with a rotating disc with artist's renderings of Muybridge's chronophotographic sequences. It was used as a demonstration device by Muybridge in his illustrated lecture (the original preserved in the Museum of [[Kingston upon Thames]] in England).
* January 1, 1881 – American inventor [[George Eastman]] founds the [[Eastman Dry Plate Company]].
* 1882 – American inventor [[George Eastman]] begins experimenting with new types of [[photographic film]], with his employee, [[William Walker (assistant)|William Walker]].
* 1882 – French physiologist [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] invents the [[chronophotographic gun]], a camera shaped like a rifle that photographs twelve successive images each second.
* 1885 – American inventors [[George Eastman]] and [[Hannibal Goodwin]] each invent a sensitized [[celluloid]] [[film base|base]] roll [[photographic film]] to replace the glass plates then in use.
* 1887 – [[Hannibal Goodwin]] files for a patent for his [[photographic film]].
* 1888 – [[George Eastman]] files for a patent for his [[photographic film]].
* 1888 – [[Thomas Edison]] meets with [[Eadweard Muybridge]] to discuss adding sound to moving pictures. Edison begins his own experiments.
* 1888 – [[Louis Le Prince|Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince]] creates the first motion picture films created on paper rolls of film.
* 1889 – American inventor [[George Eastman]]'s [[celluloid]] [[film base|base]] roll [[photographic film]] becomes commercially available.
* June 1889 or  November 1890 – [[William K. L. Dickson]], working for [[Thomas Edison]], creates the first known motion picture films shot in the United States, the [[Monkeyshines, No. 1|Monkeyshines]] films.
* 1891 – Designed around the work of Muybridge, Marey, and Eastman, [[Thomas Edison]]'s employee [[William K. L. Dickson]] finishes work on a motion-picture camera, called the [[Kinetograph]], and a viewing machine, called the [[Kinetoscope]].
* May 20, 1891 – [[Thomas Edison]] holds the first public presentation of his [[Kinetoscope]] for the [[National Federation of Women's Clubs]].
* August 24, 1891 – [[Thomas Edison]] files for a patent of the [[Kinetoscope]].
* 1892 – [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] begins public screenings in [[Paris]] at the [[Théâtre Optique]], with hundreds of drawings on a reel that he wound through his Zoetrope projector to construct moving images that continued for 15 minutes.
* 1892 – The [[Eastman Company]] becomes the [[Eastman Kodak Company]].
* March 14, 1893 – [[Thomas Edison]] is granted Patent #493,426 for "An Apparatus for Exhibiting Photographs of Moving Objects" (the [[Kinetoscope]]).
* 1893 – [[Thomas Edison]] builds a motion-picture studio, dubbed the "Black Maria" by his staff.
* May 9, 1893 – In America, [[Thomas Edison]] holds the first public exhibition of films shot using his [[Kinetograph]] at the [[Edison's Black Maria|Brooklyn Institute]]. Only one person at a time could use his viewing machine, the [[Kinetoscope]].
* January 7, 1894 – [[Thomas Edison]] films "[[Fred Ott's Sneeze]]" with the [[Kinetoscope]] at the "Black Maria".
* April 14, 1894 – The first commercial presentation of the [[Kinetoscope]] takes place at the Holland Brothers' Kinetoscope Parlor at 1155 Broadway, New York City.
* 1894 – [[Kinetoscope]] viewing parlors begin to open in major cities. Each parlor contains several machines.
* 1895 – In France, brothers named [[Auguste Lumière|Auguste]] and [[Louis Lumière]] design and build a lightweight, hand-held motion picture camera called the [[Cinématographe]]. The Lumière brothers discover that their machine can also be used to project images onto a large screen. The Lumière brothers created several short films at this time that are considered to be pivotal in the history of motion pictures.
* November 1895 – In Germany, [[Emil Skladanowsky|Emil]] and [[Max Skladanowsky]] develop their own film projector.
* December 1895 – In France, [[Auguste Lumière|Auguste]] and [[Louis Lumière]] hold their first public screening of films shot with their [[Cinématographe]].

[[File:Essays Percy Bysshe Shelley 1840 2 vols.jpg|thumb|1840 title page of ''Essays. Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments'' by Edward Moxon, London.]][[File:A Defense of Poetry.jpg|thumb|1891 title page of ''A Defense of Poetry'' by Ginn and Co., Boston]]
"'''A Defence of Poetry'''" is an essay by the English poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], written in 1821 and first published posthumously in 1840 in ''Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments'' by Edward Moxon in London.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy, Mark. "Defence of Poetry" by Percy Bysshe Shelley. 25 August 2004. The Literary Encyclopaedia&lt;/ref&gt; It contains Shelley's famous claim that "poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world".

==Background==

The essay was written in response to his friend [[Thomas Love Peacock]]'s article "[[The Four Ages of Poetry]]", which had been published in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Charles W., ed. ''English Essays: From Sir Philip Sidney to Macaulay. With Introductions and Notes. The Harvard Classics''. Edited by Charles W. Eliot. New York: P.F. Collier and Son, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley wrote to the publishers [[Charles Ollier|Charles and James Ollier]] (who were also his own publishers):  &lt;br&gt;
:I am enchanted with your ''Literary Miscellany'', although the last article has excited my polemical faculties so violently that the moment I get rid of my ophthalmia, I mean to set about an answer to it.... It is very clever, but I think, very false.

To Peacock, Shelley wrote:
:Your anathemas against poetry itself excited me to a sacred rage. . . . I had the greatest possible desire to break a lance with you ... in honour of my mistress Urania.

''A Defence of Poetry'' was eventually published, with some edits by [[John Hunt (publisher)|John Hunt]], posthumously by Shelley's wife [[Mary Shelley]] in 1840 in ''Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments''.

==Editorial introductions==

Shelley sought to show that poets make morality and establish the legal norms in a civil society thus creating the groundwork for the other branches in a community.

In ''[[Gateway to the Great Books]]'', Volume 5, Critical Essays, Robert M. Hutchins and Mortimer J. Adler wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, Robert M., and Mortimer J. Adler, eds. ''[[Gateway to the Great Books]]'', Volume 5, Critical Essays. Toronto: Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 1963, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

::In A Defence of Poetry, [Shelley] attempts to prove that poets are philosophers; that they are the creators and protectors of moral and civil laws; and that if it were not for poets, scientists could not have developed either their theories or their inventions.

Poets introduce and maintain morality. The mores so created are codified into laws. The social function or utility of poets is that they create and maintain the norms and mores of a society. In ''English Romantic Writers'', David Perkins wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, David, ed. ''English Romantic Writers,'' 2nd edition. Toronto: Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 1995, p. 1131. {{ISBN|0-15-501688-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

::...Shelley was mainly concerned to explain the moral (and thus the social) function of poetry.  In doing so, he produced one of the most penetrating general discussions on poetry that we have.

==Major themes==

Shelley’s argument for poetry in his critical essay is written within the context of [[Romanticism]]. In 1858, William Stigant, a poet, essayist, and translator, wrote in his essay "Sir Philip Sidney"&lt;ref&gt;Stigant, William. "Sir Philip Sidney", ''Cambridge Essays'', 4, 1858.&lt;/ref&gt; that Shelley's "beautifully written ''Defence of Poetry''" is a work which "analyses the very inner essence of poetry and the reason of its existence, – its development from, and operation on, the mind of man". Shelley writes in ''Defence'' that while "ethical science arranges the elements which poetry has created," and leads to a moral civil life, poetry acts in a way that "awakens and enlarges the mind itself by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought".

In ''A Defence of Poetry'', Shelley argued that the invention of language reveals a human impulse to reproduce the rhythmic and ordered, so that harmony and unity are delighted in wherever they are found and incorporated, instinctively, into creative activities: "Every man in the infancy of art, observes an order which approximates more or less closely to that from which highest delight results..." This "faculty of approximation" enables the observer to experience the beautiful, by establishing a "relation between the highest pleasure and its causes". Those who possess this faculty "in excess are poets" and their task is to communicate the "pleasure" of their experiences to the community. Shelley does not claim language is poetry on the grounds that language is the medium of poetry; rather he recognises in the creation of language an adherence to the poetic precepts of order, harmony, unity, and a desire to express delight in the beautiful. Aesthetic admiration of "the true and the beautiful" is provided with an important social aspect which extends beyond communication and precipitates self-awareness. Poetry and the various modes of art it incorporates are directly involved with the social activities of life. Shelley nominated unlikely figures such as [[Plato]] and Jesus in their excellent use of language to conceive the inconceivable.

For Shelley, "poets ... are not only the authors of language and of music, of the dance, and architecture, and statuary, and painting; they are the institutors of laws, and the founders of civil society..." Social and linguistic order are not the sole products of the rational faculty, as language is "arbitrarily produced by the imagination" and reveals "the before unapprehended relations of things and perpetuates their apprehension" of a higher beauty and truth. Shelley's conclusive remark that "poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world" suggests his awareness of "the profound ambiguity inherent in linguistic means, which he considers at once as an instrument of intellectual freedom and a vehicle for political and social subjugation".&lt;ref&gt;Liberto, Fabio. "The Politics of Language in P.B. Shelley." ''La questione romantica'' 2/1 (April, 2010), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archival research''' is a type of research which involves seeking out and extracting [[evidence]] from [[archive|archival]] [[document|records]]. These records may be held either in collecting institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciscra.org/mat/mat/term/64|title=Multilingual Archival Terminology|last=International Council on Archives|first=|date=|website=International Council on Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as libraries and museums, or in the custody of the organization (whether a government body, business, family, or other agency) that originally generated or accumulated them, or in that of a successor body (transferring, or in-house archives).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/i/institutional-archives|title=A glossary of archival and records terminology|last=Society of American Archivists|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archival research can be contrasted with (1) [[secondary research]] (undertaken in a [[library]] or [[Internet research|online]]), which involves identifying and consulting [[secondary source]]s relating to the topic of enquiry; and (2) with other types of primary research and [[Empirical method|empirical investigation]] such as [[Field research|fieldwork]] and [[experiment]].

==History of archives organizations==
The oldest archives have been in existence for hundreds of years. For instance, the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] was started in the 17th century AD and contains state papers, papal account books, and papal correspondence dating back to the 8th century. Most archives that are still in existence do not claim collections that date back quite as far as the Vatican Archive. The [[Archives nationales|Archives Nationales]] in France was founded in 1790 during the French Revolution and has holdings that date back to AD 625, and other European archives have a similar provenance. Archives in the modern world, while of more recent date, may also hold material going back several centuries, for example the United States [[National Archives and Records Administration]] was established originally in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Archive.gov. National Records and Archive Administration, 1 December 2009. Web. 5 December 2009 &lt;https://www.archives.gov/research/start/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The NARA contains records and collections dating back to the founding of the United States in the 18th century. Among the collections of the NARA are the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and an original copy of the Magna Carta. The [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|British National Archives (TNA)]] traces its history to the creation of the [[Public Record Office]] in 1838, while other state and national bodies were also formed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 

Universities are another venue for archival holdings and manuscript collections. Most universities have archival holdings that chronicle the business of the university. Some universities also have archives or manuscript collections that focus on one aspect or another of the culture of the state or country in which the university is located. Museums and local history centers may also be good sources for archival materials.

The reason for highlighting the breadth and depth of historical archives is to give some idea of the difficulties facing archival researchers. Some of these archives hold vast quantities of records. For example, the Vatican Secret Archive has upwards of 52 miles of archival shelving. An increasing number of archives are now accepting digital transfers, which can also present challenges for display and access.

== Archival research methodologies ==
Archival research lies at the heart of most academic and other forms of original [[Historical method|historical research]]; but it is frequently also undertaken (in conjunction with parallel research methodologies) in other disciplines within the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s, including [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], rhetoric&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L'Eplattenier|first=Barbara E.|date=2009|title=An Argument for Archival Research Methods: Thinking Beyond Methodology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25653008|journal=College English|volume=72|issue=1|pages=67–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[archaeology]], [[sociology]], [[human geography]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], and [[organizational studies]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It may also be important in other non-academic types of enquiry, such as the [[Adoption#Reunion|tracing of birth families by adoptees]], and [[criminal investigation]]s. Data held by archival institutions is also of use in scientific research and in establishing civil rights.

In addition to discipline, the kind of research [[methodology]] used in archival research can vary depending on its organization and its materials. For example, in an archives that has a large number of materials still unprocessed, a researcher may find consulting directly with archive staff who have a clear understanding of collections and their organization to be useful as they can be a source of information regarding unprocessed materials or of related materials in other archives and repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=82-83|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an archive is not entirely oriented towards one or relevant to a single discipline, researchers, for example [[Genealogy|genealogists]], may rely upon formal or informal networks to support research by sharing information about specific archives' organization and collections with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duff|first=Wendy|last2=Johnson|first2=Catherine|date=2003|title=Where Is the List with All the Names? Information-Seeking Behavior of Genealogists|url=https://doi.org/10.17723/aarc.66.1.l375uj047224737n|journal=The American Archivist|language=en-US|volume=66|issue=1|pages=79–95|doi=10.17723/aarc.66.1.l375uj047224737n|issn=0360-9081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elizabeth|first=Yakel,|date=2004|title=Seeking Information, Seeking Connections, Seeking Meaning: Genealogists and Family Historians.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1082067|journal=Information Research: An International Electronic Journal|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|issn=1368-1613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conducting research at an archive ==
[[File:Hoover-Archive-Reading-Room.jpg|thumb|The [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives]] Reading Room. A reading room is a space at an archive where users can consult materials under staff supervision.]]
Archival research is generally more complex and time-consuming than [[secondary research]], presenting challenges in identifying, locating and interpreting relevant documents. Although archives share similar features and characteristics they can also vary in significant ways. While publicly funded archives may have mandates that require them to be as accessible as possible other kinds, such as corporate, religious, or private archives, will have varying degrees of access and discoverability.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Welch|first=Catherine|date=2000|title=The archaeology of business networks: the use of archival records in case study research|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0965254X.2000.10815560|journal=Journal of Strategic Marketing|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=197–208|doi=10.1080/0965254x.2000.10815560|issn=0965-254X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some materials may be restricted in other ways, such as on those containing [[Information sensitivity|sensitive]] or [[Classified information|classified]] information, unpublished works, or imposed by agreements with the donor of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/what-we-do/collections-access-policies#policies|title=Collections Access Policies|last=Anonymous|date=2012-04-26|work=Smithsonian Institution Archives|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/declassification/ndc/restricted-records.html|title=General Information about Restricted Records|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/publications/brochures/copyright-and-unpublished-material|title=Copyright and Unpublished Material {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, archival records are often unique, and the researcher must be prepared to travel to reach them. Even when materials are available in digital formats there may be restrictions on them that prohibit them from being accessed off-site.

=== Locating archival collections ===
Prior to online search, [[Union catalog|union catalogs]] were an important tool for finding materials in libraries and archives. In the United States, the [[National Union Catalog]] and the [[NUCMC|National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections]] have been used by researchers to locate archives although much of its information has since been migrated to online systems. 

An increasing number of archival institutions can be found via an online search. In addition, portals such as [[Europeana]], the [[Digital Public Library of America]] and the [[National Library of Australia]]'s [[Trove]] provide links to member institutions. 

In the UK, [[Jisc|JISC]] hosts the [https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/ ArchivesHub], while the [[OCLC]]'s [https://www.oclc.org/research/themes/research-collections/archivegrid.html ArchiveGrid] provides an international portal for mostly library based institutions, which use [[MARC standards|MARC]] as a cataloguing tool for their holdings. The [[Association of Canadian Archivists]] (ACA) has partnered with the software company [https://www.artefactual.com/ Artefactual] to create [http://www.archivescanada.ca/ ArchivesCanada], while the [[Australian Society of Archivists]] have used the same software for their [https://directory.archivists.org.au/ Directory of Archives in Australia]. Many other online search tools have been made available to facilitate search and discovery

If an archives cannot be found through online search or a publicly listed collection a researcher may have to track down its existence through other means, such as following other researcher's citations and references. This is particularly true for materials held by corporations or other organizations that may not employ an archivist and thus be unaware of the extent or contents of their materials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

In very restricted archives, access may be restricted only to individuals with certain credentials or affiliations with institutions like universities and then only to those of a certain level. Those lacking the necessary credentials may need to request letters of introduction from an individual or institution to provide to the archive. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28668848|title=Archival strategies and techniques|last=R.|first=Hill, Michael|date=1993|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0803948247|location=Newbury Park|oclc=28668848}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Locating materials within archives ===
Archives usually contain unique materials and their organization may also be entirely unique or idiosyncratic to the institution or organization that maintains them. This is one important distinction with libraries where material is organized according to [[Library classification|standardized classification systems]]. Traditionally, archives have followed the principle of ''[[respect des fonds]]'' in which the [[provenance]] and [[original order]] is maintained although some rearrangement, physical or intellectual, may be done by the archivist to facilitate its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/principles-of-arrangement.html|title=Archives and Records Management Resources|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scaa.usask.ca/rad/section1.htm|title=1. What are Arrangement and Description?|website=scaa.usask.ca|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Finding aid|Finding aids]] are a common reference tool created by archivists for locating materials. They come in a variety of forms, such as registers, card catalogs, or inventories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/f/finding-aid|title=finding aid {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many finding aids to archival documents are now hosted online as web pages or uploaded as documents, such as at the [[Library of Congress]]' [https://www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/findaid/findaid.html Rare Book &amp; Special Collections].  The level of detail in finding aids can vary from granular item-level descriptions to coarse collection-level descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/guides/archivedescriptions/|title=Archive Descriptions - Archives Hub|website=archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/l/level-of-description|title=level of description {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an archive has a large backlog of unprocessed materials, there may not be any kind of finding aid at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=81|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 2005, an ideology known as "[[More Product, Less Process]]", or MPLP, has been adopted by many archives seeking to reduce [[Archival processing|processing]] time or alleviate backlogs to provide access to materials sooner, the results of which may be minimally described finding aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=65-66|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most archive repositories welcome researchers, and have [[archivist|professional staff]] tasked with assisting them, the large quantity of records means that finding aids may be of only limited usefulness: the researcher will need to hunt through large quantities of documents in search of material relevant to his or her particular enquiry. Some records may be closed to public access for reasons of [[confidentiality]]; and others may be written in [[Palaeography|archaic handwriting]], in ancient or foreign languages, or in technical terminology. Archival documents were generally created for immediate practical or administrative purposes, not for the benefit of future researchers, and additional contextual research may be necessary to make sense of them. Many of these challenges are exacerbated when the records are still in the custody of the generating body or in private hands, where owners or custodians may be unwilling to provide access to external enquirers, and where finding aids may be even more rudimentary or non-existent.

=== Consulting archival materials  ===
==== On-site ====
[[File:ResearchCenterPhotoByKirstenForWebsite960pxWide.jpg|alt=View of the reading room in the Maritime Research Center showing researchers, NPS uniformed staff as well as visitors, at tables consulting archives, books, and audio materials, Reference Librarian Gina Bardi at the Reference Desk in the background.|left|thumb|Reading Room of the [https://www.nps.gov/safr/learn/historyculture/research-center.htm Maritime Research Center, San Francisco]. In the foreground, a user is seated at a table and is consulting materials stored in [[Hollinger box|archival boxes]] which are brought to them by staff.]]
Archival materials are usually held in closed stacks and non-circulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28668848|title=Archival strategies and techniques|last=R.|first=Hill, Michael|date=1993|publisher=Sage Publications|year=|isbn=0803948247|location=Newbury Park|pages=24|oclc=28668848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users request to see specific materials from the archives and may only consult them on-site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archives.library.ubc.ca/access-and-use-of-archival-materials/|title=Using the Archives {{!}} University Archives Blog|website=archives.library.ubc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.harvard.edu/collections/archive-world-music|title=Archive of World Music|website=Harvard Library|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After locating the relevant record location using a finding aid or other discovery tool a user may then have to submit the request to the archives, such as using a request form.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/military_archives/index.html|title=Military Archives - The National Institute for Defense Studies|website=www.nids.mod.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an archives has part of its holdings located in a separate building or facility, it make take days or weeks to retrieve materials, requiring a user to submit their requests in advance of an on-site consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/start/research-visit-faqs.html|title=Research Visit FAQs|date=2016-02-11|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Reading hall of the Norwegian National Archive (Gardmanahay).jpg|thumb|Reading room of the [[National Archives of Norway]]. In the foreground are [[Image scanner|flatbed scanners]]. Since archival materials are unique, some archives may have equipment available for users to duplicate materials.]]
A reading room is a space, usually within or near the archive, where users can consult archival materials under staff supervision. The unique, fragile, or sensitive nature of some materials sometimes requires the certain kinds of restrictions on their use, handling, and/or duplication. Many archives restrict what kinds of items can be brought into a reading room from outside, such as pencils, notepads, bags, and even clothing, to guard against theft or risk of damage to materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/visit-us/researching-here/can-take-reading-rooms/|title=What can I take into the reading rooms? - The National Archives|last=Archives|first=The National|work=The National Archives|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further restrictions may be placed on the number of materials that can be consulted at any given time, such as limiting a user to one box at a time and requiring all materials to be laid flat and visible at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/start/nara-regulations|title=Regulations for NARA Researchers|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some archives provide basic supplies including scrap paper and pencils or foam wedges for supporting unusually large materials.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duplication services may be available at the archive although the policies, costs, and time required can vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2004/a-survival-guide-to-archival-research|title=A Survival Guide to Archival Research: {{!}} Perspectives on History {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hoover.org/library-archives/collections/get-help/duplication-orders|title=Reproduction Orders|work=Hoover Institution|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, archives also allow users to use their own devices, such as handheld cameras, cell phones, and even scanners, to duplicate materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/dc/researcher-info|title=Information for Researchers|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some materials may contain information that concerns the [[privacy]] and [[confidentiality]] of living individuals, such as medical and student records, and demand special care. Materials that might contain [[personally identifiable information]], such as social security numbers or names, must be handled appropriately, and an archive might provide redacted copies of materials or deny access to materials entirely due to privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taube|first=Daniel O.|last2=Burkhardt|first2=Susan|date=1997|title=Ethical and Legal Risks Associated With Archival Research|url=https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327019eb0701_5|journal=Ethics &amp; Behavior|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=59–67|doi=10.1207/s15327019eb0701_5|issn=1050-8422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://snaproundtable.wordpress.com/2016/02/17/ask-an-archivist-when-to-restrict-personally-identifiable-information-pii/|title=[Ask an Archivist]: When to Restrict Personally Identifiable Information (PII)|date=2016-02-17|work=SNAP Section|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Off-site and electronic materials ====
More and more archival materials are being digitized or are born-digital enabling them to be accessed off-site through the internet or other networked services. Archives that have digital materials accessible to the public may make their holdings discoverable to internet search engines by sharing or exposing their electronic catalogs and/or metadata, using standards like the [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting|Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)]]. Some institutions have online portals where users can freely access digital materials that have been made available by the archive such as the [http://archives.nypl.org/ Archives of the New York Public Library] or the [https://siarchives.si.edu/collections Smithsonian Institution Archives]. Governments and their related institutions may use these "electronic", or "virtual", reading rooms to upload documents and materials that have been requested by the public such as through [[FOIA request|FOIA requests]] or in accordance with records disclosure policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/foia/electronic-reading-room|title=NARA Electronic Reading Room/FOIA Library|date=2016-08-31|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/OGC/Records-Reading-Room|title=Records Request Reading Room|website=Smithsonian Institution|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/management/foia-reading.htm|title=FOIA: Reading Room - Golden Gate National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barnett Freedman''' [[CBE]], [[Royal Designers for Industry|RDI]] (19 May 1901 in [[Stepney]], London &amp;ndash; 4 January 1958) was a [[British people|British]] painter, commercial designer, book illustrator, [[typographer]], and [[lithography|lithographer]].&lt;ref name=UOBbf&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/resources/rdis-at-britain-can-make-it,-1946/barnett-freedman |title=Barnett Freedman|date= |accessdate=7 November 2016|work=University of Brighton Design Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Barnett Freedman was born in the east end of London, the son of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Freedman's only formal education was at an elementary school, and from the age of nine he spent much time in hospital. This period was filled by reading and learning how to draw and to play the violin.  At the age of fifteen, he obtained work as an office boy, then turning  to draughtsmanship, initially with a monumental mason and subsequently at an architect's office. The strong interest in [[letterform]]s that grew out of this everyday work was later to stand him in good stead.  He was assiduous in attending evening classes at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], hoping to win a [[London County Council]] scholarship. Although Freedman was initially unsuccessful, [[William Rothenstein]], Principal of the [[Royal College of Art]], was impressed by his potential and used his influence to enable Freedman to be admitted to the College.&lt;ref name=UWAC&gt;{{cite web |author=Elizabeth Dooley|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/art/artist/barnettfreedman |title=Barnet Freedman|date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=8 October 2016|work=University of Warwick Art Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==Career==
After leaving the Royal College of Art in 1925, Freedman tried to earn his living as a painter. He married a fellow student, Beatrice Claudia Guercio; and, after hard times, gained an introduction to the publishers, [[Faber and Faber|Faber and Gwyer]], for whom he illustrated [[Laurence Binyon]]'s ''Wonder Night'', in the [[Ariel Poems]] series.  Barnett illustrated two further titles, [[Walter de la Mare]]’s ''News'' and "Behold This Dreamer", and [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]]’s ''Choosing a Mast'', while Claudia did sketches for de la Mare’s poem, ''A Snowdrop''. Barnett designed book jackets for the firm for twenty-five years. Nearly all were auto-lithographed on stone with hand-drawn lettering. During this period, he carried out a wide range of work for other publishers and worked extensively also on package design.

Faber gave Freedman his first major commission, an assignment to design and illustrate [[Siegfried Sassoon]]'s ''[[Memoirs of an Infantry Officer]]''.  Published in 1931, the book was the subject of controversial reviews but brought him into prominence.  Freedman had by that time become interested in the difficult medium of auto-lithography, where the artist draws his own designs on to the stones without the intervention of trade craftsmen or photomechanical means.  He had received advice from T. E. Griffits, the most influential lithographer of the time, who held sway at [[Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son]].

Following work on an annual report for the Post Office, Freedman was chosen to design the 1935 postage stamp issues to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of [[King George V]].&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frances Spalding]]|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|date=1990|title=20th Century Painters and Sculptors |ISBN=1 85149 106 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive and handsome nature of this work brought him to wider public notice. His work - which took him just a weekend&lt;ref&gt;"More war artists chosen", ''Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer'', 7 March 1940&lt;/ref&gt; - and the subsequent printing of the stamps was the subject of [[The King's Stamp]], a documentary film by the [[GPO Film Unit]]. Freedman also designed Jubilee postal orders, in various values from sixpence to £1.&lt;ref&gt;"Bigger stamps for Jubilee", ''Dundee Courier'', 24 April 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedman was now recognised as a force in autolithographic printmaking, and his down-to-earth attitude and lack of pretension made him welcome among the craftsmen at the [[Curwen Press]], the Baynard Press and Chromoworks, the leading firms in the industry.&lt;ref name="Buckman"&gt;{{cite web |author=David Buckman|url=http://spitalfieldslife.com/2013/06/02/barnett-freedman-artist/|date=2 June 2013|accessdate=7 November 2013|title=Barnett Freedman, Artist|work=Spitalfields Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Baynard Press, he also designed the ''Baynard Claudia'' typeface, which he named after his wife, Beatrice Claudia Guercio.&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Horne|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1994|title=The Dictionary of 20th Century British Book Illustrators |ISBN=1 85149 1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guercio was also an artist of some repute and had herself been commissioned to design a new GPO greetings telegram to commemorate the 1937 Coronation of George VI.&lt;ref&gt;"New Greetings Telegram Form", ''The Scotsman'', 9 June 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 he illustrated [[George Borrow]]'s ''[[Lavengro]]'' for the Limited Editions Club of New York.  By this time Freedman’s lithography had entered  a new phase, where the unique qualities of the medium were taken into a new dimension with the artist’s rainbow palette.  Freedman developed a technique whereby the black and white illustrations printed by line block simulated lithography, bringing a unity to the book.  Although ''Lavengro'' was poorly subscribed, George Macy, owner of the book club, admired Freedman's work to such an extent that he was subsequently commissioned to illustrate ''Henry IV Part One'', for the Limited Editions Club multi-volume Shakespeare.  Tolstoy's ''War and Peace'' (1938) and ''Anna Karenina'' (1951) are recognised as two of the finest examples of twentieth century book design and have ensured Freedman an honoured place in the history of book production.  For Macy's less exclusive [[Heritage Press]], Freedman illustrated Dickens's ''Oliver Twist'' (1939), Emily Brontë's ''Wuthering Heights'' (1941) and Charlotte Brontë's ''Jane Eyre'' (1942). The Bronte novels are challenging for the illustrator, and Freedman’s interpretations were regarded as among the best.

Freedman was also employed by [[Ealing Films]] to design its 'logo' and provide the publicity for feature films such as ''Johnny Frenchman'' and ''San Demetrio''.  A constant stream of commercial design work provided him with a good living.

==World War II==
[[File:The Gun (1940) (Art.IWM ART LD 391).jpg|thumb|''The Gun'' (1940) (Art.IWM ART LD391)]]
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Freedman was appointed as a full-time salaried war artist by the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] and sent to France in April 1940 to record the work of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]].&lt;ref&gt;"Two more official war artists", ''Liverpool Daily Post'' , 7 March 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; He painted a number of works there but was frustrated by a perceived lack of support, particularly transport provision. He was evacuated to England in May 1940 and worked on coastal defence subjects in [[Sheerness]] and the [[Isle of Sheppey]]. His full-time contract with WAAC ended in February 1941 after which WAAC purchased individual pieces from him but also offered him several short-term contracts with the Admiralty.&lt;ref name="Foss"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brain Foss|publisher=Yale University Press|date=2007|title=War paint: Art, War, State and Identity in Britain, 1939-1945 |ISBN=978-0-300-10890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1941, Freedman was on board [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']], and produced the painting ''15 inch Gun Turret, HMS Repulse''. At the end of 1942 he began an album of portraits of aircraft factory workers and then spent time aboard [[HMS Tribune (N76)|HMS ''Tribune'']], which resulted in another album of portraits and the painting ''Interior of a Submarine''(1943), which was briefly displayed at the [[National Gallery]] before being removed from view under wartime censorship regulations. The painting is now in the permanent collection of the [[Tate]].&lt;ref name=Sub&gt;{{cite web |author=Tate Gallery|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/freedman-interior-of-a-submarine-n05694|title=Catalogue entry,''Interior of a Submarine'' (1943)|year=|accessdate=7 November 2013|work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1944 Freedman went to Portsmouth, before travelling to France after the D-Day landings. There he recorded scenes around the landing beaches and at the invasion headquarters, but in July was taken ill and sent to hospital in Liverpool.&lt;ref name=bfIWM&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1050000809|title=War artists archive, Barnett Freedman|year=|accessdate=7 November 2013|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In post-war years, as a teacher at the [[Royal College of Art]] and the [[Ruskin School of Art]], he was regarded by many of his students as an inspiring, if unpredictable, mentor who had little regard for time-wasters.&lt;ref name="Buckman"/&gt;

The inimitable style of Freedman's book jackets drew the eye of the ‘bookshop prowlers’, as they were termed by [[Maurice Collis]], an author who realised and admired the important role that Freedman’s art played in bookshop sales. Freedman produced a stream of colourful posters and black-and-white drawings for press advertisements.  At Chromoworks he had total oversight of the production of the Lyons lithographs, a series of fine colour prints by British artists, which were displayed in the teashops of J. Lyons and Co., now regarded as a major achievement in bringing good art to 'the masses'. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who lived and worked into old age, Freedman's precarious health led to an early death, at work in his studio on 4 January 1958.

The '''California Society of Printmakers''' (CSP) is the oldest continuously operating association of printmakers and friends of printmakers in the United States. CSP is a non-profit arts organization with an international membership of print artists and supporters of the art of fine [[printmaking]]. CSP promotes professional development and opportunity for printmakers, and educates artists and the public about printmaking. New members are admitted by portfolio review. Friends and supporters of printmaking are admitted by fee. They are based in [[San Francisco]], California.

== Early history: American print clubs (printmakers societies) and California Society of Etchers (CSE)==
[[File:California Society of Printmakers 2004 logo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Logo 2004-.]]
[[American print clubs]] or printmaking societies were prolific in the 19th century. Their impetus was primarily exhibition, technical exchange, shared equipment, and the promotion of printmaking as a fine art, as opposed to a method of reproducing images. The invention of photography meant that reproduction of art works could be achieved photographically instead of through the graphic arts of etching, engraving, and lithography. Thus, these methods of printmaking were freed from their reproducing role to develop as pure fine arts. In addition to the rise of printmaking societies/clubs, individual printmaking artists also sought to distinguish their work as a fine art, as opposed to a craft. Generally these artists from the 19th century were referred to as painter-etchers.  Nineteenth century printmaking societies in the United States were the New York Etchers Club (1877), Boston Etchers Club (1880?), Philadelphia Society of Etchers (1880), Brooklyn Etchers Club (1881), Brooklyn Scratchers Club (1882), Society of American Etchers (1888), Cincinnati Etchers Club (circa 1890).

Early 20th century printmaking societies were the very influential [[Chicago Society of Etchers]] (1910), begun and promoted by [[Bertha Jaques]]. After the Chicago Society, a flurry of other printmakers' societies followed. Next was the California Society of Etchers (1912), the Los Angeles group called the Printmakers of California (1914), and the Brooklyn Society of Etchers (1915).

The California Society of Etchers (CSE) merged with Bay Printmakers Society in 1968 when the current name, California Society of Printmakers (CSP), was adopted. Throughout the 1950s and well into the 1980s short histories of the society penned by various elected officers always referred to CSE/CSP as " the second oldest" continuous operating club in the United States. However, these historians failed to mention what the oldest society was. A little research revealed that the oldest American society of printmakers was the Chicago Society of Etchers. The California Society of Etchers was very aware of its Chicago predecessor, as the Chicago founder [[Bertha Jaques]] encouraged printmakers to establish their own local societies. Jaques also joined the California Society of Etchers in 1913, when non-resident members were first admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Millman, Mary and Dave Bohn, ''Master of Line: John W. Winker, American Etcher'' (Capra Press: Santa Barbara, 1994), p. 31, note 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago Society of Etchers ceased operations in 1956, leaving California Society of Printmakers as the longest lived printmakers' society in the U.S.

== Origins of the California Society of Etchers (CSE)==

The California Society of Etchers (CSE) was founded in San Francisco in December 1912 and announced in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' on January 19, 1913  ("Etchers Form a State Organization", p.&amp;nbsp;27). Several sources cite an earlier 1911 date, such Marilyn S. Kushner's detailed chapter, "Genesis of the Twentieth-Century Print Club", although she does not cite her source. Robert B. Harshe, founder, and later first president of California Society of Etchers, leaves the founding date ambiguous in his chapter in the 1916 book, ''Art in California''. His chapter mentions the four years of the society, although the chapter itself is undated. Mary Millman and Dave Bohn's very thorough biography of John W. Winkler, cited above, supports the CSE founding date of 1912.

The founding of CSE is intimately connected with the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] (PPIE), a world’s fair held in 1915 in San Francisco to showcase the city’s recovery from the 1906 earthquake. It was Joseph Pennell, scheduled to be a juror for this event, who inspired a handful of local printmakers to launch the California Society of Etchers in preparation for that great event. Pennell, perhaps the best known American etcher, local to New York City and London, had traveled to Panama to sketch the construction of the Canal, then traveled to San Francisco where he produced a series of etchings of San Francisco, exhibiting them in 1912 in San Francisco. It is said that his presence in San Francisco achieved its purpose: encouraging local printmakers to get prepared and organized to take advantage of the promotional opportunities afforded by the upcoming San Francisco PPIE, the largest display of original art work of its time.

The four founders of the California Society of Etchers were artist colleagues: [[Robert B. Harshe]] (1879–1938), himself an etcher and then art professor at Stanford University;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/libraries/musarchives/archharshe.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706022242/http://www.artic.edu/aic/libraries/musarchives/archharshe.html# |archive-date=2008-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos|Pedro Joseph J. Lemos]] (1882–1954), then etcher and professor at the San Francisco Institute of Art (now [[San Francisco Art Institute]]);&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=4-111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gottardo Piazzoni]] (1872–1945), painter and muralist; and [[Ralph Stackpole]] (1885–1973), a sculptor, printmaker, and at that time Piazzoni's studio assistant.

The young organization began exhibiting immediately, with its first annual exhibition in April 1913 at Vickery, Atkins and Torrey Print Gallery, 550 Sutter Street, San Francisco. Its second annual exhibition was also held in 1913.

Admission of artist members to the Society was originally not by juried portfolio review, as it is today. Then the society was open to all artists, painters and sculptors alike, any artist who had experience with etching techniques.  Artist membership was expanded beyond California in 1913 to include artists throughout the United States as well as American printmakers living abroad. It is not clear when precisely CSE began accepting international printmakers, but 1964 was CSE's first major international print competition.

The primary purpose of the Society was exhibition and education, promoting printmaking as a fine art, and sharing workspace and equipment. Non-artist members, then as now, were accepted as Associate or Patron members. Membership in both artist and associate categories grew quickly. The four founding members grew to fifteen charter members, those who were members at the time of publication of the first Constitution of the CSE in 1915; among these charter members was [[Gertrude Partington Albright]].&lt;ref&gt;Hailey, Gene, ed. [https://archive.org/stream/californiaartres15hail#page/n79/mode/2up "Gertrude Partington Albright"]. ''California Art Research 15 (1937): 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925 there were 41 artist members and 107 associate members. Among the most prominent associate members were the Moore S. Achenbachs, the Sigmund Sterns, Dr. Leon Kolb, the Milton Esbergs, the Zellerbachs, [[Albert M. Bender]], and institutions such as the De Young Museum, Oakland Public Library, and the Print Club of Albany New York.

== Mid-Century==

California Society of Etchers (CSE) had enjoyed a dedicated executive secretary, Nicholas Dunphy (1896–1955), for more than 20 years, from 1932 to his death in 1955.  Understandably, Dunphy’s death created a huge hole in CSE's leadership. Nonetheless, annual membership shows continued except for the year of his death, with [[Elizabeth Ginno]] (1911–1991) becoming secretary after Dunphy's death. Ginno, Ginno's husband John W. Winkler, aka Winks (1890–1979), and Mark Luca (1918–2005), were active CSE members between 1955 and 1968, the year that CSE merged with Bay Printmakers Society to form California Society of Printmakers (CSP)

== Bay Printmakers Society==

In 1955 two graduate students from Oakland's California College of Arts and Crafts (now the [[California College of the Arts]]) were eager for exhibition opportunities.   According to [http://www.jeaneger.com  Jean Womack], former CSP historian, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080706141751/http://denverlibrary.org/about/art/strawn.html Mel Strawn] (1929–) and [http://www.oakton.edu/museum/pcpwill.html Will Petersen] (1928–1994) placed an ad in a national art magazine announcing themselves as the Bay Printmakers Society hosting a national exhibition. Work was to be sent to the address cited even though a location for the actual show had not yet been established. As the work poured in, Paul Mills, then director of the [[Oakland Museum]] of Art, provided the venue, and remained a strong supporter during the next five national exhibitions. The first exhibition was juried by John Paul Jones, respected printmaker from UCLA. The jurying took place at the home of Eldon Mills, friend of Mel Strawn, and an active supporter of Bay Printmakers; it was monitored/observed by Sabro Hasegawa, a visiting teacher from Japan at CCAC.

Charter members of the Bay Printmakers Society included artists [[Beth Van Hoesen]] (1926–2010 ), [http://www.printdealers.com/artist_template.cfm?id=1985 John Ihle] (1925–2002), [[Karl Kasten]] (1916–2010 ), [[Nathan Oliveira]] (1928–2010 ), Gordon Cook (1927–1985), Virginia Vandegrift, and art collector Eldon Mills.  Their activities were focused exclusively on the national show. Between 1955 and 1960, Bay Printmakers generally had one-person juries for their open national shows. After John Paul Jones, BPS jurors were printmaker Leonard Edmondson (1916–2002); poet [[Kenneth Patchen]] (1911–1972); and Director of the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts [[Ernst Gunter Troche]] (1909–1971).

Between 1959 and 1965 CSE created three-person jury teams for their national open, juried print exhibitions. These generally consisted of one artist member, one critic, and one museum curator. In 1959 the jurors were Ernest Freed, John Winkler, and John LaPlante. In 1960 the jurors were Doel Reed, E. Gunter Troche, and Raymond E. Lewis. Other CSE national annual jurors were: 1961 Gordon Cook; 1965 Wayne Thiebaud, Alan Lynch, and Moses Lasky.

== Merger History: California Society of Etchers Joins Bay Printmakers==

In 1968 Ginno invited Bay Printmaker member John Ihle to join CSE, probably the first dual member of both organizations.  Ginno then approached Bay Printmaker president [[Karl Kasten]], who had help create the etching studios at the new San Francisco State University campus in 1949 and then joined UC Berkeley's art department in printmaking, about the possibility of merging CSE and BPS. Kasten took up the suggestion immediately. Both organizations met at the Oakland Museum in 1968 and approved the merger, electing Kasten as the first president of the new society, which they named California Society of Printmakers. A new constitution was created, and exhibitions, education of members and the public, and publications continued.

== CSP Today==

Today, CSP  has approximately 250 artist members, 19 honorary members, and 12 associate and patron memberships. CSP publishes the annual ''California Printmaker '''Journal''''' and previously published 
the semi-annual ''California Printmaker '''Newsbrief'''''.

== Archives ==

California Society of Printmakers maintains two separate archives: one of its records, the other of prints. The California Society of Printmakers Records were given to The [[Bancroft Library]], [[University of California, Berkeley]] by the California Society of Printmakers in January 1988. Additions were made in 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2007. A finding aid to the records may be found at the [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf2g5002s7/ Online Archive of California].

A small archive of prints is maintained by CSP at a San Francisco storage facility. An inventory has not yet been created.

A '''cell phone novel''', or {{nihongo|'''mobile phone novel'''|携帯小説|keitai shousetsu|{{zh|t=手機小說|p=shŏujī xiǎoshuō}}|lead=yes}}, is a [[literary]] work originally written on a [[cellular phone]] via [[text messaging]]. This type of [[literature]] originated in Japan, where it has become a popular [[literary genre]]. However, its popularity has also spread to other [[countries]] internationally, especially to [[China]], [[United States]], [[Germany]], and [[South Africa]]. Chapters usually consist of about 70-100 words each due to character limitations on cell phones.&lt;ref name="Asahi News"&gt;[http://book.asahi.com/clip/TKY200702100253.html book.asahi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Phone novels started out primarily read and authored by young women on the subject of romantic fiction such as [[intimate relationships|relationships]], [[sexual partners|lovers]], [[rape]], [[love triangle]]s, and [[pregnancy]]. However, mobile phone novels are gaining worldwide popularity on broader subjects. Rather than appearing in printed form, the literature is typically sent directly to the reader via email, SMS text message, or subscription through an online writing and sharing website, chapter by chapter. Japanese Internet [[ethos]] regarding mobile phone novels is dominated by pen names and forged identities.  Therefore, identities of the Japanese authors of mobile phone novels are rarely disclosed.

Japanese cell phone novels were also downloaded in short installments and run on handsets as [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based mobile applications in three different formats: WMLD, JAVA and TXT. Maho i-Land is the largest Japanese cell phone novel site that carries more than a million titles, mainly novice writers, all which are available for free. Maho iLand provides templates for blogs and homepages.  It is visited 3.5 billion times each month{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.  In 2007, 98 cell phone novels were published into books.  "[[Koizora]]" is a popular phone novel with approximately 12 million views on-line, written by "Mika", that was not only published but turned into a movie.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/12/22/i-%E2%99%A5-novels newyorker.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
Five out of the ten best selling novels in Japan in 2007 were originally cell phone novels.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/world/asia/20japan.html?pagewanted=all New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The first cell phone novel was “published” in [[Japan]] in 2003 by a Tokyo man in his mid-thirties who calls himself Yoshi. His first cell phone novel was called ''[[Deep Love: The Story of Ayu|Deep Love]]'', the story of a teenager engaged in "subsidized dating" ([[Enjo kosai|enjō kosai]]) in [[Tokyo]] and contracting [[AIDS]]. It became so popular that it was published as an actual book, with 2.6 million copies sold in Japan, then spun off into a [[television series]], a [[manga]], and a [[movie]]. The cell phone novel became a hit mainly through word of mouth and gradually started to gain traction in [[Taiwan]], [[China]], and [[South Korea]] among young adults.  In Japan, several sites offer large prizes to authors (up to $100,000 US) and purchase the publishing rights to the novels.

The movement also became popular in [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[North America]]. In Europe it started in about 2007, promoted by people like Oliver Bendel and [[Wolfgang Hohlbein]], and publishers such as Cosmoblonde or Blackbetty Mobilmedia. Teenagers in South Africa have been downloading an m-novel called ''Kontax'' - a novel specifically written for mobile phones.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8329537.stm | work=BBC News | title=Mobile novels switch on S Africa | date=2009-10-28 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pioneer cell phone novel in North America, a novel called ''Secondhand Memories'' by Takatsu - that can be viewed on Textnovel,&lt;ref name="Secondhand Memories"&gt;[http://www.textnovel.com textnovel.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the first English language cell phone novel site founded in the United States - has been viewed more than 60,000 times and published in print in 2015 as a paperback.

== Reason for popularity ==

Although Japan was the original birthplace of the cell phone novel, the phenomenon soon moved to other parts of [[East Asia]], and many of the online writers are university students. These writers understand what narratives will attract young readers, incorporating emergent events or trendy elements from teen culture into their stories.

Cell phone novels create a [[virtual world]] for teenagers via the mobile phone, or, more precisely, via [[text messages]]. As in virtual online [[video game]]s, readers can put themselves into first person in the story. Cell phone novels create a personal space for each individual reader. As Paul Levinson wrote in ''Cellphone'', "nowadays, a writer can write just about as easily, anywhere, as a reader can read" (p 20).

The [[cell phone]] novel is changing reading habits; readers no longer need to physically go to a bookshop and purchase a book. They can go online using their cell phone, download a novel, and read it on their personal mobile phone anywhere, any time they wish. Similar to the [[e-book]], its mobility and convenience saves time.

== Characteristics and literary style ==
Because of the short chapter format consisting of around 70-100 words (usually fewer than 200), the phenomenon has brought a new approach to literature, allowing a new vision to potentially redefine traditional writing and the publishing world. Despite the use of cell phones, most of these novels are not written with SMS slang and language. Instead, it has brought out a new era of minimalism and art. In each chapter, readers will be able to experience narration, poetry and even visual arts in the use of carefully chosen line breaks, punctuation, rhythm and white space.

Often, cell phone novels features the use of fragments, conversational, simple and delicate language; cliffhangers and dramatic dialogue emphasized by the unseen or omitted becomes a vital part of the reading experience, allowing deeper meanings and interpretations to unfold. Because of the use of poetic language, mood, emotions and internal thoughts are stimulated in the reader easily. Dramatic and drastic plots takes readers through twists and turns, cliffhanger after cliffhanger, always keeping the reader waiting for the next chapter instalment.

The nature of writing and reading on the go, creates a unique experience, allowing the writer and reader to approach literature in a different way, opening interactivity between the readers and the writer as the story develops in "real time".

'''Ciudad Vieja''' ({{IPA-es|θjuˈðað ˈβjexa}}, ''Old City'') is the name of the oldest part of the [[city]] of [[Montevideo]], capital city of [[Uruguay]]. Nowadays, Ciudad Vieja is a ''[[barrio]]'' (neighbourhood or district) of this city. In the last couple of years it has gone through a major transformation that has made it the main nightlife centre in town. It is in this area where most of the [[nightclubs]] are, and also it hosts the 'Mercado del Puerto' a traditional venue for Uruguayan food and beverages. The main port of Uruguay (being the main Big Draft port in southern South America) is located in Ciudad Vieja.

Part of this transformation is due to the campaign made by the [[Municipal Intendent of Montevideo|mayor]] since this part of the city had been in a state of abandonment for decades.

== Early history ==

Until 1829 it was surrounded by a wall that protected it from possible invasions. After the wall was torn down, the only part of it that was kept was its [[Ciudadela, Montevideo|gateway]], which is up to this day an [[emblem]] of this part of town. Some streets remind the presence of the wall, like Ciudadela (''[[citadel]]'') or [[Brecha (street)|Brecha]] (''breach''), which has this name because it was near but at this point that the British managed to open a breach on the wall during the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata#Second invasion - 1807|1807 British invasion]]. The old street Sarandí was turned into a pedestrian walkway in 1992, which increased its commercial and tourist attractiveness. In 2005 it was extended to beyond the [[Constitution Square (Montevideo)|Constitution Square]].

Ciudad Vieja has the most beautiful buildings from the colonial era and the first decades of independence. The [[Montevideo Cabildo|Cabildo]] (built between 1804 and 1812), the [[Solís Theatre]], the [[Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] and several museums, like the [[Museo Torres García]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torresgarcia.org.uy Torres Garcia Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; are among the most impressive ones. Also several design shops and recycled loft floors flourish in the streets near the port.

== Places of worship ==
Several temples have been built in the historic heart of the city:
* [[Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, St. Philip and St. James]] (head of the Roman Catholic Church in Uruguay) 
* [[Parroquia San Francisco de Asís, Montevideo|Parish Church of St. Francis of Assisi]] (Roman Catholic)
* [[Nuestra Señora de Lourdes y San Vicente Pallotti, Montevideo|Church of Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Vincent Pallotti]] (Roman Catholic, [[Pallottines]])
* [[Capilla de la Caridad del Hospital Maciel, Montevideo|Charity Chapel, Maciel Hospital]] (Roman Catholic, Hospitaller Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus)
* [[Cathedral of The Most Holy Trinity, Montevideo|Cathedral of The Most Holy Trinity]], popularly known as the English Temple ([[Anglican]])
* [[Comunidad Israelita Sefaradí, Montevideo|Sephardic Jewish Community]] (Synagogue)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismojudaico.com/contenidos/Uruguay/Montevideo/Para-Visitar/Templos Jewish Tourism in Uruguay - Temples]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government and infrastructure ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Creative Partnerships''' was the UK government's flagship creative learning programme, established in 2002 as part of the Council's SR2000 settlement to develop young people's creativity through artists' engagement with schools in nominated areas across England. Following the 2010 election of the coalition government, funding was cut by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Arts Council England in 2011, with activity in schools ending in summer 2011.

==Aim==
It aimed to build sustainable learning partnerships between schools, creative and cultural organisations and individuals.

==Methods==
Creative Partnerships facilitated many long-term links between schools and creative professionals, such as artists, architects, scientists and multimedia developers. Research reports covering many different aspects of the programme, conducted by researchers from a number of universities and consultancies, are available online. Reports include literature reviews about creativity and education, teacher identity, pupil wellbeing and tracking progression in creativity; evaluations and surveys of the programme; and qualitative research investigating pedagogy, wellbeing and progression.  https://archive.is/20131017205459/http://www.creativitycultureeducation.org/tag/research

== Who delivered Creative Partnerships? ==
Between 2002 - 2009, local Arts Council offices delivered the programme in 36 areas of England. Peter Jenkinson OBE was the first national director of the programme and he was succeeded by Paul Collard. 
Between 2009 - 2011, responsibility for Creative Partnership was transferred to [[Creativity, Culture and Education]].  Creativity, Culture and Education, chaired by Paul Roberts with Paul Collard as CEO, funded 25 organisations to deliver Creative Partnerships in their local area. These were a range of independent and ‘host’ cultural organisations, with many of the individuals working there transferring from Arts Council England.

==Funding==
The organisation was managed by [[Arts Council England]] and funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with additional funding from the Department for Education. It was finally managed by [[Creativity, Culture and Education]] (CCE).

'''François Zourabichvili''' (1965 – 19 April 2006) was a French philosopher specialized in the works of [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]].

==Biography==
François Zourabichvili was the son of composer [[Nicolas Zourabichvili]], nephew of historian [[Hélène Carrère d'Encausse]], and cousin of author [[Emmanuel Carrère]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Carrère. (2007). ''Un roman russe''. Paris: Pol.&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[agrégé]] in 1989 and earned his [[PhD]] in Philosophy in 1999. He taught at a [[lycee]] already from 1988 to 2001, was docent at [[Paul Valéry University, Montpellier III]], and a director at the [[Collège international de philosophie]] from 1998 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inmanencia.com/2010/07/vertiges-de-spinoza-tumba-para.html &amp;#91;Vertiges de Spinoza&amp;#93;: Tumba para ZOURABICHVILI"], ''Inmanencia'', Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He committed suicide in 2006 and is buried in the Russian Church of the Holy Trinity in Paris (XVIe arrondissement).

A year after Zourabichvili's death, the Collège international de philosophie and the [[École normale supérieure]] organized a colloquium upon ''Les physiques de la pensée selon François Zourabichvili'' ("The physics of the thinking according to François Zourabichvili") led by [[Bruno Clément]] and [[Frédéric Worms]]. The event took place with the participation of [[Pierre Macherey]], [[Pierre-François Moreau]], [[Pierre Zaoui]], [[Paola Marrati]], [[Paul R. Patton]], [[Paolo Godani]] and [[Marie-France Badie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://revue-klesis.org/pdf/EDITO-FZ-1.pdf EDITO-FZ-1], Klesis Revue Philosophique, Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ciepfc.rhapsodyk.net/article.php3?id_article=129 Les physiques de la pensée selon François Zourabichvili"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324044207/http://ciepfc.rhapsodyk.net/article.php3?id_article=129 |date=2008-03-24 }}, ''RhapSodyK'', Retrieved 24 March 2008 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
François Zourabichvili worked primarily on the concepts of "''event''" and "''littéralité''", inspired by the philosophy of Deleuze.
In addition, he wrote about [[aesthetics]], a discipline in which he centered his interest for the purpose of finding relations between [[art]] and [[game]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actu-philosophia.com/spip.php?article354 François Zourabichvili : La littéralité et autres essais sur l’art.], ''ACTU PHILOSOPHIA'', Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published some articles about the films of [[Boris Barnet]] and [[Dziga Vertov]].

'''''Funky Bones''''' is a public artwork by [[Atelier Van Lieshout]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist collective led by [[Joep van Lieshout]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], which is on the grounds of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]].  The artwork, primarily made from [[fiberglass]], consists of twenty white and black [[bone]]-shaped benches.

==Description==
''Funky Bones'' is situated in the Meadow region just south of the lake at 100 Acres.  It is a site-specific artwork consisting of twenty white bone-shaped benches inscribed with black drawings of bones that together form a large stylized human [[skeleton]]. The artwork was constructed primarily from fiberglass, [[plywood]], and [[concrete]]. Each bench is a fiberglass shell filled with a lightweight foam material. The fiberglass surface has been impregnated with pigment, carved, and coated in polyester resin. Plywood was used only during the detailing process of the black bone segments and is not visible in the completed artwork. The concrete component for this artwork is not visible but rather serves as a structural aid, anchoring and securing the individual benches into the ground. A standard [[ready-mix concrete]] was used for this application.

The skeleton is positioned with its arms spread out horizontally while the legs point straight down.  The individual benches range in both length and width, but all are approximately 26'' in height.  The artwork was fabricated in Atelier Van Lieshout's studio in [[Rotterdam]] and shipped to the Indianapolis Museum of Art where it was installed by the design and installation crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funky Bones|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/100acres/artists/ateliervanlieshout|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
''Funky Bones'' was installed at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in May 2010 and is currently on temporary loan.&lt;ref name="Sheets"/&gt; The artwork arose from many disparate interests of Joep van Lieshout, the founder and head designer of AVL. These include [[human anatomy]] &lt;ref name="Schengen"&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Acres Sculpture Park in Indianapolis|publisher=Schengen Visas Organization|url=http://www.schengenvisas.org/2011/07/100-acres-sculpture-park-in-indianapolis/|accessdate=28 Aug 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331185139/http://www.schengenvisas.org/2011/07/100-acres-sculpture-park-in-indianapolis/|archivedate=2012-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of the site. Concerning the original concept and inspiration behind ''Funky Bones'', Joep van Lieshout stated:

{{quote|I came up with [this] design that is not only a site specific artwork referring to the history of the continent, but also provides a function and will improve the stay of the park's visitors.  Even as a child I knew the state Indiana and Indianapolis as an exotic place where the 'Indians' came from and were living, and even though this is not true, it is important for my proposition.  Another field of interest is the history of art and especially in early developments of art from primitive and native cultures.  In early art forms, techniques and skills were not so developed and the artworks were made in a very basic way, therefore art had a direct relation to the people, its time and environment.  Native American art, design, and architecture produced beautiful artifacts, religion, and lifestyle, but after the appearance of the 'more advanced' culture from the east the original inhabitants were moved around and dispersed.  The very few things that remained are their cultural heritage and artifacts scattered around.  At this time of rapid production and consumption, their primitive lifestyle, close to nature, seems to become a necessary utopia.  The dislocated Funky Bone benches installed in the park stand symbolic for the leftovers of their sold culture and the spread of Native Americans over the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Nicole|author2=Richard McCoy|title=The Outdoor Sculptures of 100 Acres: A Report for the Objects and Variable Art Laboratory at the Indianapolis Museum of Art|journal=Indianapolis Museum of Art|year=2011|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to resonating with the location's history, ''Funky Bones'' also has the functional purpose of providing an ideal spot for visitors to sit, [[picnic]], lounge, or climb.&lt;ref name="Sheets"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joep van Lieshout observed visitors sitting on rocks during visits to the site, and decided to provide them with more comfortable seating arrangements in order to facilitate interaction, both among viewers as well as between viewer and art.&lt;ref name="fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Funky Bones, Atelier Van Lieshout|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|url=http://www.resnicowschroeder.com/rsa/upload/PM/493_Filename_Art%20Nature%20Park%20Fact%20Sheet_Atelier%20Van%20Leishout.pdf|accessdate=25 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This degree of interactivity, and even fun, makes ''Funky Bones'' extremely child-friendly.&lt;ref name="Wiltrout"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiltrout|first=Nicole|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art's 100 Acres|publisher=Indiana Insider|date=19 Jul 2011|url=http://www.in.gov/visitindiana/blog/index.php/2011/07/19/indianapolis-museum-of-arts-100-acres/|accessdate=5 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
Atelier Van Lieshout (AVL) is a multidisciplinary company that operates internationally in the field of contemporary art, design, and architecture.  Joep van Lieshout (born 1963), founder of AVL, is a Dutch artist born in Ravenstein, The Netherlands.  He received his formal education and training from the Academy of Modern Art in Rotterdam (1980–1985), [[Ateliers '63]] in Haarlem (1985-1987), and from the [[Villa Arson]] in Nice, France (1987).  Joep van Lieshout formed the AVL studio group in 1995 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where the company continues to design and fabricate their widely exhibited works.  Atelier Van Lieshout has attained international recognition for objects-based projects that balance on the boundary between art, architecture and design.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  Recurring themes in the work of AVL include self-sufficiency, power, politics, and the more classical themes of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atelier Van Lieshout webpage|publisher=Atelier Van Lieshout|url=http://www.ateliervanlieshout.com/|accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name Atelier Van Lieshout emphasizes the fact that, although Joep van Lieshout founded and leads the collective, the work produced stems from the creative impulses of the entire team.&lt;ref name="Benda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atelier Van Lieshout|publisher=Friedman Benda|url=http://www.friedmanbenda.com/artists/atelier-van-lieshout/bio/|accessdate=28 Aug 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127053738/http://www.friedmanbenda.com/artists/atelier-van-lieshout/bio/|archivedate=2011-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Funky Bones,'' AVL's most relevant recurring themes are domestication, politics, complex functioning systems, and the re-contextualization of familiar, domestic objects.  The Atelier van Lieshout claims to make no distinction between "real artworks" and "just building something for someone."&lt;ref name="Dellinger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dellinger|first=Jade|author2=Hester Schaaf|title=FAQ's about the Atelier Van Lieshout|journal=REVEALED!!! STAFF TELLS ALL ...|year=1998|pages=31|publisher=Nicoline Gatehouse|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The studio group focuses on creating artworks whose design principles challenge conventional ideas of utility and functionality by reinventing how the viewer perceives or approaches an object and the environment in which it is placed.  This is achieved by the implementation of  non-traditional materials and color palettes, odd or unusual subject matter, and through the strategic positioning or locale of the artwork.&lt;ref name="Dellinger"/&gt; ''Funky Bones'' is impossible to see in its entirety except at a distance, preferably from above. Moving close enough to actually interact with it produces an entirely different perspective.&lt;ref name="Schengen"/&gt;

==Condition==
In general, the bones require regular cleaning in order to maintain their white color. Instrumental analysis involving the artwork's color and gloss levels has been recorded for future reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Nicole|title=Art, Color, and Gloss|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/blog/2011/07/13/art-color-and-gloss/|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the book ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]'', by Indianapolis-based author [[John Green (author)|John Green]], the sculpture is the location of a romantic picnic, having been picked by one of the characters as being the most Dutch place in Indianapolis. ''Funky Bones'' was recreated in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] for the film adaptation of ''The Fault in Our Stars''. The recreation was built by set designers, with help from the artist and Sarah Urist Green, wife of John Green, and former Curator of Contemporary Art at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=John|title=Question Tuesday: The Fault in Our Stars Movie Edition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_731GRjCCI|work=vlogbrothers YouTube Channel|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2856">[[File:Get Up and Bar the Door. illustration by Alexander George Fraser.tiff|right|thumb|235 px|Illustration by [[Alexander George Fraser]] of  ''Get Up and Bar the Door'']]

'''Get Up and Bar the Door''' is a [[medieval]] [[Scots language|Scots]] ballad about a battle of wills between a husband and wife. It is [[Child ballad]] 275. According to Child, it was first published by David Herd.&lt;ref&gt;Herd, David (1732-1810):  ''Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs, Heroic Ballads etc.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
 [[File:Get Up and Bar the Door. by Arthur Rackham.png|right|thumb|235 px|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] of &lt;br&gt;''Get Up and Bar the Door'']]

The song begins with the wife busy in her cooking and other [[House work|chores]]. As the wind picks up, the husband tells her to close and bar the door. They make a pact that the next person who speaks must bar the door, and the door remains open. At midnight two thieves enter the house and eat the [[puddings]] that the wife has just made. The husband and wife watch them, but still neither speaks out of stubborn [[pride]]. Amazed, one of the thieves proposes to molest the wife.  Finally, the husband shouts "Will ye kiss my wife before my een, and scad me wi pudding bree?" The wife, having won the pact, tells the husband, "Goodman, you've spoken the foremost word; Get up and bar the door."

In some versions, the husband is named as Johnie Blunt of Crawford Moor.&lt;ref&gt;Child Vol. VIII p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Child notes that the song was used by Prince Hoare to provide one of the principal scenes in his musical entertainment, ''No Song, No Supper'', performed at Drury Lane in 1790.

Among many things, this folk ballad talks about the sense of lasting competition in a relationship. The man tries to maintain his power but the woman refuses because she does not want to be treated like a doormat; each is too stubborn to do something that will benefit both. The ballad makes the point that being stubborn can be carried to ludicrous lengths, since by being stubborn they lost their Martinmas puddings and left their persons and household open to crime.{{or|date=April 2008}}

==Recordings==
* [[Martin Carthy]] - ''Shearwater'' (as "John Blunt")
* [[Ewan MacColl]] sang it on "The English and Scottish Popular Ballads (The Child Ballads) Volume I" (1956)
* [[Maddy Prior]] and [[June Tabor]] sang a version on "No More to the Dance" as "The Barring o' the Door" (1988)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3594">The '''Institute of Conservation''' ('''Icon''') is a charity and the professional body for [[Conservator-restorer|conservators and restorers]] in the United Kingdom. It has over three thousand members, including [[Conservator-restorer|professional conservators]] working with heritage objects and [[Architectural conservation|buildings]]. 

==Background==
Icon was formed in 2005 as a result of a merger between five smaller bodies: The United Kingdom Institute for Conservation, The Institute of Paper Conservation, The Scottish Society for Conservation and Restoration, the Photographic Materials Conservation Group and the Care of Collections Forum. These five organisations were known collectively as the 'Vanguard Bodies' of the National Council for Conservation-Restoration (NCCR). In 2006 a sixth organisation, the Institute of Conservation Science, which had not been part of the NCCR, merged into Icon.

Seven other bodies which were also members of the NCCR opted not to merge into Icon in 2005.  These were:
* The British Antique Furniture Restorer's Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafra.org.uk|title=Home - British Antique Furniture Restorers' Association|work=British Antique Furniture Restorers' Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The British Association of Paintings Conservator-Restorers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bapcr.org.uk|title=BAPCR Home|work=bapcr.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two Irish bodies, the Irish Professional Conservators &amp; Restorers Association (IPCRA) and The Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works in Ireland (ICHAWI) - which merged in 2013 into the Institute of Conservators-Restorers in Ireland (ICRI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icriconservation.ie/about-us/background|title=Home - Institute of Conservator-Restorers in Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three 'hybrid' bodies, combining conservators and non-conservators in their membership - [[Natural Sciences Collections Association|NatSCA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natsca.org/|title=Natural Sciences Collections Association|work=natsca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BHI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhi.co.uk/|title=British Horological Institute|work=bhi.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Society of Archivists]] which merged into the [[Archives and Records Association]] in 2010.

==Activities==
* Icon is a member of the National Heritage Science Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/member-institutions.php|title=National Heritage Science Forum - Home|work=heritagescienceforum.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Icon operates a professional  [[accreditation]] scheme for suitably trained and qualified professionals in [[conservation and restoration]] called PACR (Professional Accreditation of Conservator-Restorers.) 
* Icon operates the Conservation register&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationregister.com|title=The Conservation Register|work=conservationregister.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of practices with an accredited employee in the UK or Ireland
* Icon was formerly a member of the [[European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers' Organisations]], but withdrew in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iiconservation.org/archive/www.iiconservation.org/news/index153d.html?p=106|title=International Conservation News  » Blog Archive   » Icon withdraws from ECCO|work=iiconservation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inwangjesaekdo''' ("Clearing After Rain in Mt. Inwangsan" or "After Rain at Mt. Inwang") is a landscape painting by the famous [[Jeong Seon]]. It was painted during the reign of [[Joseon Dynasty]] [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]] in 1751, at his birthplace in [[Cheongun-dong]] at [[Jongno District]], modern-day [[Seoul]].  It was designated by the South Korean government as the 216th [[National treasures of Korea|National Treasure of Korea]] on August 6, 1984.  The painting is currently held and managed by the [[Ho-Am Art Museum]] in [[Yongin]], [[Gyeonggi-do|Gyeonggi Province]] and is owned by [[Lee Kun-hee]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="796">'''Lament of dying man''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Skarga umierającego'') is an anonymous [[medieval]] [[Polish literature|Polish]] poem dating from the year 1463. The text represents the [[eschatology|eschatological]] literature popular in [[High Middle Ages]] and describes torments a sinful moribund has facing his approaching death. His sufferings are the ones  ascribed by [[Ars moriendi]] to a person on his deathbed. Having confessed his sins, the moribund receives divine consolation and feels ready to call a priest, who would provide him [[last rites]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22171">The '''100 Books of the Century''' ({{lang-fr|Les cent livres du siècle}}) is a list of the one hundred best books of the 20th century, according to a poll conducted in the spring of 1999 by the French retailer [[Fnac]] and the Paris newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]''.

Starting from a preliminary list of 200 titles created by bookshops and journalists, 17,000 French voters responded to the question, "Which books have remained in your memory?" (''Quels livres sont restés dans votre mémoire ?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=46796 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527083227/http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=46796 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 May 2012 |title=Écrivains et choix sentimentaux |trans-title=Authors and sentimental choices |first=Josyane |last=Savigneau |author-link=Josyane Savigneau |newspaper=Le Monde |language=French |date=15 October 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of acclaimed titles mixes great novels with poetry and theatre, as well as the [[Asterix the Gaul |Asterix]] comic book. The list includes many [[French novels]] because of the demographics of the surveyed group. However, similar lists by English language sources include US and UK authors only (for example, the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels]] published in 1998, with two lists, one by the Board of the Modern Library and the other by readers who responded).

The '''Marinko Sudac Collection''', based in [[Zagreb]], Croatia, has been created with a clear collecting strategy based on the region of [[Central and Eastern Europe]], additionally spanning from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] area to the [[Black Sea]]. The guiding principle of the Collection is systematic exploration, researching, and promotion of the [[avant-garde]] practices which have been marginalized, forbidden, and at times completely negated due to the historical, social and political circumstances. In this context, the Marinko Sudac Collection gives the most complete and comprehensive overview on the art of this region. The Collection starts at 1909, and it show the continuity from the first Avant-Gardes, through [[neo-avant-garde]] and [[New Artistic Practice]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, ending with the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]]. The global uniqueness of the Marinko Sudac Collection is also seen in the kind of media it contains.  It contains not only traditional artworks, such as paintings, sculptures, and photographs, but it gives equal importance to documentary and archival material. Great importance is put on these almost forgotten media, which enable research of specific phenomena, artists and the socio-political situation which affected this type of art. The Collection contains a great number of museological units, and it treats the documentary and archival material on the same level as traditional artworks. By examining the units contained in the Marinko Sudac Collection, one can read not only the art scene or the art production of a certain artist, but the full status of the society, the socio-political atmosphere of the region in which this art was created in.

This Collection is not merely a process of gathering artworks, but a contextualisation of the art of region in the global history of art and an effort of putting it on its deserved place in history. The aim of the Marinko Sudac Collection is to preserve the cultural heritage of the Central and Eastern European region from globalisation, by maintaining it in a contextual unity. The end goal is to place the Collection in an architectural, physical building of the Museum of Avant-Garde, in which this art will be valorised, museologically processed, open to researchers and experts, and presented to the public. A part of the works from the Marinko Sudac Collection is available in digital form on an innovative platform of the [[Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde]] (www.avantgarde-museum.com/en), which unites the work of the Virtual Museum of the Avant-Garde, the Marinko Sudac Collection, and the [[Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde]], with a goal to form a central database for the researching of the phenomena of the Avant-Garde.

Alongside more than 80 already accomplished successful collaborations with museum institutions and independently organized exhibition in great museum centres such as [[Tate Modern]], London; [[Ludwig Museum]], Budapest, [[Haus der Kunst]], Munich; [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe|ZKM]], Karlsruhe, [[Deutsches Filmmuseum Frankfurt]], [[Museum of Modern Art]], Warsaw, [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb|Museum of Contemporary Art]], Zagreb,... or exhibition of the Collection in unofficial places such as Marshall [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s boat ''Seagull'' (''At Standstill'' exhibition, Rijeka, 2011), Marinko Sudac is also an editor of numerous publications – art monographs, exhibition catalogues and collections of texts, and an author of a successful artist residence project ''Artist on Vacation,'' held annually since 2012, which hosted over 50 of the leading world artists which continue the tradition of the Avant-Garde.

== Collection strategy ==
The Collection's interest extends from the Baltic area to the Black Sea, with particular emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. The collector's strategy is directed towards systematic exploration, research, and promotion of Avant-Garde practices that have been marginalized, forbidden, and at times completely rejected, due to historical, social and political circumstances. In this respect, the Collection is, in relation to already existing European art collections, regionally cohesive, and presents an inexhaustible resource for the research of Avant-Garde art and a dynamic platform for the exchange of knowledge on the phenomenon of Avant-Garde. This can be seen in numerous topical and retrospective exhibitions, organized events, followed by connected detailed publications or studies, articles in professional journals, some published in the framework of research projects and collaborations with numerous important institutions, experts, theoreticians, art historians, and artists from the entire world.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Museum of Avantgarde ==
The Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde, based on the Marinko Sudac Collection, was created in 2009. It presents the digital database of the Collection through which you can see the overview of Avant-Garde art in the countries of former Yugoslavia structured according to authors, artworks, time periods, and geographical areas, as well as links and influences of the artists with cultural happenings and artistic centres in the region and the world. The website, beside the high-quality digitized artworks, contains biographies and bibliographies, alongside the connection of the artists with other artists, art institutions and cultural forums, as well as selected publications.

The online database show only a small part of the Collection. Speedy digitization of the material is crucial to accomplish the Museum's main aim, which is to make it a centre for information on the regional Avant-Garde practices.

The Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde is a free online platform to research all forms of Avant-Garde art of Eastern and Central Europe, to show connection with the rest of the world, to be a place for free thought and making realisations on the relevant cultural phenomena of Avant-Garde thought and artistic doing, to be a space for creating and publishing expert materials and research on the phenomena of the Avant-Garde. In its work, the Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde managed to become a meeting point of experts and intellectuals from the region and the artists, as well as interested public who can, in one place, find many information on the Avant-Garde movement in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avantgarde-museum.com/en/museum/about-us/museum-of-avantgarde/|title=Avantgarde Museum|website=avantgarde-museum.com|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international Board is made up of leading theoreticians and art historians: Lutz Becker, Jerko Denegri, Živko Grozdanić, Matko Meštrović, Želimir Koščević, Irina Subotić, Feđa Vukić, and Laszlo Beke. The director is Branko Franceschi.

== Projects ==
Since its beginning, the Marinko Sudac Collection has been open to collaboration with various institutions. Through the years, the works from the Collection have been exhibited both locally and internationally.

The Collection has been recognised as a good partner and the growing interest in different types of collaborations (exhibitions, conferences, projects, movies, publications) shows the quality of the Collections and its open character.

== Publications ==
As part of its activities, the interconnected institutions of the Museum of Avant-Garde, Marinko Sudac Collection, and the Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde publish various types of publications – artist monographies, exhibition catalogues etc.

The aim of these publishing projects is to present relevant artists, artist groups, artistic movements and developments of the former Yugoslavia region, as well as of Eastern and Central Europe. By presenting them through publications, the aim is to provide them with better international recognition and valorisations, so they could be placed in their rightful position in the global art scene.

== Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde ==
The Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde was created in 2010 as part of the project which has as its goal to research, preserve, present and popularize regional historical Avant-Gardes. The Institute brings together the work of the Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde and the Marinko Sudac Collection. The Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde's task is to create the work and development strategy of the Museum of Avant-Garde, make projects which promote Avant-Garde art and publish materials on the topic.

=== Artist on Vacation ===
Since 2012, the Artist on Vacation project has gathered, hosted and presented to the public a number of internationally prestigious artists who belong to the period of historical Avant-gardes, as well as artists who continue the practice of radical art and further develop its aesthetics. In the summer months, Poreč becomes a vacation spot for international artists. In collaboration with Valamar Riviera d.d., the Institute for the Research of Avant-Garde and Marinko Sudac Collection invite artists to spend a week at an exclusive hotel and vacation on the beautiful Istrian peninsula.

The project was created by Marinko Sudac as an extension of the activities of the Museum of Avant-Garde, the Institute for the Research of Avant-Garde and Marinko Sudac Collection. It complements the Collection's mission, and gives affirmation to the artists in the social, cultural and artistic contexts. The mission of the Artists on Vacation project is to show the various legacies of the original Avant-Garde movement that have developed in different countries and contexts.

The entire driving force behind our project is to present the participating artists to the Croatian public. The project is an effort to connect all the activities that aim to bring together the historical Avant-Gardes and present them to the public in a direct way, outside of an institutional environment. Artists get an opportunity to meet other artists, but also theorists, art historians, and museum professionals. This exchange of ideas and influences brings about personal and artistic developments and paves way to new collaborations and projects.  Every year, there is an exclusive one day exhibition organized during the Project.

Each year, at the end of the Project, an exhibition of works created during the Artist on Vacation project, as well as a presentation of the participating artists is organized at the Museum of Contemporary Art Zagreb. A catalogue of a year's project is produced. The catalogue contains all the information about the project, the participating artists, their stay at Poreč, their works etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avantgarde-museum.com/en/museum/about-us/institute-for-the-research-of-the-avant-garde/|title=Avantgarde Museum|website=avantgarde-museum.com|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marionette''' is a 90-minutes non-verbal breakdancing performance, created and performed by a [[South Korea]]n breakdancing group [[Expression (crew)|Expression]]. The name Marionette comes from the French word [[marionette]], a type of puppet moved by using strings. Like the name suggest, the show Marionette features the performers imitating and dancing as a puppeteer and his puppets.

==International Success==
Marionette was first performed in South Korea, early 2006, at Korean Lotte Theme Park. When it was first premiered, it brought international attention. Many countries invited Expression to perform Marionette, and Expression soon began a world Marionette tour. This international success also brought people's attention within Korea. The fact that the movie file of the Marionette was available for a free download in Expression's website, and the fact [[Lee Woo Sung]] put the movie of Marionette at the famous site [[YouTube]] also helped to spread the word around both within and outside South Korea.

==Remake as a Stage Show==
Later 2006, Expression re-worked Marionette into a [[Marionette (musical)|90-minutes stage show]] with the same name and same themes. The musical enjoyed the explosive success that the original Marionette received. and This show re-performing At seoul from 2007.

[[File:Antoon Sallaert - Mythological Scene with Apollo, Fame, and the Muses.jpg|thumb|330px|''Mythological scene with Apollo, Fame, and the Muses'' by [[Antoine Sallaert]]]]

'''Monotyping''' is a type of [[printmaking]] made by [[drawing]] or [[painting]] on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or [[matrix (printing)|matrix]], was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to [[acrylic glass]].  The image is then transferred onto a sheet of [[paper]] by pressing the two together, usually using a [[printing-press]]. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using [[brush]]es or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque colour. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.

Monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype; most of the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior.
These prints from the original plate are called "ghost prints." A print made by pressing a new print onto another surface, effectively making the print into a plate, is called a "cognate". [[Stencil]]s, [[watercolor]], [[solvent]]s, [[brushes]], and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes can be spontaneously executed and with no previous [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]].

==History==
[[Image:Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione 002.jpg|thumb|left|Monotype by Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, probably a second impression]]
There is still no certainty as to who was the inventor of the monotype process. The Italian artist [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]] (1609–64) is often credited as being the first artist to produce monotypes.  He made brushed sketches intended as finished and final works of art.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;Prints and Printmaking, Antony Griffiths, British Museum Press (in UK), 2nd ed., 1996 {{ISBN|0-7141-2608-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to make monotypes in the mid 1640s, normally working from black to white, and produced over twenty surviving ones, over half of which are set at night.  It is believed that the Flemish artist [[Antoine Sallaert]] created his first monotypes in the early 1640s and is therefore to be regarded as the inventor of this printing process.  Both artists used the new technique in different ways.  Castiglione created most of his monotypes as black-field images by wiping away ink on a prepared plate thus producing white and grey lines.  Sallaert, on the other hand, brushed bold, tapering lines onto the printing surface with meticulous precision.  It is likely that Sallaert's monotype style was influenced by the [[chiaroscuro]] woodcuts of the Dutch engraver [[Hendrik Goltzius]].  Sallaert found in the monotype a technique which was the closest to drawing and oil sketching. His monotypes and drawings are characterised by swelling lines and tapering ends.  He often added by hand white highlights to his monotypes.&lt;ref name=todd&gt;Todd D. Weyman, ''Two Early Monotypes by Sallaert'', in: Print Quarterly Vol. 12, No. 2 (JUNE 1995), p. 164-169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Royalton Kisch, ''A Monotype by Sallaert'', in: Print Quarterly, 1988, V, n. 1, p. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;  Sallaert clearly appreciated in the monotype technique the freedom to design on a plate before printing it on paper.&lt;ref name=clev&gt;[http://www.clevelandart.org/about/press/media-kit/cleveland-museum-art-presents-monotypes-painterly-prints Kelley Notaro, ''An Exhibition of the Finest Monotypes from the Cleveland Museum of Art's Collection''] at The Cleveland Museum of Art site&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Visions of the Daughters of Albion copy G plate 11.jpg|thumb|''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'', a combination by Blake of [[relief etching]] for the lines and monotype for the colour]]
[[William Blake]] developed a different technique, painting on [[millboard]] in [[egg tempera]] to produce both new works and coloured impressions of his prints and book illustrations, including his [[Pity (William Blake)|''Pity'']].  Each impression was usually then worked over by hand, using ink and watercolour.  Few other artists used the technique until [[Degas]], who made several, often working on them further after printing ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070224100213/http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true  Beside the Sea, 1876-7]); [[Pissarro]] also made several.   [[Paul Gauguin]] used a variant technique involving tracing, later taken up by [[Paul Klee]]. In the twentieth century the technique became more popular, such as the extraordinary colorful monotypes created by Marc Chagall in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;''Marc Chagall Monotypes'', Gerald Cramer, Editor, Geneva 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparing monotypes to monoprints==
Historically, the terms ''monotype'' and ''[[Monoprinting|monoprint]]'' were often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Singular impressions: the monotype in America. Joann Moser. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, they have come to refer to two different, though similar, types of printmaking. Both involve the transfer of ink from a plate to the paper, canvas, or other surface that will ultimately hold the work of art. In the case of monotypes, the plate is a featureless plate. It contains no features that will impart any definition to successive prints. The most common feature would be the etched or engraved line on a metal plate. In the absence of any permanent features on the surface of the plate, all articulation of imagery is dependent on one unique inking, resulting in one unique print. Additionally, the term monotype is often used for an image made by inking a non-absorbent surface with a solid colour, laying over it a piece of paper and drawing onto the back of the paper. When the paper is pulled off the resulting print consists of the line surrounded by ink picked up from the inked plate. The result has a chance element, often random and irregular which gives the print a certain charm, a technique famously used by British artist [[Tracey Emin]], a graduate of the Royal College of Art, where the practice of monoprinting in general was regarded as "fake painting".

Monoprints, on the other hand, now refers to the results of plates that have permanent features on them. Monoprints can be thought of as variations on a theme, with the theme resulting from some permanent features being found on the plate—lines, textures—that persist from print to print. Variations are confined to those resulting from how the plate is inked prior to each print. The variations are endless, but certain permanent features on the plate will tend to persist from one print to the next.

'''Music plagiarism''' is the use or close imitation of another author's music while representing it as one's own original work. [[Plagiarism]] in music now occurs in two contexts—with a ''musical idea'' (that is, a [[melody]] or [[Motif (music)|motif]]) or ''sampling'' (taking a portion of one sound recording and reusing it in a different song). For a legal history of the latter see [[Sampling (music)#Legal issues|sampling]].

==Overview==
Any music that follows rules of a [[musical scale]] is limited by the ability to use a small number of notes. All forms of music can be said to include patterns. [[Algorithm]]s (or, at the very least, formal sets of rules) have been used to compose music for centuries; the procedures used to plot voice-leading in Western [[counterpoint]], for example, can often be reduced to algorithmic determinacy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

For these reasons, accidental or "unconscious" plagiarism is possible. As well, some artists abandon the stigma of plagiarism altogether. Composer [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] perhaps commented sarcastically on the issue of musical plagiarism with his use of "[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]," an instantly recognizable tune, in his [[24 Preludes and Fugues (Shostakovich)#Prelude and Fugue No. 15 in D-flat major|Prelude No. 15 in D Flat, Op. 87]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wolfgang Amadeus Copycat|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2061711/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, it was also erroneously assumed that songs are still in copyright such as "Happy Birthday to You".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/26/arts/happy-birthday-and-the-money-it-makes.html|title='Happy Birthday' and the Money It Makes|work=The New York Times|date=26 December 1989|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, a lawsuit which challenged the copyright, found this was not the case.&lt;ref name=maiduc&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-happy-birthday-song-lawsuit-decision-20150922-story.html |title= 'Happy Birthday' Song Copyright Is Not Valid, Judge Rules |date= September 22, 2015 |first= Christine |last= Mai-Duc |newspaper= Los Angeles Times |access-date= September 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many songs are in [[public domain]]. For example, the work of [[Robert Johnson]] (1911 – 1938) is public domain in the [[European Union]] because Johnson died more than 70 years ago (1938 + 70). Some songs of [[W.C. Handy]] (1873 – 1958) are public domain in the USA because they were published before 1922 (e.g. "Memphis Blues"), but they are normally not public domain in the European Union until 2028 (1958 + 70). But the "[[Rule of the shorter term]]" (i.e. where copyright law overlaps, the law with the shorter term is upheld) makes them public domain in the states of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Public Domain Blues Songs | url=http://12bar.de/cms/albums/public-domain-blues-songs/ | date=2014 | accessdate=September 29, 2015 | last=Bicocchi | first=Matteo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[U.S. copyright law]], in the absence of a confession, musicians who accuse others of stealing their work must prove "access"—the alleged plagiarizer must have heard the song—and "similarity"—the songs must share unique musical components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Picking Up What They're Laying Down | work=Gelf magazine | url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/picking_up_what_theyre_laying_down.php | date=2014 | accessdate=23 November 2008 | last=Conner-Simons | first=Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is difficult to come to a definition of what is "similarity".

===Folk tradition===
The issue of plagiarism in folk music is problematic as copying and not crediting songs was common. Noted blues author and producer [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] states "It is the custom, in blues music, for a singer to borrow verses from contemporary sources, both oral and recorded, add his own tune and/or arrangement, and call the song his own".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=In the Houses of the Holy: Led Zeppelin and the Power of Rock Music| year=2001| author=Susan Fast| page=210 | isbn=0-19-511756-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorist Carl Lindahl, refers to these recycling of lyrics in songs as "floating lyrics". He defines it within the folk-music tradition as "lines that have circulated so long in folk communities that tradition-steeped singers call them instantly to mind and rearrange them constantly, and often unconsciously, to suit their personal and community aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;Carl Lindahl, "Thrills and Miracles: Legends of Lloyd Chandler", ''[[Journal of Folklore Research]]'', Bloomington: May–December 2004, Vol. 41, Issue 2/3, pp. 133–72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, when [[Bob Dylan]] was questioned over his alleged plagiarism of others music he responded, "It's an old thing – it's part of the tradition. It goes way back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Bob Dylan Strikes Back at Critics: Addresses plagiarism charges for the first time | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=12 September 2012 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylan-strikes-back-at-critics-20120912 | accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton University professor of American history [[Sean Wilentz]] defended Dylan's appropriation of music stating "crediting bits and pieces of another's work is scholarly tradition, not an artistic tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Bob Dylan says plagiarism charges made by "wussies and pussies" | work=[[Reuters]] | date=12 September 2012 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/13/entertainment-us-bobdylan-plagiarism-idUSBRE88C00720120913 | accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, B.B. King stated on the issue, "I don't think anybody steals anything; all of us borrow."&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard (1998). ''African American Quotations''. Oryx Press. pp. 98. {{ISBN|1-573-56118-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical ideas===
Plagiarism is relevant to different [[musical style]]s in different ways.

In classical music, software exists that automatically generates music in the style of another composer, using musical analysis of their works. Most notably, [[David Cope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computer Models of Musical Creativity|first = David|last = Cope|year = 2006|publisher = Cambridge, MA: MIT Press|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; has written a software system called "Experiments in Musical Intelligence" (or "EMI") that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style. EMI's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human-generated to a high level of competence. For this reason, Cope's work has been said to not produce original music. A different approach is being followed by [[Melomics]], a technology focused on teaching computers the rules of music composition, not the works of previous composers. This technology has opened the way to truly creative computer-composers, like [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] and [[Melomics109]]. The records produced ([[Iamus (album)|Iamus' album]] and [[0music]]) are in the computer's own style, so they cannot be considered a pastiche or plagiarism of previous works.

According to [[Theodor Adorno]]'s highly controversial view, [[popular music]] in general employs extensive plagiarism: variety in the musical material occurs in details whereas genuinely original musical content tends to be sparse when compared to [[classical music|classical]] or [[art music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/SWA/On_popular_music_2.shtml|title=On popular music|publisher=soundscapes.info|last=Adorno|first= Theodor W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contradicting this claim is classical music critic Mark Swed of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' who said that many composers used material from previous composers—for example, "[[John Williams]] all but lifted the core idea of his [[Star Wars (soundtrack)|soundtrack score]] from the Scherzo of [[Erich Korngold]]'s [[Symphony in F-sharp major (Korngold)|Symphony in F-sharp Major]], written 25 years earlier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-blurred-lines-classical-notebook-20150314-column.html |title='Blurred Lines' verdict would rock Amadeus and other great composers|first= Mark|last= Swed|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date= 2015-03-14|publisher=[[Tribune Co]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] |issn=0458-3035 |quote=Mark Swed |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampling===
{{Main|Sampling (music)}}
Sampling has long been an area of contention from a legal perspective. Early sampling artists simply used portions of other artists' recordings, without permission; once [[hip hop]] and other music incorporating samples began to make significant money, the original artists began to take legal action, claiming [[copyright]] infringement. Some sampling artists fought back, claiming their samples were [[fair use]] (a legal doctrine in the USA that is not universal). International sampling is governed by agreements such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] and the [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]].

Today, most major artists obtain prior authorization to use samples, a process known as "clearing," by gaining permission to use the sample and, usually, paying an upfront fee and/or a cut of the royalties to the original artist. Independent musicians, lacking the funds and legal assistance to clear samples, are at a disadvantage unless they seek the services of a professional sample replay company or producer.

Recently, the [[free culture movement]], started mainly by [[Lawrence Lessig]], has prompted many audio works to be licensed under a [[Creative Commons]] license that allows for legal sampling of the work provided the resulting work(s) are licensed under the same terms.

==Cases==
Usually cases of alleged plagiarism are settled out of court, due to the expense of litigation. Most artists try and settle for costs that will be less than defending costs. Since the 1850s federal courts have published fewer than 100 opinions dealing with this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cip.law.ucla.edu/caselist.html | title=UCLA Law Copyright Infringement Project | publisher=[[UCLA School of Law]] | accessdate=23 November 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101000016/http://cip.law.ucla.edu/caselist.html | archivedate=1 November 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbia Law School Library's Music Plagiarism Project provides information on many cases over the decades, with a few dating back to the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cip.law.ucla.edu/ |title= Music Copyright Infringement Resource |accessdate = 2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successful suits and settlements===
*[[Solomon Linda]], was a South African musician, singer and composer best known as the composer of the song "Mbube", which later became the popular music success "The Lion Sleeps Tonight". Despite the popularity and wide use of the song, Linda died impoverished in 1962 of renal failure. In February 2006, Linda's heirs attained a legal settlement with Abilene Music company, which had the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney.  The primary outcomes of the settlement of February 2006 were:
**The Linda heirs will receive payment for past uses of The Lion Sleeps Tonight and an entitlement to future royalties from its worldwide use.
**The Lion Sleeps Tonight is acknowledged as derived from Mbube. 
**Solomon Linda is acknowledged as a co-composer of The Lion Sleeps Tonight and will be designated as such in the future.
*In March 1963, [[the Beach Boys]] released "[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]" When the single was released in 1963, the record listed [[Brian Wilson]] as the sole composer although the song was published by [[Leonard Chess|Arc Music]], [[Chuck Berry]]'s publisher. Later releases, beginning with ''[[Best of The Beach Boys]]'' in 1966, listed Chuck Berry as the songwriter. Later releases list both writers although the copyright has always been owned, since 1963, by Arc Music. Under pressure from Berry's publisher, Wilson's father and manager, [[Murry Wilson]], had given the copyright, including Brian Wilson's lyrics, to Arc Music.&lt;ref&gt;Pegg, Bruce. ''Brown Eyed Handsome Man'' (2002): 162–163&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[George Martin]]'s score for [[the Beatles]]' "[[All You Need Is Love]]" (1967) contained melodies from several songs thought to be [[public domain]], including "[[In the Mood]]," written by [[Joe Garland]] and [[Andy Razaf]]. While the song was in the public domain, the [[Glenn Miller]] arrangement used was not and [[EMI]] made a royalty payment to KPM Publishing in July 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Lewisohn, Mark. ''The Beatles: Recording Sessions'' (1988): 120&lt;/ref&gt;
* John Lennon's use of a line from [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[You Can't Catch Me]]" ("Here come up flat top / He was movin' up with me/")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/you-cant-catch-me-lyrics-chuck-berry.html|title=Chuck Berry - You Can't Catch Me Lyrics - MetroLyrics|work=metrolyrics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1969 Beatles' song "[[Come Together]]" ("Here comes ol' flat-top / He come groovin' up slowly") led to a lawsuit from Berry's publisher, Big Seven Music Corp. In 1973, a settlement was reached whereby Lennon agreed to record three of Big Seven's songs on his next album. Big Seven Music Corp. again sued Lennon for breach of contract, when his 1974 album, ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'', failed to contain all three of the songs, with the court awarding the company US$6,795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Self |first=Joseph C. |year=1992 |title=Lennon vs. Levy – The 'Roots' Lawsuit |work=abbeyrd.net |url=http://www.abbeyrd.net/lenlevy.htm |accessdate=25 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703122215/http://www.abbeyrd.net/lenlevy.htm |archivedate= 3 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[George Harrison]] was successfully sued in a prolonged suit that began in 1971 for plagiarizing [[The Chiffons]]' "[[He's So Fine]]" (1963) for the melody of his own "[[My Sweet Lord]]" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/mysweet.htm |title=The "My Sweet Lord"/"He's So Fine" Plagiarism Suit |accessdate=23 November 2008 |last=Self |first=Joseph C. |year=1993 |work=The 910 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221135306/http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/mysweet.htm |archivedate=21 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ruling, the judge stated that he believed Harrison had not intentionally copied the song, but more than likely experienced an episode of [[cryptomnesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/mysweet.htm The "My Sweet Lord"/"He's So Fine" Plagiarism Suit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221135306/http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/mysweet.htm |date=21 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1971, [[Johnny Cash]] paid songwriter [[Gordon Jenkins]] an out-of-court settlement of US$75,000 for plagiarizing liberally from Jenkins' 1953 song "[[Crescent City Blues]]," for Cash's 1955 single "[[Folsom Prison Blues]]" (re-released in 1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Goodbye: In Search of Gordon Jenkins |last=Jenkins |first=Bruce |year=2005 |publisher=Frog Books |isbn=978-1-58394-126-3 |page= |pages=191 |url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=shameless+ripoff+%22folsom+prison+blues%22+inauthor:Jenkins |accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth, Michael.

*On [[Led Zeppelin]]'s album ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' (1969), parts of the song "[[Bring It On Home (Sonny Boy Williamson II song)|Bring It On Home]]" were copied from [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]]'s 1963 recording of "Bring It On Home," written by [[Willie Dixon]]. On the same album, "[[The Lemon Song]]" included an adaptation of [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s "[[Killing Floor (Howlin' Wolf song)|Killing Floor]]." In 1972, Arc Music, the publishing arm of [[Chess Records]], brought a lawsuit against Led Zeppelin for copyright infringement over "Bring It On Home" and "The Lemon Song"; the case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.
*Led Zeppelin's song "[[Whole Lotta Love]]" contained lyrics that were derivative of Willie Dixon's 1962 song "You Need Love." In 1985, Dixon filed a copyright infringement suit, resulting in an out-of-court settlement. Later pressings of ''Led Zeppelin II'' credit Dixon as co-writer.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Patrick. "Whole Lotta Litigation". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 3 February 1985: N72&lt;/ref&gt;
*Led Zeppelin also paid a settlement to the publisher of [[Ritchie Valens]]' song "Ooh! My Head" over "[[Boogie with Stu]]" (from their album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'') which borrowed from Valens' song.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmer, Larry. ''The Day the Music Died: The Last Tour of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens'' (2004): 166&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rod Stewart]] was successfully sued by Brazilian songwriter [[Jorge Ben Jor]], over "[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]" melody and chorus similarities to Ben's 1972 song "Taj Mahal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil's alchemist of funk - Tropical superstar Jorge Ben Jor brings the funk to Germany|url=http://www.expatica.com/de/lifestyle_leisure/lifestyle/brazils-alchemist-of-funk-abrtropical-superstar-jorge-ben-jor-brings-the-funk-to-germanybr-9736.html|publisher=Expatica|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In autumn 1984 and throughout 1985, [[Huey Lewis]] sued [[Ray Parker, Jr.]], for [[plagiarism]], alleging that Parker stole the melody of the song "[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]" (the theme from the [[Ghostbusters|movie of the same name]]), from Lewis's 1983 song "[[I Want A New Drug]]." Lewis dropped the lawsuit after the two parties settled out-of-court in 1995. Lewis had been approached to compose the main theme song for the ''Ghostbusters'' movie, but had declined due to his work on the soundtrack for ''[[Back to the Future]]''. It was reported in 2001 that Lewis allegedly breached an agreement not to mention the original suit, doing so on [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1442127/20010323/lewis_huey.jhtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613074344/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1442127/20010323/lewis_huey.jhtml |archivedate=13 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the book ''Sharp Dressed Men'' by former [[ZZ Top]] stage manager David Blayney, who was with the band for 15 years, sound engineer Linden Hudson co-wrote much of the material on the ZZ Top album ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' album as a live-in high-tech music teacher to band members [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] and [[Billy Gibbons]]. Despite continued denials by the band, it settled a five-year legal battle with Hudson in 1986, paying him $600,000 after he proved he held the copyright to the song "Thug" which appeared on ''Eliminator''.&lt;ref&gt;Blayney, David (1994).

*Due to similarities to "[[The Air That I Breathe]]", a song recorded by [[The Hollies]] in 1973, [[Radiohead]] were successfully sued for plagiarism over their 1992 song "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]".

Oasis were also successfully sued for $500,000 by [[The New Seekers]] after the 1994 song "[[Shakermaker]]" was alleged to have taken its melody from "[[I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing]]". An Oasis song "Step Out," was originally intended for the ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' album but was taken off after [[Stevie Wonder]] requested 10% of the royalties, as the chorus bore a similarity to his hit "[[Uptight (Everything's Alright)]]." Instead it was placed as a [[B-side]] on their 1996 single "[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]," and "Uptight" writers Wonder, [[Henry Cosby]] and [[Sylvia Moy]] received credit for writing the song, along with [[Noel Gallagher]].

*[[Shakira]]'s Spanish-language single "[[Loca (Shakira song)|Loca]]" was ruled a copy from another songwriter's work. On 19 August 2014, [[Alvin Hellerstein]], senior judge of the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], concluded that the Spanish version of "Loca" had been plagiarised from "Loca con su Tiguere", a mid-1990s song composed by Dominican songwriter Ramon "Arias" Vasquez. Hellerstein ruled in favour of Vasquez and found the two songs to be similar in structure and rhythm. As the Spanish version of "Loca" features Bello singing numerous portions, the judge reasoned that it too was plagiarised from Vasquez's song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fox News Latino|date=20 August 2014|title=Judge: Shakira's Hit Song 'Loca' Ripped Off From Dominican Songerwriter's Work|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2014/08/20/judge-shakira-hit-song-loca-ripped-off-from-dominican-songerwriter-work/|publisher=FOX News Network|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a trial phase, [[Sony ATV|SonyATV Latin]] and Sony/ATV Discos (the distributors of the Spanish version of "Loca" in the United States) will pay damages to Mayimba Music, the owner of the rights to Vasquez's song and the plaintiff in the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=Eriq|date=20 August 2014|title=Shakira's Illegally Copied Song Puts Sony on Hook for Damages|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/shakiras-illegally-copied-song-puts-726532|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neosymbolism''' is a movement current in the [[visual arts]] genre.  Active in the movement are artists in the United States, Denmark, the [[Czech Republic]], and Canada.

== Philosophy ==
The core philosophy of Neosymbolism, like that of its predecessor [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], is the idea of "correspondences", the "emblematic order" of a world in which technology and the industrial reality have not yet drowned the forces of mysticism and belief. In a world where visual images exist to generate sales and revenue, Neosymbolist imagery attempts to preserve the relationship between image and the human soul. The imagery is necessarily representational rather than abstract. It borders on the narrative, but stops short of the commercial trap of illustration to convey an idea for profit. Artists like [[Norman Rockwell]] could qualify as Neosymbolist painters in that they adopt a social and cultural undercurrent and then convey it in terms of the cultural cliche—the image as representative of core aspects of the culture. The same is not true, however, of the generally accepted idea of commercial illustration which attempts more to influence cultural, political, and economic ideology than it tries to communicate an existential reality.

Neosymbolism is fairly well-hidden within the culture, with few references and almost no broad-based visibility. In 1988, Nick A_Demos published a book in two editions. This was  the first visible sign of an idea underlying a Neosymbolist philosophy. A_Demos then developed this first book of Neosymbolism into paintings. He was also the first to use the word "Neosymbolism", thus coining it.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There has also been a separate group using the Neosymbolism name for the creation of an international collective representing a number of artists who share the goals of preserving the visual art of Symbolism (the foundation of the ideas associated with the term Neosymbolism) in its original and essential sense. This preservation, as opposed to the "non-sense" of various philosophies that have evolved since the late nineteenth century and have deviated from the core Symbolist philosophy.
  
The Neosymbolist movement was born spontaneously in numerous locations across the globe. Many groups use the word but also do not want to be limited to only this discipline. A group of Danish Neosymbolists defined their movement thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arrkunst.webbyen.dk/vishjemmeside_privat.asp?mode=top_frame&amp;id=614394&amp;side=&amp;webside=4222305 |title=webbyen.dk |date=2011-07-19 |access-date=2017-02-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132848/http://www.arrkunst.webbyen.dk/vishjemmeside_privat.asp?mode=top_frame&amp;id=614394&amp;side=&amp;webside=4222305 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
* Using Iconic language in their expressions
* Reproducing the inner experience of the outer world  
* Examining the human experience and circumstance in today’s changing world
* Examining the underlying meaning of life
* Using media in conscious and innovative ways

The founder of the Canadian Neosymbolists, meanwhile, describes the foundations of their movement in ''Brief Summary of the Foundations of Canadian Neosymbolism,''{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} written by their founder, Gary F. Manzo.

* Using Symbolic language in our expressions, often derived from Dream Sequences and Archetypal Imagery as described by Carl Jung, and others involved with Mysticism, Alchemy, Depth Psychology and Philosophy. 
* Depicting the inner experience of the outer world, in relationship to Self-Actualization and Depth Psychology and related fields of study. 
* Examining the human experience and circumstance in today’s changing world, with the idea that mankind must “make friends with his animal nature” in order to achieve Wholeness of SELF in a contemporary world. 
* Examining the underlying meaning of life, both from an historical perspective and its relevancy to the new age of Technology as well as New Age Psychology. 
* Using mediums and techniques, in conscious, experimental and innovative ways, utilizing both traditional methods and contemporary cutting-edge techniques and technologies.

Another international Neosymbolist collective that began exhibiting as a group in 2001 has a simpler definition:
 
- The "exploration of the emotional, political, and spiritual themes of the rapidly changing culture of the late 20th and early 21st (century) through the use of symbols both personal and universal."{{cite quote|date=April 2015}}
  
This perspective of the Neosymbolist movement can be seen as a reaction against abstraction, an attempt to weave artists’ intellectual and spiritual experiences into the fabric of their work. Furthermore, the Neosymbolists’ palette is not limited to the use of words and ancient symbols of ideas, even as these remain powerful tools of expression.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Nightwood Theatre''' is a Canadian professional women’s theatre company. Based in [[Toronto]], it was founded in 1979 by Cynthia Grant, [[Kim Renders]], [[Mary Vingoe]], and Maureen White, a collective of women in their 20s who set out to develop imagistic theatre practices by drawing on literature, painting, and music.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Eugene, and L.W. Connolly. ''English Canadian Theatre''. Perspectives on Canadian Culture. Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1987. P. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first production in 1979, ''The True Story of Ida Johnson'', was adapted from the novel by [[Sharon Riis]], and is described as "an innovative mixed-media performance,"&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, Louise. "Feminist Theatre." ''The Oxford Companion to Canadian Theatre''. Eds. Eugene Benson and L.W. Connolly. Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1989. P. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; as with their 1980 creation, ''Glazed Tempera'', which was inspired by Alex Colville's paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Benson and Connolly.&lt;/ref&gt; The original impetus had little to do with feminism, but that changed once the company began to be defined and critiqued as a group of women theatre practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Nothof, Anne. "[http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Nightwood%20Theatre Nightwood Theatre]." ''Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia''. 2017. Retrieved 7 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The company attracted a number of strong writer-performers, such as Beverley Cooper, [[Ann-Marie MacDonald]], and Banuta Rubess.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/nightwood-theatre/ Nightwood Theatre]." ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 10 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable works from this early period in the 1980s include ''[[This is For You, Anna]]'', a collective creation exploring themes of justice, power, and violence, based in part on the true story of [[Marianne Bachmeier]]; ''Nancy Drew, The Case of the Missing Mother,'' by Cooper and MacDonald; and Banuta Rubbess's ''Pope Joan'', about a woman elected as a male pope (see [[Pope Joan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nightwood advocates for women, provides a training ground for emerging talent, promotes diversity, and engages artists in play development and theatre production. Play development, mentorship, and youth outreach are at the centre of the company’s activities, including a free summer program for teen girls called Busting Out! [[Kelly Thornton]] has been the artistic director since 2001.

'''Patulangan''', sometimes called '''palinggihan''', is a type of wooden [[sarcophagus]] in [[Bali, Indonesia]]. They are shaped in animal forms, real and mythical.&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1GVdW9_li9cC&amp;pg=PT212&amp;lpg=PT212&amp;dq=patulangan+bali&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YA6x_WNLuw&amp;sig=EjoJKr4LWWcPqEFWxx2I4gWfTSc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMIzeTZpN6PxwIVgXceCh1A4AHg#v=onepage&amp;q=patulangan%20bali&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Cremation] edited by Lewis H. Mates, Professor Douglas J. Davies&lt;/ref&gt; The body is brough to the patulangan in a [[bodé]], a pagoda like structure with an odd number multi-tiered roof (the more roof tiers the higher the prestige). The patulangan and bodé are cremated along with the body.&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt; Traditionally the design of the sarcophagus depends on the [[varna]] of the deceased. Bull shaped patulangan are used for male [[Brahmin]]s, cows for female Brahmins, lions for [[Kshatriya]], winged lions for [[prabali]], deer for [[Vaishyas]], and the [[gajah mina]] (elephant-fish) and [[cecekakan]] for [[jaba (caste)]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IxAVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA398&amp;lpg=PA398&amp;dq=patulangan+bali&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oTLzlTPNvi&amp;sig=mfBAln9HZBE0ziEqXMXpBnU0PYk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIzeTZpN6PxwIVgXceCh1A4AHg#v=onepage&amp;q=patulangan%20bali&amp;f=false Codices Manuscripti: Catalogue of Balinese manuscripts in the Library of the University of Leiden and other collections in the Netherlands] Descriptions of the Balinese drawings from the Van der Tuuk Collection, Volume 23, Page 2, Bibliotheek der Rijksuniversiteit te Leiden, Hedwig I.

Because of the high cost of the funeral and its rituals, bodies are often buried and disinterred for mass funeral events.&lt;ref name=lon&gt;Lonely Planet Bali &amp; Lombok by Ryan Ver Berkmoes&lt;/ref&gt; The tower is shaken and circled during the funeral procession so that the soul cannot find its way back home. War battles are simulated and water is tossed. The structures and body are cremated and the ashes scattered in the ocean. The process is meant to liberate th esoul to ascend to heaven and the family temple.&lt;ref name=lon/&gt;

'''Persian dance''' or '''Iranian dance''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]:رقص ایرانی) refers to the dance styles indigenous to [[Iran]]. Genres of dance in Iran vary depending on the area, culture, and language of the local people, and can range from sophisticated reconstructions of refined court dances to energetic folk dances.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.laurelvictoriagray.com/persian-dance.html|title = A Brief Introduction to Persian Dance|date = 2007|accessdate = July 14, 2014|website = Laurel Victoria Gray, Central Asian, Persian, Turkic, Arabian and Silk Road Dance Culture|publisher = |last = Gray|first = Laurel Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Iran includes many [[Ethnic minorities in Iran|ethnicities]], such as [[Kurds]], [[Azeri-Iranian|Azerbaijanis]], [[Iranian Turkmen|Turkmen]], [[Persian Jews|Jews]], [[Iranian Armenians|Armenian]], [[Iranian Georgians|Georgian]] peoples, in addition to numerous Iranian tribal groups which can be found within the borders of modern-day Iran.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each group, region, and historical epoch has specific dance styles associated with it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Raghs (also spelled as Raqs) is the Arabic word for dance, and is almost exclusively the word used for dance in [[Persian language|Persian]], as the Persian word for dance, paykubi, is no longer in common usage. It's also the word in Azerbaijani for dance (''Reqs''). The [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] word for dance is Halperke, and the Lurs from [[Lorestan]] use the word Bākhten (or Bāzee) for dance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
People of Iranian plateau have known dance in forms of music, play, drama or religious rituals and have used instruments like mask, costumes of animals or plants, and musical instruments for rhythm, at least since 6th millennium BC. Cultural mixed forms of dance, play and drama have served rituals like celebration, mourning and worship. And the actors have been masters of music, dance, physical acts and manners of expression. Artifacts with pictures of dancers, players or actors were found in many of archaeological prehistoric sites in Iran, like Tepe Sabz, Ja'far Abad, Chogha Mish, Tall-e Jari, Cheshmeh Ali, Ismaeel Abad, Tal-e bakun, Tepe Sialk, Tepe Musian, tepe Yahya, Shahdad, Tepe Gian, Kul Farah, Susa, Kok Tepe, Cemeteries of Luristan, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://jfadram.ut.ac.ir/article_24776.html|title = Dance, Play, Drama; a Survey of Dramatic Actions in Pre-Islamic Artifacts of Iran|date = 2012|publisher = Tehran: University of Tehran, Honarhay-e Ziba Journal|last = Taheri|first = Sadreddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest researched dance from historic Iran is a dance worshiping [[Cult of Mithras|Mithra]] (as in the Cult of Mithras) in which a bull was sacrificed. This cult later became highly adhered in the [[Roman Empire]]. This dance was to promote vigor in life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ancient Persian dance was significantly researched by Greek historian from [[Herodotus]] of Halikarnassos, in his work ''Book IX (Calliope)'', in which he describes the history of Asian empires and Persian wars until 478 BC.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artira.com/nimakiann/history/preislamic.html|title = Persian Dance And It's Forgotten History|date = 2000|accessdate = July 14, 2014|website = Nima Kiann|publisher = Les Ballets Persans|last = Kiann|first = Nima}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Persia was occupied by foreign powers, first [[Greeks]], then [[Arabs]], and then [[Mongols]] and in turn political instability and civil wars occurred. Throughout these changes a slow disappearance of heritage dance traditions occurred.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After the fall of Persian Empire, when the country was torn into pieces, Iranian women and young girls were enslaved by the new conquerors, often forced into sexual slavery and required to perform erotic dances for the new rulers. Religious prohibition of dancing in Iran came with the spread of Islam, but it was spurred by historical events.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Religious prohibition to dancing waxed and waned over the years, but after the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979 dancing was no longer allowed due to its frequent mixing of the sexes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Islamic Revolution of 1979, was the end of a successful era for dancing and the art of ballet in Iran.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iranchamber.com/cinema/articles/persian_dance_history03.php|title = Persian Dance History|date = 2002|accessdate = Aug 26, 2015|website = Iran Chamber Society|publisher = |last = Kiann|first = Nima}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian national ballet company was dissolved and its members emigrated to different countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to the principles of the “cultural revolution” in Iran, dancing was considered to be perverse, a great sin, immoral and corrupting.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As a result, many of the talented Persian dancers moved to the West and spread out mainly in Europe and the United States and new generation of Iranian dancers and ballet artists have grown up in the Diaspora.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Genres of dance ==
Iran possesses four categories of dance and these genres are; chain or line dances, solo improvisational dance, war or combat dances and ritual or spiritual dances.

'''Chain or Line dances''' are often named for the region or the ethnic groups with which they are associated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Solo dance''' includes usually reconstructions of [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Court Dance. These often are improvisational dances and utilize delicate, graceful movements of the hands and arms, such as wrist circles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''War or Combat dances''' imitate combat, or help train the warrior. It could be argued that men from the [[Pahlevani and zoorkhaneh rituals|zurkhaneh]] (a traditional Persian style gymnasium) called the “House of Strength” and their ritualized, wrestling-training movements are known as a type of dance called Raghs-e-Pa but could also been seen as a [[Martial arts|martial art]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasehpour.com/tonbak/persian-dance.html|title = A Brief About Persian Dance|date = |accessdate = July 14, 2014|website = Official Website of Dr. Peyman Nasehpour|publisher = |last = Nasehpour|first = Peyman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ritual or spiritual dances''', are often [[Sufism|Sufi]] are known as sama and also a type of zikr (religious chant).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are various types of dancing in a trance for healing practices in Iran and surrounding areas. One healing ritual that involves trance, music, and movement is called le’b guati of the Baluchis of Eastern Iran, which is performed to rid a possessed person of the possessing spirit and appears to be in a similar state as an exorcism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thebestofhabibi.com/volume-18-no-2-september-2000/spirituality-in-iran/|title = Spirituality in Iranian Music and Dance, Conversations with Morteza Varzi|date = 2002|accessdate = July 14, 2014|website = The Best of Habibi, A Journal for Lovers of Middle Eastern Dance and Arts|publisher = Shareen El Safy|last = Friend PhD|first = Robyn C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a term in Balochi "gowati" for psychologically ill patients (possessed by wind) who have recovered through music healing, music as medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://everything2.com/title/Bandari|title = Bandari|date = May 2, 2003|accessdate = July 14, 2014|website = everything2|publisher = |last = oakling|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern coastal regions of Iran such as [[Qeshm Island]] have a similar possession by wind ceremony and it is thought that it may be influenced or originated in Africa, particularly the [[Abyssinian Empire|Abyssinian]] or [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopian]] region.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The word sama'','' from the Arabic root meaning “to listen,” refers to the spiritual practice of listening to music and achieving unity with the Divine, it is spelled sema in Turkish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dancing mystics (regardless of their specific religious identifications) are called [[Dervish]].

Contemporary social dances and urban dance performed at festive occasions like weddings and [[Noruz]] celebrations focus less on communal line or circle dances and more on solo improvisational forms, with each dancer interpreting the music in her own special way but within a  specific range of dance vocabulary sometimes blending other dance styles or elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Persian dance styles ==
This is a list of some of the ancient and contemporary Persian dances, from various ethnic groups within Iran. 
* '''Baba Karam, '''a chain dance, derived from a Sufi story whereby a servant at the court of the king falls in love with one of the harem girls and sings this song out of grief of not being able to be with her, was traditionally featuring male dancers but nowadays also performed by women, also sometimes Baba Karam refers to as a term for contemporary Persian Hip-Hop dancing.
*[[Bandari music|'''Bandari''']]''' dance, '''a chain dance, often referred to as "Persian belly dancing" refers to the style of dancing indigenous to Southwestern, Bandar region of Iran influenced by the African and Arabic music and dance.

The area's history is an archetypal example of inner-city regeneration and [[gentrification]], encompassing [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]], cultural, political, and architectural developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrgazetas.com/papers/SoHo.pdf SoHo, New York – Mixed Use, Density and the Power of Myth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708145243/http://www.barrgazetas.com/papers/SoHo.pdf |date=2008-07-08 }} Barr, Alistair – Architect&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{maplink|frame=y|frame-align=left|zoom=12|type=shape|id=Q461572|text=Location in New York City}}

===Boundaries===
Because of the nature of neighborhoods in New York City,{{refn|group=notes|Neighborhoods in New York City do not have official status, and their boundaries are not specifically set by the city, although the boundaries of related areas, such as zoning districts and historic districts are set and specific. Because of this, the definition of where neighborhoods begin and end is subject to a variety of forces, including the efforts of real estate concerns to promote certain areas, the use of neighborhood names in media news reports, and the everyday usage of people.&lt;ref&gt;Scherzer, Kenneth A. "neighborhoods" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.886-87. Quote: "Most neighborhoods in New York have a generally recognized central district, but their boundaries are difficult to define, especially if the population is transient and heterogeneous, the neighborhood is centrally situated, or the question of boundaries is politically sensitive ... Perceptions play a large role in shaping the evolution of neighborhoods: areas that are perceived as desirable tend to grow and prosper, which in turn makes them more desirable. At the same time the boundaries of a prosperous neighborhood inevitably expands, which serves the interests of residents of adjoining areas, of real estate brokers and speculators, and sometimes of government. A similar process works in reverse to the detriment of declining neighborhoods.  Sometimes neighborhoods are renamed in an effort to improve their image."&lt;/ref&gt;}} different sources will often give different boundaries for each one. In the case of SoHo, all sources appear to agree that the northern boundary is [[Houston Street]], and the southern boundary is [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], but the location of the eastern and western boundaries is disputed.

In 1974, shortly after SoHo first came into existence, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the boundaries as "stretching from Houston to Canal Streets between [[West Broadway]] and [[Lafayette Street]]"&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, Wendy (November 24, 1974) [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/11/24/91085427.pdf "SoHo a 'Victim of its Own Success'"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; – a definition it continued to hold to in 2016&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Aileen (April 27, 2016) [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/realestate/living-in-soho-chic-stores-and-cobblestones.html?_r=0 "SoHo: Chic Stores and Cobblestones"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; – but ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'' reports that SoHo is bounded by Crosby Street on the east, and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] to the west.&lt;ref name=enc-nyc&gt;Gold, Joyce. "SoHo" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.1202-03&lt;/ref&gt; These are the same boundaries shown by [[Google Maps]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/maps/place/SoHo,+New+York,+NY/@40.7236447,-74.0050567,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2598c5e51e2f3:0xce2f3449f490f818!8m2!3d40.723301!4d-74.0029883 "Soho, Manhattan"] [[Google Maps]]". Accessed: April 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''[[AIA Guide to New York City]]'' gives the western boundary of SoHo north of [[Broome Street]] as being West Broadway,&lt;ref name=aia /&gt; and ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine gives the eastern boundary as Lafayette Street and the western boundary as the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff [http://nymag.com/realestate/articles/neighborhoods/soho.htm "Neighborhood Profile: SoHo"] ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''. Accessed: April 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The very small-scale map at the Community Board 2 profile page on New York City's official website appears to show Sixth Avenue and Lafayette Street as the western and eastern boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/community/community-portal-1.page?cd=mn02 "Community Portal: Manhattan Community District 2"] nyc.gov. Accessed: April 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Summing up these sources, the western boundary of SoHo may be the Hudson River, Sixth Avenue or West Broadway, and the eastern boundary may be Crosby Street or Lafayette Street.

In the 1990s, real estate agents began giving an adjacent neighborhood below West Houston Street various appellations, with no general agreement on whether it should be called West SoHo, [[Hudson Square]] or the [[South Village]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Clare. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/15/realestate/living-in-west-soho-eschewing-a-name-and-becoming-an-address.html "Living in: West SoHo; Eschewing a Name and Becoming an Address"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' (August 15, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''AIA Guide'' calls that neighborhood "An intersection of brick and glass, searching for an identity", and refers to the western section of it as "The Glass Box District".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic District===
The SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District is contained within the zoned SoHo neighborhood. Originally ending in the west at the eastern side of West Broadway and to the east at the western side of Crosby Street, the SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District was expanded in 2010 to cover most of West Broadway and to extend east to Lafayette and Centre Streets. The boundary lines are not straight, and some block-fronts on West Broadway and Lafayette are excluded from the District.&lt;ref&gt;[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] [http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/maps/sohodextmap.pdf "SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District Extension Map"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Designation Report, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early years===
During the colonial period, the land that is now SoHo was part of a grant of farmland given to freed slaves of the [[Dutch West Indies Company]], and the site of the first free Black settlement on Manhattan island.&lt;ref name=desrep4&gt;Designation Report, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; This land was acquired in the 1660s by Augustine Hermann, and then passed to his brother-in-law, Nicholas Bayard.&lt;ref name=desrep4 /&gt; The estate was confiscated by the state as a result of Bayard's part in [[Leisler's Rebellion]], but was returned to him after the sentence was annulled.&lt;ref name=desrep5&gt;Designation Report, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century natural barriers&amp;nbsp;– streams and hills&amp;nbsp;– impeded the growth of the city northward into the Bayard estate, and the area maintained its rural character.&lt;ref name=desrep5 /&gt; During the [[American Revolution]], the area was the location of numerous [[fortification]]s, [[redoubt]]s and [[breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]]s.&lt;ref name=desrep5 /&gt; After the war, Bayard, who had suffered financially because of it, was forced to mortgage some of the property, which was divided up into lots, but even then there was very little development in the area, aside from some manufacturing at Broadway and Canal Street.&lt;ref name=desrep5 /&gt;

Serious development of the area did not begin until the Common Council, answering the complaints of landowners in the area, drained the [[Collect Pond]], which had once been an important source of fresh water for the island, but which had become polluted and rank and a breeding ground for mosquitoes. A canal was built to drain the pond into the Hudson, and the canal and pond were both later filled in using earth from nearby Bayard's Hill.&lt;ref name=desrep5 /&gt; Once Broadway was paved and sidewalks were built there and along Canal Street, more people began to make their homes there, joining earlier arrivals such as [[James Fennimore Cooper]].&lt;ref name=desrep5 /&gt;

==={{anchor|decline}} Commerce, entertainment, and decline===
By the mid-19th century, the early [[Federal architecture|Federal]]- and [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]]-style homes were replaced by more-solid structures of masonry and cast iron, and along Broadway, large marble-skinned commercial establishments began to open, such as [[Lord &amp; Taylor]], [[Arnold Constable &amp; Company]] and [[Tiffany &amp; Company]], as well as grand hotels such as the St. Nicholas and the Metropolitan.&lt;ref name=desrep6&gt;Designation Report. p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Theatres followed in their wake, and Broadway between Canal and [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston]] Streets became a lively theater and shopping district and the entertainment center of New York;&lt;ref name=desrep6 /&gt; as usual with such areas, it was home to many brothels as well,&lt;ref name="Ephemeral New York"&gt;{{Cite web| title = West Broadway: once a slum called 'Rotten Row' | work=Ephemeral New York | date = 2011-03-16 | url = http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/west-broadway-once-a-slum-called-rotten-row/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the side streets off of Broadway became the city's [[red-light district]].&lt;ref name=desrep6 /&gt; As this change in character drove out the middle-class, their place was taken by small manufacturing concerns, including cabinet-makers and the lumberyards that supplied them, brass and copper firms, makers of china and glassware, locksmiths, snuff manufacturers and book publishers.&lt;ref name=desrep7&gt;Designation Report, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

This dramatic shift in the nature of the neighborhood continued to drive out residents, and between 1860 and 1865 the Eighth Ward, which included the SoHo area, lost 25% of its population.&lt;ref name=desrep7 /&gt; After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Panic of 1873]], in the 1880s and 90s, large manufacturers began to move into the area, especially textile firms, and the area became the mercantile and wholesale dry-goods trade center of the city, and was the subject of significant real-estate speculation.&lt;ref name=desrep7 /&gt; This phase came to an end by the close of the 19th century, and as the center of the city continued to move uptown, the quality of the area declined.&lt;ref name=desrep8&gt;Designation Report, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], the textile industry largely moved to the South, leaving many large buildings in the district unoccupied. In some buildings they were replaced by warehouses and printing plants, and other buildings were torn down to be replaced by gas stations, auto repair shops and parking lots and garages.&lt;ref name=extdesrep&gt;Betts, Mary Beth (ed.) [http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/sohoextdesignation.pdf "SoHo&amp;nbsp;– Cast-Iron Historic District Extension Designation Report"], [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] (May 11, 2010) pp.5–6&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s, the area had become known as '''Hell's Hundred Acres''',&lt;ref name=extdesrep /&gt; an industrial wasteland, full of [[sweatshop]]s and small factories in the daytime, but empty at night. It would not be until the 1960s, when artists began to be interested in the tall ceilings and many windows of the empty manufacturing lofts, that the character of the neighborhood began to change again.&lt;ref name=desrep8 /&gt;

===Cast-iron architecture===
SoHo boasts the greatest collection of [[cast-iron architecture]] in the world.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, pp.39-41&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 250 cast-iron buildings stand in New York City, and the majority are in SoHo. Cast iron was initially used as a decorative front over a pre-existing building. With the addition of modern, decorative facades, older industrial buildings were able to attract new commercial clients. Most of these facades were constructed during the period from 1840 to 1880.&lt;ref name=enc-nyc /&gt; In addition to revitalizing older structures, buildings in SoHo were later designed to feature the cast iron.

[[File:E.V. Haughwout Building-2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[E. V. Haughwout Building]] at Broadway and [[Broome Street (Manhattan)|Broome Street]] was built in 1856–57, and has a cast-iron facade by [[Daniel D. Badger]]]]

An American architectural innovation, cast iron was cheaper to use for facades than materials such as stone or brick. Molds of ornamentation, prefabricated in foundries, were used interchangeably for many buildings, and a broken piece could be easily recast. The buildings could be erected quickly; some were built in four months. Despite the brief construction period, the quality of the cast-iron designs was not sacrificed. Bronze had previously been the metal most frequently used for architectural detail. Architects found that the relatively inexpensive cast iron could provide intricately designed patterns. Classical French and Italian architectural designs were often used as models for these facades. Because stone was the material associated with architectural masterpieces, cast iron, painted in neutral tints such as beige, was used to simulate stone.

There was a profusion of cast iron foundries in New York, including Badger's Architectural Iron Works, James L. Jackson's Iron Works, and Cornell Iron Works.

Since the iron was pliable and easily molded, sumptuously curved window frames were created, and the strength of the metal allowed these frames considerable height. The once-somber, gas-lit interiors of the industrial district were flooded with sunlight through the enlarged windows. The strength of cast iron permitted high ceilings with sleek supporting columns, and interiors became expansive and functional.

During cast iron's heyday, many architects thought it to be structurally more sound than steel. It was also thought that cast iron would be fire-resistant, and facades were constructed over many interiors built of wood and other flammable materials. When exposed to heat, cast iron buckled, and later cracked under the cold water used to extinguish fire. In 1899, a building code mandating the backing of cast-iron fronts with masonry was passed. Most of the buildings that stand today are constructed in this way. It was the advent of steel as a major construction material that brought an end to the cast iron era.{{clear left}}

===Lower Manhattan Expressway===
In the 1960s, the SoHo area was to have been the location of two enormous elevated [[highway]]s that comprised the two branches of the [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]], a [[Robert Moses]] project that was intended to create an [[automobile]] and [[truck]] through-route connecting the [[Manhattan Bridge]] and [[Williamsburg Bridge]] on the east with the [[Holland Tunnel]] on the west.&lt;ref name=enc-nyc /&gt;&lt;ref name="nycroads"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/lower-manhattan/ |title=Lower Manhattan Expressway (I-78 and I-478, unbuilt) |first=Steve |last=Anderson |work=NYCRoads |accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young [[historic preservation]] movement and [[architectural]] critics, stung by the destruction of the original [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Pennsylvania Station]] in 1963 and the threat to other historic structures, challenged the plans because of the threatened loss of a huge quantity of 19th-century cast-iron buildings.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-RememberingPioneer-2008"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/remembering-a-pioneer-of-the-preservation-movement/|title=Remembering a Pioneer of the Preservation Movement|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|authorlink=David W. Dunlap|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 29, 2008|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NYC SoHo Green Street.jpg|thumb|325px|right|[[Cast-iron architecture]] on Greene Street]]

When [[John V. Lindsay]] became [[Mayors of New York City|mayor of New York City]] in 1966, his initial reaction was to try to push the expressways through, dubbing the project the Lower Manhattan Expressway, depressing some of the proposed highway in residential areas and stressing the importance of the artery to the city. Nevertheless, through the efforts of [[Jane Jacobs]], Tony D'Apolito, [[Margot Gayle]], and other local, civic, and cultural leaders, as well as SoHo artist residents themselves, the project was derailed.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-RememberingPioneer-2008"/&gt;

===Artists move in===
After the abandonment of the highway scheme, the city was left with a large number of historic buildings that were unattractive for the kinds of [[manufacturing]] and [[commerce]] that survived in the city in the 1970s. The upper floors of many of these buildings had been built as commercial [[Manhattan loft]]s, which provided large, unobstructed spaces for manufacturing and other industrial uses. These spaces attracted artists who valued them for their large areas, large windows admitting [[natural lighting|natural light]] and low rents. Most of these spaces were also used illegally as living space, despite being neither [[zoning|zoned]] nor equipped for residential use. This widespread zoning violation was ignored for a long period of time, as the artist-occupants were using space for which there was little demand due to the city's poor economy at the time, and would have lain dormant or been abandoned otherwise.&lt;ref name=aia /&gt;&lt;ref name=enc-nyc /&gt;&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;
[[File:105 Mercer Street.jpg|thumb|left|187px|SoHo also contains former industrial buildings in other architectural styles, and is also dotted with smaller structures like this [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] house built in 1819–20.]]
Nevertheless, as the artist population grew, the city made some attempts to stem the movement, concerned about the occupation of space that did not meet residential building codes, and the possibility that the occupied space might be needed for the return of manufacturing to New York City. Pressured on many sides, the city abandoned attempts to keep the district as strictly [[industry|industrial]] space, and in 1971, the Zoning Resolution was amended to permit Joint Live-Work Quarters for artists, and the M1-5a and M-5b districting was established to permit visual artists, certified as such by the Department of Cultural Affairs, to live where they worked.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In 1987, non-artists residing in SoHo and NoHo were permitted to [[Grandfather clause|grandfather]] themselves, but that was the only extension to non-artists and was a one-time agreement.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The area received landmark designation as the SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District in 1973.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

[[File:428 Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|428 Broadway (428-432) was built in 1888-89 and was designed by Samuel A. Warner in the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne style]]]]

===Gentrification and shopping===
In 2005, the construction of residential buildings on empty lots in the historic district was permitted. Nevertheless, with no enforcement of the new zoning laws by the city, beginning in the 1980s, in a way that would later apply elsewhere, the neighborhood began to draw [[List of highest-income urban neighborhoods in the United States|more affluent residents]]. Due to rent protection and stability afforded by the [[1982 Loft Law]], in addition to the fact that many of the artists owned their co-ops, many of the original pioneering artists remained despite the popular misconception that gentrification forced them to flee. Many residents have lived in the neighborhood for decades. In the mid-1990s, most of the galleries moved to Chelsea, but several galleries remain as of 2013, including William Bennett Gallery, [[Martin Lawrence Galleries]], [[Terrain Gallery]], Franklin Bowles Gallery, and Pop International Gallery.

SoHo's location, the appeal of lofts as living spaces, its architecture, and its reputation as a haven for artists all contributed to this change. The pattern of [[gentrification]] is typically known as the "SoHo Effect" and has been observed elsewhere in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/arts/artistic-enclave-gets-its-footing-in-rhode-island.html?pagewanted=2 | title = Artistic Enclave Gets Its Footing In Rhode Island | first= Katie | last= Zezima | work = [[The New York Times]] | date =August 10, 2004 | accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0928/p01s01-ussc.html | title= In New England, a city revival built on creativity | first=Sara B. | last=Miller | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date =September 28, 2004 | page = [http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0928/p01s01-ussc.html/(page)/2 2] | accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A backwater of poor artists and small factories in the 1970s, SoHo became a popular tourist destination for people seeking fashionable clothing and exquisite architecture, and home to some of the most expensive real estate in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Most Expensive ZIP Codes| work = [[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/special-report/2012/1016_zip-codes_rank.html|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SoHo's chain outlets are clustered in the northern area of the neighborhood, along [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and Prince and [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Streets]]. The sidewalks in this area are often crowded with tourists and with vendors selling jewelry, T-shirts, and other works. SoHo is known for its commercialization and eclectic mix of boutiques for shopping—although in 2010, it had twice as many chain stores as boutiques and three times as many boutiques as art galleries.&lt;ref name=sz&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/nyregion/21gentrify.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=A Contrarian's Lament in a Blitz of Gentrification|date=Feb 21, 2010|work=The New York Times|last=Powell|first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Literature}}
The '''sociology of literature''' is a subfield of the [[sociology of culture]]. It studies the social production of literature and its social implications. A notable example is [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s 1992  ''Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire'', translated by Susan Emanuel as ''Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'' (1996).

==Classical sociology==

None of the 'founding fathers' of sociology produced a detailed study of literature, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[ideology]] has been directed at literature by [[Pierre Macherey]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. [[Max Weber]]'s theory of modernity as cultural rationalisation, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by [[Frankfurt School]] writers such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]. [[Emile Durkheim]]'s view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by [[Robert Escarpit]]. Bourdieu's work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim

==Lukács and the theory of the novel==

An important first step in the sociology of literature was taken by [[Georg Lukács]]'s ''The Theory of the Novel'', first published in German in 1916, in the ''Zeitschrift fur Aesthetik und Allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft''. In 1920 it was republished in book form and this version strongly influenced the Frankfurt School. A second edition, published in 1962, was similarly influential on French structuralism. ''The Theory of the Novel'' argued that, whilst the classical epic poem had given form to a totality of life pregiven in reality by the social integration of classical civilisation, the modern novel had become 'the epic of an age in which the extensive totality of life is no longer directly given'.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1971). ''The Theory of the Novel: A Historico-Philosophical Essay of the Forms of Great Epic Literature'', trans. A. Bostock, London: Merlin Press, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel form is therefore organised around the problematic hero in pursuit of problematic values within a problematic world. 

Lukács's second distinctive contribution to the sociology of literature was ''The Historical Novel'', written in German but first published in Russian in 1937, which appeared in English translation in 1962. Here, Lukács argued that the early 19th century historical novel's central achievement was to represent realistically the differences between pre-capitalist past and capitalist present. This was not a matter of individual talent, but of collective historical experience, because the French Revolution and the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars had made history for the first time a mass experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1962). ''The Historical Novel'', trans. H. and S. Mitchell, London: Merlin Press, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to argue that the success of the 1848 revolutions led to the decline of the historical novel into 'decorative monumentalization' and the 'making private of history'.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1962). ''The Historical Novel'', trans. H. and S. Mitchell, London: Merlin Press, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The key figures in the historical novel were thus those of the early 19th century, especially Sir Walter Scott.

Lukács was an important influence on [[Lucien Goldmann]]'s ''Towards a Sociology of the Novel'', Alan Swingewood's discussion of the sociology of the novel in Part 3 of Laurenson and Swingewood's ''The Sociology of Literature'' and [[Franco Moretti]]'s ''Signs Taken for Wonders''.

==The Frankfurt School==

Founded in 1923, the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt developed a distinctive kind of 'critical sociology' indebted to Marx, Weber and Freud. Leading Frankfurt School critics who worked on literature included Adorno, [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Leo Löwenthal]]. Adorno's ''Notes to Literature'', Benjamin's ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' and Löwentahl's ''Literature and the Image of Man'' were each influential studies in the sociology of literature. Löwenthal continued this work at the University of California, Berkeley, during the 1950s.

Adorno's ''Notes to Literature'' is a collection of essays, the most influential of which is probably 'On Lyric Poetry and Society'. It argued that poetic thought is a reaction against the [[commodification]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] of modern life, citing [[Goethe]] and [[Baudelaire]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T.W. (1991). ''Notes to Literature'', Vol. 1, trans. S.W. Nicholson, New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 37-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin's ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' argued that the extreme 'sovereign violence' of the 16th and 17th century German 'Trauerspiel' (literally mourning play, less literally tragedy) playwrights expressed the historical realities of princely power far better than had classical tragedy.    

Habermas succeeded Adorno to the Chair of Sociology and Philosophy at Frankfurt. Habermas's first major work, ''Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit'' was published in German in 1962, and in English translation as ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' in 1989. It attempted to explain the socio-historical emergence of middle-class public opinion in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Developing a new kind of institutional sociology of literature, it argued that the public sphere had been organised around literary salons in France, learned and literary societies in Germany, and coffee houses in England. These institutions sustained the early novel, newspaper and periodical press.

==The sociology of the avant-garde==

Peter Bürger was Professor of French and Comparative Literature at the University of Bremen. His ''Theorie der Avantgarde'' was published in German in 1974 and in English translation in 1984. Like Habermas, Bürger was interested in the institutional sociology of literature and art. He postulated a historical typology of aesthetic social relations, measured along three main axes, the function of the artwork, its mode of production and its mode of reception.&lt;ref&gt;Bürger, P. (1984). ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'', trans. M. Shaw, Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave him three main kinds of art, sacral, courtly and bourgeois. Bourgeois art, he argued, had as its function individual self-understanding and was produced and received individually. It became a celebration in form of the liberation of art from religion, the court and, eventually, even the bourgeoisie. Modernist art was thus an autonomous social 'institution', the preserve of an increasingly autonomous intellectual class. The 'historical avant-garde' of the inter-war years developed as a movement within and against modernism, he concluded, as an ultimately unsuccessful revolt against precisely this autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Bürger, P. (1984). ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'', trans. M. Shaw, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas adopts a very similar approach in his own account of the avant-garde.

==The sociology of the book trade==

Robert Escarpit was Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Bordeaux and founder of the Centre for the Sociology of Literary Facts. His works included ''The Sociology of Literature'', published in French in 1958 and in English translation in 1971, and ''The Book Revolution'', published in French in 1965 and in English in 1966. In Durkheimian fashion, Escarpit aimed to concern himself only with the externally defined 'social facts' of literature, especially those registered in the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;Escarpit, R. (1971). ''The Sociolology of Literature'', trans. E. Pick, London: Cass, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; His focus fell on the 'community of writers', understood in aggregate as 'generations' and 'teams'. He extended the definition of literature to include all 'non-functional' writing and also insisted that literary success resulted from 'a convergence of intentions between author and reader'.&lt;ref&gt;Escarpit, R. (1971). ''The Sociolology of Literature'', trans. E. Pick, London: Cass, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Analogously empirical studies of the sociology of the book trade were carried out by [[Lewis Coser]] in the United States and [[Peter H. Mann]] in Britain.

[[Lucien Febvre]] and Henri-Jean Martin's ''L'Apparition du livre'', first published in French 1958 and in English translation as ''The Coming of the Book'' in 1976, is strictly speaking a work of social history (Febvre was a leading figure in the ''Annales'' School of historiography). But it is deeply sociological in character - ''Annales'' history was determinedly social scientific - and provides a systematic account of the long-run development of the European book trade (the period covered is 1450–1800).

==Genetic structuralism==

Lucien Goldmann was Director of Studies at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris and founding Director of the Centre for the Sociology of Literature at the Free University of Brussels. Like Escarpit, Goldmann was influenced by Durkheim: hence, his definition of the subject matter of sociology as the 'study of the facts of consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmann, L. (1970). ''The Human Sciences and Philosophy'', trans. H.V. White and R. Anchor, London: Jonathan Cape, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; But he was also interested in developing a sociology of the text. The central task of the literary sociologist, he argued, was to bring out the objective meaning of the literary work by placing it in its historical context, studied as a whole. 

Goldmann defined the creating subject as transindividual, that is, as an instance of Durkheim's 'collective consciousness'. Following Marx and Lukács, however, Goldmann also assumed that group consciousness was normally class consciousnesses. The mediating agency between a social class and the work of literature then became the 'world vision', which binds the individual members of a social class together. ''Le Dieu caché'', his study of [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jean Racine]], was published in French in 1955 and in English translation as ''The Hidden God'' in 1964. It identified 'structural homologies' between the Jansenist 'tragic vision', the textual structures of Pascal's ''Pensées'' and Racine's plays, and the social position of the seventeenth-century 'noblesse de robe'. Goldmann's structuralism was 'genetic' because it sought to trace the genesis of literary structures in extra-literary phenomena.

In 1964 Goldmann published ''Pour une Sociologie du Roman'' translated by Alan Sheridan as ''Towards a Sociology of the Novel'' in 1974. Like Lukács, Goldmann sees the novel as revolving around the problematic hero's search for authentic values in a degraded society. But Goldmann also postulates a 'rigorous homology' between the literary form of the novel and the economic form of the commodity. The early novel, he argues, is concerned with individual biography and the problematic hero, but, as competitive capitalism evolves into monopoly capitalism, the problematic hero progressively disappears. The period between the First and Second World Wars witnesses a temporary experiment with the community as collective hero: Goldmann's example is [[André Malraux]]. But the main line of development is characterised by the effort to write the novel of 'the absence of subjects'. Here, Goldmann's example is the ''nouveau roman'' of [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and [[Nathalie Sarraute]].  

[[Andrew Milner]]'s ''John Milton and the English Revolution'' (1981) is essentially an application of Goldmann's genetic structuralism to the study of seventeenth-century English literature.

==Sociocriticism==

Goldmann's sociology of literature remains significant in itself and as a source of inspiration, both positive and negative, to the kind of 'sociocriticism' developed by Edmond Cros, Pierre Zima and their co-workers in France and Canada.

==Neo-Marxian ideology critique==

Marx used the term ideology to denote the inner connectedness of culture, including literature, and class.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. and F. Engels (1970). ''The German Ideology'', Part 1, trans. W. Lough, C. dutt and C.P. Magill, London: Lawrence and Wishart, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Louis Althusser elaborated on this notion in the early 1970s, arguing that ideology functions so as to constitute biological individuals as social 'subjects' by representing their imaginary relation to their real conditions of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). 'Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Towards and Investigation' in ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays'', trans. B. Brewster, London: New Left Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Althusser himself art was not ideology. But his theory was applied to literature by Macherey in France, Eagleton in Britain and Jameson in the United States. The central novelty of Eagleton's ''Criticism and Ideology'' was its argument that literature could be understood as 'producing' ideology, in the sense of performing it.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, T. (1976). ''Criticism and Ideology'', London: New Left Books, pp. 64-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson's ''The Political Unconscious'' argued that literary analysis can be focussed on three distinct levels, 'text', 'ideologeme' and 'ideology of form', each of which has its socio-historical corollary, in the equivalent 'semantic horizon' of political history, society and mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, F. (1981), ''The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act'', London: Methuen, pp. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; The version of ideology Jameson applies to all three levels is essentially Althusserian. The novelty of his position, however, was to argue for a 'double hermeneutic' simultaneously concerned with ideology and [[utopia]].

Macherey, Eagleton and Jameson were literary critics by profession, but their applications of ideology-critique to literature are sociological in character, insofar as they seek to explain literary phenomena in extra-literary terms.

==Bourdieu==

Bourdieu was Professor of Sociology at the Collège de France and Director of the Centre de Sociologie Européenne. His first major contribution to the sociology of literature (and other arts) was ''La Distinction'', published in French in 1979 and in English translation in 1984. It is based on detailed sociological surveys and ethnographic observation of the social distribution of cultural preferences. Bourdieu identified three main zones of taste, 'legitimate', 'middle-brow' and 'popular', which he found to be dominant respectively in the educated sections of the dominant class, the middle classes and the working classes. He described legitimate taste as centred on an 'aesthetic disposition' to assert the primacy of form over function. The 'popular aesthetic', by contrast, is based on continuity between art and life and 'a deep-rooted demand for participation'.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1984). ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste'', trans. R. Nice, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, its hostility to representations of objects that in real life are either ugly or immoral. Artistic and social 'distinction' are inextricably interrelated, he concluded, because the 'pure gaze' implies a break with ordinary attitudes towards the world and, as such, is a 'social break'.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1984). ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste'', trans. R. Nice, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Rules of Art'' is more specifically focussed on literature, especially the significance of [[Gustave Flaubert]] for the making of modern French literature. Bourdieu postulated a model of 'the field of cultural production' as structured externally in relation to the 'field of power' and internally in relation to two 'principles of hierarchization', the heteronomous and the autonomous. The modern literary and artistic field is a site of contestation between the heteronomous principle, subordinating art to economy, and the autonomous, resisting such subordination. In Bourdieu's map of the French literary field in the late nineteenth century, the most autonomous genre, that is, the least economically profitable - poetry - is to the left, whilst the most heteronomous, the most economically profitable - drama - is to the right, with the novel located somewhere in between. Additionally, higher social status audiences govern the upper end of the field and lower status audiences the lower end.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1996). ''The Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'', trans. S. Emanuel, Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Flaubert's distinctive achievement in ''L'Éducation sentimentale'' was, in Bourdieu's account, to have understood and defined the rules of modern autonomous art.

==The rise of the novel==

One of the earliest English-language contributions to the sociology of literature is ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957) by Ian Watt, Professor of English at Stanford University. For Watt, the novel's 'novelty' was its 'formal realism', the idea 'that the novel is a full and authentic report of human experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, I. (1963). ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; His paradigmatic instances are [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Samuel Richardson]] and [[Henry Fielding]]. Watt argued that the novel's concern with realistically described relations between ordinary individuals, ran parallel to the more general development of philosophical realism, middle-class economic individualism and Puritan individualism. He also argued that the form addressed the interests and capacities of the new middle-class reading public and the new book trade evolving in response to them. As tradesmen themselves, Defoe and Richardson had only to 'consult their own standards' to know that their work would appeal to a large audience.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, I. (1963). ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural materialism==

Raymond Williams was Professor of Drama at Cambridge University and one of the founders of contemporary cultural studies. He described his own distinctive approach as a 'cultural materialism', by which he meant a theory of culture 'as a (social and material) productive process' and of the arts 'as social uses of material means of production'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1980). ''Problems in Materialism and Culture: Selected Essays'', London: Verso, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a clearly sociological, as distinct from literary-critical, perspective: hence, its most general exposition in the United States as ''The Sociology of Culture'' and in Britain as ''Culture'', a 1981 title in Fontana's New Sociology series. Although Williams's interests ranged widely across the whole field of literary and cultural studies, his major work was concentrated on literature and drama. He was thus a sociologist of culture, specialising in the sociology of literature. 

In ''The Long Revolution'' (1961), Williams developed pioneering accounts of the sociology of the book trade, the sociology of authorship and the sociology of the novel. In ''The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence'' (1970), he argued that the modern novel articulated a distinctively modern 'structure of feeling', the key problem of which was the 'knowable community'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1974). ''The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence'', London: Chatto and Windus, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Country and the City'' (1973) he developed a social history of English country-house poetry, aimed at demystifying the idealisations of rural life contained in the literature: 'It is what the poems are: not country life but social compliment; the familiar hyperboles of the aristocracy and its attendants'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1973). ''The Country and the City'', New York: Oxford University Press, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Marxism and Literature'' (1977) - simultaneously a critique of both Marxism and 'Literature' - is an extensive formal elaboration of Williams's own theoretical system.   

[[Alan Sinfield]]'s ''Faultlines: Cultural Materialism and the Politics of Dissident Reading'' (1992) and ''Literature, Politics and Culture in Postwar Britain'' (1997) are both clearly indebted to Williams. So, too, is Andrew Milner's ''Literature, Culture and Society'' (2005).

==World-systems theory==

Franco Moretti was, by turn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Salerno, of Comparative Literature at Verona University and of English and Comparative Literature at Stanford University. His first book, ''Signs Taken for Wonders'' (1983) was subtitled ''Essays in the Sociology of Literary Forms'' and was essentially qualitative in method. His later work, however, became progressively more quantitative. 

Applying [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s [[world-systems theory]] to literature, Moretti argued, in ''Atlas of the European Novel'' (1998), that the nineteenth-century literary economy had comprised 'three Europes', with France and Britain at the core, most countries in the periphery and a variable semiperiphery located in between. Measured by the volume of translations in national bibliographies, he found that French novelists were more successful in the Catholic South and British in the Protestant North, but that the whole continent nonetheless read the leading figures from both.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, F. (1998). ''Atlas of the European Novel 1800–1900'', London: Verso, pp. 174, 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt; London and Paris 'rule the entire continent for over a century', he concluded, publishing half or more of all European novels.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, F. (1998). ''Atlas of the European Novel 1800–1900'', London: Verso, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moretti's theses prompted much subsequent controversy, collected together in Christopher Prendergast's edited collection ''Debating World Literature'' (2004). Moretti himself expanded on the argument in his ''Distant Reading'' (2013).

==Recent developments==

Building on earlier work in the production of culture, reception aesthetics and cultural capital, the sociology of literature has recently concentrated on readers' construction of meaning. New developments include studying the relationship between literature and group identities; concerning institutional and reader-response analysis; reintroducing the role of intentions of the author in literature; reconsidering the role of ethics and morality in literature &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recovering Morality: Pragmatic Sociology and Literary Studies | journal = New Literary History | first1 = S.

The sociology of literature has also recently taken an interest in the global inequality between First-World and Third-World authors, where the latter tend to be strongly dependent on the editorial decisions of publishers in Paris, London or New York and are often excluded from participation in the global literary market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The World Republic of Letters |last1= Casanova |first1= Pascale |year= 2004 |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_literary_history/toc/nlh.41.2.html New Literary History] devoted a special issue to new approaches to the sociology of literature in Spring 2010.

{{Distinguish|Socialist Art}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F088809-0038, Berlin, East Side Gallery.jpg|thumb|''[[My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love]]'' by [[Dmitri Vrubel]] on [[Berlin Wall]], 1991]]

Often referred to as “Soviet Pop Art”, '''Sots Art''' (short for Socialist Art) originated in the [[Soviet Union]] in the early 1970s as a reaction against the official aesthetic doctrine of the state—"[[Socialist Realism]]", which was marked by reverential depictions of workers, peasants living happily in their communes, and a young, fit [[Joseph Stalin]].

[[Vitaly Komar]] and [[Alexander Melamid]], inventors of the term “Sots Art”, worked in advertising and were frequently employed to use Socialist Realist aesthetics in their ads and brochures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russian.psydeshow.org/images/komar-melamid.htm |title=The Post-Utopian Art of Vitaly Komar &amp; Aleksandr Melamid (Sots Art: 1970s, '80s)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 1972, Komar and Melamid were putting together a design for the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]]' upcoming [[summer camp]] session.

While putting together the signs, which were supposed to convey the strong ideological [[piety]] of the Pioneers, Komar and Melamid entertained themselves by using the Socialist Realism tropes they were employing but filling in the content with people they knew, such as their wives and even themselves.

[[Komar and Melamid]] continued tweaking well-known Soviet symbols and icons, often replacing [[Vladimir Lenin]] and Stalin’s portraits with their own, and signing famous Soviet slogans and catch-phrases with their own autographs.

According to [[Arthur Danto]], Sots Art's attack on official styles is similar in intent to American [[pop art]] and German [[capitalist realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Coleman Danto, ''After the End of Art: contemporary art and the pale of history'', Princeton University Press, 1997, p126. {{ISBN|0-691-00299-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kolozsvár főtere 1840-ben.jpg|thumb|In 1840]]
The '''[[Saint Michael|St. Michael]]'s Church''' ({{lang-ro|Biserica Sfântul Mihail}}, {{lang-hu|Szent Mihály-templom}}) is a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic-style]] [[Romanian Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church in [[Cluj-Napoca]]. It is the second largest church (after the [[Black Church]] of [[Brașov]]) in the geographical region of [[Transylvania]], [[Romania]]. The nave is 50 meters long and 24 meters wide, the apse is 20&amp;times;10 m. The tower with its height of 76 meter (80 meter including the cross) is the highest one in Transylvania. The western portal is decorated with the three [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] as [[King of Hungary]], as [[King of Bohemia]] and as [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

The construction was begun probably in place of the [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] Chapel. The financing of the church was partly done by the citizens, partly from the income of indulgences. (The first related document from 1349, signed by the archbishop of [[Avignon]] and fifteen other bishops grants the indulgence for those contributing to the illumination and furniture of the Saint Michael Church.) The construction was completed between 1442-1447, the old tower was built between 1511-1545. The tower that stands today was erected in 1862.

The church was converted with the population to Protestantism between 1545-1566. Then the more radical [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] patry took it over in the period 1566-1716. At last, it was confiscated in the [[counter reformation]] by the [[Habsburg]] government supported Catholic Church.

The oldest of its sections is the [[altar]], inaugurated in 1390, while the newest part is the [[clock tower]], which was built in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style (1837-1862).

Some important historical events that took place in the church:
* 26 July 1551: [[Isabella Jagiełło|Queen Isabella of Hungary]] gives the [[Hungarian Crown]] to General Castaldo, the deputy of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I.]], and cedes with that Hungary and Transylvania
* 23 October 1556: Queen Isabella returns and takes back the reign of Transylvania, in the name of her son, the child [[John II Sigismund Zápolya]]
* 27 March 1601: the third investiture of [[Sigismund Báthory]] as Prince of Transylvania 
* 12 February 1607: election of [[Sigismund Rákóczi]] as Prince of Transylvania 
* 7 March 1608: election of [[Gabriel Báthory]] as Prince of Transylvania 
* 13 October 1613: election of [[Gabriel Bethlen]] as Prince of Transylvania 
* 18 May 1944: the speech of [[Áron Márton]], bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in Transylvania in which he strongly condemned the deportation of Jews.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">'''Symphony No. 1''' is a [[symphony]] in one movement by the American composer [[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Christopher Rouse]].  The work was commissioned by [[David Zinman]] and the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]], completed August 26, 1986, and premiered in [[Baltimore]], January 21, 1988.  The piece is dedicated to Rouse's friend and fellow composer [[John Harbison]].&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;[[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Rouse, Christopher]]. [http://www.christopherrouse.com/sym1press.html Symphony No. 1: Program Note by the Composer]. 1986. Retrieved March 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The symphony is composed in a single adagio movement and has a duration of approximately 27 minutes.  The work was conceived, in part, as a companion to Rouse's 1984 [[orchestra]]l piece ''[[Gorgon (composition)|Gorgon]]''.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

===Style and influences===
The music quotes [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7]].  In the program notes to the score, Rouse commented on his inspirations and the use of Bruckner, saying, "In my Symphony No. 1 I have attempted to pay conscious homage to many of those I especially admire as composers of adagios -- [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], [[Karl Amadeus Hartmann|Hartmann]], [[Allan Pettersson|Pettersson]], and [[William Schuman|Schuman]], for example -- but only one is recognizably quoted (the famous opening theme from the second movement of Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, played both in the original and here by a quartet of [[Wagner Tuba]]s)."&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The piece is scored for two [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (2nd doubling on [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s (2nd doubling on [[oboe d'amore]] and [[English horn]]), two [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling on [[bass clarinet]]), two [[bassoon]]s (2nd doubling on [[contrabassoon]]), four [[French horn]]s (all doubling [[Wagner Tuba]]s), three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], percussion (three players), and [[String section|strings]] ([[violin]]s I &amp; II, [[viola]]s, [[violoncello]]s, and [[double bass]]es).&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Music critic David Hurwitz described the work as "wholly gripping and vividly contrasted despite the slow pacing and prevailing gloomy atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hurwitz |first=David  |title=Rouse: Symphony No. 1; Clarinet concerto |work=Classics Today |date=October 17, 2008 |url=http://www.classicstoday.com/review/review-14612/ |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewing the 1992 [[Los Angeles]] premiere of the symphony, Daniel Cariaga of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "In the 27 intense minutes of this L.A. premiere performance, the Symphony sometimes loudly achieved a finally quiet victory over pessimism, all the while engaging the observer in its progress to that not-predictable end.  [Rouse] calls this piece tonal, and it may be, if one counts the number of bars in which consonance, rather than grating dissonance, holds sway. But what one remembers is the bite of atonality on the way to sound-resolutions in this gripping, abstract musical scenario."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cariaga |first=Daniel |title=MUSIC REVIEW : L.A. Philharmonic Program Salutes Heroism: The concert of works by Wagner, Christopher Rouse and Richard Strauss will be repeated tonight at the Performing Arts Center. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 1, 1992 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-01/entertainment/ca-835_1_christopher-rouse-and-richard-strauss |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Calum MacDonald of ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'' was less favorable, describing the work as "inhabiting a blackness somewhere beyond Shostakovich and Pettersson" and adding, "the single-movement First Symphony (1986) takes a familiar theme from Bruckner’s Seventh and subjects its aspiration to all manner of ironic and negative underminings and reversals, ending in exhausted elegy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=MacDonald |first=Calum |title=Rouse: Iscariot; Clarinet Concerto; Symphony No. 1 |work=[[BBC Music Magazine]] |date=January 20, 2012 |url=http://www.classical-music.com/review/rouse-iscariot-0 |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony won the first place 1988 [[Kennedy Center]] [[Kennedy Center Friedheim Award|Friedheim Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Valdes |first=Lesley |title=Christopher Rouse Symphony Wins A $5,000 Prize |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]] |date=November 1, 1988 |url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-11-01/news/26245696_1_prize-performances-baltimore-symphony |accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Hallé''' is an English [[symphony orchestra]] based in Manchester, England. It supports a choir, youth choir, youth training choir, children's choir and a youth orchestra, and releases its recordings on its own record label, though it has occasionally released recordings on [[Angel Records]] and [[EMI]].  Since 1996 the orchestra has been resident at the [[Bridgewater Hall]] in Manchester.

==History==
In May 1857 the pianist and conductor [[Charles Hallé]] set up an orchestra to perform at the Manchester [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], which it did until October.  Hallé decided to continue working with the orchestra as a formal organisation, and it gave its first concert under those auspices on 30&amp;nbsp;January 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/2/Royal-Liverpool-Philharmonic-Society/SHP_ADJ_175173.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105084922/https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/2/Royal-Liverpool-Philharmonic-Society/SHP_ADJ_175173.aspx |archivedate=2017-01-05 |df= }}

&lt;/ref&gt;  The orchestra's first home was the [[Free Trade Hall]]. By 1861 the orchestra was in financial trouble, and it performed only two concerts that year.&lt;ref name="Hewett"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml;jsessionid=CW4IP5KH5U3VDQFIQMFCFF4AVCBQYIV0?xml=/arts/2008/01/07/bmelder107.xml | title=Manchester's Hallé: Knees-up for our oldest orchestra | work=Telegraph | author=Ivan Hewett | date=7 January 2008 | accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/features/article3326598.ece | title=How an orchestra changed my life  | work=The Independent | author=Howard Jacobson | date=11 January 2008 | accessdate=2008-01-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111215658/http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/features/article3326598.ece &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hallé-first-concert.jpg|thumb|left|alt=old newspaper classified advertisement with twenty lines of text in small type|The Hallé's first programme (1858)]][[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] served as music director from 1899 to 1911. During his tenure, the orchestra gave the first performance of the [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|Symphony No. 1]] of Sir [[Edward Elgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Richter-Hungarian-conductor|title=Hans Richter|accessdate=2017-07-04|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 the orchestra was again in crisis, having diminished in size to 30 players.&lt;ref name="Hewett"/&gt;  Over the next 27&amp;nbsp;years, from 1943 to 1970, the orchestra's next music director, Sir [[John Barbirolli]], restored the Hallé to national prominence.  Together, they made many recordings, including the first recording of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' ''[[Symphony No. 8 (Vaughan Williams)|Symphony No. 8]]'', of which they also gave the first performance.  During Barbirolli's tenure, one of the most notable orchestra members was concertmaster Martin Milner, who served in that capacity from 1958 to 1987.  Barbirolli regarded Milner as his "right-hand man" and once wrote in appreciation to him: "You are the finest leader I have ever had in my fairly long career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,336724,00.html | title=Martin Milner: Barbirolli's right-hand man who led the Hallé through arduous times | work=The Guardian | author=Clive Smart | date=27 June 2000 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kent Nagano]] was principal conductor of the orchestra from 1992 to 1999.  The orchestra moved from the Free Trade Hall to the Bridgewater Hall in 1996, as its primary concert venue.  During his tenure, Nagano received criticism for his expensive and ambitious programming, as well as his conducting fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,299041,00.html | title=Nagano passes on Halle baton | work=The Guardian | author=John Ezard | date=25 May 1999 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, poor financial management at the orchestra separately contributed to the fiscal troubles of the orchestra. The orchestra faced major financial problems during the late 1990s, including a £1.3&amp;nbsp;million deficit in 1998, to the point where the existence of the orchestra was threatened with loss of funding from the Arts Council and ultimately bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/article994944.ece | title=A city reborn | work=The Times | author=Richard Morrison | date=14 January 2004 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jodrell Bank Live 2013 14.jpg|thumb|right|The Hallé performing at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]].]]
During 1997 there was an eight-month period when the orchestra had no executive director.  Leslie Robinson served for two years as chief executive after that period, starting changes to the orchestra to start to bring under control the orchestra's financial troubles.  These included public fund-raising, which netted £2&amp;nbsp;million, cutting the number of people on the orchestra board in half, and reducing the number of musicians in the orchestra from 98 to 80. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Since 1999, the orchestra's chief executive has been John Summers, who continued Robinson's fiscal practices to restore greater financial security to the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/career_and_jobs/secretarial/article1050437.ece | title=In perfect harmony | work=The Times | author= | date=24 March 2004 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Arts Council awarded the orchestra a £3.8&amp;nbsp;million grant to allow it to pay off accumulated debts and increase musician salaries, which had been frozen for 4&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,510258,00.html | title=Troubled orchestra gets £3.8m fillip | work=The Guardian | author=David Ward | date=21 June 2001 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2000 Sir [[Mark Elder]] took up the position of music director, having been appointed to the post in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Fiachra Gibbons | title=Miracle man to stir Halle giant | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,292269,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=1999-06-07 | accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His concerts with the orchestra have received consistently positive reviews, and he is generally regarded as having restored the orchestra to high critical and musical standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article623923.ece | title=Orchestras: these are the champions | work=The Times | author=Richard Morrison | date=1 September 2006 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004 Elder signed a contract to extend his tenure through 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article577628.ece | title=Opera: Armed for action | work=The Times | author=Hugh Canning | date=16 October 2005 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in May 2009 the Hallé announced a further extension to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Cullingford, "Elder renews Hallé contract until 2015".

One of the orchestra's recent ideas was to try to find alternative stage dress to the traditional "penguin suits", but this idea did not come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=David Ward | title=Halle keeps penguin suits for new season | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/may/16/arts.artsnews1 | work=The Guardian | date=2003-05-16 | accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The orchestra has also begun to issue new CD recordings under its own label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=David Ward | title=Hallé opts to record on own label | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,718534,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=2002-05-20 | accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the orchestra began a series of recordings in collaboration with the film composer, [[Benson Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/_bensontaylor/status/852265750601629697|title=BENSON TAYLOR on Twitter|website=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006 the orchestra was forced to cancel a planned tour of the United States because of the cost and administrative difficulties in obtaining visas for the musicians, a result of the tougher visa regulations intended to combat potential terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbcmusicmagazine.com/newsRead.asp?id=19331&amp;scrollCount=12 | title=Visa hurdle forces Hallé to cancel US tour | work=BBC Music Magazine | author= | date=5 April 2006 | accessdate=2007-05-19 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928185634/http://www.bbcmusicmagazine.com/newsRead.asp?id=19331&amp;scrollCount=12 | archivedate=28 September 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orchestra appointed its first-ever principal guest conductor, Cristian Mandeal, in 2006.  He served in this post until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.connaughtartists.com/index.php/cristian-mandeal/&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2008, the orchestra announced the appointment of [[Markus Stenz]] as its second and next principal guest conductor, starting in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.maxinerobertson.com/artists/markus-stenz/&lt;/ref&gt; Past assistant conductors have included [[Edward Gardner (conductor)|Edward Gardner]], [[Rory Macdonald (conductor)|Rory Macdonald]], [[Andrew Gourlay]], and [[Ewa Strusińska]] (2008–2010), the first female conductor named to a UK assistant conductorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Stephen Bates | title=People | url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/feb/21/3 | work=The Guardian | date=2008-02-21 | accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2016, Jonathon Heyward became the Hallé's new assistant conductor, whose duties include musical direction of the Hallé Youth Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jonathonheyward.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  The current leader of the Hallé is Lyn Fletcher.

'''''The Intruder''''' is a 1962 American film, directed by [[Roger Corman]] and starring [[William Shatner]]. It is adapted from a 1959 novel by [[Charles Beaumont]]. The story depicts the machinations of a racist named Adam Cramer (portrayed by Shatner), who arrives in the fictitious small Southern town of Caxton in order to incite white townspeople to [[racial violence]] against black townspeople and [[Brown v. Board of Education|court-ordered school integration]].

The film is also known under its US reissue titles as '''''I Hate Your Guts!''''' and '''''Shame''''', and '''''The Stranger''''' in the UK release.

==Plot==
In the early 1960s, Adam Cramer arrives in the small [[Southern United States|Southern]] town of Caxton with an agenda that soon becomes clear. Caxton's "whites only" high school is about to undergo forced [[desegregation]] and admit black students due to a court order, and Cramer, purportedly working on behalf of an organization called The [[Patrick Henry]] Society, is a racist working to incite the white townspeople to strongly and possibly violently resist the desegregation. Although Cramer is not from the area or even from the South (shown by his lack of a Southern accent), he quickly charms most of the people he meets, presenting himself as a confident, smooth-talking, well-mannered gentleman. He quickly convinces wealthy landowner Verne Shipman to back him, and seduces Ella, the pretty teenage daughter of the local newspaper editor Tom McDaniel.

The white locals are not happy about having black students attend the "white school", but prior to Cramer's arrival, most were prepared to grudgingly comply with the law. However, after Cramer, with Shipman's help, makes an inflammatory speech in front of the town hall and organizes a [[cross burning]] in the black neighborhood, the whites are moved to violence, first threatening a black family who happen to be driving through town after Cramer's speech, and then blowing up the local black church, killing the preacher. After the church bombing, Cramer is jailed, but the locals join together to get him quickly released.

Apart from his racist rabblerousing, Cramer also seduces Vi, the emotionally unstable wife of traveling salesman Sam Griffin, Cramer's next door neighbor at the Caxton hotel. Vi, ashamed of her lapse, leaves Griffin, who figures out what happened and comes after Cramer with Cramer's own gun. The terrified Cramer's confident facade crumbles for the first time; when he manages to get the gun and point it back at Griffin, he is too weak to pull the trigger, and Griffin reveals that he already removed the bullets from the gun before the confrontation. Griffin predicts that Cramer will soon lose control of the racially charged tensions that he has ignited in the town.

McDaniel, after seeing Cramer in action, realizes that his own sympathies are with the blacks and feels compelled to stand with them against the racists. After the preacher is killed, the families of the black students hesitate to send their children back to the white high school for fear of more violence, but McDaniel encourages them, and walks the students to school himself through the town past the disapproving glares of other white townspeople. After the students enter the school, several townspeople confront and severely beat McDaniel, causing him to be hospitalized with broken ribs, internal injuries and the loss of his eye. Cramer secretly meets with Ella, who is upset and worried about her father, and convinces her that the townspeople are planning to kill her father and that the only way to save him is for Ella to do what Cramer says.

Ella, following Cramer's directions, lures her black classmate Joey Green to a storage room on the pretext of helping her get some heavy boxes from a high shelf. She then screams and falsely accuses him of attempting to rape her. Joey denies it, and the principal believes him, but also knows that most people will believe Ella. An angry mob led by Cramer and Shipman forms in front of the school. Joey, rather than escape out the back door with the principal and attempt to reach the safety of the sheriff's office, insists on going out to confront the mob. Shipman beats Joey and the mob begins to [[lynching|lynch]] him on the school playground [[swing (seat)|swing set]]. Suddenly Griffin appears with Ella, who confesses that she lied at Cramer's instigation in order to save her father's life. In front of the mob, Ella apologizes to Joey, telling him that Cramer said he would not be harmed and would only be expelled from the white school. Realizing that they have been manipulated by Cramer, the townspeople slowly walk away, ignoring Cramer's exhortations, until only he and Griffin are left on the empty playground. Griffin tells Cramer that his "work" in Caxton is finished and that he should catch the next bus out of town.

== Production ==
 
The novel was published in 1958 and film rights were optioned by Seven Arts.&lt;ref name="AIP"&gt;Mark McGee, ''Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures'', McFarland, 1996 p187-189&lt;/ref&gt; They were unable to get the project off the ground, and Corman bought the rights in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;FILMLAND EVENTS: CORMAN HAS ACQUIRED RIGHTS TO 'INTRUDER' ''Los Angeles Times'' (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 04 Jan 1960: C15.&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to get the film made with producer [[Edward Small]] for [[United Artists]] but Small pulled out.&lt;ref name="AIP"/&gt; He then envisioned the film costing $500,000 and starring [[Tony Randall]].&lt;ref&gt;Todd McCarthy, 'Movies: A Swarm of B's From Roger Corman Corman Festival', ''Los Angeles Times'' (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 05 Feb 1978: m31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was unable to raise enough money, with the movie being turned down by UA, [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]] and [[American International Pictures|AIP]]. Corman managed to raise some funds from Pathé Labs, with Corman and his brother Gene putting in the balance.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Corman &amp; Jim Jerome, ''How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never lost a Dime'', Muller, 1990 p 98&lt;/ref&gt; Gene Corman later said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We put our hearts, our souls - and what few people do - our money into this picture. Everybody asked us 'Why would you make this picture?' as if to say why try to do something you believe in when everything else is so profitable. Obviously we did it because we wanted to, and we think it's a damn good job.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;CHAINED BY TIMIDITY: 'The Intruder' Seeks Release

It was shot in [[black and white]] over three and a half weeks on location in southeast [[Missouri]]. Some of the production took place in [[East Prairie, Missouri|East Prairie]], [[Charleston, Missouri|Charleston]] and [[Sikeston, Missouri|Sikeston]]. Corman presented a watered-down version of the script to the townspeople, but they still did not like it. Before it was finished, local people objected to the film's portrayal of [[racism]] and [[Racial segregation|segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;'Remembering The Intruder,' featurette with accompanying the DVD Special Edition https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0055019&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
The movie received good reviews but encountered difficulty obtaining release. Pathé released it in New York, but eventually pulled out and the Corman brothers took over distributing the movie themselves.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; Although it had a budget of only $80,000, it was until recently the only Corman film ever to lose money. The $6,000 paid by the recent documentary ''Charles Beaumont: The Twilight Zone’s Magic Man'' finally put it in the black.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060828105913/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/06/corman.html Dixon, Wheeler Winston (August 2005) "Roger Corman" ''Senses of Cinema''] from Web Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Nostalgia of the Infinite''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Metaphysical art|metaphysical painter]] [[Giorgio de Chirico]].

The subject of the painting is a large tower. The scene is struck by low, angular evening light. In the foreground below the tower are two small shadowy figures resembling those in future works by [[Salvador Dalí]]. This painting is the most famous example of the tower theme which appears in several of de Chirico’s works.

Although the painting is dated 1911, this date is generally held in question. It has been speculated by [[the Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] that it was created from 1912 to 1913 while the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School for Communication]] suggests 1913–14. According to art historian Robert Hughes, the painting draws inspiration from  the [[Mole Antonelliana]] in [[Turin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first= Robert|year=1980|title=The Shock of the New|location=New York|publisher= McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting, amongst other works by Giorgio de Chirico, influenced the painting by [[Fumito Ueda]] for the front cover of the [[video game]] ''[[Ico]]'' used in the Japanese and European versions of the game.

'''''The Procuress''''' is the name given to a number of similar paintings by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] painter [[Dirck van Baburen]]. The painting is in the [[Caravaggio|Caravaggiesque]] style of the [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Utrecht school]].

==The painting==
The painting shows three figures, a prostitute on the left, the client in the middle and the procuress on the right pointing to her palm to indicate that she is expecting payment. The client is holding a coin between his fingers as he puts his arm around the prostitute, who is playing a [[lute]]. The painting is an example of the popular genre known as ''Bordeeltjes'', or brothel scenes (see also the overlapping genre of [[Merry company]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Schneider, ''Vermeer, 1632–1675: veiled emotions'', Taschen, 2000, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cropped, close-up figures close to the [[picture plane]] against a flat blank background are typical of [[Utrecht Caravaggism]].&lt;ref name = "jmm"/&gt;

There are at least three versions of the painting. The versions in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121011141312/http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/collectie/zoeken/asset.jsp?id=SK-C-612&amp;lang=en Rijksmuseum catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-procuress-33414 |title=MFA catalogue |publisher=Mfa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; are attributed to [[Dirck van Baburen]] or his studio. One copy of the painting was owned by [[Maria Thins]], mother-in-law of [[Johannes Vermeer]], who reproduced it in the background of two of his own paintings.  A copy owned by the [[Courtauld Institute]] in London has been identified as the work of the forger [[Han van Meegeren]]. This was featured in the third episode of the BBC TV series, ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''.&lt;ref name="FoF3"&gt;{{Cite episode

==Vermeer==
[[File:Vermeer The concert.JPG|thumb|left|Vermeer's ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' in which ''The Procuress'' hangs on the wall at the upper right]]
[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Zittende Klavecimbelspeelster (1673-1675).jpg|thumb|Vermeer's ''[[Lady Seated at a Virginal]]'', in which ''The Procuress'' hangs on the wall behind the figure]]

One of these paintings was owned by [[Vermeer]]'s mother-in-law, and it may have been an influence on one of his own early paintings on a similar subject, also known as ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656).&lt;ref name = "jmm"&gt;John Michael Montias, ''Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History'', Princeton University Press, 1991, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in the background of two of Vermeer's later paintings, ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' (c.1664) and ''[[Lady Seated at a Virginal]]'' (c.1670). In both of these later paintings the blatant lust depicted by Baburen is contrasted with the genteel, but erotically charged, middle-class world occupied by Vermeer's women. The contrast between the images may also imply "a more general association between music and love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/johannes-vermeer-a-young-woman-seated-at-a-virginal |title=National Gallery |publisher=National Gallery |date=2013-09-08 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermeer sets up a series of contrasts between his own delicate, restrained style and Baburen's vulgar realism. According to Michael Wayne Cole and Mary Pardo this represents Vermeer's own move away from such low-life subjects. The older, cruder style of Baburen is relegated to the background, "eclipsing it with the more modern kind of genteel subject that Vermeer would soon paint exclusively".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wayne Cole, Mary Pardo, ''Inventions of the studio, Renaissance to Romanticism'', UNC Press Books, 2005, p.206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Courtauld Institute version==
[[File:The_Procuress_forgery_by_Han_van_Meegeren_from_the_Courtauld_Gallery.jpg|left|thumb|The Courtauld Institute copy, believed to be a van Meegeren forgery]]
In 1960, [[Geoffrey Webb]] presented a version of the painting to the Courtauld Institute. At the end of the [[Second World War]], he had been an allied officer in Europe investigating art works looted by the Nazis. He believed it was a fake painted by [[Han van Meegeren]], and he presented it to the Courtauld as such. In his own defense, van Meegeren claimed that the painting had been bought in an antique shop by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8612890/Master-forgery-17th-century-work-exposed-as-a-fake.html |title=report in the Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2011-07-02 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the painting was initially believed to be a fake, its authenticity remained controversial, and in 2009 a scientific study indicated that the painting was likely to be genuine, as no modern pigments were found. A spokesperson for the gallery stated that they were "surprised" by the results, but that the evidence indicated that it was "likely to be a 17th-century painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Akbar |first=Arifa |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/fake-painting-revealed-as-dutch-masterpiece-1794254.html |title=Independent article |publisher=Independent article |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following this, the BBC TV programme ''Fake or Fortune?'' conducted a further investigation.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; The resulting film was first shown July 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; [[Philip Mould]] and [[Fiona Bruce]] traveled to Amsterdam where they obtained samples of the paints used by van Meegeren.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; These included an artificial resin which turned out to be [[Bakelite]].&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; The use of Bakelite had the effect of hardening the paint and thus making it difficult to detect that it was new.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; Chemical analysis showed Bakelite in the Courtauld painting, thus confirming that it was a modern forgery.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; Van Meegeren is the only forger known to have used this technique, so the painting was attributed to him.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; It was probably intended to be used as a prop in Vermeer forgeries.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; It is more valuable as a van Meegeren forgery than as a 17th-century studio copy.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt;

'''William Hart''' (March 31, 1823 – June 17, 1894), was a [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born [[United States|American]] [[landscape art|landscape]] and cattle [[Painting|painter]], and [[Hudson River School]] artist. His younger brother, [[James McDougal Hart]], and his younger sister, [[Julie Hart Beers]], were also Hudson River School artists. He studied under [[Jules-Joseph Lefebvre]].

==Life and work==
William Hart (sometimern in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], [[Scotland]], and was taken to [[Albany, New York]] in 1831 by his family. He was apprenticed to a decorative painter in [[Albany, New York]] and [[Troy, New York]], and his first artistic experience was in decorating the panels of coaches with [[landscape art|landscape]]s. He also spent time as a portrait painter, likely after 1834.  He toured the mid-western States, predominantly Michigan, during the late 1830s seeking portrait commissions, and was unsuccessful.  He exhibited his first work at the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1848, and returned to Albany permanently in 1849.  In late 1849, he was underwritten by a Dr. Ormsby to travel to Europe to study landscape painting.  He painted primarily in Scotland until 1852, after which he returned to [[Albany, New York]], and then in 1853, moved to [[New York City]]. By the time he returned to America, Hart had shifted his energy to landscape painting. Like most of the major American landscape artists of the time, Hart settled in New York City, where he opened a studio in the [[Tenth Street Studio Building]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartproject.org/#!thehistory/ckni|title=Catalogue of works by landscape painter William Hart and James M. Hart|work=hartproject.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224221005/http://www.hartproject.org/#!thehistory/ckni|archivedate=2014-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1865, he was elected President of the Brooklyn Academy of Design.

Hart a full member of the [[National Academy]] in 1858, and continued to show his paintings there regularly through the mid-1870s. He also exhibited at the Brooklyn Art Association and at major exhibitions around the country. Hart was a member of the [[American Watercolor Society]], and was its President from 1870 to 1873.

[[Image:William Hart - Mount Madison from the Androscoggin River.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Madison]] from the [[Androscoggin River]]]]

His mature landscape style embraced the mannerism of the late Hudson River School by emphasizing light and atmosphere. He became particularly adept at depicting angled sunlight and foreground shadow; the best examples of this are:  ''Seashore Morning'' (1866) in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York;  ''After the Storm'' (1860s) in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]; ''The Last Gleam'' (1865) in the [[High Museum of Art]] in Atlanta, Georgia;  ''Sunset in the Valley'' (1870) in a private collection, featured on pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83 of ''All That is Glorious Around Us: Paintings from the Hudson River School'' by John Driscoll.

Later works are indicative of Hart's prolific and occasionally formulaic paintings of cows. Cattle were a popular motif in Hudson River School art, and nearly every artist included them in at least some of their landscapes as diminutive symbols of man's harmonious relationship with nature. Some artists, including William and James Hart along with [[Thomas Bigelow Craig]], made a specialty of cow portraits. These paintings, which were very popular with late-19th-century American collectors, typically featured several cattle grazing or watering in the foreground or middle distance with the landscape playing a supporting role as a bucolic backdrop.  G.W. Sheldon wrote in 1879 that Hart's later landscapes "may  be found in almost all the auction-rooms where pictures are sold, and in almost all the principal private collections in the Atlantic cities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/americanpainters00shel#page/n7/mode/2up|title=American Painters|location=N.Y.|year=1879|pages=50, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart was also known for his exceptional etchings. In 1883 the Art Department of the New England Manufacturers' and Mechanics' Institute, Boston, held an important exhibition of contemporary American art. Concentrating largely upon American drawings and etchings the exhibition catalogue listed 731 important works of original art. William Hart's iconic etching, "Naponock (Naponoch) Scenery, Ulster County, New York", was first exhibited at this exposition and is listed in the catalogue under number 362.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Catalogue_of_the_art_department_of_the_N.html?id=g4IEAAAAYAAJ|title=Catalogue of the art department of the New England Manufacturers' and Mechanics' Institute ... Boston, Mass., U.S.A., 1883}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An oil on canvas work from 1883, also of Naponock (Naponoch) scenery, is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art - a direct bequest from Hart's daughter, Jessie Hart White.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/11011|title=William Hart - Scene at Napanoch - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|work=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, Hart painted ''A Quiet Nook'' which is now in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=10008|title=A Quiet Nook by William M. Hart / American Art|work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Albany Institute of History &amp; Art]] has in its collection over 400 sketches, water colors, and sketch books which were retained en masse from the artist's studio after his death, by the family of the subsequent donor.  Since each piece is signed, dated, and annotated with the location of its subject, many previously unsigned and unattributed paintings are now being associated with the artist. The museum is preparing an exhibition of this material.

Hart died in [[Mount Vernon, New York]], on June 17, 1894. His daughter Jessie Hart White was the mother of [[Elwyn Brooks White|E. B. White]]. He is interred at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]].
