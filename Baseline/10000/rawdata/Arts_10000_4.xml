==Plot==
On an Arctic flight the crew of a RAF transport aircraft overflies a crashed aircraft. Although a survivor is spotted, the crew realizes that a rescue is not possible and rules out a landing. Rupert Royce ([[Sam Waterston]]), a U.S. meteorologist aboard the flight, volunteers to parachute to the ice with first aid supplies to treat the survivor.

Bringing supplies with him, Royce lands near the wreckage and finds Averyanov (Aleksandr Potapov), a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] navigator, the sole survivor who is injured and unable to be moved. Intending to wait until further help arrives, Royce makes repairs on the shattered aircraft, but soon realizes help is not coming, as the aircraft is far off course. The ice shifts below the wreckage, further complicating their survival.

When a blizzard strands the two men and forces them to survive on their own, they have to accept that different cultural backgrounds cannot jeopardize their survival. As supplies run low and a leaking heater nearly kills them, releasing deadly carbon monoxide into their small enclosure, Royce begins to make plans for both of them to find a way to reach civilization, the nearest settlement, 200 miles away. The isolation, ever-present wolves and dwindling supplies leaves Royce little option.

Setting out into the wilderness with an improvised sled to carry the injured airman, Averyanov urges Royce to save himself, and not to risk his own life in a vain attempt to save someone who will likely die soon anyway. Royce refuses and strives mightily to save the two "captives" of the  wild.

==Production==
''A Captive in the Land'' was filmed in an island in the [[Onega Bay]] of the [[White Sea]]: [[Kiy Island]] and the Lena Rover, involved two sessions of location shooting. Sam Waterston had to return to Russia to complete the film after Aleksandr Potapov suffered a heart attack, causing a suspension of filming.&lt;ref&gt;Budd 2001, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, Charles. [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-01/entertainment/ca-281_1_sam-waterston "Sam Waterston: A Labor of Love for a Versatile Everyman : Acting: The skilled performer is still waiting for his star to really shine with the studios. He's just finished work on a Soviet-American film project."] ''LA TImes'', June 1, 1990. Retrieved: December 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''A Captive in the Land'' was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/118/year/1991.html "Festival de Cannes: A Captive in the Land."] ''festival-cannes.com''. Retrieved: December 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Holden in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', noted: "Had it stuck to the stark physical realities of the situation, "A Captive in the Land," which opens today at the Angelika Film Center, could have been a gripping film. But the movie, which was completed before the crumbling of the Soviet Union, insists on lending the relationship between the American and the Russian a turgid metaphoric significance." &lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen.

Retrieved: December 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

A later review in ''[[TV Guide]]'' has similar assessments: "The plot and theme of A CAPTIVE IN THE LAND dates back, of course, to Jack London, long a favorite author among Russians, and the entire film project is colored by the reconciliation of American and Russian. Whether as a joint production with Maxim Gorky Film Studios or as an expression of rival ideologies (in a brief argument between the characters that seem outdated and silly) 'A Captive in the Land' is oddly unexciting. Potapov's chatty and literate Russian does not mesh at all well with Waterston's laconic would-be hero, and the location scenes look like stock footage." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/movies/a-captive-in-the-land/review/129701/ "Review: 'A Captive in the Land'."] ''TV Guide''.

The '''architecture of [[Samoa]]''' is characterised by openness, with the design mirroring the culture and life of the [[Samoan people]] who inhabit the [[Samoa Islands]].&lt;ref name="googleDocPaper"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:DOXF5EmAXHQJ:cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/papers/antalya/18.pdf+Samoan+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=nz&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj5F2Hi2o5ky61cj5k0RYuhkP7QK3jXf--TVo-gFvFnX7FPUhIsZAiBfepQNLdkcHGDNJKvQklcamttUpUwPmIIKfywhI1WuXT3foYgi6MtyxVo5X3dtXviyBKxMVtrghbfMvE7&amp;sig=AFQjCNFlPg6HbFWZKFxFh2Hl4VdUNaUBgg] Recording the Cultural Heritages of Samoa and the Fiji Islands, U. Herbig, G. Zohrer, F. Samoliy. Retrieved 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural concepts are incorporated into [[Samoan proverbs]], oratory and metaphors, as well as linking to other art forms in Samoa, such as boat building and [[Pe'a|tattooing]]. The spaces outside and inside of traditional Samoan architecture are part of cultural form, ceremony and ritual.

'''''Fale''''' is the Samoan word for all types of houses, from small to large.

In general, traditional Samoan architecture is characterized by an oval or circular shape, with wooden posts holding up a domed roof. There are no walls. The base of the architecture is a skeleton frame.

Before European arrival and the availability of Western materials, a Samoan ''fale'' did not use any metal in its construction.

==Lashing ''{{okina}}Afa''==
[[File:Magimagi - Mainbeam.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Similar Fijian lashing (''[[magimagi]]'')]]
[[File:Magimagi - Diags.jpg|right|thumb|120px|''afa'' woven pattern]]
The ''fale'' is lashed and tied together with a plaited [[sennit]] rope called ''{{okina}}afa'', handmade from dried [[coconut]] fibre. The ''{{okina}}afa'' is woven tight in complex patterns around the wooden frame, and binds the entire construction together. ''{{okina}}Afa'' is made from the husk of certain varieties of coconuts with long fibres, particularly the ''niu'afa'' (''afa'' palm). The husks are soaked in fresh water to soften the interfibrous portion.  The husks from mature nuts must be soaked from four to five weeks, or perhaps even longer, and very mature fibre is best soaked in salt water, but the green husk from a special variety of coconut is ready in four or five days.
Soaking is considered to improve the quality of the fibre. Old men or women then beat the husk with a mallet on a wooden [[anvil]] to separate the fibres, which, after a further washing to remove interfibrous material, are tied together in bundles and dried in the sun. When this stage is completed, the fibres are manufactured into sennit by plaiting, a task usually done by elderly men or ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'', and performed at their leisure. This usually involves them seated on the ground rolling the dried fibre strands against their bare thigh by hand, until heavier strands are formed. These long, thin strands are then woven together into a three-ply plait, often in long lengths, that is the finished sennit. The sennit is then coiled in bundles or wound tightly in very neat cylindrical rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Samoan Custom |last=Grattan |first=F.J.H.  |year=1985 |publisher=R. McMillan |location=New Zealand |isbn=0-908712-13-8|page= |pages=164, 165 |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-GraIntr-_N65654.html|accessdate=14 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making enough lengths of ''afa'' for an entire house can take months of work. The construction of an ordinary traditional ''fale'' is estimated to use 30,000 to 50,000 feet of ''{{okina}}afa''. The lashing construction of the Samoan ''fale'' is one of the great architectural achievements of [[Polynesia]].&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;[http://app.cul.columbia.edu:8080/ac/handle/10022/AC:P:2113]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Space as social construct : the vernacular architecture of rural Samoa by Anne Elizabeth Guernsey Allen, Columbia University Abstract. Retrieved 26 October 2009
&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar lashing technique was also used in traditional boat building, where planks of wood were 'sewn' together in parts. ''{{okina}}Afa'' has many other uses in Samoan material culture, including ceremonial items, such as the ''fue'' fly whisk, a symbol of orator status. This lashing technique was also used in other parts of Polynesia, such as the ''[[magimagi]]'' of [[Fiji]].

==Cultural space==
[[File:Samoan fale, Lelepa village, Savaii, Samoa 2009.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Situated by the beach and raised a meter off the ground, this ''fale tele'' in [[Lelepa (village)|Lelepa]] village on [[Savai'i|Savai'i Island]] has an iron roof replacing traditional thatching for the roof, although ''pola'' (suspended in photo), traditional 'wall blinds' around the poles of the ''fale'' are still used.]]
The form of a ''fale'', especially the large meeting houses, creates both physical and invisible spatial areas, which are clearly understood in Samoan custom, and dictate areas of social interaction. The use and function of the ''fale'' is closely linked to the Samoan system of social organisation, especially the ''[[Fa'amatai]]'' chiefly system.

Those gathered at a formal gathering or ''fono'' are always seated cross-legged on mats on the floor, around the ''fale'', facing each other with an open space in the middle. The interior directions of a ''fale'', east, west, north and south, as well as the positions of the posts, affect the seating positions of chiefs according to rank, the place where orators (host or visiting party) must stand to speak or the side of the house where guests and visitors enter and are seated. The space also defines the position where the 'ava makers (''aumaga'') in the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]] are seated and the open area for the presentation and exchanging of cultural items such as the ''[['ie toga]]'' fine mats.

The front of a Samoan house is that part that faces the main thoroughfare or road through the village. The floor is quartered, and each section is named: ''Tala luma'' is the front side section, ''tala tua'' the back section, and ''tala'', the two end or side sections.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; The middle posts, termed ''matua tala'' are reserved for the leading chiefs and the side posts on the front section, termed ''pou o le pepe'' are occupied by the orators. The posts at the back of the house, ''talatua'', indicate the positions maintained by the 'ava makers and others serving the gathering.&lt;ref name=tp&gt;An Account of Samoan History up to 1918 by Te'o Tuvale. NZ Electronic Text Centre. Retrieved 27 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate area exterior of the ''fale'' is usually kept clear, and is either a grassy lawn or sandy area if the village is by the sea. The open area in front of the large meeting houses, facing the main thoroughfare or road in a village, is called the ''malae'', and is an important outdoor area for larger gatherings and ceremonial interaction.

The word "''fale''" is also constructed with other words to denote social groupings or rank, such as the ''faleiva'' (house of nine) orator group in certain districts. The term is also used to describe certain buildings and their functions. The word for hospital is ''falema'i'', "house of the ill".

The simplest types of ''fale'' are called ''faleo'o'', which have become popular as ecofriendly and low-budget [[beach fale|beach accommodations]] in local tourism. Every family complex in Samoa has a ''fale tele'', the meeting house, "big house".

The site on which the house is built is called ''tulaga fale'' (place to stand).&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

==''Tufuga fau fale''==
The builders in Samoan architecture were also the architects, and they belonged to an exclusive ancient guild of master builders, ''Tufuga fau fale''. The Samoan word ''tufuga'' denotes the status of master craftsmen who have achieved the highest rank in skill and knowledge in a particular traditional art form. The words ''fau-fale'' means ''house builder''. There were ''Tufuga'' of navigation (''Tufuga fau va'a'') and [[pe'a|Samoan tattooing]] (''Tufuga ta tatau'').
Contracting the services of a ''Tufuga fau fale'' required negotiations and cultural custom.&lt;ref name="nzetc"&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucSamo-t1-body1-d2-d8-d12.html] Samoan Material Culture by Te Rangi Hiroa ([[Te Rangi Hīroa|Sir Peter Buck]]), p.87. Retrieved 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of ''fale''==
[[File:Cocos nucifera - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-187.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Coconut husk of nut used to make ''afa'' rope]]
[[File:Samoa houses circa 1930s-photographer and location unknown.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|''Fale tele'' in a village]]

The '''fale tele''' (big house), the most important house, is usually round in shape, and serves as a meeting house for chief council meetings, family gatherings, funerals or chief title investitures. The ''fale tele'' is always situated at the front of all other houses in an extended family complex. The houses behind it serve as living quarters, with an outdoor cooking area at the rear of the compound.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; At the front is an open area, called a ''malae''. The ''malae'', (similar to ''marae'' concept in [[Māori culture|Māori]] and other Polynesian cultures), is usually a well-kept, grassy lawn or sandy area. The ''malae'' is an important cultural space where interactions between visitors and hosts or outdoor formal gatherings take place.

The open characteristics of Samoan architecture are also mirrored in the overall pattern of house sites in a village, where all ''fale tele'' are situated prominently at the fore of all other dwellings in the village, and sometimes form a semicircle, usually facing seawards.

In modern times, with the decline of traditional architecture and the availability of western building materials, the shape of the ''fale tele'' has become rectangular, though the spatial areas in custom and ceremony remain the same.
[[File:Fale on Manono Island.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Faleo'o'' (''[[beach fale]]'') with simple roof thatching on [[Manono Island]], 2009]]
Traditionally, the '''afolau''' (long house), a longer ''fale'' shaped like a stretched oval, served as the dwelling house or guest house.

The '''faleo'o''' (small house), traditionally long in shape, was really an addition to the main house. It is not so well constructed and is situated always at the back of the main dwelling.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; In modern times, the term is also used for any type of small and simple ''fale'', which is not the main house of dwelling. Popular as a "grass hut" or [[beach fale]] in village tourism, many are raised about a meter off the ground on stilts, sometimes with an iron roof. In a village, families build a ''faleo'o'' beside the main house or by the sea for resting during the heat of the day or as an extra sleeping space at night if there are guests.

The '''tunoa''' (cook house) is a flimsy structure, small in size, and not really to be considered as a house. In modern times, the cook house, called the ''umukuka'', is at the rear of the family compound, where all the cooking is carried out in an earth oven, ''umu'', and pots over the fire. In most villages, the ''umukuka'' is really a simple open shed made with a few posts with an iron roof to protect the cooking area from the weather.

==Construction==
[[File:Seumanutafa's house Apia 1896.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Samoan ''fale'' construction 1896]]
Construction of a ''fale'', especially the large and important ''fale tele'', often involves the whole extended family and help from their village community.

The ''Tufuga fai fale'' oversees the entire building project. Before construction, the family prepares the building site. Lava, coral, sand or stone materials are usually used for this purpose. The ''Tufuga'', his assistants (''autufuga'') and men from the family cut the timber from the forest.

The main supporting posts, erected first, vary in number, size and length depending on the shape and dimensions of the house. Usually they are between 16 and 25 feet in length and six to 12&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter, and are buried about four feet in the ground. The term for these posts is ''poutu'' (standing posts); they are erected in the middle of the house, forming central pillars.

Attached to the ''poutu'' are cross pieces of wood of a substantial size called ''so'a''. The ''so'a'' extend from the ''poutu'' to the outside circumference of the ''fale'' and their ends are fastened to further supporting pieces called ''la'au fa'alava''.
[[File:Samoa Tourism Office, Apia, 2009.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Samoa tourism office in [[Apia]] incorporating traditional design of a ''Fale'']]
The ''la'au fa'alava'', placed horizontally, are attached at their ends to wide strips of wood continuing from the ''faulalo'' to the ''auau''. These wide strips are called ''ivi'ivi''. The ''faulalo'' is a tubular piece (or pieces) of wood about four inches in diameter running around the circumference of the house at the lower extremity of the roof, and is supported on the ''poulalo''. The ''auau'' is one or more pieces of wood of substantial size resting on the top of the ''poutu''. At a distance of about two feet between each are circular pieces of wood running around the house and extending from the ''faulalo'' to the top of the building. They are similar to the ''faulalo''.

The ''poulalo'' are spaced about three to four feet apart and are sunk about two feet in the ground. They average three to four inches in diameter, and extend about five feet above the floor of the ''fale''. The height of the ''poulalo'' above the floor determines the height of the lower extremity of the roof from the ground.

On the framework are attached innumerable ''aso'', thin strips of timber (about half an inch by a quarter by 12 to 25 feet in length). They extend from the ''faulalo'' to the ''ivi'ivi'', and are spaced from one to two inches apart. Attached to these strips at right angles are further strips, ''paeaso'', the same size as ''aso.'' As a result, the roof of the ''fale'' is divided into an enormous number of small squares.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

==Timber==
[[File:Samoan house under construction 1914.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Fale'' under construction, 1914]]
Most of the timber is grown in forests on family land. The timber was cut in the forest and carried to the building site in the village. The heavy work involved the builder's assistants, members of the family and help from the village community.

The main posts were from the [[Breadfruit|breadfruit tree]] (''ulu''), or ''ifi lele'' or ''pou muli'' if this wood was not available. The long principal rafters had to be flexible, so [[Coconut palm|coconut]] wood (''niu'') was always selected. The breadfruit tree was also used for other parts of the main framework.&lt;ref name="nzetc2"&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucSamo-t1-body1-d2-d7-d1.html] Samoan Material Culture by Te Rangi Hiroa (Sir Peter Buck), p.22. Retrieved 31 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the timbers most frequently used in the construction of Samoan houses are:-

Posts (''poutu'' and ''poulalo''): ''ifi lele'', ''pou muli'', ''asi'', ''ulu'', ''talia'', ''launini'u'' and ''aloalovao''.
''Fau'': ''ulu'', ''fau'', ''niu'', and ''uagani''
''Aso'' and ''paeso'': ''niuvao'', ''ulu'', ''matomo'' and ''olomea''

The ''auau'' and ''talitali'' use ''ulu'' and the ''so'a' used both ''ulu'' and ''niu''.

==Thatch==
[[File:Samoan.village.on.the.Manu’a.Island.Group.Andrew.Thomas 1890-1910.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Samoan ''fale'' in the [[Manu'a]] island group, showing thatched roof and woven ''pola'' blinds, circa 1890 - 1910]]
The completed, domed framework is covered with thatch (''lau'' leaves), which is made by the women. The best quality of thatch is made with the dry leaves of the [[sugarcane]]. If sugarcane leaf was not available, the palm leaves of the coconut tree was used in the same manner.&lt;ref name="nzetc2"/&gt; The long, dry leaves are twisted over a three-foot length of ''lafo'', which are then fastened by a thin strip of the frond of the coconut being threaded through the leaves close up to the ''lafo'' stem.

These sections of thatch are fastened to the outside of the framework of the ''fale'' beginning at the bottom and working up to the apex. They are overlapped, so each section advances the thatching about three inches. This means there is really a double layer of thatch covering the whole house. The sections are fastened to the ''aso'' at each end by ''afa''.

Provided the best quality of thatch is used and it has been truly laid, it will last about seven years. On an ordinary dwelling house, about 3000 sections of thatch are laid.

==''Pola''==
Protection from sun, wind or rain, as well as from prying eyes, was achieved by suspending from the ''fau'' running round the house several of a sort of drop-down Venetian blind, called ''pola.'' The fronds of the coconut tree are plaited into a kind of mat about a foot wide and three feet long. A sufficient number of ''pola'' to reach from the ground to the top of the ''poulalo'' are fastened together with ''afa'' and are tied up or let down as the occasion demands. Usually, one string of these mats covers the space between two ''poulalo'' and so on round the house. They do not last for long, but being quickly made, are soon replaced. They afford ample protection from the elements, and it being possible to let them down in sections; seldom is the whole house is closed up.

==Flooring==
The natural foundations of a ''fale'' site are coral, sand, and lava, with sometimes a few inches of soil in some localities. Drainage is therefore good. The top layers of the flooring are smooth pebbles and stones. When occupied, the house floors are usually covered or partially covered with native mats.

In modern times, concrete is used for flooring.

==Mythology==
[[File:Round Samoan houses with blue roofs, Lepea village with Mt Vaea beyond.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Round ''fale tele'' in [[Lepea]] village, with [[Mount Vaea]] beyond, the burial place of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]]]
In [[Samoan mythology]], an explanation of why Samoan houses are round is explained in a story about the god [[Tagaloa]], also known as Tagaloalagi (Tagaloa of the Heavens).

Following is the story, as told by Samoan historian Te'o Tuvale in ''An Account of Samoan History up to 1918''.

*During the time of Tagaloalagi, the houses in Samoa varied in shape, and this led to many difficulties for those who wished to have a house built in a certain manner. Each carpenter was proficient in building a house of one particular shape only, and it was sometimes impossible to obtain the services of the carpenter desired. A meeting of all the carpenters in the country was held to try to decide on some uniform shape. The discussion waxed enthusiastic, and as there seemed no prospect of a decision being arrived at, it was decided to call in the services of Tagaloalagi. After considering the matter, he pointed to the dome of Heaven and to the horizon and he decreed that in future, all houses built would be of that shape, and this explains why all the ends of Samoan houses are as the shape of the heavens extending down to the horizon.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

An important tree in Samoan architecture is the coconut palm. In Samoan mythology, the first coconut tree is told in a legend called [[Sina and the Eel]].

An '''artist cooperative''' (also [[co-operative]] or co-op) is an autonomous [[visual arts]] organization, enterprise, or association jointly owned and democratically controlled by its members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html International Co-operative Alliance ''Statement on the Co-operative Identity''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204081503/http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html |date=2012-02-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist cooperatives are legal entities organized as non-capital stock [[corporations]], [[non-profit organizations]], or [[voluntary association|unincorporated associations]]. Such cooperatives typically provide professional facilities and services for its artist-members, including studios, workshops, equipment, exhibition galleries, and educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfc.ucdavis.edu/cooperatives/whatis.html#arts Small Farm Center, University of California] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305050618/http://www.sfc.ucdavis.edu/cooperatives/whatis.html#arts |date=March 5, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By design, all economic and non-economic benefits and liabilities of the cooperative are shared equally among its members. Cooperative members elect their board of directors from within the membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncba.coop/abcoop.cfm National Cooperative Business Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218093223/http://www.ncba.coop/abcoop.cfm |date=February 18, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arts Etobicoke''' was founded in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://365etobicoke.com/arts-etobicoke/|title=#87|publisher=365Etobicoke.com|accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada (formerly in the city of [[Etobicoke]]). They are an incorporated [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]] [[arts council]] governed by a 
volunteer Board of Directors from business, the arts and the community. They serve thousands of students in their arts education programs, a membership of 50 arts organizations, 200 individual members, 60 individual artists and clients in an Art Rental program, hundreds of artists through their arts programming and exhibitions, 22 scholarship recipients, the general public and numerous project partners.

== About ==
Arts Etobicoke endeavors to engage the people of [[Etobicoke]] with the arts and artists in their own community.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.blogto.com/gallery/artsetobicoke|title=Arts Etobicoke Gallery|publisher=BlogTO.com|author=Sameer Vasta|date=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide programs and services to increase accessibility of the arts, involve diverse audiences, create broad awareness of artists through advocacy and develop partnerships to sustain local arts activities. To achieve this goal, they provide programs and services designed to increase the accessibility of the arts for residents of Etobicoke, reach and involve special and diverse audiences, create broad community awareness of local arts organizations and artists and develop partnerships and networks to foster and sustain local arts activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.clubrunner.ca/Data/7070/1133/HTML/134164//Jun012011.pdf|title=Weekly Update|publisher=Rotary Club of Etobicoke|date=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating funding for Arts Etobicoke comes from the [[Toronto|City of Toronto]] and the [[Ontario Arts Council]]. This funding accounts for approximately 25% of their total income. The balance is raised through program revenues, memberships, foundations, corporate sponsorships, donations and fundraising events. Arts Etobicoke relies on a team of dedicated volunteers to promote events, help with fundraising, and assist with programs. Their current Executive Director is Menon Dwarka. 

=== Programs ===
==== Smart StART Student Art Show ====
The "Smart Start Student Art Show" at [[Sherway Gardens]] is a non-juried art show displaying works of students from Grades 9 to 12 from the Toronto District School Board and Toronto District Catholic School Board. The Smart Start Student Art Show gives them an opportunity to present their artwork in a public forum, particularly in a high-traffic venue such as Sherway Gardens, where thousands of people can view their works. The program was established in 1996.

==== Urban Noise ====
A joint venture with [[Expect Theatre]] creates a platform for children/youth to speak out against violence in their communities. Established in 2006, the project includes a free Youth Training Program and Festival that promotes leadership, unity and social change in the culturally diverse communities of Rexdale/Jamestown, located in North Etobicoke.  The workshops include DJing, break dancing, singing and song writing, etc.  These workshops encourage youth to identify and examine the issues that directly affect them in a supportive environment through various artistic mediums. It also solicits the attention of the general public to take notice of the neighbourhoods that are suffering from racial tension, poverty, gender inequality and lack of resources - all of which can become a potential source for violence.

==== Art Alley ====
Art Alley is a project that was designed to bring poetry to Islington Village.  A specially commissioned poem by [[Dionne Brand]] (City of Toronto's Poet Laureate) has been painted on the 1000-square-foot wall in the alley immediately east of their storefront office.

==== Art on The Move ====
is a three-year mobile community arts initiative in partnership with [[Lakeshore Arts]].  The project will transform 13 vehicles into moving canvasses of art.

=== Scholarships ===
The Presidents' Legacy Scholarship Fund, launched in 1999, was established as an endowment fund with the Ontario Arts Foundation to provide financial assistance to young people from West Toronto wishing to pursue their education in the arts.  Scholarships are awarded to students attending designated arts education institutions. As of 2011, approximately 75 young people received scholarships and awards from the program to such institutions as; OCAD; Royal Conservatory of Music; Kingsway Conservatory of Music; Humber College; Etobicoke School of the Arts; North Albion C.I.; Sean Boutillier Academy of Dance; and Richview C.I.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.clubrunner.ca/Data/7070/1133/HTML/134164//Jun012011.pdf|title=Weekly Update|publisher=Rotary Club of Etobicoke|date=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artur Grottger''' (11 November 1837 – 13 December 1867) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[Romanticism in Poland|Romantic painter]] and [[graphic artist]], one of the most prominent artists of the mid 19th century under the [[History of Poland (1795–1918)|foreign partitions of Poland]], despite a life cut short by incurable illness.&lt;ref name="pinakoteka-bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pinakoteka.zascianek.pl/Grottger/Grottger_bio.htm | title=Artur Grottger.

==Biography==
Grottger was born in Ottyniowice, [[Eastern Galicia]] (now Otynevychi, Ukraine) to Jan Józef Grottger, a Polish officer commanding the [[Uhlan|Uhlans' Regiment]] called ''Warszawskie Dzieci'' (the Warsaw Children) during the failed [[November Uprising]] against the Russians (1831); an amateur artist himself, with many areas of passion.&lt;ref name="lwow" /&gt; 
[[File:Artur Grottger, Portret własny.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Self-portrait, 1867]]

At age 11, Artur Grottger was sent from a quiet estate to study painting in [[Lwów]] under the apprenticeship of [[Jan Maszkowski|Jan Kanty Maszkowski]] (1848–1852), (together with [[Stanisław Tarnowski (Biały)|Stanisław Tarnowski]])&lt;ref&gt;„Polski Słownik Biograficzny”, Vol. XX (Maria Józefa – Mathy Ignacy), ed. Polska Akademia Nauk, print. Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, Wroclaw-Warsaw-Cracow-Danzig, 1975, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; and (briefly) [[Juliusz Kossak]]. In 1852 he embarked on a journey to [[Kraków]] (then in the [[Austrian Partition]]) to attend classes at the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]]. He studied under [[Władysław Łuszczkiewicz]] and [[Wojciech Stattler|Wojciech Kornel Stattler]]. In 1855–1858 he went to the Academy in [[Vienna]] and studied under [[Karl von Blaas]] and [[Christian Ruben]]. While in Austria, he travelled to Munich, Venice and to Hungary, where he met his biggest future sponsor and benefactor, Count [[Aleksander Pappenheim]]. He returned to Poland in 1865 upon the collapse of the [[January Uprising]].&lt;ref name="pinakoteka-bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lwow"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/naszdziennik/grottger.html | title=Artur Grottger - wielki polski artysta (Artur Grottger - a great Polish artist) | publisher=''Nasz Dziennik'', Lwow.pl | work=Wielcy zapomniani | accessdate=October 21, 2012 | author=Piotr Czartoryski-Sziler | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, Grottger moved between the estates of Polish art lovers in [[Podolia]], among others in Manor House of [[Stanisław Tarnowski (Biały)|Stanisław Tarnowski]] in Śniatynka, there he painted numerous paintings for the cycle ''Lithuania''. &lt;ref&gt;Zofia Gołubiew, Anna Król „Artur Grottger (1837-1867)”, (Wystawa przygotowana przez Muzeum Narodowego w Krakowie w Pałacu Sztuki Towarzystwa Przyjaciół Sztuk Pięknych w Krakowie marzec – maj 1988, pod patronatem Ministra Kultury i Sztuki Prof. Aleksandra Krawczuka) Muzeum Narodowe w Krakowie, Cracow, 1988, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 he met his fiancée Wanda Monné, a young Polish patriot; and spent a lot of time at her house. However, he also developed tuberculosis. In 1867 he went to Paris hoping to make more money; visited [[Hôtel Lambert]], and met with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. His illness was getting worse and worse. He went to a sanatorium at [[Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda]] in the [[Pyrénées]], where he died on 13 December 1867. His body was brought back to Poland by his fiancée and buried at the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lwów Cemetery]] on 4 July 1868.&lt;ref name="lwow" /&gt;

==Artistic career==
Grottger painted mostly epic battle scenes, portraits, and horses. He produced some of his most famous paintings while in Vienna. During his stay in occupied Poland, he poured all of his talent and energy into depicting the hopes and horrors of the failed Polish insurrections in several series of black-and-while pannels including ''Warszawa'', ''Polonia'', ''Lithuania'' and ''Wojna'' (1863–1867) which brought him no income. The series titled "Polonia" included eight boards, depicting the grim realities of everyday life and struggle under Russian occupation. "Polonia" was a response to the failed insurrection of 1863–65. His last painting was his self-portrait.

In 1908, [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], whose own father had been caught up in the insurrection and had been arrested, completed his ''magnum opus'', the [[Symphony in B minor (Paderewski)|Symphony in B minor "Polonia]], which was inspired by Grottger's series of paintings.

[[Image:Banco del libro.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Banco del libro in [[Caracas, Venezuela]]]]
'''Banco del Libro''' is a [[non-profit organization]] for the promotion of [[children's literature]], with headquarters in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]. It was established in 1960 as a centre for the exchange of textbooks – hence the name Banco del Libro (Book Bank). As it has grown it has diversified to promote reading in Venezuela, in every conceivable arena and genre of children’s literature.

In 2007 Banco del Libro won the biggest prize in children's literature, the [[Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award]] from the Swedish Arts Council, recognising its "long-term sustainable work" as a promoter of reading. It is one of two institutions to win the award (2003 to 2012).&lt;ref name=alma2007&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13919">The '''Bruce High Quality Foundation''' is an  arts collective in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], the [[United States]], which was "created to foster an alternative to everything."&lt;ref name="MGL"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/arts/design/16wart.html?pagewanted=all|title=Museum and Gallery Listings|date=2008-05-16|work=New York Times|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective is made up of five to eight rotating and anonymous members, most or all of whom are [[Cooper Union]] graduates.&lt;ref name="MGL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; The group has attracted attention with the subversive, humorous and erudite style of their work and operates an unaccredited art school, the Bruce High Quality Foundation University.&lt;ref name="BGO" /&gt;

==History and work==
The collective was formed in 2004.&lt;ref name="BGO"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/fashion/06night.html|title=A Night Out With Members of the Bruce High Quality Foundation. And the Beat Goes On |last=Chaplin|first=Julia|date=2009-12-04|work=New York Times|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members remain anonymous, in protest against the "star-making machinery of the art market", but it is known that they are a group of mostly men and some women, and that some of them met and became friends while studying art at [[Cooper Union]].&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt;&lt;ref name="BGO" /&gt; The group is named after a fictional artist, "Bruce High Quality", who supposedly perished in the [[9/11]] attack.&lt;ref name=MT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/reviews/rinebold/bruce-high-quality-foundation8-20-09.asp|title=Money Talks|last=Rinebold|first=Mary|date=2009-08-20|work=artnet Magazine|accessdate=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Whitney Museum]] collaborated with Minetta Brook, [[Robert Smithson]]'s estate, and [[James Cohan Gallery]] to sponsor the construction of Robert Smithson's "Floating Island", a floating island of parkland tugged around [[New York Harbor]], inspired by a 1970 drawing by Robert Smithson, entitled "Floating Island to Travel Around Manhattan Island".&lt;ref name="MGL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; The island, complete with living trees, was pulled by a [[tugboat]]. The Bruce High Quality Foundation responded to the event with their own performance, titled "The Gate: Not the Idea of the Thing but the Thing Itself",&lt;ref name="MGL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; in which members of the collective pursued the Smithson island in a small [[skiff]] carrying a model of one of the orange gates by [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]] that had been displayed in [[Central Park]] earlier that year.&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artsjournal.com/artopia/2005/09/smithsons_floating_island.html|title=Smithson's Floating Island|last=Perreault|first=John|date=2005-09-21|work=Artopia: John Perreault's art diary|publisher=Arts Journal|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Public Sculpture Tackle", an ongoing work begun in 2007 and documented on video, features one of the members of the collective, wearing "quasi-football gear", climbing, hurling himself against or hanging from various public sculptures in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; In the fall of 2007, when [[Ugo Rondinone]] displayed a rainbow-coloured sign saying "Hell Yes" on the [[New Museum]], the Bruce High Quality Foundation suspended a similar sign saying "Heaven Forbid" from the building opposite.&lt;ref name="MGL" /&gt;

The collective's first show in a commercial New York gallery was "The Retrospective" in 2008, employing "an implicitly satiric, reactive style".&lt;ref name="MGL" /&gt; The collective has produced a film, ''Isle of the Dead'', which was shown in 2009 at the "Plot/09 – This World &amp; Nearer Ones" exhibition organized by [[Creative Time]] on [[Governors Island]].&lt;ref name="IAI" /&gt; A send-up of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', the film chronicles the death and [[zombie]]-led revival of the art world.&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt;&lt;ref name="IAI"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/arts/design/26plot.html?pagewanted=all|title=Art Review – "Plot/09": Island as Inspiration and Canvas |last=Smith|first=Roberta|date=2009-06-25|work=New York Times|accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's December 2009 show in Miami was curated by [[Vito Schnabel]], son of the artist [[Julian Schnabel]], and attended by New York's rich and famous, guests including the shipping heir [[Stavros Niarchos#Marriages|Stavros Niarchos III]], newsprint billionaire [[Peter Brant]], actor [[Stephen Dorff]] and [[John McEnroe]].&lt;ref name="BGO" /&gt; The Bruce High Quality Foundation was among the artists represented at the 2010 [[Whitney Biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designtaxi.com/news.php?id=29906|title=Artists Listed For 2010 Whitney Biennial|date=2009-12-14|work=[[DesignTAXI]] |accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Bruce High Quality Foundation was the subject of a retrospective at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] and exhibited work in Switzerland, Germany. London, Dubai, and Washington.
In November 2013 the group opened "Meditations", a single show in two New York galleries.  The works duplicated antiquities from the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in a Play-Doh-like modeling clay.  Later in the month, a silkscreen by the foundation, "Hooverville," depicting the New York skyline with hobos, sold for $425,000 at [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/nov-2013-contemporary-evening-n09037/lot.2.html|title=Sotheby's, 13 November 2013.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Bruce High Quality staged "As We Lay Dying," an immersive multimedia installation including sculpture and performance at [[The Watermill Center]] on Long Island, New York.&lt;ref name="bruce1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museemagazine.com/culture/2016/8/1/the-23rd-annual-watermill-center-benefit-and-auction|title=The 23rd Annual Watermill Center Benefit and Auction|author=|date=|website=museemagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bruce2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2016/05/31/summertime-bruce-watermill-centers-summer-benefit-will-feature-bruce-high-quality-foundation/|title=Summertime Bruce: Watermill Center’s Summer Benefit Will Feature Bruce High Quality Foundation|first=M.

==The Bruce High Quality Foundation University==
In July 2009, four members of the group gave a lecture-performance at the Harris Lieberman Gallery in New York, entitled "How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Bull".&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt;&lt;ref name=MT /&gt; The title mimicked that of [[Joseph Beuys]]' 1965 performance, "How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare", with the dead [[Market trend#Bull market|bull]] in the title representing economic recession.&lt;ref name=MT /&gt; Although accompanied by humorous and irreverent slides, the lecture had a serious intent, examining the current relationship between contemporary art, the art market and art schools, and ended with the question: "How can we imagine a sustainable alternative to professionalized art education?"&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt;&lt;ref name=MT /&gt;

In the fall of 2009, the group presented its own answer, by founding an unaccredited art school, the Bruce High Quality Foundation University, where "students are teachers are administrators are staff."&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/arts/design/13roberta.html|title=Artists Without Mortarboards|last=Smith|first=Roberta|date=2009-09-09|work=New York Times|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYAB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyartbeat.com/event/2009/0FC5|title=Events: The Bruce High Quality Foundation "University"|date=December 2009|work=NY Art Beat|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is located in downtown Manhattan, in premises made available by an unnamed benefactor.&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; Presented with partial support by public arts organization [[Creative Time]], it has offered students free classes for "an education in metaphor manipulation", the main focus of the curriculum being on art history and studio critiques.&lt;ref name="NYAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=VV /&gt; Lecture topics have included "Occult Shenanigans in 20th/21st-Century Art", "What’s a Metaphor?", "The B.H.Q.F.U.

In the spring of 2013, the school re-opened in the [[Lower East Side]], Manhattan with new curricula such as "Math Wipe" by Dmitry Samochine, "Generative Design—Model Assembly" by Sanam Salek, and a class about Japanese art in Japanese language by Nozomi Kato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galleristny.com/2013/03/a-quality-education-the-bruce-high-quality-foundation-university-is-in-session/|title=A Quality Education: The Bruce High Quality Foundation University is in Session|last=Duray|first=Dan|work=GalleristNY|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Bruce High Quality Foundation has been widely covered in ''[[The New York Times]]''. In September 2009, art critic [[Roberta Smith]] wrote that the group "has been best known for a sharp, well-aimed and unusually entertaining form of institutional critique."&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; Julia Chaplin, also writing in the ''New York Times'', said in December 2009 that the group was known for its "subversive performance art, humorous videos and conceptual sculptures all infused with Ph.D. quantities of art history references" and had "become the darlings of the art world".&lt;ref name="BGO" /&gt;  In December 2013, [[Jesse McKinley]] further explained, "Devoted to the idea that an artwork should stand on its own — without the artist’s identity or biography affecting its worth — the group’s no-name ethos has, perhaps intentionally, proven to be a potent and lucrative creative tool for members and a seductive draw for collectors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/arts/design/bruce-high-quality-skewers-and-seduces-the-art-world.html|title=Fake Artifact by an Unknown? Sold!|last=McKinley|first=Jesse|work=The New York Times, December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce High Quality Foundation was ranked 99 in [[ArtReview]]'s guide to the 100 most powerful figures in contemporary art: Power 100, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.artreview100.com/people/749/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811181926/http://www.artreview100.com/people/749/ |archive-date=2011-08-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all reviews of the group's work have been positive. ''[[New York Magazine]]'' derided the group's anonymous conceit as "pretentious drapery", while judging the show “Meditations” to be “kind of interestingly pretentious".&lt;ref&gt;''New York Magazine''. "The Approval Matrix", November 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Perspective==
The Bruce High Quality Foundation is part of a long history of artists using fictional identities in contemporary art, although the use of [[pseudonyms]] in the literary world has a much richer and more established tradition.

[[Rrose Sélavy]] was just one of the pseudonyms used by the artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] as early as 1921.  In the late 1990s, the artist [[Walid Raad]] began constructing elaborate fictions chronicling the contemporary history of his native Lebanon, signing his work [http://www.theatlasgroup.org/ The Atlas Group] and presenting it as a body of collective scholarship.  In 2003, [[Jeff Wassmann]] launched [[Wassmann Foundation|The Wassmann Foundation]], Washington, D.C., representing the fictitious estate of the early [[Leipzig]] modernist and sewerage engineer [[Johann Dieter Wassmann]] (1841-1898).  Mr Wassmann is, in fact, a contemporary artist living in [[Melbourne, Australia]].  [[Banksy]] is the pseudonym of a [[Bristol]]-born graffiti artist and political activist working since the late 1980s.  For over twenty years Banksy has successfully hidden his identity from the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/arts/design/banksy-makes-new-york-his-gallery-for-a-month.html|title=Mystery Man, Painting the Town|last=Smith|first=Roberta|work=New York Times, October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these artists scrutinize the ever-increasing presence of artist, curator and art institution alike, as brands.  In establishing artist and institution as conceits, the projects are free to explore these roles as pure brand, largely existent for critical assessment.

The Bruce High Quality Foundation University closed in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School's Out Forever: Bruce High Quality Foundation University Closes, Ending an Experiment in Free Art Education|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/art-school-bruce-high-quality-foundation-university-1078370|website=artnet News|accessdate=7 October 2017|date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bush Mechanics''''' is a 2001 television [[documentary film|documentary]] series directed by David Batty and produced by the [[Warlpiri Media Association]], featuring an [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] take on motor mechanics.

A [[bush mechanic]], in Australian parlance, is someone who uses unorthodox techniques and readily available materials to build or fix mechanical problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130917123046/http://www.bushmechanics.com/pages/what_is.htm Bush Mechanics definition]&lt;/ref&gt; An American analogue would be the television show character [[MacGyver]] who shares similar resourceful and lateral-cognitive traits. The television show featured Aboriginal people from [[Yuendumu]] fixing cars in such a way as they travelled through Central Australia. As they traverse the desert in their dilapidated vehicles, the series followed how they solved multiple car problems with inventive, wacky and unpredictable [[The Bush|bush]] repair techniques.

One example from the series (episode one) involved a [[station wagon]] with the band's equipment on the roof. Since the car was very old, the back half collapsed. They then removed the roof of the car with an [[axe]], turned it upside down, and tied it to the back of the car, loaded the items from the roof onto the same roof--but it is now used as a trailer. They continued down the sandy [[trail|track]] dragging the roof behind them. 

The television show consisted of five episodes: one initial half-hour documentary, which garnered international recognition, and four subsequent episodes. It was first broadcast by [[ABC Television]] (Australia) on 2 October 2001.

The episodes included:

* Motorcar Ngutju (Good Motorcar)
* Payback
* The Chase
* The Rainmakers

Language:
The series is notable for being one of the first media to be in an Aboriginal language as much of the dialog is in [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] and [[Australian Kriol language|Kriol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Australian Indigenous languages you should know|url=http://theconversation.com/some-australian-indigenous-languages-you-should-know-40155|last=Meakins|first=Felicity|publisher=Australian Research Council (ARC), Aboriginals Benefit Account (ABA) and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS)|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the '''''chorêgos''''' (pl. ''chorêgoi''; {{lang-el|χορηγός}}, [[Greek etymology]]: χορός "chorus" + ἡγεῖσθαι "to lead"){{#tag:ref|The Attic and Doric form was "χορᾱγός" (choragos) rather than the more usual Greek form "χορηγός" (choregos).&lt;ref&gt;[[A Greek–English Lexicon|Liddell and Scott]], p. 1668&lt;/ref&gt; The later forms of the word in [[Latin]] (choragus) and Italian (corago) followed the Attic spelling.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/32286?redirectedFrom=choragus "choragus, n."], ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', September 2013. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 9 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} was a wealthy [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] citizen who assumed the public duty, or ''choregiai'', of financing the preparation for the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and other aspects of dramatic production that were not paid for by the government of the ''[[polis]]'' or [[city-state]].&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;Brockett, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Anglicized forms of the word include '''choragus''' and '''choregus''', with the accepted plurals being the Latin forms ''choregi'' and ''choragi''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; In modern Greek the word ''χορηγός'' is synonymous with the word "grantor".&lt;ref&gt;Pring, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

''Choregoi'' were appointed by the [[archon]] and the tribes of Athenian citizens from among the Athenian citizens of great wealth. Service as a ''choregos'', though an honor, was a duty for wealthy citizens and was part of the [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|liturgical]] system designed to improve the city-state's economic stability through the use of private wealth to fund public good.  Choregoi paid for costumes, rehearsals, expenses of the chorus (including training, salaries, board and lodging), scenery, props (including elaborate [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Masks|masks]]), special effects and most of the musicians.  The ''choregos'' also hosted a feast if his chorus proved victorious in competition. The prizes for drama at the Athenian festival competitions were awarded jointly to the playwright and the ''choregos''.&lt;ref name=Brockett/&gt; Such victories carried prestige for the ''choregos''. Several notable political figures served as ''choregoi'', including [[Themistocles]], [[Pericles]] and [[Plato]], among others.  Monuments were built in honor of victorious ''choregoi''.

At the turn of the 17th century AD, in an attempt to recreate the ancient Greek dramatic tradition, the position was revived briefly in Italian opera, and combined the roles of impresario and director.

==Nomination and appointment==
Under the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] constitution, ''choregoi'' were appointed by the [[archon]] and the [[Phyle|tribes]] of Athenian citizens. The archon appointed ''choregoi'' for the tragedies, while the tribes supplied five ''choregoi'' for the comedies as well as ''choregoi'' for the [[Dionysia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Choragus|volume=6|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thargelia]] (the major festival competitions).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  The archon, who began this process months in advance of a festival, were able easily to identify potential dramatic ''choregoi'' because their mutual wealth allowed them to move in the same social circles as the most qualified candidates. In order to be considered for the role of ''choregos'', an individual had to be an Athenian citizen and possess great wealth. ''Choregoi'' for [[Greek chorus|choruses]] of boys were required by Athenian law to be over forty years old to protect the young participants. Volunteers from this selected group of qualified individuals may have been the source of most appointments. The figure of the ''choregos'' can be traced back as early as the 7th century B.C. References to the title are found in recovered portions of the earliest choral lyric poetry, including the ''Parthenia'' (or "Maiden-songs") of [[Alkman]], a poet of archaic [[Sparta]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, pp. 53–61, 113 and 198–213&lt;/ref&gt;

Service as a ''choregos'', though an honor, was a duty rather than a choice for wealthy citizens. This duty was one among many built into the state [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|liturgical]] system of ancient Athens, which was designed to improve the city-state's economic stability through the use of private wealth to fund public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Brooks A.|title=The Athenian Trierarchy: Mechanism Design for the Private Provision of Public Goods|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=June 2007| volume=67|issue=2| page=448| jstor=4501159| doi=10.1017/s0022050707000162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once nominated, however, a potential ''choregos'' had three choices. He could accept the nomination and the duty. Through a process called ''skepsis'', he could claim one of several specifically defined exemptions and be excused from service. Finally, he could identify another Athenian who was more qualified to perform the role of ''choregos'' and use the procedure of ''skepsis'' to resolve the matter.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

==Duties of the ''choregoi''==
Choregoi were responsible for supporting many aspects of [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre]] production in ancient Athens: paying for costumes, rehearsals, the chorus, scenery or scene painting (including such items as ''[[mechane]]'' and ''[[ekkyklema]]''), props (including elaborate [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Masks|masks]]), special effects, such as sound, and musicians, except that the state provided the flute player and paid the actors not in the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William; Wayte, William; Marindin, G.E. Ed. (1890). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D5%3Aentry%3Dchoregus-cn "Choragus"]. ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities''. perseus.tufts.edu. Retrieved 17 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the City Dionysia in Athens, for example, the ''choregos'' was expected to finance all aspects relating to the chorus, which could include training, the hiring of an expert to execute such training, salaries, and board and lodging during a lengthy rehearsal period.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt;

The ''choregos'' did not act as the director for the production; this role was fulfilled by the playwright.&lt;ref&gt;The playwright also appeared in the production and acted as the ''didaskalos'' or teacher, instructing the other principal actors. See Brockett, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''choregos'' would appoint a ''chorodidaskalos'' (Χοροδιδάσκαλος, often shortened to διδάσκαλος), often the playwright, to train the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, 18-33&lt;/ref&gt; The ''choregos'' was often expected to host a feast, analogous to a modern cast party, should his chorus prove victorious in competition.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt; According to the ''Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World'': "The sums spent on choregiai show that the duty could elicit vast expenditure. One extremely enthusiastic choregos catalogues a list which represents an outlay of nearly two and a half talents. This includes a dithyrambic choregia at the Little Panathenaea for 300 drachmae, and a tragic choregia for 3,000 dr. The latter figure is roughly ten times what a skilled worker might have earned annually."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John (ed.) "chorēgia", ''Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World'', Oxford University Press, 2007 {{ISBN|9780192801463}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reorganization of the ''choregia'' in 406 BC spread the cost among the wider community – the synchoregia – with the ''choregos'' paying only part of the expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Capps| first=Edward|title=The Dramatic Synchoregia at Athens|journal=The American Journal of Philology|year=1896| volume=17| issue=3| pages=319–328| jstor=288240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes and recognition==
[[File:Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.jpg|thumb|Choragic Monument of Lysicrates near the Acropolis in Athens, Greece]]
The prizes for drama at the Dionysia were awarded jointly to the playwright and the ''choregos''.&lt;ref name=Brockett/&gt; Originally the ''choregos'' acted on behalf of his tribe, which collectively won the [[wikt:kudos#Noun|kudos]] for a successful performance. Gradually the sponsoring ''choregoi'' asserted more personal responsibility, and by the fourth century BC the prize for the ''choregos'' was a personal award. The winner was expected to display his trophy in a place of honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buck|first=Carl D.|title=Discoveries in the Attic Deme of Ikaria 1888. III. The Choregia in Athens and at Ikaria. Inscriptions from Ikaria Nos. 5-7|journal=The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts|date=March 1889|volume=5|issue=1|pages=18–33|jstor=495931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such victories carried prestige for the ''choregos'', and these honors could be an important stepping stone to a successful political career for wealthy young Athenians. Conversely, failure to successfully execute one's role as a ''choregos'' could lead to social humiliation.&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foley| first=Helene| title=Choral Identity in Greek Tragedy|journal=Classical Philology|date=January 2003|volume=98|issue=1|page=3| doi=10.1086/378725| jstor=10.1086/378725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorious ''choregoi'' were honored further with the erection of a monument in honor of their accomplishment. These monuments, which have become an important source of scholarly knowledge about the ''choregoi'', were the final step in the victory celebration, which also involved a parade and a feast. Each monument featured an eloquent inscription that echoed the original victory announcement made at the Dionysia.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

==Notable ''choregoi''==
Greek society was a symbiosis of art and politics, and several notable political figures of the time served as ''choregoi''. [[Themistocles]] was ''choregos'' for [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus']] ''Phoenissae'' (named for the Phoenician women who formed the chorus), and [[Pericles]] acted as ''choregos'' for ''[[The Persians]]'' by [[Aeschylus]].&lt;ref&gt;Zelenak, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 365 BC, [[Plato]], a rare exception to the qualification of wealth, served as ''choregos'' for a boys chorus supported by the patronage of [[Dionysius II of Syracuse]].&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Choregos Lysicrates is remembered today because of the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates|monument]] still standing in Athens erected in honor of the festival victory of his production in 335 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Cou | first1 = Herbert F. | year = 1893 | title = The Frieze of the Choragic Monument of Lysikrates at Athens | url = | journal = The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 42–55 | doi=10.2307/495920| jstor = 495920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of a choragic monument to [[Nicias]] from the 5th-century BC were discovered in Athens in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dinsmoor|first=W.B.|title=The Choragic Monument of Nicias| journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=October–December 1910|volume=14|issue=4|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropic context==
''Choregoi'' were an example of a larger tradition of cosmopolitanism, defined by an interest in benefiting others, that dominated many aspects of urban life for the wealthy in ancient Greece and which has been linked to Western philanthropy.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller| first=Eugene F.| title=Philanthropy and Cosmopolitanism|journal=The Good Society| year=2006| volume=15| issue=1| pages=51–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these acts, which also included subsidy of temples, armories, and other essential municipal needs, were driven more by personal vanity, societal pressure, and political influence than the modern philanthropic impulse. Nevertheless, the ''choregoi's'' contributions to the theatre of ancient Greece were integral to the flourishing of drama in ancient Greece and the structure of the society's cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Philanthropy – Ancient Mediterranean Examples| url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/10645/Philanthropy-Ancient-Mediterranean-Examples.html| accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest references to the philanthropic impulse can be traced to Aeschylus's ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' with the use of the word ''philanthropia'', which is translates to "love of humankind," displaying an early tie between the theatre and the ''choregoi'', and philanthropy.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

==17th-century revival==
At the turn of the 17th century AD, when the first operas were being written in an attempt to recreate the old Greek dramatic tradition, the position of ''choregos'' was revived briefly. It was known in Italian as "corago", and combined the roles of impresario and director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Savage|first=Rover|author2=Matteo Sansone|title=Il Corago and the Staging of Early Opera: Four Chapters from an Anonymous Treatise circa 1630|journal=Early Music|date=November 1989|volume=17|series=The Baroque Stage I|issue=4|pages=494–511|doi=10.1093/earlyj/xvii.4.495|jstor=3127018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conception dreams''' are [[dream]]s that are said to foretell the [[Fertilisation|conception]] or [[birth]] of a child, dreamt by the future mother or people close to her. The belief that a dream will foretell a baby's birth originates from Ancient [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Samuel, transl. (1875), The romantic legend of Sâkya Buddha (Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra), London: Trübner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/romanticlegendof00ahbi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahāvastu, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, 2, London: Luzac &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/sacredbooksofbud18londuoft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreaming in the Lotus: Buddhist Dream Narrative, Imagery, and Practice By Serinity Young&lt;/ref&gt; and is found in some Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asdreams.org/2003/abstracts/nah-ree_doh.htm|title=Psychological significance of Korean women's "conception dreams"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In India==
Ancient India believes that conception dream predicts the child character. [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)]] dreamt that a white elephant with six white tusks entered her right side.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Samuel, transl. (1875), The romantic legend of Sâkya Buddha (Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra), London: Trübner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/romanticlegendof00ahbi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahāvastu, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, 2, London: Luzac &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/sacredbooksofbud18londuoft&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jainism]] dreams are connected with the births of [[Tirthankara]]s and the other prominent people including ''[[chakravarti]]'', ''[[Balabhadra]]''s and ''Vāsudevas''. They are 63 in total and called ''[[Shalakapurusha]]''. Their mothers see a certain number of dreams on conception of their soul in womb. They are described in the great detail in [[Kalpa Sūtra|Kalpasutra]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainpedia.org/nc/themes/principles/holy-symbols/dreams.html?sword_list%5B0%5D=dreams&amp;cHash=33eba476582356cda9587de0d285a3b9Balbir, Nalini.

''Avashyak-niryukti'', an early verse-commentary in Prakrit, explains relation of names of some [[Tirthankara]]s and these dreams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainpedia.org/nc/themes/principles/holy-symbols/dreams.html?sword_list%5B0%5D=dreams&amp;cHash=33eba476582356cda9587de0d285a3b9Balbir, Nalini.

[[Rathore]] ruler Simhaji's queen dreamt 3 lions before birth of his 3 son.&lt;ref&gt;Muhnot Nainsi Ki Khyat Khand-ii.Page:- 53-54.https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.308977&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramakrishna]] parents experienced supernatural incidents and visions before his birth. In [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] his father Khudiram had a dream in which Lord Gadadhara (a form of [[Vishnu]]), said that he would be born as his son. Chandramani Devi is said to have had a vision of light entering her womb from Shiva's temple.{{sfn|Chatterjee|1993|pp=46–47}}{{sfn|Harding|1998|pp=243–244}} [[Nahusha]] mother Indumati had conception dream.&lt;ref&gt;Padma purana, shrishti khand, 104&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dashakumaracharita]] Queen vasumati conceiving her first son hamsavahana, dreams that she has bathed in the water of all pilgrimages.while conceiving her second so Rajavahana she dreams that she swallowed the orb of universe.

==In Korea==
In Korea conception dreams are known as 태몽(''taemong''). Many women in Korean culture report having such dreams themselves. Popular topics of the dreams include fruit (such apples, [[persimmon]]s, cherries, chestnuts), animals (tigers, snakes, goldfish), nature (rivers, rainbows), children and jewels. The dreamer might eat or take fruits, embrace animals, or interact with nature. The topic is believed to influence the [[gender]] or the future of the baby; for example, fruits are seen as a sign for a baby girl.

The person having the dream can be the mother herself, but close family members such as her mother or the husband can also have conception dreams instead of the mother.

Dreams are often considered to be [[omen]]s, and sometimes people will "buy" dreams from friends, if they feel it is a good omen or a good conception dream.

Accounts of conception dreams can be found in numerous old histories. One example is the conception dream of [[Kim Yushin]], from the 6th century [[Common Era|CE]], documented in the [[Samguk Sagi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1349">The '''conical refiner''' is a machine used in the refining of pulp in the papermaking process.  It may also be referred to as a Jordan refiner, after the American inventor Joseph Jordan who patented the device in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780080533681|title=Handbook of Pulping and Papermaking|last1=Biermann|first1=C|publisher=Academic Press|date=1996|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfZfyEmqs_AC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jordan refiner.jpg|Jordan patent|thumb]]

The conical refiner is a chamber with metal bars mounted around the inside of the container.  The material to be refined is pumped into the chamber at high-pressure rate in order to create an abrasive effect as the material is forced through the machine, abraided by the metal bars.  At the opposite end of the chamber the resulting pulp is pumped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=197|isbn=9781483279602|title=The Paper-making Machine: Its Invention, Evolution, and Development|last1=Clapperton|first1=R.

'''''Contes et nouvelles en vers''''' ({{Lang-en|Tales and Novellas in Verse}}) is an [[anthology]] of various [[ribald]] [[Short story|short stories]] and [[novella]]s collected and versified from [[prose]] by [[Jean de La Fontaine]]. Claude Barbin of Paris published the collection in 1665.

La Fontaine drew from several French and Italian works of the 15th and 16th centuries, among them ''[[The Decameron]]'' of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', [[Antoine de la Sale]]'s collection ''[[Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles]]'', and the work of [[Bonaventure des Périers]].

[[File:Costa Rican - Bird Pendant - Walters 421511 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|150px|Jade bird pendant from Costa Rica]]
[[Jadeite]] is presumed one of the most precious materials of [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Costa Rica]].  It, along with other similar looking greenstones ( ex. [[chalcedony]], [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], and green [[jasper]]) were cherished and worked for years.  Jadeite was used to decorate the body and was presumably a symbol of power.

== Timeline ==

There are three main periods in Costa Rican [[Jade]] Tradition, they correspond with the second half of Mid-Preclassic to Late Classic Periods in [[Mesoamerica]].

# Beginning Period: 500 BC- 300 AD
# Fluorescent Period: 300-900 AD
# Decadent Period: 700-900 AD

The end of the [[jade]] tradition in [[Costa Rica]] corresponds with the beginning of gold work.

== Jade working==
Jadeite rates between 6-7 on the [[Mohs scale of hardness]], therefore making it extremely tough and time consuming to work because it was necessary to use minerals of equal or harder value.  Abrasive powders made of these minerals were often used to carve into the material.  Some of the main techniques used were pecking, drilling, sawing, carving, engraving and grinding.  String sawing was a technique likely developed by Costa Rican lapidaries, in the northeastern region.  This technique was done by sawing with a cord and a powdered abrasive.  It was used to create curved slits openings, and by drilling a hole in the middle of a piece you could thread the cord through and create a hole. The final process was polishing.

Presumed patterns: &lt;br/&gt;
:High-intensity: this pattern of jade working characterizes the jade objects that took the most time to complete, sometimes years.  They were more time consuming in addition to being more elaborately decorated, with deeper incisions.  
:Low-intensity: this pattern was less time consuming and could be made of softer materials, greenstones that looked like jadeite.  They were less valuable because they were made from local materials.  It was socially motivated by the high-intensity pattern.

== Jade objects ==

Most of the jade objects recorded are from looted context, but when found in situ the objects are primarily in graves.  The bulk of Costa Rican jades contain drilled holes so they can be utilized to decorate the body in bead and pendant form.  There are three main types of objects listed here.

1. Axe Gods: Generally these are stylized figure pendants that look like they were made from axes or celts.  They are two-dimensionally decorated on the front with three main segments.  The first is the top of the head to the top of the shoulders, where holes are drilled to suspend the object.  The second is from the top of the shoulders to the bottom of the wings or arms.  The third section is the blade of the pendant, it goes from the bottom of the wings or arms to the base, which consists of 30-40% of the entire pendant.  There are two types of Axe god figurines, Avian and Anthropomorphic.  The earliest known jade work is the Avian axe god celt found at the site of La Regla, dated at 500 BC.

2.  Beak Birds: These are characteristic for their large, stylized beak.  All were drilled through their neck so when strung to hang the beak would be projecting.  The figures are very diverse in size and shape.  The beaks are either straight, or curved pointing up or down.  Some of the beaks are curved into a spiral, and attached to the body presenting the string saw technique.

3.  Bar Pendants:  These are horizontal and usually winged.  They are drilled with two holes through the length of the pendant or drilled parallel to each other through the width of the pendant.  Examples of this type are open-winged bats, double headed winged bats, double headed bar with reptile heads at either end, opened winged bats with reptile heads at both ends, or plain with no incised decoration.

== Likely source and trade patterns ==

Most of the jade work in Costa Rica was done with a particular type. It was a deep, blue-green color, and the same type the [[Olmecs]] used.  In 1998 an enormous region of this particular jade was uncovered after a hurricane in [[Guatemala]].  The area is located in south east Guatemala In the Motagua River Valley.  It is about the size of Rhode Island, and has evidence of ancient mining.  This is the likely source of both the Olmec and Costa Rican jade.  This implies a significant long-distance trade hundreds of years before Christ.  Postulated by David Mora there was a direct exchange network between the previously mentioned area in Guatemala (in the Mayan lowlands) and the northwestern/ central areas of Costa Rica between 300 BC and 800 AD, in which Costa Ricans obtain jade.  Also, the jade tradition died down due to the collapse of (the Olmec's) [[Copan]], the presumed trade center for the jade.

''''deFENCE'''' is an [[interactive]] [[conceptual art]] project for freedom of cohabitation, designed in such a way as to include each beholder personally. In tradition of [[Marcel Duchamp]], the ''two main roles'' of this exhibit are the work itself, and the person watching it. Only here, the subjective role of the beholder is not the only one. They are personally drawn into the exhibit, by way of a [[mirror]]. &lt;br /&gt;
The work represents a house, with its door wide open, inviting and welcoming every visitor. Except, a certain visitor is watching this house over a barbed wire fence. On the other hand, this visitor is being watched from the window of the house. The author's intention was to combine these two persons into one, so that people who had never had the chance to be on the other side of the barbed wire, can benefit in two ways: Firstly, they can see how it is to be looking over a barbed wire into a house inviting you, which you cannot reach. And secondly, they can see themselves passively looking from the house at the person outside the fence, doing nothing to remove this segregation.

The concept of this project is to bring to the attention of people living in the 'free' world that many of the boundaries that segregate others in a 'non free' world, are created by themselves. Or, at least, they do nothing to remove these boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;
The wish of the author is to help remove all boundaries that separate people and worlds.

''Note:'' 'deFENCE' project was created by Gregor Marković from [[Serbia]], in January 2006. It has been selected to take part at the International Design Biennial in St. Etienne, in 2006.

'''Elizabeth Amber''' is a [[romance novel|romance]] [[novel]]ist who has written the series of [[paranormal fiction]] books called ''The Lord Of Satyr''.

==Biography==

===Home Life===

Elizabeth Amber's interest in Greco-Roman mythology inspired this series. She is an animal lover with two cats, who volunteers at a local no-kill animal shelter. Her other hobbies include cooking, shopping, and spending time with her mother and sister. She is now an art historian specializing in ancient Greco-Roman artifacts. She has visited Italy and Greece and had seen the monuments there which has developed her interests in mythology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freshfiction.com/author.php?id=16893 freshfiction.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing career===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2013}}
Elizabeth Amber wrote this series of erotic historical paranormal romance novels based on her interest in Greco-Roman artifacts celebrating the grape harvest. Satyrs are the carnal followers of the wine god, Bacchus in ancient Roman mythology, and are depicted on many urns and amphorae found in Roman ruins.

In her novels, three half-satyr, half-human brothers own a lavish estate and vineyard in 1800s [[Tuscany]], Italy, where they guard ancient secrets and conduct unusual rituals.  When a letter arrives instructing them to seek out three endangered half-faerie brides, they see it as an opportunity to sire heirs.  She wrote her first book, ''Nicholas'',  and then went to a [[Romance Writers of America]] conference to learn where to submit her book. [[Kensington]] bought the series. ''Nicholas'' has been critically acclaimed by many reviewers and has been mentioned in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3024">The '''Enid Blyton Society''' was formed in 1995 by collectors of [[Enid Blyton]]'s work Norman Wright, Tony Summerfield and Michael Rouse. It was originally named the '''Enid Blyton Literary Society''', to distinguish it from other organisations with similar aims, such as the Enid Blyton Book and Ephemera Collectors' Society, but was renamed after the latter's closure.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=2969–2976|ps=}}

The call for material for the first ''Enid Blyton Society Journal'', edited by Tony Summerfield, met with a response which allowed a 32-page magazine to be issued in 1996. The journal flourished, and now has full-colour covers with around ninety pages per issue becoming the norm.

Just as the journal flourished, so the 'Enid Blyton Day' is still going strong,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Enid Blyton Society Day May 12th 2012 |url=http://peakirk.blogspot.com/2012/05/enid-blyton-society-day-may-12th-2012.html |work=Peakirk Books |publisher=Peakirk Books |accessdate=28 May 2012 |author=My Photo  Heather Lawrence |date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over a hundred in attendance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stella &amp; Roses Books at the Enid Blyton Day |url=http://www.blytonbooks.co.uk/articles/blyton_fair.php |work=Blyton Books |publisher=Stella &amp; Rose's Books |accessdate=28 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408211635/http://www.blytonbooks.co.uk/articles/blyton_fair.php |archivedate=8 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at each event.

People, paths, and purposes is the concept of '''Envirotecture'''.

Defined it is the use of Architecture, Audio - Visual Experience, and purposeful direction of individuals to experience a "milieu" for the purpose of immersion into an emotional and physical experience.

The first reference know to this author is the book ''People, Paths, and Purposes: Notations for a Participatory Envirotecture'' written by Phillip Thiel in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alibris.com/People-Paths-and-Purposes-Notations-for-a-Participatory-Envirotecture-Philip-Thiel/book/5051225 |title=People, Paths, and Purposes: Notations for a Participatory Envirotecture |author=Philip Thiel |isbn=978-0295975214 |publisher=Alibris.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; I will reference this work for future entries about the subject.

This book is an explanatory and definitive work which develops the concept of Envirotecture from ancient historical examples to modern day uses.

In a similar way that [[Feng Shui]] uses a system of energies to determine human participation in an environment, Envirotecture is using special tools to view the environment from a "experiential point of view" to allow designers to include visual, auditory and other accents, to heighten the "reality" of the experience.

&lt;!--- This article is in its infancy.  I have used these principles for many years, but only now surprised they are not in Wikipedia.  My aim is to correct this omission.  On a world wide google search there are only 600 or so entries of the word "envirotecture" which came up on a search today.

Thank you for your patience as I develop this topic.

If you are an expert in this field, please feel free to edit / help. ---&gt;

==Concepts of design : the human experience.==
As a human, you are able to have many Social / Cultural experiences in life.

Close your eyes and remember a special moment in your life.

The sights....

The Sounds....

The Visceral reaction of your body to the situation...

THIS, intentional or not "Is the human domain."

Our understanding of the world around us is based on physical evidence, and our human emotional response to it.

'''The Federation of Children's Book Groups''' is a national charity in the [[United Kingdom]] that promotes children's books and reading for pleasure for all ages of children, from newborns to teenagers. The organisation is run by volunteers interested in supporting children and their books, both at a national level, through an executive, and a local level, through local groups, with the support also of individuals and professional members. The Federation liaises with publishers, libraries, schools and other bodies with an interest in literacy, reading and young people. 

The Federation owns and coordinates the [[Red House Children's Book Award]], the UK's only national book award voted for entirely by children.

The Federation promotes [[National Share-a-Story Month]] (every May) and [[National Non-Fiction Day]] (every November). It holds an annual conference each spring (with the help of local groups) as well as various one day regional conferences. The Federation regularly publishes booklists for children of different ages, as well as producing newsletters three times a year, and providing general advice and information on children's books and reading for enjoyment.

In 2011 The Federation of Children's Book Groups won the [[Eleanor Farjeon Award]] for distinguished service to the world of British children's books.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/news/4162_the_federation_of_childrens_book_groups_wins_award&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Anne Wood]], a British children's television producer, and creator of the [[Teletubbies]], established the first Book Group to promote enthusiasm for and about children's book in 1965. Soon more groups were created and the Federation of Children's Book Groups was created in 1968. Many of the original local groups are still in existence, though new groups are developing every year.

==Local Book Groups==
There are currently over 25 separate Book Groups throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Each group is different but typically a local group holds
*Meetings for adults to discuss children's books.
*Events with visiting speakers, including authors and illustrators.
*Activities for children such as storytelling and book exhibitions.

The Hamilton King Award was established in 1965 by Mrs. Hamilton King in memory of her husband through a bequest and is presented annually for the best illustration in the annual exhibition executed by a member of the [[Society of Illustrators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Society of Illustrators | url=http://www.societyillustrators.org/HamiltonKing.aspx?id=140 | accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton King (1871–1941)&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00098749?rskey=dp4IvD&amp;result=9 Benezit Dictionary of Artists]&lt;/ref&gt; was a prominent illustrator who worked in the late 1800s and early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanartarchives.com/king,h.htm americanartarchives]&lt;/ref&gt; King illustrated the "[[Coca-Cola]] girls" for calendars from 1910 to 1913. The Coca-Cola calendar work was considered significant because the artist's signature appeared in all printed matter for Coca-Cola, including serving trays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Famous Artists Who Have Worked With Coca-Cola | url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coke-lore-commissioned-artists | date=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King became well known for his "Hamilton King Girls", significantly working on behalf of [http://www.metmuseum.org/en/collections/search-the-collections?&amp;what=Color+lithographs&amp;who=Turkish+Trophies+Cigarettes&amp;pg=1 Turkish Trophies Cigarettes].

'''Jonty Hurwitz''' (born 2 September 1969 in Johannesburg) is an artist, [[engineer]] and entrepreneur.  Hurwitz creates scientifically inspired artworks and [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic]] sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/048913-007/tracks#details-description Tracks: Jonty Hurwitz], on [[Arte|ARTE]] 29 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He is recognised for the smallest human form ever created using [[nano technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/14/sculpture-human-sperm_n_6158258.html  |title=Artist Creates Sculptures So Tiny They Can't Be Seen By The Human Eye |publisher=Huffington Post, Leigh Weingus |date= 14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jonty Hurwitz was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to Selwin, a hotelier and entrepreneur and Marcia Berger, a drama lecturer and teacher. Jonty spent his early life living in small hotels in rural towns in South Africa while his father built up his business.

Jonty studied [[Electrical Engineering]] at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]] from 1989 to 1993. His major was [[Signal Processing]]. He then joined the [[University of Cape Town]] Remote Sensing Group as a full-time researcher under Professor Michael Inggs, publishing a paper on radar pattern recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=365844 |title=Synthetic Range Profile Measurements of Aircraft, COMSIG-93, COMSIG ’93:204 – 209, September 1993. M R Inggs, J.B. Hurwitz, and A. Langman.  |publisher=COMSIG |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his research post, Hurwitz traveled for a long period of time in India studying Yoga and wood carving.

==Career in art==
In a 2015, documentary by CNN International on Hurwitz's artwork,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/03/13/spc-ones-to-watch-sculpture-c.cnn |title=Is this the World's Smallest Sculpture? |publisher=CNN |date= March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC Radio 2]] art critic Estelle Lovatt commented on Hurwitz's work: "If [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] were alive today, he would have been doing what Jonty is doing.  He would have been using algorithms.  No one else works like him today.  His art is the mix between the emotional and the intelligent, and that's what gives it that spark."&lt;ref name="Self2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mathematics of Self|title=Art of Jonty Hurwitz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leATtAEACAAJ|date=8 January 2018|publisher=Blurb, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-389-03122-9|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz's work focuses on the aesthetics of art in the context of human perception. His early body of sculpture was discovered by Estelle Lovatt during 2011 in an article for ''Art of England Magazine'': "Thinning the divide gap between art and science, Hurwitz is cognisant of the two being holistically co-joined in the same way as we are naturally, comfortably split between our spiritual and operational self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/541afcd4e4b09246971aad4b/t/5421b307e4b0004bfbd4f10e/1411494663328/ARTofEnglandJonty.pdf |title=Art of England, Estelle Lovatt, Feb 2011 publication, p50. |publisher=Art of England |date= Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pocketmags.com/viewmagazine.aspx?catid=1029&amp;category=Art+%26+Photography&amp;subcatid=183&amp;subcategory=Art&amp;title=Art+of+England&amp;titleid=1015&amp;issueid=31285 Art of England Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz began producing sculptures in 2008. In 2009, his first sculpture '[[Yoda]] and the Anamorph' won the People’s Choice Bentliff Prize of the [[Maidstone Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/winner-of-art-prize-announced-a105202/|title=Winner of Art Prize Announced. |publisher=Kent Online | date= 6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2009 he won the [[Bernard Noble|Noble]] Sculpture Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnsf.org.uk/winners/2009/ |title=Bernard Noble Sculpture Prize. |date= Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was commissioned to install his first large scale work (a nude study of his father called 'Dietro di me')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jontyhurwitz.com/noble-prize ''Dietro di me''] by Jonty Hurwitz&lt;/ref&gt; in the Italian village [[Colletta di Castelbianco]]. In 2010, he was selected as a finalist for the 4th International [[Arte Laguna Prize]] in Venice, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premioartelaguna.it/catalogo/4edizione/catalogo_premio_arte_laguna_2009.pdf |title=Arte Laguna Exhibition Catalogue, p106. |publisher=Arte Laguna Prize |date= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Hurwitz's anamorphic work was described by the art blogger [[Colossal (blog)|Christopher Jobson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/01/the-skewed-anamorphic-sculptures-and-engineered-illusions-of-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=The skewed anamorphic sculptures and engineered illusions of Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Christopher Jobson, Colossal |date= 21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a short documentary about Hurwitz's "Generation Pi" philosophy by ''Vera Productions'' it is estimated that the sculpture received 20 million views online in the space of a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTp5Q3-8Ng |title=The Paintbrush of Mathematics |publisher=Vera Productions |date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013 Hurwitz was introduced to the [[Savoy Hotel]] by London art agent Sally Vaughan. Hurwitz was commissioned to be [[Artist in Residence]] at the hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlyst.com/articles/londons-savoy-hotel-continues-its-artist-in-residence-tradition |title=London's Savoy Hotel continues its artist in residence tradition |publisher=Artlyst |date= April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produce a sculpture of the hotel’s historically iconic [[Mascot]] ''Kaspar the Cat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/a-homage-to-kaspar-the-friendly-cat-checks-in-at-the-savoys-new-eatery-8600305.html |title=A homage to Kaspar the friendly Cat checks in at the Savoy's new eatery |publisher=The Independent |date= April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz lived for several months in the hotel producing the sculpture.

In the same year, Hurwitz was also nominated for the [[Threadneedle Prize]] and exhibited a collection at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London. By late 2013, in a special edition of Art of England on portraiture, Hurwitz was cited as the #1 portrait artist in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketmags.com/viewmagazine.aspx?catid=1029&amp;category=Art+%26+Photography&amp;subcatid=183&amp;subcategory=Art&amp;title=Art+of+England&amp;titleid=1015&amp;issueid=60975 |title=Six of the Best, Sally Vaughan, Aug 2013. |publisher=Art of England |date= Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 Hurwitz was voted #46 in the top 100 artists of 2013 by the American art site, Empty Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emptykingdom.com/featured/empty-kingdom-top-100-artists-of-2013/ |title=Top 100 artists of 2013, Empty Kingdom. |publisher=Empty Kingdom |date= 31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, Hurwitz's anamorphic work was blogged as "The best of 2013" by the American Art and Culture magazine, [[Juxtapoz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/sculptures-by-jonty-hurwitz |title=Best of 2013: Sculpture by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Juxtapoz |date= 31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Hurwitz's work was also curated by ''Science Gallery International'' for a touring group show entitled ‘Illusion’ curated by [[Trinity College Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.sciencegallery.com/illusion/ Science Gallery International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212190314/http://www.international.sciencegallery.com/illusion/ |date=12 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show presents a collection of installation artworks from around the world that affect human perception. The exhibition led to a 2014/2015 tour in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/30/fleet-science-center-illusion-exhibit/ |title=Real fun at Fleet’s ‘Illusion’ exhibit |publisher=U-T San Diego, Karla Peterson |date= 30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it attracted over 170,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessandleadership.com/marketing/item/48935-science-gallery-dublin-hono |title=Science Gallery Dublin honoured with dedicated 68c stamp |publisher=Business &amp; Leadership Magazine |date=7 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110010448/http://www.businessandleadership.com/marketing/item/48935-science-gallery-dublin-hono |archivedate=10 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show then moved on to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2015 and Leipzig, Germany in 2016.

In late 2014, he released a series of “nano sculptures” under the title of ″Trust″. This series of works captured the attentions of both the scientific and art community, being cited by among others, [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/images-of-the-month-november-2014-1.16481 |title=Image of the Month: November 2014 |publisher=Nature Journal, Daniel Cressey |date= 5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific American]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/2014/12/20/physics-week-in-review-december-20-2014/ |title=Physics Week in Review |publisher=Scientific American, Jennifer Ouellette  |date= 20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular Science]] and [[Phys.org]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-11-science-art-nanosculpture-marvels.html |title=When science and art produce nanosculpture marvels |publisher=Phys.org, Nancy Owano  |date= 18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Hurwitz was elected a member of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]]. In 2016 the [[Royal Photographic Society]] selected a [[Scanning Electron Microscope]] photograph by Hurwitz and Stefan Diller as one of the top 100 'Royal Society International Images for Science'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3777603/From-droplets-spider-web-spiral-galaxy-Stunning-photos-reveal-natural-beauty-science.html#ixzz4JfHIgjum |title=From droplets on a spider web to a spiral galaxy: Stunning photos reveal the natural beauty in science |publisher=Daily Mail, Libby Plumner  |date= 7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anamorphic sculpture===
Hurwitz has produced a body of work using both [[oblique projection|oblique]] (perspective) and [[catoptric]] (mirror) [[anamorphosis]]. In an interview with Christopher Jobson, Hurwitz explains his anamorphic inspiration as follows: “I have always been torn between art and physics. In a moment of self-doubt in 2008, I wandered into the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] and stumbled across a strange anamorphic piece by [[William Scrots]], a portrait of Edward VI from 1546. Followed shortly down the aisle by The Ambassadors by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] from 1533. My life changed forever. I rushed home and within hours was devouring the works of [[M. C. Escher]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci|Da Vinci]] and many more. In a breath I had found “brothers” in a smallish group of artists spanning 500 years with exactly the same dilemma as me. Within two months I was deep in production of my first work. My art rests on the shoulders of giants, and I am grateful to them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twistedsifter.com/2013/04/anamorphic-sculptures-made-with-algorithms-jonty-hurwitz/  |title=Anamorphic Sculptures Made With Algorithms |publisher=Twisted Sifter |date= 17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anamorphosis]] as a form of art has a long history. A page in Leonardo Da Vinci’s note book (folio 35 verso a of the [[Codex Atlanticus]]) shows two strangely elongated sketches of a child's head and an eye. These distorted and hesitant drawings, the first known anamorphoses, from around 1485”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startstudioarts.si.edu/2009/08/anamorphoses-in-the-eye-of-leonardo.html |title=Anamorphoses in the eyes of Leonardo |publisher=The Smithsonian, Holly Sloofman |date= 26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th Century anamorphosis was also used by [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] artists to secretly depict images of [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] in the wake of brutal English censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.core77.com/blog/fine_art/how_to_hide_a_forbidden_image_in_plain_sight_anamorphic_cylinders_27356.asp |title=How to Hide a Forbidden Image in Plain Sight |publisher=Core77, Rain Noe |date= 22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz is a pioneer in creating [[catoptric]] sculpture.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Until the creation of his first work ''Rejuvenation'', anamorphic sculptures have not been known to have existed in art history. In his online talks, Hurwitz explains that this is a function of processing power and that whilst painting is possible in a mirror, three dimensional anamorphosis could only have come into being with the advent of powerful computers. Each of his sculptures involves billions of calculations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ignant.de/2013/01/30/anamorphic-sculptures/ |title=Anamorphic Sculptures |publisher=Ignant |date= 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; using an [[algorithm]] derived from the mathematical constant [[π]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.designboom.com/art/anamorphic-sculptures-by-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=Anamorphic sculptures by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Design Boom |date= 21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2013/02/kiss-of-chytrid-anamorphic-art-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=Kiss of Chytrid: Anamorphic art by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Urban Ghost Media |date= 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz asserts that his art is “contemporary to the millisecond”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsfwyoutube.com/videos/398405/Jonty-Hurwitz-talk-Contemporary-Art-is-measured-in-milliseconds |title=Contemporary Art is Measured in Milliseconds |publisher=NSFW Youtube, Vera Productions, Jonty Hurwitz |date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kinetic Art]] curator and director of the London ''Kinetica Museum'', Dianne Harris, described Hurwitz's art as follows "The works of polymath Jonty Hurwitz are contemporary [[trompe l'oeil]], at first glance appearing abstract, but in mirrored reflections, representational".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinetica-artfair.com/?exhibitors/2013/jonty-hurwitz |title=Kinetica Museum Artist Profile, 2013.  |publisher=Kinetica |date= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nano sculpture===
In 2014, Hurwitz pioneered a new sculptural technique{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} in the field of [[Nanoart]] using [[multiphoton lithography]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.chempics.org/post/105392403108/trust-artist-jonty-hurwitz-and-nanoscientist |title=Trust |publisher=Chemical and Engineering News |date= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[photogrammetry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://all3dp.com/enter-photo-studios-21st-century/?hvid=3766p |title=Enter the Photo Studios of the 21st Century |publisher=All3DP |date= 29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create the world’s smallest human portraits of his first love. The works of art were inspired by the nineteenth century marble sculpture of Cupid and Psyche by [[Antonio Canova]], part of the permanent collection of the [[Louvre Museum]], Paris. Hurwitz’s works are so tiny that they are invisible to the human eye, able to be placed on the forehead of an ant. Smaller details of the works are at approximately the 300 [[nanometer]] scale, similar to the [[wavelengths]] of visible light and are therefore near impossible by the laws of physics to see in the visible spectrum.  The only way to observe these works is through a non-optical method of magnification like a [[scanning electron microscope]]. To create these works Hurwitz collaborated with a team of over 20 people, including Stephan Hengsbach of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] and Yehiam Prior of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], an art project centred in the world of academic [[physics]]. In February 2015, Hurwitz's sculpture "Trust" was awarded the world record for the "Smallest sculpture of a human" by the [[Guinness Book of Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/products/books/superlatives/smallest |title=Sculpture of a human 80 x 100 x 30 micrometers |publisher=Guinness World Records |date= 13 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Beautiful/Decay Hurwitz explains the philosophy behind the works: “As technology starts to evolve faster than our human perception is able to handle, the line between science and myth becomes blurred. We live in an era where the impossible has finally come to pass. In our own little way we have become demigods of creation in our physical world…. The nano works that I present to you here represent more that just a feat of science though. They represent the moment in history that we ourselves are able to create a full human form at the same scale as the sperm that creates us in order to facilitate the creation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beautifuldecay.com/2014/11/12/jonty-hurwitzs-sculptures-small-cant-seen-human-eye/ |title=Jonty Hurwitz’s sculptures are so small the can’t be seen with the human eye |publisher=Beautiful/Decay |date= 12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an online interview with [[Slashdot]], Hurwitz himself asks the question “How can something you can't see be art?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech-beta.slashdot.org/story/14/12/15/1357213/interviews-ask-jonty-hurwitz-about-art-and-engineering |title=Ask Jonty Hurwitz about Art and Engineering |publisher=Slashdot |date= January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By basing his work on the myth of [[Cupid and Psyche]] he also suggests that our belief in modern science isn't that different from the faith the ancient greeks had in the [[demigod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/elegant-nanosculptures-fit-comfortably-inside-the-eye-of-a-needle |title=Elegant Nano Sculptures Fit Comfortably Inside the Eye of a Needle |publisher=The Creators Project, Beckett Mufson  |date= 13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final irony was that the sculptures were destroyed by a touch one week before the images were published on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2836676/Is-smallest-sculpture-Nano-artist-creates-images-nude-model-easily-fit-eye-needle.html |title=Artist spends ten months creating sculptures which are half the width of a human hair... only for his friend to accidentally crush them a few minutes later |publisher=Daily Mail, Stephanie Linning  |date= December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in technology==
In the mid-90s, Hurwitz arrived in London following his travels in India and got his first job researching financial [[data visualization]] for [[Gilbert de Botton]], Chairman and Founder of [[GAM (company)|Global Asset Management]] (GAM). During this period, he was exposed to de Botton’s [[open architecture]] model of asset management. It was Jonty’s close relationship with de Botton, also a major British art collector, that exposed him to the art world. The two maintained a close friendship until de Botton's death in 2000.

Hurwitz left Global Asset Management after two years forming his own company, ''Delve'', to develop the [[Research and Development|R&amp;D]] in [[data visualisation]] and reporting. Jonty’s main client became de Botton himself. In 1996, GAM launched its financial reporting technology built by Hurwitz, which attracted attention in the financial media, winning several awards.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Hurwitz’s newly formed graphics and software team evolved over several years publishing several visualization projects (non-exhaustive list):

*1997 News International visual archives on the [[Cold War]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], Published by News International
*1998 [[Biosys]] an environmental simulation published by ''Take 2 Interactive''. 
*1998 Hurwitz was selected by the British Foreign Office to build a 3D engine called “Oceans of Innovation” to represent the leading edge of British Innovation.  The work was nominated for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/189832.stm | title=Bafta plugs into interactive awards. | publisher=BBC |date= 9 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years from 2000 to 2005, Hurwitz signed up a large base of asset managers for his reporting and analysis technology. In 2005, Hurwitz’s company ''Delve'' was acquired by [[Alternative Investment Market]] listed company Statpro Group PLC (SOG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/rns/050704sog4008o |title=Acquisition of Delve, a leading supplier of enterprise and web reporting. |publisher=Proactive Investors |date= 4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz joined Statpro as [[Creative Director]] where he designed the first [[cloud-based|Cloud Computing]] analytics and [[risk]] platform for asset data. In 2008, Statpro launched its flagship product ''Statpro Revolution'' which was the result of this R&amp;D. By 2014, eight out of the top ten largest asset managers in the world were Statpro Clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statpro.com/news/eight-top-ten-largest-asset-managers-world-statpro-clients/ |title=Eight out of the top ten largest asset managers in the world Statpro Clients. |publisher=Statpro |date= 20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz was co-founding Chief Technology Officer of [[Wonga.com]] in 2007 where he designed and built the first real-time online consumer loan system in the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} During this period, Wonga’s technology won several awards (listed below). By 2011, Wonga had begun to attract criticism and Hurwitz, as the inventor of the technology, found himself with not enough influence to guide the now large company's use of his designs. After several attempts at changing Wonga's strategy, he resigned from his operational role in November 2011, quietly releasing his sculpture entitled ''Co-Founder''.

Hurwitz's technology is credited with several innovations in the financial services industry:
*Financial sliders. A [[User Interface]] innovation which allowed customers to easily to get a real-time quote on the exact cost of a loan in pound and pennies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/oct/16/wonga-algorithm-lending-debt-data |title=Your prosperity could depend on an Algorithm |publisher=Will Sawney,Guardian |date= 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of communicating loan information to consumers has been adopted by several of the major high street UK lenders. These include (non-exhaustive list): [[HSBC]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Barclays]], [[Halifax (bank)|Halifax]], [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyds]], [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company|Nationwide]], [[Santander Bank]], [[The Co-operative Bank|Co-operative Bank]], [[Natwest]] and [[Bank of Scotland]].
*Real-time risk technology. Wonga’s risk engine was the first ever to evaluate the credit worthiness of a customer in near real time on the internet based on the collection of data from alternative sources in combination with traditional credit scores.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The consumer risk technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2011/03/15/the-algorithm-that-beats-your-bank-manager/ |title=The algorithm that beats your bank manager |publisher=Parmy Olson, Forbes |date= 15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided the ability to transfer money to customers within 12 minutes on the basis of the decision.

Hurwitz continues to commit much of his time to [[Financial technology|fintech]] startups while at the same time building up his body of artwork. In late 2011 Hurwitz backed Damian Kimmelman, to build a next-generation data provider [[Duedil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.growthbusiness.co.uk/news-and-market-deals/fundraising-deals/1679298/duedil-secures-funding-from-wongas-jonty-hurwitz.thtml |title=Duedil secures funding from Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Growth Business, Thomas Hobbs |date= 14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duedil has since been dubbed "The Bloomberg of private companies" and has emerged as one of the key data providers in Europe and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cd830afa-8364-11e3-86c9-00144feab7de.html#axzz3QWzwSOhb |title=UK startup dubbed 'Bloomberg of private companies' raises $17m  |publisher=Financial Times, Jonathan Moules |date= 3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Hurwitz [[seed money|seed funded]] the financial technology startup ''behalf.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/challenged-by-upstarts-lenders-try-new-strategy-cooperation/?_r=1&amp;action=Click&amp;contentCollection=Investment%20Banking&amp;module=BlogPost-Title&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body&amp;version=Blog%20Main |title= Challenged by Upstarts, Lenders try a New Strategy: Cooperation  |publisher=New York Times, Randall Smith |date= 7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Hurwitz backed the UK startup bank for young people: ''Meet Osper''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21968">This is the main '''list of [[dance]]s'''.  It is a non-categorized, index list of specific dances.  It may also include dances which could either be considered specific dances or a family of related dances.  For example, [[ballet]], [[ballroom dance]] and [[folk dance]] can be single dance styles or families of related dances. 

See following for categorized lists:
* [[List of dance style categories]]
* [[List of folk dances sorted by origin]]
* [[Novelty and fad dances|List of novelty/fad dances]]
Cats listed on these specialized (categorized) lists should also be included in this general index.

&lt;!--

IMPORTANT, READ BEFORE ADDING AN ENTRY:
Please ONLY add dances with a Wikipedia entry. They are likely to be removed otherwise. Don't add additional information, which should be instead added to the dances' respective articles.

Specific dances are listed below in alphabetical order.  Variants of a specific dance should be listed as indented items, and not as separate items.  For example, Waltz has several variants.  This makes the list easier to read, and avoids redundant links. --&gt;

'''Music without sound''' can refer to music that falls outside the range of human hearing (typically 20&amp;nbsp;Hz–20&amp;nbsp;kHz) or to compositions, such as [[visual music]], that are analogous to or suggestive of conventional music but in media other than sound, such as color, shape, position, motion and literature (see Discursive music below). It is commonly taken for granted that music is wont to be performed or recorded, but some sound works simply won't fit on a disc or on stage, being either extremely discreet (like Robin Minard's ''Silent Music'') or incomplete (Varèse's Unfinished music). Additionally, silence can be regarded as the [[via negativa]] of music and has induced long lasting fascination to music composers of all kinds. A composer deals with the absence of sound as much as they deal with sounds. Therefore, this article includes several examples of [[apophasis]] in music (like Algorithmic music or Gesture Music). 
{{cquote|''"It seems to me that the most radical redefinition of music would be one that defines 'music' without reference to sound."''&lt;br /&gt;[[Robert Ashley]], 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Nyman, ''Experimental Music'', 1974, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Gesture music==
'''Sofia Gubaidulina'''&lt;br /&gt;
Silence in music happens when the music stops during a performance. It is sometimes replaced by gesture music. In his Sofia Gubaidulina biography,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurtz ''Sofia Gubaidulina: A Biography'', p 184, english translation Indiana University Press, 2007 (written 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kurtz mentions the ''silent solo performance by the conductor'' included in ''...Stimmenn... verstummen...'', an orchestral work from 1986.
{{cquote|''The symphony is notable for its careful and innovative use of silence. Though the eighth movement has the largest proportions of the work, the climax actually takes place in the ninth movement when the conductor motions before a silent orchestra. The motions the conductor makes are meant to make his hands move increasingly farther apart from each other according to the Fibonacci sequence. This "conductor solo" is repeated at the end of the work, when after the last note is sounded the conductor continues to motion for several minutes.''&lt;br /&gt;From Wikipedia [[Stimmen Verstummen|...Stimmenn... verstummen...]] article}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Knizak-snowstorm.jpg|right|thumb|Milan Knizak's 1965 Snowstorm N°1]] --&gt;
'''Milan Knizak'''&lt;br /&gt;
From 1960, the International [[Fluxus]] Movement created a number of Events or Verbal Pieces, whose temporal structures were typically vague so as to be sometimes without beginning nor end, with or without sound, with or without music. A remarkable example is that of Czech artist Milan Knizak's 1965 Snowstorm N°1 whose score states: ''Paper gliders are distributed to an idle and waiting audience.''
{{cquote|''Another Event, by Czech Fluxus artist Milan Knizak, is called Snowstorm N°1 (1965) and simply instructs that ‘Paper gliders are distributed to an idle and waiting audience’. What results is a snowstorm of quietly gliding paper airplanes as the audience returns them back and forth and so on. The exchange of sheets is experimentaly beautiful, like the caring gesture toward the instrument as tended by Brecht.''&lt;br /&gt;[From ''Not the Other Avant-garde''].&lt;ref&gt;James Martin Harding and John Rouse (editors) ''Not the Other Avant-Garde: The Transnational Foundations of Avant-Garde Performance'', University of Michigan Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-472-06931-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-472-06931-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;br /&gt;'''Helmut Lachenmann'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Lachenmann]] composed ''Salut Für Caldwell'' for 2 guitars in 1977. The piece includes silent moments when ''« the players silent motions and gestures created a space of unheard music »''
[Michael Kurtz&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurtz ''Sofia Gubaidulina: A Biography'', p 192, english translation Indiana University Press, 2007 (written 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;]

&lt;br /&gt;'''Takehisa Kosugi'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 1963 [[Takehisa Kosugi]] composed for ''Fluxus 1'' a musical piece called ''Theatre Music'' in the form of a rectangle of cardstock that bore the trace of a spiral of moving feet. This was paired with the instructions: "Keep walking intently".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Mereweather ed., ''Art Anti-Art Non-Art'', Getty Research Institute, 2007, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;'''Juan María Solare'''&lt;br /&gt;
* His work ''[[Gestenstücke]]'' (2008) is a collection of five pieces for 4 performers in which a musical structure is used to put order in non-sounding elements, concretely gestures. For instance, the first piece of the cycle is a canon of gestures. Premiere: University Bremen, Ensemble Neues Musiktheater, June 12, 2008.
* Another non-sounding piece is his conceptual work called ''Tense Atmosphere'' a graphic score which consists of a silence with a sforzato sign (2013).

== Algorithmic music ==
[[File:Stadler -579180303.jpg|right|thumb|Maximilian Stadler (1748-1833)]]
''A sequence of finite instructions'' according to Wikipedia, an [[algorithm]] relates to computation, which ultimately relates to music. Eighteenth century algorithmic music is a contemporary of [[automaton]] machines, like [[Jacques de Vaucanson]]'s duck or [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]]'s chess player, or [[Ada Lovelace]] and [[Charles Babbage]]'s 1822 difference engine. In 1787, [[W.A. Mozart]] (1756–1791) devised an aleatoric system called ''[[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]]'' (''Musical Dice'')&lt;ref&gt;Musikalisches Würfelspiel (Musical Dice Game), K.516f in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart’s music&lt;/ref&gt; published 1793 by J.J. Hummel in Berlin-Amsterdam, to compose waltzes with a pair of dice and a set of written bars on paper cards.&lt;ref&gt;See Hideo Noguchi's [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~rb5h-ngc/e/k516f.htm article]: ''Mozart Musical Game in C K. 516f'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of all the 16 cards and transitions, of which there are theoretically &lt;math&gt;10^{29}&lt;/math&gt; combinations, constitutes a minuet.&lt;ref&gt;Computation from John Chuang in a 1995 [http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/Mozart/dice/ article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian composer Maximilian Johann Karl Dominik Stadler, also known as [[Maximilian Stadler]] (1748–1833), created a table to compose [[minuet]]s and trios with a pair of dice. In the case of the minuet version, there are 16 cards with one bar each and preconceived transitions between certain musical measures. Mathematical games columnist Martin Gardner once remarked in an article about automated music composition. ''"If you fail to preserve it, it will be a waltz that will probably never be heard again."''&lt;ref&gt;See Ivars Peterson's [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/1956/title/Mozarts_Melody_Machine article] ''Mozart's Melody Machine'' on Science News&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of pure [[aleatoric music]] was used in the twentieth century by US composer [[Lejaren Hiller]].

== The optophonic piano&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Opto-disc.jpg|right|thumb| Optophonic disc, paint on glass, diameter: 40cms, ca. 1920-24]] --&gt; ==
[[Wladimir Baranoff-Rossiné]]&lt;ref&gt;See Baranoff-Rossiné's official web [http://www.baranoffrossine.com/museum/optophonicpiano/ page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627175122/http://www.baranoffrossine.com/museum/optophonicpiano/ |date=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; started building his [[optophonic piano]] in the 1915s. A set of painted glass discs are rotated via the small keyboard. Light is projected through the discs onto the wall. The player can control intensity of light and speed of rotation. 6 or 8 keys of the 3-octaves keyboard are devoted to colored discs. It is not clear what kind of sound the keyboard is able to produce. Oscillator frequencies (as stated in some articles) are rather unlikely between 1915-1920. More probably the light show was performed with piano accompaniment, maybe performed on the reduced keyboard of the Optosonic Piano, akin to a toy piano.

== Unfinished/aborted music ==
At one point, the music exists in the composer's mind. In 1928, [[Edgar Varèse]] started working on an opera called ''L'Astronome'' based on North American Indian legends, a project he never completed and destroyed the drafts. In 1932, he asked [[Antonin Artaud]] to write the libretto of a large scale oratorio, ''Il n'ya plus de firmament'' (There is no longer any firmament). In his book ''Phantasmatic Radio'' '''Allen S. Weiss''' translates the beginning of Artaud's text:
{{cquote|''Darkness. Explosions in this darkness. Harmonies suddenly broken off. Harsh sounds. Depressurized soundings. The music will give the impression of a distant cataclysm and will fill the room, falling as from vertiginous heights. Chords will originate in the sky and then deteriorate, going from one extreme to the other. Sounds will fall as if from very high, then suddenly stop and spread out in bursts, forming vaults and parasols. Tiers of sounds...'' [in ''Phantasmatic Radio''&lt;ref&gt;Allen S. Weiss, ''Phantasmatic Radio'', Duke University Press, 1995, page 42&lt;/ref&gt;]}}
The piece was never completed and Varèse turned to other projects, including a radiophonic work involving various synchronised choirs located in different places of the world. He never found the technology for it. In 1948, Artaud insisted on having noise sounds included in his ''Pour en finir avec le judgement de Dieu'' (To have done with the judgment of God). This was done in the Radiodiffusion Television Française studios where [[Pierre Schaeffer]] was working at the time.

== Silent music ==
''Silent Music'' (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Schulz (editor) ''Silent Music - zwischen Klangkunst und Akustikdesign/Between Sound Art and Acoustic Design'', book+CD, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; is an installation work by Canadian artist [[Robin Minard]] (b1953) with several hundred wall-mounted piezo loudspeakers and four-channel audio. The miniature loudspeakers are displayed in plant-like shapes on the walls of public spaces. They reproduce the minuscule ambient sounds of the public space where they are installed or play random synthetic sounds at barely audible volume. Minard deals with remote sounds best suited to intimate listening. In 2006 he created 'A voir en silence', a small artist book with loudspeakers and hand-written text.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Meinhardt ''Silent Music/Adelaide Festival'' DVD, Australia, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discursive music ==
'''Marcel Proust'''&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Vinteuil Sonata]] (French: [[:fr:Sonate de Vinteuil|''Sonate de Vinteuil'']]) is an imaginary violin and piano sonata by fictitious composer Vinteuil recurring several times in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu'' (''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''), particularly in ''[[Un amour de Swann|Un Amour De Swann]]'' (1913). In the latter volume, Charles Swann associates strong emotions and memories to the melody composed by Vinteuil. The French composer [[Reynaldo Hahn]] noticed how much Marcel Proust ''"vivait la musique de son temps"'' (experienced contemporary music).&lt;ref&gt;See Adrien De Vries' [http://www.classiquenews.com/applaudir/lire_article.aspx?article=1012&amp;identifiant=20074159EEHR4OOD1ZQH7CEC61RFTMS8 article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205112508/http://www.classiquenews.com/applaudir/lire_article.aspx?article=1012&amp;identifiant=20074159EEHR4OOD1ZQH7CEC61RFTMS8 |date=2008-12-05 }}: ''Sources de la Sonate de Vinteuil'', April 2007 (in french)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Proust immediately praised and enjoyed [[Debussy]]'s 1902 ''[[Pelléas_et_Mélisande_(opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande ]]'' opera. Critics disagree on which composer inspired the Sonata. Possibly [[Gabriel Fauré]]&lt;ref&gt;See Margaret Hunter and Abigail Al-Doory's [http://www.french.pomona.edu/MSAIGAL/CLASSES/FR185/FALL96/aaldoory-mhunter/ article]: ''L'homme et la Musique Dans Un Amour de Swann'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; or [[César Franck]]. In [[:fr:Les Plaisirs et les Jours|Les Plaisirs et les Jours]] (1896), Proust focusses on [[Hans Sachs]]'s monologue from [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', Act II. In ''[[Jean Santeuil]]'' (1952), a [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] Sonata for Violin and Piano (op. 75, 1885) plays a key role and is presumably the model for the Sonate de Vinteuil. In ''Un Amour De Swann'', the Vinteuil Sonata is played during evenings at the Verdurins' by pianist Dechambre. The main character's emotions are mirrored by Proust's musical reminiscences. 

'''Walter Marchetti'''
&lt;br /&gt;A good example of imaginary music can be found in a Walter Marchetti poem where he mentions a Juan Hidalgo imaginary composition (both Hidalgo and Marchetti were members of the Spanish [[Zaj]] Group of Madrid in the late 1950s).
{{cquote|''Eat an iced popsicle and thus perform his free''&lt;br /&gt;''transcription, for only one performer, of''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Music For Five Dogs, an iced'''''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Popsicle and Six Male Performers'''''&lt;br /&gt;''by Juan Hidalgo.''&lt;br /&gt;Walter Marchetti in ''A Zaj Sampler''&lt;ref&gt;Something Else Press, New York, 1967, reissued by Great Bear Pamphlets&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Musical fiction''' is a genre of fiction in which music is paramount: both as subject matter, and through the rhythm and flow of the prose; that is, music is manifested through the language itself. 

Notable authors who have written novels of musical fiction include [[Don DeLillo]] (''Great Jones Street''), [[Tom Perotta]] (''The Wishbones''), [[Lewis Shiner]] (''Glimpses''), [[Roddy Doyle]] (''The Commitments''), [[Robert Dunn (novelist)|Robert Dunn]] (''Pink Cadillac''), [[Nick Hornby]] (''High Fidelity''), [[Ibi Kaslik]] (''The Angel Riots''), [[Scott Spencer (author)|Scott Spencer]] (''The Rich Man's Table''), Brian Paone (''Yours Truly, 2095''), and Randy Blazak (''The Mission of the Sacred Heart'').

==Description==
In her anthology The Best of Rock Fiction, editor June Skinner Sawyers writes, “Rock fiction has not received the proper respect it deserves, which is unfortunate given the caliber of writers who have captured its fleeting essence on the written page.”&lt;ref&gt;Sawyers, June Skinner (Ed.) (2005). ''The Best in Rock Fiction.'' Milwaukee: Hal Leonard, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same anthology, Rolling Stone writer Anthony DeCurtis talks about “the edgy relationship” between music and the written word. “Words are long-standing symbols of permanence. Music ultimately is ephemeral, evaporating into your unreliable memory once you’ve heard it. In taking music as their inspiration, writers seek to capture some of that immediacy, that spirit of the moment, and hold it still for their reader’s pleasure.”&lt;ref&gt;Sawyers, June Skinner (Ed.) (2005). ''The Best in Rock Fiction.'' Milwaukee: Hal Leonard, pp. xii-xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Living Treasures Award''', alternatively known as the '''Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan''' (GAMABA; {{literal translation|Award for the Creators of the Country}}) is conferred to a person or group of artists recognized by the [[Government of the Philippines]] for their contributions to the country's [[intangible cultural heritage]]. A recipient of the award, known as a National Living Treasures or ''Manlilikha ng Bayan''  is defined as "a Filipino citizen or group of Filipino citizens engaged in any traditional art uniquely Filipino, whose distinctive skills have reached such a high level of technical and artistic excellence and have been passed on to and widely practiced by the present generations in their community with the same degree of technical and artistic competence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ph/2003/09/19/executive-order-no-236/ Executive Order No. 236, s. 2003] Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines. Retrieved 14 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The National Living Treasures Award (''Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan'') was institutionalized in 1992 through Republic Act No. 7355. The [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]], which is the highest policy-making and coordinating body of the [[Philippines]] for culture and the arts, was tasked with the implementation.&lt;ref name="ncca" /&gt; This is in line with UNESCO's criteria of [[Living Human Treasure|Living National Treasure]]s.

== Criteria ==
To become a National Living Treasure, the candidate must possess the following qualifications:&lt;ref name="ncca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/briefer-gawad-sa-manlilikha-ng-bayan/|title=Briefer: Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan|work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#is an inhabitant of an indigenous/traditional cultural community anywhere in the Philippines that has preserved indigenous customs, beliefs, rituals and traditions and/or has syncretized whatever external elements that have influenced it.
#must have engaged in a folk art tradition that has been in existence and documented for at least 50 years.
#must have consistently performed or produced over a significant period, works of superior and distinctive quality.
#must possess a mastery of tools and materials needed by the art, and must have an established reputation in the art as master and maker of works of extraordinary technical quality.
#must have passed on and/or will pass on to other members of the community their skills in the folk art for which the community is traditionally known.

A traditional artist who possesses all the qualities of a ''Manlilikha ng Bayan'' candidate, but due to age or infirmity has left them incapable of teaching further their craft, may still be recognized if:&lt;ref name="ncca" /&gt;

#had created a significant body of works and/or has consistently displayed excellence in the practice of their art, thus achieving important contributions for its development.
#has been instrumental in the revitalization of their community's artistic tradition.
#has passed on to the other members of the community skills in the folk art for which the community is traditionally known.
#community has recognized them as master and teacher of their craft.

== Categories ==

The categories are, but not limited to, the following categories of traditional folk arts:&lt;ref name="ncca" /&gt;

* folk architecture
* maritime transport
* weaving
* carving
* performing arts
* literature
* graphic and plastic arts
* ornament
* textile or fiber art
* pottery

Other artistic expressions of traditional culture may be added.

== Recipients and nominees ==
As defined by [[UNESCO]], the bearers of intangible cultural heritage are to be known internationally as [[Living Human Treasure]]s. The Filipino counterparts of this title are the [[Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan]] (GAMABA) awardees. There are currently sixteen declared GAMABA awardees, all of which have exemplified the highest standard in their respective field of expertise. The award is only given to individuals or groups that have exhibited the highest possible standard in intangible cultural heritage. A master of the heritage does not automatically qualify an individual or group for the award as the craft of the master should exude a higher meaning to the highest standard set by the highly critical council of the GAMABA board. Due to this lengthy and critical process, only sixteen of the thousands of traditional masters have been conferred with the award.

[[File:Fragrance pyramid.svg|thumb|Fragrance pyramid.]]
'''Notes''' in [[perfume]]ry are descriptors of scents that can be sensed upon the application of a perfume. Notes are separated into three classes; '''top/head notes''', '''middle/heart notes''', and '''base notes'''; which denote groups of scents which can be sensed with respect to the time after the application of a perfume. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process and intended use of the perfume. The presence of one note may alter the perception of another—for instance, the presence of certain base or heart notes will alter the scent perceived when the top notes are strongest, and likewise the scent of base notes in the dry-down will often be altered depending on the smells of the heart notes.

The idea of ''notes'' is used primarily for the marketing of fine fragrances. The term is sometimes used by [[perfumer]]s to describe approximately scents or the perfumery process to laypeople.

|Top Notes: || 1 to 14 (most volatile)

|}

==Top notes==
Top notes are otherwise called the head notes.

Perceived immediately upon application of a perfume, top notes consist of small, light molecules that [[evaporation|evaporate]] quickly. They form a person's initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of the product. The scents of this note class are usually described as "fresh", "assertive" or "sharp". The compounds that contribute to top notes are strong in scent, very volatile, and evaporate quickly. 

Although not as saliently perceived, the heart and base-notes contribute much to the scent in the top notes.

[[Citrus]] and [[ginger]] scents are common top notes.

==Middle notes==
They are also called the "heart notes".

The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to when the top notes dissipate. The middle note compounds form the "heart" or main body of a perfume and emerge in the middle of the [[perfume]]'s dispersion process. They serve to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. Not surprisingly, the scent of middle note compounds is usually more mellow and "rounded". Scents from this note class appear anywhere from twenty minutes to one hour after the application of a perfume. 

[[Lavender]] and [[rose]] scents are typical middle notes.

==Base notes==
The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class are often the fixatives used to hold and boost the strength of the lighter top and middle notes. Consisting  of large, heavy molecules that evaporate slowly, compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and "deep" and are usually not perceived until 30 minutes after the application of the perfume or during the period of perfume dry-down. 

Some base notes can still be detectable in excess of twenty-four hours after application, particularly the animalic and [[musk]] notes.

'''[[Our Lady of Sorrows]], Queen of [[Poland]]''', '''Our Lady of Licheń''', or '''Virgin of [[Licheń Stary|Licheń]]''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[icon]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] venerated by its Polish faithful dating from 1772 and is permanently enshrined within the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen|Sanctuary of Our Lady of Licheń]], in central Poland, which was built to honor it, and receives about 1.5 million pilgrims per year.&lt;ref&gt;''Moved by Mary: The Power of Pilgrimage in the Modern World'' by Anna-Karina Hermkens, Willy Jansen, Catrien Notermans 2009 {{ISBN|0-7546-6789-8}} page 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Poland'' by Neal Bedford 2008 {{ISBN|1-74104-479-0}} page 401&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Licheń - bazylika 08.JPG|thumb|200px|The framed icon (lower image in red) on the altar of the basilica.]]

Along with the [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]], located in [[Częstochowa]], southern Poland, the image is one of the two most venerated Marian images in Poland. The image was canonically crowned by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 15 August 1967.

==Description==
In the central image, the Virgin Mary has a gold dress&lt;ref&gt;A new golden dress (named 'sapphire') was made in 2017 for the gratitude of the jubilee of 50 years from coronation of the icon in 1967. See the [http://www.lichen.pl/pl/579/szafirowa_sukienka_matki_bozej_lichenskiej official website of the shrine] (Polish).&lt;/ref&gt;, is being crowned by two angels and is surrounded by a ring of stars. Below the image a ribbon carries the inscription: "Queen of Poland, give us days of peace." The image measures 9.5 × 15.5&amp;nbsp;cm and is on larger panel of 16 × 25&amp;nbsp;cm. There is a second crown above the image, on the larger panel.

==Legend and history==

The icon was painted in 1772 as a replica of the icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary enshrined in [[Rokitno, Międzyrzecz County]] in Western Poland. According to legend, a Polish soldier (called Thomas Kłossowski) was wounded in the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in 1813 and had a vision of the Virgin Mary who saved him from death and instructed him to look for the image upon his return to Poland. Kłossowski is then said to have looked for and found the image in the woods in [[Grąblin]] as instructed.

According to oral tradition, in 1850 Kłossowski and shepherd Nicholas Sikatka witnessed several apparitions of the Virgin Mary who called for repentance and prayer. In the apparitions, the Virgin reportedly predicted war and a cholera epidemic, but also gave hope. During the cholera plague of 1852, the image became famous for performing miracles.

On 29 September  1852 the image was moved to the parish church in [[Licheń]] and remained there until 2006.  Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]], the Primate of the Millennium gave its [[Canonical Coronation]] towards the image with the approval of Pope Paul VI on 15 August 1967.

==The basilica==
In 1994 the construction of the new basilica of [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen]] was started to house the image and accommodate the large number of pilgrims. Pope [[John Paul II]] blessed the basilica in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_07061999_lichen_en.html Vatican web site: John Paul II at Lichen]&lt;/ref&gt; The basilica is Poland's largest church, the seventh largest in Europe and eleventh in the world. The basilica's organ manufactured by the Zych company (157 stops, 6 manuals and pedalboard) is the largest instrument in Poland, the fourth largest in Europe and thirteenth largest in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Licheńskie organy na tle największych instrumentów Polski, Europy i świata |last=Szostak |first=Michał |date=2017 |publisher=Zakład Gospodarczy "Dom Pielgrzyma" |isbn=9788364126147 |location=Licheń Stary |pages=154-155 |oclc=1005163172}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On July 2, 2006 the image was placed in the main altar of the basilica.

The '''''Portrait of Ugolino Martelli''''' is a painting by the Italian artist [[Agnolo di Cosimo]], known as [[Bronzino]], executed in 1536 or 1537. It is housed in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]], [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The work is signed ''BRONZO FIORENTINO'' on the edge of the table top.&lt;ref name=Wildmoser&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wildmoser|first=Rudolf|title=Das Bildnis des Ugolino Martelli von Agnolo Bronzino|journal=Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen|year=1989|issue=31|pages=181–214|jstor=4125857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugolino Martelli (1519-1592) was a [[Florence|Florentine]] aristocrat, a humanist and a linguist, whose palace can be seen in the background of the picture. A marble ''David'' of the family's collection appears in the background. It was attributed at the time to [[Donatello]], while it is now ascribed to [[Antonio Rossellino|Antonio]] or [[Bernardo Rossellino]] and dated between about 1461 to 1479. The earliest reference to the sculpture is in the private records of Luigi d'Ugolino Martelli (Ugolino's grandfather), in an inventory of his possessions begun in 1488. It is now in the [[National Gallery of Art, Washington|National Gallery]] in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref name=NGA&gt;{{cite web|last=National Gallery of Art|title=The David of the Casa Martelli|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.1254.html|publisher=National Gallery of Art, Washington|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The David was a traditional symbol of the Florentine freedom, and could be an allusion to Martelli adherence to the city's Republican party.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=Norbert|title=The Portrait|year=2002|publisher=Taschen|isbn=9783822819951|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5w8U6OFuOkC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4555">'''Puka shells''' originally were naturally occurring [[bead]]-like objects which can be found on some beaches in [[Hawaii]]. Each one was the beach-worn apex of a [[Conus|cone snail]] shell, a kind of [[seashell]] from a [[sea snail]]. ''Puka'' is the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word for "hole" and refers to the naturally occurring hole in the middle of these rounded and worn shell fragments. These natural beads were made into necklaces.

Numerous inexpensive imitations are now widely sold as puka shell necklaces. The majority of these are not made from cone shells, but from other shells, or even from plastic. In addition, some strings of beads are currently sold that are made from cone shells, but the beads in these necklaces were not formed by natural processes. They were instead worked by hand from whole shells using pliers to break the shell down to the needed part, and then subjecting the rough results to [[tumble finishing]], in order to give each bead more or less smooth edges in imitation of the natural wear and tear a shell receives when tumbled in the surf over long periods of time.

The original all-natural puka shells were very easily made into [[necklace]]s, [[bracelet]]s and [[anklet]]s because they were naturally pierced, which enabled them to be strung like [[bead]]s. Puka shell [[jewellery]] first became a popular item in [[Hawaii]] during the 1960s, as an attractive and inexpensive lei which could be made and sold on the beach where it was made. In the 1970s, this type of shell jewelry became highly sought after, and prices skyrocketed. The craftsmanship also became more refined and the ''lei pūpū puka'', puka shell leis were strung in graduated or matching styles, rather than the original random patterns. 

Many "legends" about the puka shell were created during this time, and these stories also helped sales.

==Natural puka shell formation==
[[File:Textile cone.JPG| thumb|left|A live [[Conus textile|Textile Cone Snail]] from Australia]]
The terminal helix of the shell of a cone snail is cone-shaped, and closed at the apex. When the empty shell is rolled over a long time by the waves in the breaking surf and [[coral]] rubble, the terminal helix of the shell breaks off or is gradually ground off, leaving the solid top of the shell intact. 

Given enough time, the tip of the [[spire (mollusc)|spire]] of the shell usually also wears down, and thus a natural hole is formed from one side to the other. This shell fragment can be viewed as a sort of a natural bead, and is known in Hawaii as a "puka". Real puka shells are not flat: one side of the bead is slightly convex; the other is concave. The concave side of the bead clearly shows the spiral form of the interior of the [[spire (mollusc)|spire]] of the cone shell.

==Modern substitutes==
Naturally-formed rounded cone shell fragments suitable to be used as beads are hard to find in large quantities, so true puka jewelry, formed entirely naturally, is now uncommon. Shell jewellery made from naturally occurring puka shells is also now more expensive because of the labor and time involved in locating and hand-picking these rather uncommon shell fragments from the beach drift. 

In modern times, beads cut from other types of shell, or even beads of plastic, are used to make imitation puka jewellery. Cone snail shells are sometimes harvested so that they can be chipped and ground down to make more authentic-looking puka jewellery, which is however still not genuine by the standards of the originals. 

A very glossy [[patina]] indicates that the shells in a necklace have been [[Tumble finishing|tumble polished]]. If the edges of the shell beads are chipped, the shells were harvested and manually broken into shape. If the "puka" or central hole is perfectly circular and parallel-sided, then the hole was drilled by humans.

The '''Quito School''' ('''''Escuela Quiteña''''') is a [[Latin American]] artistic tradition that constitutes essentially the whole of the professional artistic output developed in the territory of the [[Royal Audience of Quito]] — from [[Pasto]] and [[Popayán]] in the north to [[Piura]] and [[Cajamarca]] in the south — during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period (1542-1824)]].&lt;ref&gt;Ximena Escudero-Albornoz and Ximena Escudero de Terán.

Ediciones del Banco de los Andes (1992). {{ISBN|9978-82-293-3}}, {{ISBN|978-9978-82-293-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially associated with the 17th and 18th centuries and was almost exclusively focused on the religious art of the [[Catholic Church]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Handelsman, Michael (2000), ''Culture and Customs of Ecuador'' (Series: Culture and Customs of Latin America and the Caribbean; Series editor: Peter Standish); Westport, Connecticut/London: Greenwood Press, pg 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized by a mastery of the realistic and by the degree to which indigenous beliefs and artistic traditions are evident, these productions were among of the most important activities in the economy of the Royal Audience of Quito.&lt;ref&gt;Christiana Renate Borchart de Moreno. ''La Audiencia de Quito: aspectos económicos y sociales (siglos XVI-XVIII)''. Editorial Abya Yala (1998). {{ISBN|9978-72-084-7}}, {{ISBN|978-9978-72-084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the prestige of the movement even in Europe that it was said that [[King Carlos III]] of Spain (1716–1788), referring to one of its sculptors in particular, opined: "I am not concerned that Italy has [[Michelangelo]]; in my colonies of America I have the master [[Caspicara]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rivas, Julio (2012), [http://www.clave.com.ec/index.php?idSeccion=785|fechaacceso=05/03/2013 ''Un sitio llamado San Francisco'']; ''Revista Clave!'', Nov-Dec issue. [''No me preocupa que Italia tenga a [[Miguel Ángel]], en mis colonias de América yo tengo al maestro Caspicara.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Quito School originated in the school of Artes y Oficios, founded in 1552 by the Franciscan priest [[Jodoco Ricke]], who together with Friar [[Pedro Bedon]] transformed the San Andrés seminary, where the first indigenous artists were trained. As a cultural expression, it is the result of a long process of acculturation between indigenous peoples and Europeans, and it is one of the richest expressions of [[Mestizo|miscegenation (''mestizaje'')]] and of [[syncretism]], in which the participation of the vanquished Indian is seemingly of minor importance as compared to the dominant European contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Ximena Escudero Albornoz and José María Vargas Arévalo. ''Historia y crítica del Arte Hispanoamericano, Real Audiencia de Quito: (siglos XVI, XVII y XVIII)''. Editorial Abya Yala (2000). {{ISBN|9978-04-562-7}}, {{ISBN|978-9978-04-562-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
As a product of cultural syncretism and miscegenation, the works of the Quito School are characterized by the combination and adaptation of European and Indigenous features. In its development, it reflected the styles prevailing in each period of Spain and thus contains [[renaissance]] and [[Mannerism|mannerist]] elements. During its height, it was eminently [[baroque]], concluding with a short [[rococo]] period leading to an incipient [[neoclassicism]] until the transition to the [[History of Ecuador (1830–60)|republican period]]. The Quito School also incorporated [[Flemish]], [[Culture of Italy|Italian]], and [[Moorish]] influences.

One of the common characteristics of the school is the technique of ''encarnado'' ("flesh-colored") — the simulation of the color of the flesh of the [European] human body — that makes the skin of sculptures appear more natural. Once the piece was perfectly cut and sanded, an artisan covered the wood with several layers of [[gesso]] with glue. Each layer was highly polished to achieve a perfectly smooth finish. Next, color was applied in various transparent layers, allowing an optical mix of overlapping colors. This began with the colors of shadows (blue, green, ocher), then light colors were applied (white, pink, yellow). and finally highlight colors were added (orange and red to cheeks, knees, and elbows of children; and dark blue, green, and violet for wounds and bruises of Christ or for stubble on a beardless figure).

Other typical characteristics include:
*Serpentine representation of the movement of bodies, especially in sculpture
*Application of [[watercolor|''aguada'' (watercolor)]] on top of [[gold leaf]] or silver paint, giving a special metallic sheen

The features indicating its indigenous roots include:
* "Quiteñization" of characters, with mixed traits and local costumes
* Frequent appearance of ancestral indigenous customs
* Location of the scenes within the Andean countryside or cities
* Presence of local flora and fauna, and the substitution of local plants for traditional European iconography

'''Road of Hope in Color''' (Spanish: '''Ruta de Esperanza en Color'''; Macedonian: '''Патот на Надежта во Боја'''; Croatian: '''Put Nade u Boji''') is an [[art exhibition]] and a movement against [[cancer]] that proposes the creation by law of an art workshop for each Regional Hospital along [[Chile]], to benefit cancer patients and those who must face long-term illness, thereby improving the system of [[Public health|Public Health]].

It consists of 28 [[oil painting]]s on canvas, 12 of which were painted from February to August 2011 over the treatment of six sessions of [[chemotherapy]] of a 79-year-old patient diagnosed with cancer in December 2010, Prof. Dora Formas. Two renowned European artists, Tome Mishev and Chendo, contributed six works, each created especially for this exhibition. Marysol Salval, a Spanish artist who lives in Chile, contributed four paintings. The background music of the exposition is donated by [[Simon Trpčeski]], piano soloist from the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] of [[London]]. In addition, this initiative is being supported by ADICA (Professional Diplomats Association) and FALP (Arturo Lopez Perez Foundation against cancer).

The collection opened in the Cultural Center “[[Palacio de La Moneda]]” and is planned to be presented in cities in Chile, United States, Spain, [[Croatia]], [[Turkey]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. It is a tribute to women as a symbol of fertility, creative force, beauty, harmony, and spiritual strength. It has depth and complexity, expressing theology, mythology and how they confuse each other to this day; it encourages reflection and perhaps a metaphysical concept along with other philosophical disquisitions. The Road of Hope in Color is a masterful expression of love for life. Each work reflects the symbolism of life, death and resurrection, spiritual peace, the [[Eucharist]] and the hope for renewal of faith.

Pursuant to the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 between the [[Holy See]] and Italy, the Basilica is within Italian territory and not the territory of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]].&lt;ref&gt;Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 15 ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Holy See]] fully owns the Basilica, and Italy is legally obligated to recognize its full ownership thereof&lt;ref&gt;Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 13 ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf])&lt;/ref&gt; and to concede to it "the immunity granted by International Law to the headquarters of the diplomatic agents of foreign States."&lt;ref&gt;Lateran Treaty of 1929, Article 15 ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appellations==
The Basilica is sometimes referred to as [[Dedication of the Basilica of St Mary Major|Our Lady of the Snows]], a name given to it in the [[Roman Missal]] from 1568 to 1969 in connection with the [[Dedication of the Basilica of St Mary Major|liturgical feast of the anniversary of its dedication]] on 5 August, a feast that was then denominated ''Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae ad Nives'' (Dedication of Saint Mary of the Snows). This name for the basilica had become popular in the 14th century&lt;ref name=Calendarium&gt;{{harvnb|Calendarium Romanum|1969|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; in connection with a legend that the 1911 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] reports thus: "During the pontificate of [[Pope Liberius|Liberius]], the Roman patrician John and his wife, who were without heirs, made a vow to donate their possessions to the Virgin Mary. They prayed that she might make known to them how they were to dispose of their property in her honour. On 5 August, at the height of the Roman summer, snow fell during the night on the summit of the Esquiline Hill. In obedience to a vision of the Virgin Mary which they had the same night, the couple built a basilica in honour of Mary on the very spot which was covered with snow. From the fact that no mention whatever is made of this alleged miracle until a few hundred years later, not even by [[Pope Sixtus III|Sixtus III]] in his eight-line dedicatory inscription ... it would seem that the legend has no historical basis."&lt;ref name="cathency"&gt;{{harvnb|Ott|1913|loc=Our Lady of the Snow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend is first reported only after AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020611054253/http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/SaintOfDay/default.asp?id=1098 Dedication of St. Mary Major Basilica]&lt;/ref&gt; It may be implied in what the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', of the early 13th century, says of Pope Liberius: "He built the basilica of his own name (i.e. the Liberian Basilica) near the [[Macellum Liviae|Macellum of Livia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loomis|1916|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its prevalence in the 15th century is shown in the painting of the Miracle of the Snow by [[Masolino da Panicale]].&lt;ref name="Miles 1993157"&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1993|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;This triptych painted around 1423 was commissioned for the basilica by a member of the [[Colonna family]]; it is now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]], Naples (Paul Joannides, "The Colonna Triptych by Masolino and Masaccio," ''Arte Cristiana'' no 728 (1988:339-)). The miracle is depicted as witnessed by a crowd of men and women, with Jesus and the Virgin Mary observing from above.&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast was originally called ''Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae'' (Dedication of Saint Mary's),&lt;ref name="cathency"/&gt; and was celebrated only in Rome until inserted for the first time into the [[General Roman Calendar]], with ''ad Nives'' added to its name, in 1568.&lt;ref name=Calendarium/&gt; A congregation appointed by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1741 proposed that the reading of the legend be struck from the Office and that the feast be given its original name.&lt;ref name="cathency"/&gt; No action was taken on the proposal until 1969, when the reading of the legend was removed and the feast was called ''In dedicatione Basilicae S. Mariae'' (Dedication of the Basilica of Saint Mary).&lt;ref name=Calendarium/&gt; The legend is still commemorated by dropping white [[rose]] petals from the [[dome]] during the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and Second [[Vespers]] of the feast.

The earliest building on the site was the '''Liberian Basilica''' or '''Santa Maria Liberiana''', after [[Pope Liberius]] (352–366). This name may have originated from the same legend, which recounts that, like John and his wife, Pope Liberius was told in a dream of the forthcoming summer snowfall, went in procession to where it did occur and there marked out the area on which the church was to be built.&lt;ref name=Parsch&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/calendar/day.cfm?id=218 Pius Parsch, ''The Church's Year of Grace'' quoted in Catholic Culture: "Ordinary Time, 5 August"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liberiana'' is still included in some versions of the basilica's formal name, and "Liberian Basilica" may be used as a contemporary as well as historical name.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [[Holy See]]'s press office using "Papal Liberian Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome" in English [http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_biografie/cardinali_bio_law_bf_en.html in a 2011 note] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303044547/http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_biografie/cardinali_bio_law_bf_en.html |date=3 March 2013 }}, while the [http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/sm_maggiore/en/vita_liturgica/informazioni.htm official Vatican website for the church] uses various formulas, some under a coat of arms that includes "basilica Liberiana" in Italian.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the name "Liberian Basilica" may be independent of the legend, since, according to Pius Parsch, Pope Liberius transformed a palace of the Sicinini family into a church, which was for that reason called the '''Sicinini Basilica'''. This building was then replaced under [[Pope Sixtus III]] (432–440) by the present structure dedicated to Mary.&lt;ref name=Parsch/&gt; However, some sources say that the adaptation as a church of a pre-existing building on the site of the present basilica was done in the 420s under [[Pope Celestine I]], the immediate predecessor of Sixtus III.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubin|2009|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long before the earliest traces of the story of the miraculous snow, the church now known as Saint Mary Major was called '''Saint Mary of the Crib''' (''Sancta Maria ad Praesepe''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0220/__P2.HTM Encyclical ''Slavorum Apostoli''], 5&lt;/ref&gt; a name it was given because of its [[relic]] of the crib or manger of the Nativity of [[Jesus Christ]], four boards of sycamore wood believed to have been brought to the church, together with a fifth, in the time of [[Pope Theodore I]] (640–649).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Crib Stephen M. Donovan, "Crib" in [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] 1908] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117161306/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Crib |date=17 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2NutWXeteNgC&amp;pg=PA22 Joan Carroll Cruz, ''Relics''] (Our Sunday Visitor 1984 {{ISBN|978-0-87973-701-6}}), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; This name appears in the [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine]] editions of the [[Roman Missal]] as the place for the pope's [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (the station Mass) on Christmas Night,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962.pdf ''Missale Romanum''], 1962 edition, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; while the name "Mary Major" appears for the church of the station Mass on Christmas Day.&lt;ref&gt;''Missale Romanum'', 1962 edition, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2006, the four Papal Major Basilicas, together with the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura|Basilica of St. Lawrence outside the Walls]] were referred to as the "patriarchal basilicas" of Rome,&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;When [[Pope Benedict XVI]] abandoned the title "[[Patriarch of the West]]", the title of St. Mary Major changed from ''patriarchal'' to ''papal'' basilica, as on [http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/sm_maggiore/index_en.html its official website].&lt;/ref&gt; and were associated with the five ancient [[patriarch]]ates (see [[Pentarchy]]). St. Mary Major was associated with the [[Patriarchate of Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Patriarch and Patriarchate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five Papal Basilicas along with the [[Basilica of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem]] (actually in Rome) and [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]] were the traditional [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome]], which were visited by pilgrims during their pilgrimage to Rome following a {{convert|20|km}} itinerary established by [[Philip Neri|St. Philip Neri]] on 25 February 1552.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oratoriosanfilippo.org/visita-sette-chiese.pdf La Visita alle Sette Chiese]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panvinio|first=Onofrio|title=Le sette chiese romane|year=1570|location=Rome|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SozbdUVZnycC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sacchi|first=Guido|title=La visita alle Sette Chiese: cenni storici|url=http://www.gliscritti.it/approf/luogiub/settechiese.htm#appel2|accessdate=12 August 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] issued a [[Papal bull]] granting equal indulgences of the basilica for pilgrims who travel to the [[Minor Basilica]] of [[Our Lady of Manaoag]].

==History of the present church==
[[File:Giovanni Paolo Pannini - The Piazza and Church of Santa Maria Maggiore.jpg|thumb|The Piazza and Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, by [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]]]]

It is agreed that the present church was built under [[Pope Sixtus III]] (432–440). The dedicatory inscription on the triumphal arch, ''Sixtus Episcopus plebi Dei'', (Sixtus the bishop to the people of God) is an indication of that Pope's role in the construction.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 49" /&gt; As well as this church on the summit of the [[Esquiline Hill]], Pope Sixtus III is said to have commissioned extensive building projects throughout the city, which were continued by his successor [[Pope Leo I]], the Great.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church retains the core of its original structure, despite several additional construction projects and damage by the [[earthquake of 1348]].

Church building in Rome in this period, as exemplified in Saint Mary Major, was inspired by the idea of Rome being not just the centre of the world of the [[Roman Empire]], as it was seen in the classical period, but the centre of the Christian world.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer46"&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the first churches built in honour of the Virgin Mary, was erected in the immediate aftermath of the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] of 431, which proclaimed Mary Mother of God. [[Pope Sixtus III]] built it to commemorate this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vassilaki|2000|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, the atmosphere that generated the council gave rise also the mosaics that adorn the interior of the dedication: "whatever the precise connection was between council and church it is clear that the planners of the decoration belong to a period of concentrated debates on nature and status of the Virgin and incarnate Christ."&lt;ref name="Corm889"/&gt; The magnificent [[mosaics]] of the nave and triumphal arch, seen as "milestones in the depiction" of the Virgin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vassilaki|2000|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; depict scenes of her life and that of Christ, but also scenes from the [[Old Testament]]: Moses striking the [[Red Sea]], and Egyptians drowning in the Red Sea.

Richard Krautheimer attributes the magnificence of the work also to the abundant revenue accruing to the papacy at the time from land holdings acquired by the Church during the 4th and 5th centuries on the Italian peninsula: "Some of these holdings were locally controlled; the majority as early as the end of the 5th century were administered directly from Rome with great efficiency: a central accounting system was involved in the papal chancery; and a budget was apparently prepared, one part of the income going to the papal administration, another to the needs of the clergy, a third to the maintenance of church buildings, a fourth to charity. These fines enabled the papacy to carry out through the 5th century an ambitious building program, including Santa Maria Maggiore."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miri Rubin believes that the building of the basilica was influenced also by seeing Mary as one who could represent the imperial ideals of classical Rome, bringing together the old Rome and the new Christian Rome:  "In Rome, the city of [[martyr]]s, if no longer of emperors, Mary was a figure that could credibly carry imperial memories and representations."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubin|2009|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory the Great may have been inspired by Byzantine devotions to the Theotokos (Mother of God) when after becoming Pope during a plague in 590 that had taken the life of his predecessor, he ordered for seven processions to march through the city of Rome chanting Psalms and Kyrie Eleison, in order to appease the wrath of God. The processions began in different parts of the city, but rather than finally converging on St Peter's, who was always the traditional protector of Rome, he instead ordered the processions to converge on Mary Major instead.&lt;ref&gt; Andrew J. Ekonomou. Byzantine Rome and Greek Popes. Lexington Books, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;  

When the popes returned to Rome after the period of the [[Avignon papacy]], the buildings of the basilica became a temporary [[Palace of the Popes (disambiguation)|Palace of the Popes]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} due to the deteriorated state of the [[Lateran Palace]]. The papal residence was later moved to the [[Palace of the Vatican]] in what is now [[Vatican City]].

The basilica was restored, redecorated and extended by various popes, including [[Pope Eugene III|Eugene III]] (1145–1153), [[Pope Nicholas IV|Nicholas IV]] (1288–92), [[Pope Clement X|Clement X]] (1670–76), and [[Pope Benedict XIV|Benedict XIV]] (1740–58), who in the 1740s commissioned [[Ferdinando Fuga]] to build the present façade and to modify the interior. The interior of the Santa Maria Maggiore underwent a broad renovation encompassing all of its altars between the years 1575 and 1630.

On 15 December 2015, a [[Palestine (state)|Palestinian]] and a [[Tunisia]]n national were arrested after they tried to disarm soldiers stationed outside the basilica while yelling "[[Takbir|Allah (God) is great]]". When police intervened, the two men aged 40 and 30 called other foreigners in the area to their aid, and assaulted and threatened the arresting officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2015/12/15/two-homeless-arabs-attack-soldiers-at-rome-cathedral_1eb5f4d1-1270-42b9-b46f-fa6ade40d53f.html ANSA Italy News Service], accessed 16 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Piazza Esquilino, Santa Maria Maggiore.JPG|thumb|Piazza dell'Esquilino with the apse area of Santa Maria Maggiore.]]
The original architecture of Santa Maria Maggiore was classical and traditionally [[Roman architecture|Roman]] perhaps to convey the idea that Santa Maria Maggiore represented old imperial Rome as well as its Christian future. As one scholar puts it, "Santa Maria Maggiore so closely resembles a second-century imperial [[basilica]] that it has sometimes been thought to have been adapted from a basilica for use as a Christian church. Its plan was based on [[Hellenistic]] principles stated by [[Vitruvius]] at the time of [[Augustus]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1993|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Santa Maria Maggiore is immense in its area, it was built to plan. The design of the basilica was a typical one during this time in Rome: "a tall and wide nave; an aisle on either side; and a semicircular apse at the end of the nave."&lt;ref name="Krautheimer46"/&gt; The key aspect that made Santa Maria Maggiore such a significant cornerstone in church building during the early 5th century were the beautiful [[mosaics]] found on the triumphal arch and nave. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[File:Detail of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the external façade of the apse on the north-west of the church on Piazza dell'Esquilino]]

The Athenian marble columns supporting the nave are even older, and either come from the first basilica, or from another antique Roman building; thirty-six are marble and four granite, pared down, or shortened to make them identical by Ferdinando Fuga, who provided them with identical gilt-bronze capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beny|Gunn|1981|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th century [[campanile]], or bell tower, is the highest in Rome, at 246 feet, (about 75 m.). The basilica's 16th-century coffered ceiling, to a design by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], is said to be gilded with gold, initially brought by [[Christopher Columbus]], presented by [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] to the Spanish pope, [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles A. Coulombe]], ''Vicars of Christ'', p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; The apse mosaic, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], is from 1295, signed by the [[Franciscan]] friar, [[Jacopo Torriti]]. The Basilica also contains frescoes by [[Giovanni Baglione]], in the Cappella Borghese. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The 12th-century façade has been masked by a reconstruction, with a screening loggia, that were added by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743, to designs by [[Ferdinando Fuga]] that did not damage the mosaics of the façade. The wing of the ''canonica'' ([[sacristy]]) to its left and a matching wing to the right (designed by [[Flaminio Ponzio]]) give the basilica's front the aspect of a palace facing the ''Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore''. To the right of the Basilica's façade is a memorial representing a column in the form of an up-ended cannon barrel topped with a cross: it was erected by [[Pope Clement VIII]] to celebrate the end of the [[French Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/romeartlover/Vasi48.html Basilica memorial to celebrate the end of the French Wars of Religion]; accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marian column erected in 1614, to designs of [[Carlo Maderno]] is the model for numerous [[Marian column]]s erected in Catholic countries in thanksgiving for remission of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] during the [[Baroque]] era. (An example is the [[Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc]], the [[Czech Republic]]). The column itself is the sole remainder from Constantine's [[Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine]] in ''[[Roman Forum|Campo Vaccino]]'' Rome Art Lover website notes that Campo Vaccino as what the Roman Forum was called until the 18th century. Maderno's fountain at the base combines the armorial eagles and dragons of Paul V.

==Interior==

===Fifth century mosaics===
[[File:Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore (Rome).jpg|thumb|Interior of the basilica: view down the nave towards the high altar]]

The mosaics found in Santa Maria Maggiore are one of the oldest representations of the Virgin Mary in Christian [[Late Antiquity]]. As one scholar puts it, "This is well demonstrated by the decoration of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome,... where the iconographic depiction of the Virgin Mary was chosen at least in part to celebrate the affirmation of Mary as [[Theotokos]] (bearer of God) by the third ecumenical [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431 CE."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gwynn|Bangert|2010|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaics of the triumphal arch and the nave in Santa Maria Maggiore were the definition of [[impressionistic]] art during the time period and gave a model for the future representations of the Virgin Mary. The influences of these mosaics are rooted in late antique impressionism that could be seen in [[frescoes]], manuscript paintings and many pavement mosaics across villas in Africa, [[Syria]] and [[Sicily]] during the 5th century.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 49"&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These mosaics gave historians insight into artistic, religious, and social movements during this time. As Margaret Miles explains the mosaics in Santa Maria Maggiore have two goals: one to glorify the Virgin Mary as Theotokos (God-Bearer); and the other to present "a systematic and comprehensive articulation of the relationship of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian scriptures as one in which the Hebrew Bible foreshadows Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1993|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by the dual images of [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] events depicted in the mosaics of the triumphal arch and the nave. The mosaics also show the range of artistic expertise and refute the theory that mosaic technique during the time was based on copying from model books. The mosaics found in Santa Maria Maggiore are combinations of different styles of mosaic art during the time, according to art scholar Robin Cormack: "the range of artistic expertise and the actual complexities of production can hardly be reduced to a mentality of copying. A test case is given by the mosaics of S. Maria Maggiore in Rome".&lt;ref name="Corm889"&gt;{{harvnb|Cormack|2000|p=889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Triumphal arch====
[[File:RomaSantaMariaMaggioreArcoTrionfaleDxRegistro4.jpg|thumb|Detail of the mosaic in the triumphal arch, showing Bethlehem]]
The triumphal arch at the head of the nave was at first referred to as the [[apse]] arch, but later became known as the triumphal arch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The triumphal arch is illustrated with magnificent mosaics depicting different scenes of Christ and the Virgin Mary. There was a difference in the styles used in the triumphal arch mosaics compared to those of the nave; the style of the triumphal arch was much more linear and flat as one scholar describes it, not nearly as much action, emotion and movement in them as there were in the Old Testament mosaics of the nave.&lt;ref name="Corm889"/&gt; One of the first scenes that were visible on the triumphal arch was a panel of Christ's enthronement with a group of angels as his court. As one historian describes it: "On the apse arch Christ is enthroned, a young emperor attended by four [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlains]], angels of course",&lt;ref name="Krautheimer46"/&gt; this is a perfect example of mosaic art in the 5th century. Another panel found on the triumphal arch is of the Virgin, she is crowned and dressed in a colorful veil, her wardrobe subtly brings to mind that of a Roman empress and in this panel she has her divine son walking with her and a suite of angels and Joseph ready to greet her; "The Virgin...shows to perfection the impressionistic character of mosaics."&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 48"&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|1980|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another panel is known as the [[Adoration]] of the [[Magi]] and this mosaic depicts Infant Christ and The Virgin and the arrival of the three wise men, "mosaics illustrating Christ's first coming and his youth covered the triumphal arch."&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 48"/&gt; The other panel depicts the Virgin accompanied by five martyrs.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 49"/&gt;

====Nave====
[[File:SMM Nave Mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|A nave mosaic from the story of Moses]]
[[File:Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore abside a Roma.jpg|thumb|The apse of the basilica]]
The nave of the basilica was covered in mosaics representing Old Testament events of [[Moses]] leading the [[Jews]] out of [[Egypt]] across the Red Sea. "The nave mosaics (which represents stories of Old Testament history and accordingly offered Christians in Rome a new 'past') are illusionistic in a colorful and impressionist manner"&lt;ref name="Corm889"/&gt; as this scholar puts it the scene was filled with movement, emotion, and it was to inspire thinking of Rome's "new" past; the past of the Old Testament. As one scholar describes it: "Moses strikes the waters of the Red Sea in a heroic gesture, his toga in light and dark grays and blues, but lined in black, the folds white lines, the tunic underneath light blue; the man next to him wears a deep blue toga over a gray and white tunic."&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 49"/&gt; Another panel shows the demise of the [[Egyptians]] in the [[Red Sea]]. An observer describes the mosaic: "The Egyptians, clad in blue armor with gold bands and scarlet cloaks wildly flying, drown in the greenish blue waters; the horses, white or light brown shaded with darker browns, highlighted in white, the accoutrements a bright red."&lt;ref name="Krautheimer, 1980 p 48"/&gt;

Under the high altar of the basilica is the '''Crypt of the Nativity''' or ''Bethlehem Crypt'', with a crystal reliquary designed by [[Giuseppe Valadier]] said to contain wood from the Holy Crib of the nativity of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=Inside&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/sm_maggiore/en/storia/interno.htm Inside the Basilica]&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the burial place of [[Saint Jerome]], the 4th-century [[Doctor of the Church]] who translated the Bible into the [[Latin|Latin language]] (the [[Vulgate]]).&lt;ref name=Destinations&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/rome-santa-maria-maggiore Sacred Destinations: SantaMariaMaggiore, Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Santa Maria Maggiore (Rome) 06.jpg|thumb|left|Altar of Sistine Chapel and Oratory of the Nativity]]
Fragments of the sculpture of the Nativity believed to be by 13th-century [[Arnolfo di Cambio]] were transferred to beneath the altar of the large Sistine Chapel&lt;ref name=Inside/&gt; off the right transept of the church. This chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is named after [[Pope Sixtus V]], and is not to be confused with the [[Sistine Chapel]] of the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], named after [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The architect [[Domenico Fontana]] designed the chapel, which contains the tombs of Sixtus V himself and of his early patron [[Pope Pius V]]. The main altar in the chapel has four gilded bronze angels by Sebastiano Torregiani, holding up the [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]], which is a model of the chapel itself.

Beneath this altar is the Oratory or Chapel of the Nativity, on whose altar, at that time situated in the Crypt of the Nativity below the main altar of the church itself, [[Saint Ignatius of Loyola]] celebrated his first Mass as a priest on 25 December 1538.

Just outside the Sistine Chapel is the tomb of [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]] and his family.&lt;ref name=Destinations/&gt;

The [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] interior decoration of the Sistine Chapel was completed (1587–1589) by a large team of artists, directed by [[Cesare Nebbia]] and [[Giovanni Guerra]]. While the art biographer, [[Giovanni Baglione]] allocates specific works to individual artists, recent scholarship finds that the hand of Nebbia drew preliminary sketches for many, if not all, of the frescoes. Baglione also concedes the roles of Nebbia and Guerra could be summarized as "Nebbia drew, and Guerra supervised the teams".

==Borghese Chapel and Salus Populi Romani==
[[File:Santamariamaggiore2b.jpg|thumb|right|The Borghese Chapel]]
The column in the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore celebrates the famous [[icon]] of the Virgin Mary now enshrined in the Borghese Chapel of the basilica. It is known as ''[[Salus Populi Romani]],'' or ''Health of the Roman People'' or ''Salvation of the Roman People'', due to a miracle in which the icon reportedly helped keep plague from the city. The icon is at least a thousand years old, and according to a tradition was painted from life by [[Luke the Evangelist|St Luke the Evangelist]] using the wooden table of the [[Holy Family]] in [[Nazareth]].

[[File:Virgin salus populi romani.jpg|left|thumb|upright=.5|[[Salus Populi Romani]], perhaps the oldest [[Roman Catholic Marian art|Marian image]] in Rome.]]
The [[Salus Populi Romani]] has been a favourite of several popes and acted as a key [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological]] symbol. Roman-born [[Pope Pius XII]] (Eugenio Pacelli) celebrated his first Holy Mass there on 1 April 1899. In 1953, the icon was carried through Rome to initiate the first Marian year in church history. In 1954, the icon was crowned by [[Pope Pius XII]] as he introduced a new Marian feast [[Queenship of Mary]]. [[Pope Paul VI]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]], and [[Pope Francis]] all honoured the Salus Populi Romani with personal visits and liturgical celebrations.

==Papal basilica==
As a papal basilica, Santa Maria Maggiore is often used by the pope. He presides over the rites for the annual [[Feast of the Assumption of Mary]] on 15 August there. Except for a few priests and the basilica's archpriest, the [[baldachin|canopied]] high altar is reserved for use by the pope alone. [[Pope Francis]] visited the basilica on the day after his election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate = 28 December 2016 | title= Pope Francis eschews trappings of papacy on first day in office | url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/14/pope-francis-style-first-day | date= 14 March 2013 | work = The Guardian | first= Lizzy | last = Davies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pope gives charge of the basilica to an archpriest, usually a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]. Formerly, the archpriest was the titular [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch]], a title abolished in 1964. Since 29 December 2016, the archpriest has been [[Stanisław Ryłko]].

In addition to the archpriest and his assistant priests, a chapter of [[Canon (priest)|canons]] is resident. [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] and [[dominican order|Dominican]] priests serve the church.

The [[King of Spain]], currently [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]], is ''ex officio'' [[protopriest|protocanon]] of the basilica's [[Canon (priest)|chapter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/sm_maggiore/en/capitolo/capitolo.htm Liberian Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Rolando (attested 1189–1193)
* Pietro Sasso (attested 1212)&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;Archpriest Pietro Sasso is commonly identified with contemporary cardinal Pietro Sasso of S. Pudenziana (1206–1218/19). However, this identification remains uncertain because the only document which mentions this archpriest (dated 3 July 1212) makes no reference to his cardinalate, cf. Ferri in ASRSP, vol. 28, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
* Romano (attested 1222)
* Astor (attested 1244)
* Pietro Capocci (?) (named in 1245?)&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;Cardinal Pietro Capocci (died 1259) is mentioned in the majority of the catalogs of archpriests of Liberian Basilica but the documents from the archive of the Basilica, published by Ferri in ASRSP, vol. 27, p. 34–39 and vol. 30, p. 119, give no support for this affirmation. Document dated 19 March 1244 mentions Astor (or Aston) as archpriest, documents between 13 February 1247 and 1 October 1255 mention archpriest without mentioning his name but also without indicating his cardinalate, and on 28 May 1258 Romano was archpriest of the Basilica; the latest document mentions also cardinal Pietro Capocci but makes no reference to his occupation of that post. If he was really an archpriest under Innocent IV, he must have later resigned, but it seems more likely that this statement resulted from a confusion.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shared universe''' or '''shared world''' is a set of creative works where more than one writer (or other artist) independently contributes a work that can stand alone but fits into the joint development of the storyline, characters, or world of the overall project. It is common in genres like [[science fiction]].&lt;ref name="Nielsen1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nielsen|first=Jakob|title=Multimedia and Hypertext: The Internet and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZXCCfP0rQC&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=5 August 2015|year=1995|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-12-518408-3|pages=120–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324122455/https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZXCCfP0rQC&amp;pg=PA120|archivedate=March 24, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It differs from [[collaborative writing]] where multiple artists are working together on the same work and from [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]] where the works and characters are independent except for a single meeting.

The term ''shared universe'' is also used within comics to reflect the overall milieu created by the comic book publisher in which characters, events, and premises from one product line appear in other product lines in a [[media franchise]].

A specific kind of shared universe that is published across a variety of media (e.g. novels, films, role-playing games, etc.), each of them contributing to the growth, history, and status of the setting is called an "imaginary entertainment environment."&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Daniel.

== Definitions ==
Fiction in some [[Mass media|media]], such as most [[television programs]] and many [[comic book]] titles, is understood{{By whom|date=December 2017}} to require the contribution of multiple authors and does not by itself create a shared universe and is considered a collaborative art form. Incidental appearances, such as that of [[d'Artagnan]] in ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', are considered literary [[cameo appearance]]s. More substantial interaction between characters from different sources is often marketed as a [[fictional crossover|crossover]]. While crossovers occur in a shared universe, not all crossovers are intended to merge their settings' [[back-stories]] and are instead used for marketing, parody, or to explore [[Alternate history|"what-if" scenarios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |date=Mar 1994 |title=Super Heroes: A Modern Mythology |author=Reynolds, Richard |isbn=978-0-87805-694-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comics &amp; Culture: analytical and theoretical approaches to comics |author=Magnussen, Anne and Hans-christian Christiansen, eds. |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |date=Apr 2000 |isbn=978-87-7289-580-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can become difficult for writers contributing to a shared universe to maintain consistency and avoid contradicting details in earlier works, especially when a shared universe grows to be very large. The version deemed "official" by the author or company controlling the setting is known as [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. Not all shared universes have a controlling entity capable of or interested in determining canonicity, and not all fans agree with these determinations when they occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comic Book Culture: Fanboys and True Believers |author=Pustz, Matthew |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fanon (fiction)|fanon]] may instead find some degree of consensus within the setting's [[fandom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=All Shapes of Hunger: Teenagers and Fanfiction |journal=Voya |author=Moore, Rebecca C. |date=Apr 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers, in an effort to ensure that a canon can be established and to keep details of the setting believable, employ tools to correct contradictions and errors that result from multiple contributors working over a long period of time. One such tool is [[retcon]]ning, short for "retroactive continuity", which resolves errors in continuity that came about through previously-written conflicting material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Retcon Tricks |journal=Star Trek Monthly Magazine |author=Jones, Nick |date=Feb 2002 |pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Readers may also object when a story or series is integrated into a shared universe, feeling it "requir[es] one hero's fans to buy other heroes' titles".&lt;ref name="BurtCL"&gt;{{cite journal |title="Blown To Atoms or Reshaped At Will": Recent Books About Comics |author=Burt, Stephen |journal=College Literature |date=Winter 2005 |volume=32 |page=166 |doi=10.1353/lit.2005.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of fictional universes in literature}}
The expansion of existing material into a shared universe is not restricted to settings licensed from movies and television. For example, [[Larry Niven]] opened his [[Known Space]] setting to other writers initially because he considered his lack of military experience prevented him from adequately describing the wars between mankind and the [[Kzinti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Scribner, Ted|title=Novel Collaborations |url=http://www.larryniven.org/collaborations.shtml |accessdate=2007-01-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070110055400/http://www.larryniven.org/collaborations.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which he has made the setting available for other writers became a topic of controversy, when [[Elf Sternberg]] created an [[erotic literature|erotic short story]] set in Known Space following an author's note from Niven indicating that "[i]f you want more Known Space stories, you'll have to write them yourself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ringworld Engineers |author=Niven, Larry |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niven has since clarified that his setting is still to be used only "under restricted circumstances and with permission",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, Dr. Larry Niven |publisher=Slashdot |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2007-01-13 |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/10/167206&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=134&amp;tid=192 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213110227/http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F03%2F10%2F167206&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=134&amp;tid=192 |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Niven granted to the several authors of the [[Man-Kzin Wars]] series. By contrast, author [[Eric Flint]] has edited and published collaborations with fan fiction writers directly, expanding his [[1632 series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1632: About this Site |author=Eves, David |date=Sep 2005 |url=http://1632.org/About.html |accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A setting may also be expanded in a similar manner after the death of its creator, although this posthumous expansion does not meet some strict definitions of a shared universe. One such example is [[August Derleth]]'s development of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] from the writings of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], an approach whose result is considered by some to be "completely dissimilar" to Lovecraft's own works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tierney |first=Richard L. |title=The Derleth Mythos |publisher=Nightscapes |date=2004-09-09 |url=http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/nightscapes/NS04/hplnf3.htm |accessdate=2007-01-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209052219/http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/nightscapes/NS04/hplnf3.htm |archivedate=February 9, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less controversial posthumous expansions include [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]]'s and later authors' sequels to [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[Land of Oz|Oz]]'' stories and the further development of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[The Foundation Series|Foundation]]'' universe by [[Greg Bear]], [[Gregory Benford]], and [[David Brin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Following Asimov's Foundation |publisher=Cyberhaven |year=1999 |url=http://www.cyberhaven.com/books/sciencefiction/bear.html |accessdate=2007-06-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811055828/http://cyberhaven.com/books/sciencefiction/bear.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other published works of this nature take the form of a series of short-story [[anthologies]] with occasional standalone novels.

{{Main|List of fictional universes in animation and comics}}
[[File:MasterComicsNo21.jpg|thumb|Early example: [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Bulletman]] join forces to battle [[Captain Nazi]], thereby establishing a shared continuity within the [[Fawcett Comics|Fawcett]] "universe".]]
Within comics, the term ''shared universe'' has been used to reflect the overall milieu created by the comic book publisher in which characters, events, and premises from one product line appear in other product lines in a [[media franchise]].

By 1961, [[Marvel Comics]] writer and editor [[Stan Lee]], working with artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]], merged the bulk of the publisher's comics characters into the [[Marvel Universe]].&lt;ref name="BurtCL" /&gt; Marvel sets its stories in an increasing number of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate realities]], each with an assigned number in a greater "[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]".&lt;ref name="MarvMulti"&gt;{{cite book |title=Marvel Encyclopedia Volume 6: Fantastic Four |publisher=Marvel Comics |date=2004-11-24 |isbn=978-0-7851-1480-2 |author=writer, Kit Kiefer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DC Comics]] and Marvel have also periodically co-published series in which their respective characters meet and interact. These [[intercompany crossovers]] have typically been written as self-limiting events that avoid implying that the DC Universe and Marvel Universe co-exist. Exceptions include the twenty-four comics released under the [[metafiction]]al [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[Amalgam Comics]] in 1996, depicting a shared universe populated by hybridizations of the two companies' characters. Marvel has since referred to this as part of its setting's greater multiverse by labeling it Earth-692.&lt;ref name="MarvMulti" /&gt;

Although DC and Marvel's shared universe approaches to comics have set them apart from competitors in the industry,&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler |first=Brant W. |title=Myth Conceptions: 'Summer Blockbusters' |publisher=Silver Bullet Comics |date=2006-06-05 |url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=1719 |accessdate=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026024638/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=1719 |archivedate=October 26, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; other companies have attempted similar models.

== Universes in films and television ==
{{Main|List of fictional shared universes in film and television}}
Universes in films (or television) mostly consist of a franchise featuring an umbrella of multiple franchises (film or television) set within the same continuity, each franchise within telling its own stand-alone story focusing on a different character (or group of characters), as well as featuring its own cast, of directors, writers, while also being part of a coherent, non-contradictory continuity shared with the other works. Fictional universes with major presence in films are referred to as '''cinematic universes''', while fictional universes with major presence in television are refereed to as '''television universes'''. Universes with major presence in films and television, generally are refereed as cinematic universes as that's the medium that reaches the most audiences. Some film and television universes are accompanied by video games, and print works such as novels or comics, telling additional canonical stories set within the same continuity.

An early universe in cinema history was the ''[[Universal Monsters#Recurring cast and characters|Universal Monsters]]'' series of ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'', ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' and ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', which ran from 1931 to 1951 and featured recurring cast and characters.

Some universes in film have originated as film adaptations of novels, such as the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' film series]] based on the spy novels by [[Ian Fleming]]. The films adapt some elements from the novels, however they are not direct adaptations, additionally they were not adapted in the same order as the books released. The first film in the series is ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), and has produced 23 sequels, with the most recent one being ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015). Due to the series spanning more than 50 years, [[James Bond]] has been portrayed by six actors, all the other frequent cast of characters has also gone through replacements, additionally after all Fleming's novels were adapted the series shifted towards original scripts. However, all films are set within a single, coherent fictional continuity, even if the writers, directors and cast change between films. Aspects of the fictional universe are retained between films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/every-james-bond-movie-ranked-worst-best/|title=Every James Bond Movie Ever, Ranked Worst To Best|date=April 16, 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717200714/http://screenrant.com/every-james-bond-movie-ranked-worst-best/|archivedate=July 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' film series also originated as a film adaptation of the novel of the same name, taking many creative liberties. The original film titled ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) focused on present-day astronaut George Taylor landing on a mysterious planet ruled by apes, which is revealed to be a future planet Earth at the end of the film. The sequel ''Beneath'' focused on Brent, an astronaut sent on a rescue mission to save Taylor. The third film ''Escape'' introduced [[time travel]] and shifted the focus towards the apes Zira and Cornelius, who appeared as supporting characters in the previous films, as they travel to the past in Taylor's spaceship. The fourth and fifth films, ''Conquest'' and ''Battle'', focus on Zira and Cornelius' son Cesar leading the up-rise against the humans and to the future depicted in the original film. A television series and an animated series are also considered part of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/planet-of-the-apes-a-timeline-and-an-explanation-1603218068|title=Planet of the Apes: A Timeline and an Explanation|first=Annalee|last=Newitz|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713112149/http://io9.gizmodo.com/planet-of-the-apes-a-timeline-and-an-explanation-1603218068|archivedate=July 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the ''Planet of the Apes'' in the original timeline before the time travel occurred was explained in a prequel-reboot film series with the ape Cesar becoming the main protagonist again, with the story focused on his life from childhood to an old ape, and how the conflict between the apes and the humans, started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/12/9/13899502/planet-of-the-apes-series-war-dawn-rise-reboot-franchise-right|title=The Planet of the Apes series is quietly showing the world how to reboot a franchise right|publisher=The Verge|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610123359/https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/12/9/13899502/planet-of-the-apes-series-war-dawn-rise-reboot-franchise-right|archivedate=June 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series was created by [[George Lucas]], produced by his self-funded production company Lucasfilm. It originated with the film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' (1977), followed by two sequels under the subtitles ''[[Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983); together, those three films are known as the original trilogy and focuses on [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo]] and [[Princess Leia]]. The prequel trilogy composed of ''[[Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), ''[[Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), and ''[[Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) expanded the series into a Saga, and focused on Luke Skywalker's father [[Anakin Skywalker]], new cast members portrayed younger versions of characters from the Original trilogy, while other actors returned to their original trilogy roles. On television, the lore was expanded through animation, the animated film titled ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' (2008) served as the pilot of an [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|animated series of the same name]] (2008-2014). Lucas was deeply creatively involved in the previously mentioned works, but he ceased creative involvement with the ''Star Wars'' franchise in 2014. Lucasfilm announced that from April 2014, only such previously mentioned works would be considered canonical, along all of the fictional works released after such date. The animated series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' (2014-2018), was the first work released after. A sequel trilogy formed by ''[[Episode VII: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015), ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|Episode VIII: The Last Jedi]]'' (2017) and the upcoming ''[[Star Wars: Episode IX|Episode IX]]'' (2019) featured many returning cast members along newcomers. The films’ main saga is conformed of the original, prequel, and sequel trilogies. A concurrent spin-off film series, known as the anthology films, expands the stories of plot points and characters from the main series. Additionally the series expanded into video games, comics, and novels, telling original stories based on the franchise, classifying it as an imaginary entertainment environment,&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Daniel. [http://www.worldcat.org/title/fantasy-role-playing-game-a-new-performing-art/oclc/45575501 ''The Fantasy Role-Playing Game: A New Performing Art''] (Jefferson, NC: McFarland. 2001) pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; where the films share the same [[Star Wars canon|continuity]] as all the other media formats, regardless of the different media formats. Lucasfilm's "Story Group" coordinates a cohesive story-telling and ensures consistency and synergy by avoiding plot holes between all the film and non-film works. The ''[[Star Wars Legends]]'' brand is used to brand all the re-prints of non-canonical works (television films, animated series, video-games, comics, and novels) of the franchise which were produced and/or ceased production before April 2014. Lucas himself considered the ''Legends'' works as non-canonical because considered them to diminish his films meaning by not adhering to his vision. Albeit, Lucas did include a few of the ''Legends'' elements that he supported within his works, such as characters and places which made those included elements canonical. Storytellers after Lucas have also incorporated ''Legends'' elements in their stories, sometimes with the help of the original creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/star-wars-story-group-shared-universe/|title=How Star Wars Mastered the Shared Universe|date=May 4, 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517220938/http://screenrant.com/star-wars-story-group-shared-universe/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for comic book based films, there are two cinematic universes based on [[Marvel Comics]] characters, both set within a different continuity. The [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], which originated in 2000, is the longest-running superhero film franchise to be set within the same continuity. The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] has the most films, as well as [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|multiple TV shows]] and a separate run of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|tie-in comics]] that co-exist and share the same continuity, making the MCU an imaginary entertainment environment. The [[DC Extended Universe]] is a movie franchise that encompasses different movies series based on the [[DC Comics]] characters, all of them sharing a continuity.

Writer/director [[Kevin Smith]] created a fictional universe used in several of his films, as well as comics and a television series:  the [[View Askewniverse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The View Askewniverse | url=http://www.viewaskew.com | website=[[View Askewniverse|The View Askewniverse]] | access-date=December 29, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216205425/http://www.viewaskew.com/ | archivedate=December 16, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is named for Smith's production company, [[View Askew Productions]]. The characters [[Jay and Silent Bob]] (played by Smith) appear in almost all the View Askewniverse media, and characters from one story often reappear or are referred to in others.  Recurring characters, settings, and motifs of the View Askewniverse first appeared in Smith's debut film, [[Clerks]], in 1994.

Among the most successful novel-to-film adaptations are the film trilogies of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' (2012–2014) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (2001–2003), all of which were directed by [[Peter Jackson]], while serving as faithful adaptations of the novels by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] (especially ''The Lord of the Rings''). The first work in the series was ''[[The Hobbit (novel)|The Hobbit novel]]'' published in 1937. The novels focused on the hobbits [[Bilbo Baggins]] and his nephew [[Frodo Baggins]], as well as the wizard [[Gandalf]], among other species such as dwarves and elves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/23/14055580/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-movies-peter-jackson-15th-anniversary|title=Looking back on what made the Lord of the Rings trilogy special, 15 years later|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826115748/https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/23/14055580/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-movies-peter-jackson-15th-anniversary|archivedate=August 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videogames taking place between the films of the saga have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/games/middle-earth_shadow_of_war/b/playstation4/default.aspx|title=Middle-earth: Shadow of War - PlayStation 4 - www.GameInformer.com|website=www.gameinformer.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826123803/https://www.gameinformer.com/games/middle-earth_shadow_of_war/b/playstation4/default.aspx|archivedate=August 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Universes in television ====
This refers to universes that are based on television shows without any films. Television series may lead to a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off series]] set in the same universe, often focusing on a single character from the original. The American sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'' led to two spin-off series based on its characters, in the form of ''[[Frasier]]'' and ''[[The Tortellis]]''.

A significant example of shared universes among television shows is the [[Tommy Westphall#The Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis|Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis]], which suggests that hundreds of American television series take place in the same universe. It builds from the assumption that when an actor playing a character from one series guest-stars in a second series, in character, both of those series must take place in the same universe. The theory takes its name from a character in the final episode of ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', where the common interpretation of the events of that finale is that the entire ''St. Elsewhere'' universe – including all connected series – exist only within Westphall's imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Gravely|first1=Gary|title=A Multiverse of Narratives: Possible Worlds Theory and Authorship From the Lone Artist to Corporate Authors|date=August 2015|institution=[[Middle Tennessee State University]]|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|location=Murfreesboro, TN|pages=166-167|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1718228166|degree=Ph.D.|id=No.3719757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off media]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]'', known as the "[[Whoniverse]]", has relatively little consistency given its division into [[audio play]]s produced by [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] and the BBC, the [[Virgin New Adventures|New Adventures]] universe novel, or a universe based on comics published in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gary Russell two |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/01/01/13770.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721053617/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/01/01/13770.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-21 |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2007-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television network [[The CW]] houses the [[Arrowverse]], a shared universe of television shows based on characters from DC Comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Black Lightning Part Of The Arrow-verse?

=== Universes in animated films and animated series ===
{{Main|List of fictional universes in animation and comics}}
The [[Mickey Mouse universe]] dates back to the 1930s when the animated cartoon was expanded into a newspaper strip. Although the characters occasionally portray other roles and with other names, the writers address this discrepancy by thinking of the characters as being "employed" by Disney as actors. [[Walt Disney]], when asked whether or not [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] were married, replied that the mice were indeed married in their "private li[ves]", but that they sometimes appeared as boyfriend and girlfriend for "screen purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Pixar universe]] is an elaborate [[fan theory]] suggesting that all [[Pixar]] animated movies take place in the same universe. At the 2015 [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]], during the "Pixar Secrets Revealed" panel, director [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]] rejected the theory, with ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' co-director [[Ronnie del Carmen]] adding "Do you know what kinds of meetings we'd have to have to make sure all our movies line up?!"&lt;ref name=Disney&gt;{{cite news|title=10 Things We Learned from the 'Pixar Secrets Revealed' Panel|url=http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2015/08/16/10-things-we-learned-from-the-pixar-secrets-revealed-panel/|accessdate=August 17, 2015|newspaper=Oh My Disney|date=August 16, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817120038/http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2015/08/16/10-things-we-learned-from-the-pixar-secrets-revealed-panel/|archivedate=August 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Originating in video games and the internet ==
The influence of the [[Internet]] on [[collaborative fiction|collaborative]] and [[interactive fiction]] has also resulted in a large number of amateur shared universe settings. Amateur authors have created shared universes by contributing to [[mailing lists]], story [[archive]]s and [[Usenet]]. One of the earliest of these settings, [[SFStory]], saw its spin-off setting [[Superguy]] cited as illustrative of the potential of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Engst, Adam C. |author2=William Dickson |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Internet Explorer Kit |publisher=Hayden Books |date=1994-01-15 |isbn=978-1-56830-089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[furry fandom|furry]]-themed Tales from the Blind Pig created at the [[Transformation Story Archive]] which some limited publication.&lt;ref name="AnthroIndex"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Index |journal=Anthro |url=http://www.anthrozine.com/site/everything.html |accessdate=2006-12-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426163814/http://www.anthrozine.com/site/everything.html |archivedate=April 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TSAT21"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Stories |journal=TSAT: Transformation Stories, Art, Talk |issue=21 |url=http://tsat.transform.to/i.21/index.21.html |date=Apr–May 2002 |accessdate=2006-12-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908060758/http://tsat.transform.to/i.21/index.21.html |archivedate=September 8, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early examples include the [[DargonZine|Dargon Project]], Devilbunnies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=alt.pave.the.earth |author=Miller, Steve |journal=Wired |issue=2.07 |date=Jul 1994 |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.07/alt.pave.html |accessdate=2007-05-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134303/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.07/alt.pave.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[SCP Foundation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.

One of the lesser known, but still widely popular shared universes is the [http://whateleyacademy.net/index.php Whateley Academy stories], a series set in a fictional superhero-themed universe detailing the events occurring at the titular mutant school Whateley Academy. The shared universe of these stories originated in 2004, and has attracted a dedicated fanbase from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whateleyacademy.net/index.php|title=Site - Whateley Academy - Home|last=Darken|first=Kristin|website=whateleyacademy.net|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106032929/http://whateleyacademy.net/index.php/|archivedate=January 6, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other media ==
The 2000 musical ''[[Seussical]]'' presented several works of [[Dr. Seuss]] as taking place in the same fictional world.

[[Hasbro]] toy products including [[G.I. Joe]] and [[Transformers]] are considered by their manufacturer to exist fictionally within the [[Hasbro Universe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8124">The Finnish composer [[Aulis Sallinen]] has composed eight [[symphonies]], considered by some to be the core of his instrumental output.&lt;ref name="korhoenen"/&gt;

== Symphony No. 1, Op. 24 ==
Originally entitled just 'Sinfonia', Sallinen's first symphony lasts around 16 minutes. It won first prize in a competition organized by the [[City of Helsinki]] to mark the inauguration of Finlandia House, and was premièred there in December 1971 by the Helsinki City Symphony Orchestra conducted by [[Jorma Panula]].&lt;ref name="Novellocat"&gt;Aulis Sallinen, Catalogue, January 1987, Novello, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; This single movement symphony is a dense atmospheric piece arising from an environment of F sharp minor.&lt;ref name="korhoenen"&gt;Korhonen, Kimmo. Contemporary Composers from Medieval to Modern - Inventing Finnish Music (English translation Kimmo Korhonen and Jaakko Mäntyjärvi, 2007), 2007, Finnish Music Information Centre, {{ISBN|978-952-5076-61-5}}. Chapter IX “That Which Was Old” p126-129.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Okko Kamu]] notes that the symphonic texture is founded on organic expansion of motifs; the work emerges from small intervals. He comments that "the scherzo movement... rushes forward like a tempest... The exquisite section with percussion and harp is peculiarly fascinating with timbres of sound and an exoticism, the intensity of which emanates from an escaping triad".&lt;ref name="kamubis041"&gt;Kamu, Okko. Booklet notes for Bis CD 41, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symphony No. 2, Op. 29 'Symphonic Dialogue for percussion and orchestra' ==
The second symphony was written soon after the first and lasts around 17 minutes. It was commissioned by and first performed by the [[Norrköping Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Okko Kamu]] in February 1973, with percussionist Rainer Kuisma. A studio recording was made by the [[BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] under Ole Schmidt in February 1981.&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt; The work is based principally on two themes, a falling scale, and a fanfare-like motif; the percussion part, well-integrated into the symphony as a whole demands use of marimba, vibraphone, crotales, tom-tom, bongo, military snare drum, suspended cymbal, guiro and tam-tam.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Martin. Booklet notes for Sallinen works recorded on CPO 999 969-2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symphony No. 3, Op. 35 ==
Sallinen's third symphony was commissioned by the Finnish Broadcasting Company and dedicated to Okko Kamu, who conducted the première with the [[Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra]] in April 1975. The work lasts around 27 minutes.&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt; The symphony was finished at around the time of his first opera ''[[The Horseman (opera)|Ratsumies]]'' (''The Horseman''), and was the first to be divided into several movements.&lt;ref name="korhoenen"/&gt; The middle movement takes the form of a chaconne based on themes of the first movement coda. The last movement recreates the atmosphere of the first, where "the sea builds up into an engulfing orchestral wave pouring over the landscape".&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;Mark Morris. ''The Pimlico dictionary of 20th-century composers.'' London, Pimlico, 1999, p113.&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 1984 a ballet entitled ''Midsomernatten'' with choreography by Thor Sutowski and based on this symphony was first performed at the [[Atlanta Civic Center]].&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt; Kamu reflects that, conceived on an island out in the Baltic, it embodies the composer's love of the ocean “that fickle element which without warning changes character”.&lt;ref name="kamubis041"/&gt;

== Symphony No. 4, Op. 49 ==
This symphony was a commission from the city of [[Turku]] to celebrate its 750th anniversary. Lasting 22 minutes, and in less sombre mode than its predecessors, it was first played by the Turku City Symphony Orchestra conducted by Pertti Pekkanen in August 1979. The UK première was given by the [[Hallé Orchestra]] conducted by Okko Kamu in the [[Free Trade Hall]] in October 1980.&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt; Composed shortly after his ''Dies Irae'' for voices and orchestra (1978) which was influenced by thoughts of nuclear devastation, the symphony maintains a sense of fear: a striking opening march interweaves with quiet, bleak passages, while the sound of bells overlies the last movement.&lt;ref name="morris"/&gt; Especially in the first movement of this symphony Sallinen begins to develop a ‘mosaic technique’, which he would make a central part of his approach to the fifth symphony.&lt;ref name="korhoenen"/&gt;

== Symphony No. 5, Op. 57 'Washington Mosaics' ==
Sallinen's fifth symphony was a commission from the National Symphony Orchestra Association (USA). It received its première at the [[Kennedy Center]] in October 1985 with the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]. The work lasts 37 minutes. The UK première was given by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] under Kamu in the Royal Festival Hall in February 1987.&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt; Sallinen has commented that “whereas each movement in a symphony usually has its own material, here certain motifs are repeated identically, just like identical pieces in a mosaic, in the various movements”. This five-movement work ranges in expression “from static frozen cluster chords to almost tonal allusions to Sibelius and Mahler”.&lt;ref name="korhoenen"/&gt;

== Symphony No. 6, Op. 65 'From a New Zealand Diary' ==
In order to prepare for the commission from the New Zealand Symphony Orhcestra, Sallinen had a holiday in New Zealand in early 1989. The titles of the movements are I. The Islands of the Sounds. The sounds of the islands (attaca) II. Air. Rain. III. [[Kyeburn]] Diggings (attaca) IV. Finale 'Simply by sailing in a new direction You could enlarge the world' (a line from a poem by [[Allen Curnow]]). The 2nd movement quotes from Act II of ''[[The King Goes Forth to France]]'', and the whole work lasts approximately 42 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Weitzman. Booklet notes for Bis CD 511, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symphony No. 7, Op. 71 'The Dreams of Gandalf' ==
The music was intended for a ballet around the subject of the [[Hobbit]], which was abandoned due to copyright difficulties, but much of the material was made into this 25-minute seventh symphony (the subtitle refers to [[Gandalf|a character of JRR Tolkien]]). The first performance by the [[Göteborg Symphony Orchestra]] was conducted by [[Neeme Järvi]]. A ballet ''Holbitti'' (also called The Dragon Mountain (The Hobbit), Op.78) (choreographed by Marjo Kuusela) was produced at the [[Finnish National Opera]] in 2001 using this symphony and other music by Sallinen.&lt;ref&gt;Sallinen, quoted in the booklet accompanying CD CPO 999 918-2 of works by Sallinen, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; A note in the score states “The symphony does not actually depict the events in the novel; rather it is a musical expression of the literary atmosphere and poetry”.

== Symphony No. 8 Autumnal Fragments, Op. 81 (2001) ==
Written in 2001, the symphony lasts 24 minutes in its world première recording.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Rasilainen conducting the Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz on CPO 999 972-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned by the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] it received its world première by the same orchestra conducted by [[Paavo Järvi]] on 16 April  2004. In the words of the composer « I have quoted "Theme of the Dead" from my opera ''[[Kullervo (Sallinen)|Kullervo]]'', and it finally emerges as a five-part canon. The "Bell Theme" of the finale is a salute to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra... built up from certain notes from the name and its home city: ConCErtGEBouwAmstErDAm.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the booklet accompanying CD CPO 999 972-2 of works by Sallinen, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The autumnal of the subtitle refers to the composer's time of life.

Music from Symphonies 1, 3 and 4 was used for a ballet, based on a play, ''Himlens hemlighet'' (''Secret of Heaven'') by [[Pär Lagerkvist]], choreographed by Pär Isberg, and shown on Swedish television on 20 October 1986.&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}

=== Part One ===

'''&lt;u&gt;Opening Sequence - Home Again Tour - ''New Mexico 1997''&lt;/u&gt;'''

Narration by Brook Payne ([[Wood Harris]]), the group's first manager, sets the stage: all six members of [[New Edition]] are back on tour in 1997, almost twenty years after the group's formation, separations, and solo projects.  The divisions are still present as, in addition to performing the group's hits, the three solo acts - [[Ralph Tresvant]], [[Johnny Gill]], and [[Bobby Brown]] - and the trio [[Bell Biv DeVoe]] (or BBD, for short, made up by [[Ricky Bell (singer)]], [[Michael Bivins]], and [[Ronnie DeVoe]]) also have their own scheduled sets.

Tensions reach a boiling point at the [[New Mexico]] concert.  As Brown - whose decade-long selfishness and severely erratic behavior resulted in his being suspended from the group a decade prior - starts yet another song well after his scheduled time is up, DeVoe goes on stage, thanking Brown for his performance. He then directs the [[disc jockey|DJ]] to begin playing the BBD set.  After briefly walking off stage, an enraged Brown returns and gets into a confrontation with DeVoe, as the musical performance is replaced by a wild brawl among the various New Edition members and their entourages, punctuated by a gunshot.

Payne's narration states that ego, pride, and greed resulted in this blow up of what had once been a successful group and decides to rewind the scene nearly twenty years, back to the group's founding in Roxbury, Massachusetts.	 	
	
'''&lt;u&gt;The rise of New Edition - ''Roxbury, MA - 1978-1983''&lt;/u&gt;'''
	
It's a normal day for the people of [[Roxbury, Boston|Orchard Park]] Housing Projects (also called "O.P."), in Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1978.

Despite his mother' refusal to grant her son permission, a young [[Ricky Bell (singer)|Ricky Bell]] (played as a youth by [[Caleb McLaughlin]]) sneaks out at night to meet his friend, [[Michael Bivins|Michael "Mike" Bivins]] (played as a youth by Dante Hoagland) to go to a local talent show, where their mutual friend, [[Bobby Brown]] (played as a youth by Tyler Marcel Williams) is scheduled to perform.  Ricky and Mike are impressed by the sound of a vocal group called "The Untouchables", while Bobby's performance is a disappointment as he gets [[stage fright]] within the first few seconds of his song.

The next day, Bobby asks Ricky and Mike to join him on stage the next time he performs, thinking that will help him with his stage fright.  Initially unsure, the pair agree as long as another kid from the neighborhood, [[Ralph Tresvant]] (played as a youth by Jahi D'Allo Winston), can join. The trio made an assumption of the fact he can be pulled away from a girl, whom he has unsuccessfully been trying to impress with his [[karate]] skills.

The quartet try to practice at Ricky's house but squabble a fair amount.  Recognizing they need some guidance, Ricky's sister, Peanut (Bre-Z), suggests they meet with Brooke Payne ([[Wood Harris]]), a manager for several of Boston's rising musical acts.  The boys sneak into the back alley of a club to convince Brooke to manage them, finally winning him over with an [[a capella]] version of [[The Jackson 5]]'s "[[I Want You Back]]".

The next morning, the boys arrive on time to meet Payne. However, Payne doesn't sugarcoat them, warning them they will be doing some extra hard work on their path to becoming musical artists.  Payne comes up with the group's name of New Edition, as if they were either a new version or new edition of the Jacksons.  Weeks of strenuous training features time spent on [[choreography]], physical and mental discipline, and singing, Payne prepares the quartet in  for a big talent showcase at the [[Strand Theatre (Dorchester, Massachusetts)|Strand Theater]], where the winning act will receive a recording contract from [[Maurice Starr]] ([[Faizon Love]]) under his independent record label.

In a format reminiscent of the Amateur Night of the [[Apollo Theater]], New Edition dazzles the crowd. Unfortunately, the judges grant 1st prize to a hip-hop duo, "The Boston Rebels."  The crowd booed the decision, chanting for New Edition so loudly that Maurice gives New Edition a studio recording session and a record deal as well.  To strengthen the Jackson 5 connection, Maurice encourages making the group a quintet, with Brooke suggesting his nephew [[Ronnie DeVoe]] (played as a youth by Myles Truitt) as the fifth member. Ronnie's audition is good enough for the group to accept him, completing the initial five-member formation of New Edition.

Squabbling returns at the recording session, with Ricky and Bobby fighting over a pair of [[headphones]], while Ralph was patiently waiting his turn. Instead, Maurice decides to let Ralph sing first. As a result, the performance is so impressive that Ralph is given the lead vocals for "[[Candy Girl (New Edition song)|Candy Girl]]," which would become New Edition's first hit.  Prior to finalizing the group, Maurice offers Ralph a solo deal instead, but Ralph declines, preferring to remain part of New Edition. With their mothers' oversight, the members of New Edition sign their record contract, receiving upfront payments of $500 each and a [[Betamax]] machine.  With "Candy Girl" a nationwide hit, New Edition now are rising young stars. The quintet begin taking photo shoots for the cover of their debut album (also named [[Candy Girl (album)|Candy Girl]]), while also getting ready for a nationwide tour.
 	
'''&lt;u&gt;First Album and Candy Girl Tour - ''1983''&lt;/u&gt;'''

With "Candy Girl" #1 on the [[Billboard charts]] (topping Michael Jackson), New Edition begins making TV and concert hall appearances, including headlining a show at the [[Roseland Theater]] in [[New York City]] with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Kurtis Blow]].  When the group has been on tour (with international dates added) for several weeks, the mothers of Ricky and Bobby, who are struggling financially and on food stamps, seem concerned that they have not yet received any checks their sons should have earned from the shows. Therefore, they decide to confront Brooke Payne, who says he is not in control of the group's finances, despite being its manager.  After grumbling about firing Brooke in order to get a manager who could improve the financial situation, they agree to give him a little more time to see if things improve.

'''&lt;u&gt;Transition of Power / Boys Gone Wild - ''1983 to 1984''&lt;/u&gt;'''

The tour finally ends, with the teenagers leaving the high life and returning home to the poverty of Roxbury, at least until their tour checks arrive.  However, when the checks finally show up, each member received $1.87 for the entire tour.  Brooke, who had never had a major deal with a music industry label before New Edition and may have made some mistakes due to that inexperience, tries to explain the intricacies of the deal: the label advanced the group money that it needed to record the album and to promote the tour, with the label recouping that advance from the money the boys would have earned from the various tour dates.  An emotional Brooke, who didn't even get $1.87 for all of his work on the tour, insists that he cares about the boys and wouldn't have intentionally made a deal that was bad for the boys.  Four of the mothers vote to fire Brooke as manager. On the other hand, the lone holdout was Flo DeVoe ([[La La Anthony]]), Brooke's sister, who threatened to pull Ronnie out of the group. Brooke, however, reminded her that the group was their only best chance at getting out of the projects.

The mothers replace Brooke as manager with Gary Evans ([[Michael Rapaport]]), who promises to replace their current deal with Maurice Starr with a better one due to his relationship with [[MCA Records]]. Jheryl Busby ([[Tank (American singer)|Tank]]), an executive at MCA, privately expresses to Gary a lack of interest with New Edition, whom he views as "some ghetto kids."

Having tasted fame and experiencing typical teenage rebellion, the young men of New Edition are less easy to control. Both Gary and the two security guards, Jeff Dyson ([[Wallace Smith (actor)|Wallace Smith]]) and Khalil, unexpectedly walking in on some of the members [[sexual intercourse|having sex]] with female groupies. There is more tension and a lot of anxiety within the group as well. Ralph ([[Algee Smith]])'s talent and constant professionalism result in him taking the lead vocals on most of the songs for the new album. Feeling slighted, the rest of the group focuses more on women and having fun, often without Ralph, to whom they mockingly refer as "the big star."  This in turn makes Ralph feel betrayed by his friends and frustrated that he is carrying so much of the group's work.

'''&lt;u&gt;Roller coaster of troubles - ''1984-1985''&lt;/u&gt;'''

In an effort to patch things up, Ralph asks Gary if the others could have lead vocals in more songs and Gary agrees. It starts with Bobby ([[Woody McClain]]) having lead vocals on "[[Mr. Telephone Man]]" when New Edition was working with singer-songwriter and producer [[Ray Parker Jr.]].  During the recording, Bobby (perhaps letting his constant prominence go to his head) maliciously starts making fun of Mike ([[Bryshere Y. Gray]]) for being unable to correctly hold a note. Mike takes this and teasing by the other members personally. He decides to take a [[Taxicab|cab]] rather than get in the group's [[limousine|limo]], slamming the door shut in frustration. The driver, hearing the slam, assumes that Mike is in the car with them. He backs up and accidentally runs over Mike's foot. When Bobby antagonizes Mike yet again, Mike spits in his face. This eventually triggers a fight that prompted the rest of the group to break up. Gary tells the group that their moms think Mike should be kicked out of the group due to fighting. However, the other guys (including Bobby) stick up for Mike. When Mike returns, Bobby goes up to him first and apologizes for his actions. This allows the group to move forward. While internally repaired, New Edition is clashing with their new choreographer. A frustrated Gary decides to bring in someone who can help keep the group focused: Brooke, who was back only as the choreographer, not the manager.

Echoing the concerns of MCA executive Jheryl (who, while satisfied financially, is still concerned about the "ghetto boys'" public persona), Gary presses New Edition to maintain a clean image and be (or at least appear to be) single, the latter of which is particularly important to their young, female fanbase. While rehearsing for the "Cool It Now" tour, Bobby gets arrested for [[speeding]] in someone else's car that doesn't belong to him and driving without a license. When Gary comes to the station to bail him out, Bobby reveals that his girlfriend, who was in the car with him, is [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. Meanwhile, Ralph's girlfriend back home is also pregnant, but he hasn't told anyone yet. It was later revealed that she would have a [[miscarriage]], partially because Ralph wasn't there to support her during the pregnancy. While smoking [[marijuana|weed]] backstage on tour, the group runs into [[Johnny Gill]] ([[Luke James]]). Johnny is a [[Washington, D.C.]] native, who is another young artist within the MCA family. At another stop on New Edition's tour, no one can locate Bobby, until Gary finds him in the car doing [[cocaine]] with and receiving [[fellatio]] from female groupies. When discussing the situation with his fellow New Edition members, Bobby insists that he has his personal life under control.

&lt;u&gt;'''Out with the old, In with the new - ''1985-1988''&lt;/u&gt;

After the tour, the mothers meet with Gary, frustrated yet again at their sons receiving less money than expected. Gary brings up the group's various expenses and drug/alcohol habits as contributing to the smaller checks, despite New Edition's [[New Edition (album)|self-titled second album]] with MCA being certified platinum.

Viewing the act as "Bobby Brown with New Edition" instead of just "New Edition," Bobby's ego continues to inflate out of control. With his personal and professional life causing two things for New Edition: disturbance and disrespect, it comes to a head at a show in [[Oakland, California]]. While enjoying the whole spotlight to himself after singing lead vocals for "Mr. Telephone Man," Bobby became emotionally irate. Also (in his mind, at least), he was initially upset over being quickly ignored by the crowd, who cheers for New Edition as a whole. Meanwhile, Ronnie, Mike, Ricky, and Ralph initially felt annoyed over Bobby selfishly trying to hog the entire onstage spotlight to himself. As a result, they all quickly transitioned into their next song,      "[[Cool It Now]]." This further enrages Bobby, who has an attitude with the audience (by whom he was ignored), dictating that he wouldn't perform with New Edition anymore. Since Bobby does not get his way in the group, he disrespectfully tosses his [[microphone|mike]] in the air before storming off the set. Fed up with Bobby's actions, Gary pressures Ronnie, Mike, Ricky, and Ralph into voting to kick Bobby out of the group as punishment. Despite their initial reluctance to kick him out, thinking about Bobby's arrest, severe drug usage, continual selfishness, and disrespect eventually prompts the four to unanimously vote Bobby out instead.

While driving with Jeff (one of the group's security guards that Gary had hired), Mike speculates on what (if any) future the group has without Bobby. Jeff makes a suggestion that Mike should consider getting in the business side of the industry, given how few broke executives there are compared to broke musicians, as well as giving him more control. Mike glances at the [[All for Love (New Edition album)|All For Love]] record, which he and the group (including Bobby) had recorded the year prior and notices "Fast Break Productions" on the record rather than MCA Records.  Mike storms into Jheryl's office, interrupting a meeting to demand an explanation. The MCA executive explains to Mike that, rather than being signed to MCA Records, they were signed to Fast Break Productions, which was Gary's company, which in turn had a relationship with MCA Records.  In other words, rather than just being a manager who could use his connections to get the group a deal with MCA (as Gary had indicated to the mothers and the members of the group), Gary had drafted a contract that gave him two things: ownership and control of New Edition. This ensured that he got his money before the group did, as well as allowing him to do things like negotiating a shoe deal without consulting the members of the group. Still stunned that their contract with Gary wasn't much better than their $1.87 contract with Maurice Starr four years ago, Mike can't really respond when Jheryl rhetorically asks him if he even read Gary's contract before signing it as opposed to just relying on Gary's explanation. Jheryl finally ends the meeting with a response, saying, "Welcome to the music business." This gives Mike the opportunity to see what it is like to be a music executive- with the group's approval- meets with an attorney to fire Gary as manager and to work by getting out of their contract in order to sign directly with MCA.

Back home with his mom, Bobby is doing cocaine while watching the remaining members of New Edition perform "[[Count Me Out (song)|Count Me Out]]" on [[Soul Train]]. His mom enters his room to tell him that he has a visitor: Jheryl. He feels Bobby has too much talent to waste his life to drugs and offers him a solo deal with MCA, where he eventually [[King of Stage|records his debut solo album]]. Having moved in together, Ralph's girlfriend encourages him to similarly go solo. Ralph insists that while he is happy with the group, he does start to record some solo tracks without telling the rest of the group beforehand. When Ralph plays some of the solo songs for Ricky, Mike, and Ronnie, they feel betrayed. They are not very supportive even when Ralph says he would still be part of the group and just do the solo stuff as a side project, which results in Ralph feeling isolated and frustrated.  When Ronnie expresses concern about how he'd take care of his family without New Edition, Mike starts working on a plan, so that they aren't dependent on Ralph. Meanwhile, Ralph, looking forward to solo money rather than splitting with other members of New Edition, shares his feelings with Jheryl. He stresses the importance of two things: timing and positioning, which is why Ralph's solo album will come out later after New Edition records another album. This one with [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], who had just produced [[Janet Jackson]]'s smash album, [[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]] a year prior.

The group arrives in [[Minneapolis]] to begin recording [[Heart Break]] with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.  Ralph - who is known for always being on time and ready to go - travels separately and arrives late. After a chilly greeting with Ricky, Mike, and Ronnie, Ralph is baffled to see a fifth member of New Edition: Johnny Gill, who Mike and Jheryl thought would be a good fit for the group. Angered that he wasn't even consulted about the decision and upset over having to split money five ways again, Ralph storms off. Johnny, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis are also rattled, as they assumed Ralph knew about Johnny.

Still sulking, Ralph can't help but be impressed by Johnny's voice (if not his cowboy boot fashion sense). After a recording session, the two have a private conversation (because the other three guys didn't bother to hang around for the session), with Ralph apologizing for his initial conduct. He was admitting that the situation was more about his relationship with the other guys than anything Johnny had done. Ralph and Johnny realize they have several things in common, including professionalism and being fed the same story by Jheryl about delaying a solo project until after recording a New Edition album. Now that Ralph and Johnny were cool, Ralph jokingly asked if wannabe executive Mike sold Johnny on being the next Bobby. Johnny honestly replied that Mike described it as being the next Ralph. Slightly jarred by the thought of being replaced, Ralph regains his normal focus and dedication, with the entire group contributing to a great performance of "[[Can You Stand The Rain]]" and work well together recording the rest of the album.  While preparing for Heart Break's album cover photo shoot, the men discuss how they've grown personally and professionally in their years in the recording business. When the photographer encourages them to smile, the group insists they know what works best for them and opts for a more serious facial expression.

While working on a music video for [[If It Isn't Love]] (with Brooke Payne once again providing choreography) and preparing for another tour, MCA's A&amp;R/business partner [[Louis Silas Jr.]] ([[Duane Martin]]) drops the bombshell that Bobby will be touring with them.

=== Part Three ===

'''&lt;u&gt;A Fork in the Road - ''1988-1990''&lt;/u&gt;'''

New Edition continues their preparations for the upcoming tour by releasing their new single "[[If It Isn't Love]]." Meanwhile, at the [[Paramount Pictures]] studio, Bobby Brown (who has skyrocketed to super-stardom with his second album ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]'') prepares for his "[[Every Little Step]]" music video.  Brown's barber (DC Young Fly) is distracted by the girls that will appear in the video and accidentally cuts off a chunk of Bobby's hair. This left a slant in Bobby's hair that Bobby irately compares to "[[Gumby]]." Without time to fix it, Bobby is forced to debut what would become his signature look in the video instead.

Bobby and New Edition are generally able to work well together on the tour, which also features singer [[Al B. Sure!]] (Josh David). Despite this, Bobby bristles a bit when "his" supposed lead vocals on [[Jealous Girl]] and [[Mr. Telephone Man]] will be both sung by Johnny even after Bobby originally offered to sing them himself. After a [[Washington, D.C.]] performance, Mike agrees to listen to a group of young men from [[Philadelphia]] sing one of New Edition's songs for him outside the tour bus. Impressed, Mike gives them a business card and encourages the group that will become [[Boyz II Men]] to call him.

In 1989, a party to celebrate the success of the tour, revealing how the group split up again. Jheryl is leaving his job at MCA Records to take a major role at Motown and convinces Johnny to come with him and record his [[Johnny Gill (1990 album)|self-titled third album]] - the one Jheryl promised he would support if Johnny recorded Heart Break with New Edition - at Motown. Ralph's similarly promised solo album will be released by MCA but must be re-recorded because Ralph and the executives felt that it would sound too much like Bobby's Don't Be Cruel album. Ralph is annoyed, because his album was originally ready to be released before Heart Break. However, it was delayed in favor of the New Edition album. As for Ricky, Mike, and Ronnie, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis suggest the trio start their own group, which would become [[Bell Biv DeVoe]], based on their last names. Finally, the arrogant and disrespectful Bobby, who made a scene by sticking his hands into both of the party's cakes, is angry despite his individual success and being surrounded by attractive women. He almost showed constant jealousy looking out at his former group members.

In March 1990, all six members of New Edition reunite by making an appearance for ''[[Video Soul]]'' with Sherry Carter. There is clearly awkwardness and tension during the interview, with barbed comments flying all around, particularly between Ralph and Mike (still not yet over inviting Johnny to the group without consulting Ralph), as well as Bobby and everyone else. The show also airs each of the separate acts' music videos: [[Bell Biv DeVoe|BBD]]'s "[[Poison (Bell Biv DeVoe song)|Poison]]", Ralph Tresvant's "[[Sensitivity (song)|Sensitivity]]", and Johnny Gill's "[[My, My, My]]."  When the host asked the most anticipated question, "Would the group ever reunite for a new album?," Ralph suggested there was a possibility to record a reunion album in the coming future.

&lt;u&gt;'''Are we "Home Again" or not? -''' '''''1996-1997'''''&lt;/u&gt;

The [[Home Again (New Edition album)|reunion album]] is made six years later, in 1996, after the various independent acts somewhat fizzled. This left several in debt, or at least precarious, financial position, especially Ricky ([[Elijah Kelley]]).  Several of the group members, now approaching their 30s, are also dealing with personal issues: Ralph is struggling with the passing of his mother, while Bobby is no longer the only member with drug and alcohol issues. Also, Ricky is secretly using cocaine, popping pills, and drinking heavily, hiding his problems from his wife as well as the rest of New Edition.

As the group prepares for a tour of Home Again, Brooke is amazed at their expenses - separate tour buses, large entourages, lots of luggage - despite their limited success as independent acts, as well as being less professional than when they were kids. While the group will perform New Edition songs, they will also perform the songs of their various respective acts. Unfortunately, this tour does not go well, with Bobby's penchant for missing various interviews and even performances annoying the rest of the group and interfering with scheduled performance times. At one stop, Bobby arrived after the rest of the group had finished performing but decided to close the show solo instead. Bobby claimed that he felt like singing, because the crowd was chanting for him.

The tour arrives in [[New Mexico]], where the miniseries began, though with some additional details on what would lead to the massive brawl.  Bobby - on time for a change - decided to sing an extra song, at least partially because Bell Biv DeVoe couldn't go on as Ronnie ([[Keith Powers]]) was late. Bobby assumes that he was the real star of the tour. Thus, when Ronnie charged onto the stage to cut off Bobby, Bobby was partially angry, claiming that he was covering for Ronnie by doing an extra song. Storming backstage angry, Bobby tries to blast Bell Biv DeVoe with water from a fire hose but can't get the emergency device to work. Instead, he and his bodyguard march onstage, which brings in the various entourages for a chaotic scene, finally culminating with a gun shot that scatters everyone.

In the chaos, Brooke stumbles away and has a heart attack before being found by one of the members of the Bell Biv DeVoe entourage. An [[ambulance]] arrives to take him to the [[hospital]], but won't allow Ronnie (who is Brooke's nephew) in with him. Instead, both Ricky and Mike try to keep Ronnie calm while waiting for a car. Ralph and Johnny get filled in, but Ronnie nearly loses it when Bobby appears to ask what's going on. He angrily blames Bobby for starting the fracas that led to his uncle having a heart attack. Bobby, on the hand, counter-argued that he would never hurt Brooke and that it was Ronnie who provoked the situation. Ronnie angrily storms off for good this time, saying he's done with the tour. Also, he's fed up with Ralph and Johnny always coddling Bobby. Bobby walks off, stating that he was doing everyone else a favor by agreeing to the reunion, but Johnny snaps at Bobby stating that he did nothing for him. Bobby angrily lashes out and Johnny, saying the group is deceased and finished. Ralph leaves after getting into it with Mike, and Johnny was fed up wasting his time with the hostility. A panicked Ricky asks Mike what they are going to do with so many shows left, and Mike essentially says the tour and the group are done.

'''&lt;u&gt;Souls falling apart / Finding myself - ''1998-2004&lt;/u&gt;'''

In the years after the tour, the New Edition members largely stay out of contact and have their lives go in different directions.

*Johnny is largely OK music wise, forming a new group called [[LSG (band)|LSG]] with [[Gerald Levert]] and [[Keith Sweat]] but not seeming interested in talking to a radio personality about New Edition and the destruction of the group during the Home Again album and tour during a radio interview.  
*Taking all the knowledge of the business side of the music industry that Jeff game, Mike becomes a full-time music executive himself. He starts his own label [[Biv 10 Records]]. Mike is now finding himself on the other side of the table when dealing with artists and often using the same words ("Did you even read your contract?") that people like Jheryl had said to Mike when New Edition was just starting.  
*Ralph's short marriage to his longtime girlfriend Xeina ends in a grimey divorce, with her taking the cars, house, sole custody of the kids and half of their shared assets. Being the mild mannered guy that he is, Ralph eventually deciding not to fight too much to contest. 
* With the Home Again tour falling apart and the group not on any speaking terms whatsoever, Ronnie decides to pursue a whole endeavor by enrolling in some real estate classes to become a real estate agent. However, he feels somewhat embarrassed when a fan recognizes him, feeling like he is at a rock bottom. 
*The New Edition member really at rock bottom is Ricky, whose drug and alcohol use gets worse when he faces bankruptcy, aggravated by lawsuits from the tour's abrupt end and lack of any job or trade skills other than music. Ricky's wife, Amy, suggests asking the members of New Edition for help but he refused. Instead, he asks her if she knows someone with a truck to help them move out of their foreclosed house. 
*Bobby's life at this time, including his relationship with his then wife at the time, [[Whitney Houston]], is not shown in the miniseries.

Ricky eventually has an [[overdose]], but his wife finds him in time for help to arrive and save him.  At rehab, Ricky admits that what he was chasing was the feeling of fame, fortune, and popularity that he had years prior, as well as trying to fight the fear that the feeling wouldn't come back.  
In 2004, Ronnie's wedding planning isn't going well, with his latest concern being wasting money for inedible flowers on the wedding cake. His fiancée, Shamari, gets him to admit that his real issue is not having reunited New Edition, either as a musical group or to be his groomsmen for his rapidly approaching wedding.  Concerned that their egos and behavior will both prevent any of them from showing up, Ronnie is convinced to at least invite the other five members to his wedding so that he won't have regrets.

'''&lt;u&gt;I am my Brother's Keeper / BET 25th Celebration - ''2005''&lt;/u&gt;'''

The day of the wedding, Ronnie is in his prep room, on his own, accepting that he's going to be at the altar without any groomsmen. He hears a knock on the door and "Police!", only for it to be Bobby in a dazzling all-white tuxedo. Although Bobby thanks Ronnie for the invitation to be a groomsman, he declines an offer for a drink, saying he has cooled on drugs and alcohol. The rest of New Edition arrives, including a sober Ricky, with Ralph and Mike at least able to be civil to each other. The final arrival is Brooke, back to normal, after his heart attack at the disastrous tour and ready to see his nephew Ronnie get married.

At the reception, Ralph and Mike have a longer conversation, with Mike apologizing for starting the group's break up by bringing in Johnny to replace Ralph. Ralph counters that the group faced bigger problems than that, citing that the problems, which the members were only ready to deal with now that they were older. Rather than just a temporary truce, Ralph and Mike seem to have rekindled their friendship, ready to move forward without dwelling on negative events from the past.

Brooke toasts Ronnie and his new wife and includes New Edition in his toast by reminiscing about raising Ronnie and the other members of the group, encouraging them to be thankful for their success as a musical group and as men.  New Edition reunites to serenade Ronnie's wife with their first hit song "[[Candy Girl (New Edition song)|Candy Girl]]." A [[BET]] producer approaches Brooke with the idea of having a New Edition reunion at the channel's 25th anniversary special. Brooke advises him to move quickly, as he does't know the next time the group will be together like this. The producer, however, does move quickly enough, as the group agrees to reunite for the BET special.

At the special, New Edition begins to perform a medley of hit singles: "[[If It Isn't Love]]," "[[Can You Stand the Rain]]," "[[Candy Girl (New Edition song)|Candy Girl]]," and "[[Cool It Now]]" before introducing Bobby Brown to perform "[[Mr. Telephone Man]]" with them. After Bobby gives a solo performance of his solo classic hit single "[[My Prerogative]]," Bobby then invites the group along to perform a medley with him, with highlights of the miniseries airing as the group sings. They all take a bow and give props and credit to BET for giving their long standing partnership as a final sendoff.

===Critical===
''The New Edition Story'' has garnered positive reviews from critics. On [[Metacritic]], the series holds a score of 76 out of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Edition Story Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-new-edition-story|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently has a 100% rating, with an average score of 7.2/10 on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], along with the consensus being, "''The New Edition Story'' colorfully showcases its subjects with honesty and clarity while offering an entertainingly paced overview that leaves room for plenty of the group's greatest hits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_new_edition_story/s01/|title=The New Edition Story: Season 1 - Rotten Tomatoes|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received rave reviews for the child actors who portrayed younger versions of New Edition in the first part of the series. Sylvia Obell of [[Buzzfeed]] praised the casting as "absolute perfection" and rated it an A+. Obell compared the film to another iconic television miniseries -- "it is on its way to being the best black TV biopic since ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]''" which aired on ABC in 1992. The most talked about similarities is the uncanny "jawdropping" striking resemblance of the young [[Bobby Brown]], portrayed by Tyler Marcel Williams, who nailed the looks, demeanor and Bobby's most iconic "body roll". Also another uncanny resemblance were of the vocals of the young Ralph Tresvant, portrayed by Jahi Di'Allo Winston. For viewers, hearing his first lead solo appearance in the film singing "[[Candy Girl (New Edition song)|Candy Girl]]" gave chills for nailing every note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/sylviaobell/the-child-actors-from-new-edition-story-are-absolute-perfect|title=The Child Actors From "New Edition Story" Are Absolute Perfection|first=Sylvia |last=Obell|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|publisher=BuzzFeed Inc.|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trey Mangum of [[Blavity]] said that BET "outdid" themselves, saying "With the warm reception and open arms that the world received The New Edition Story with, it's clear that this story needed to be told, and this was the perfect time." Mangum complimented the "spot-on" casting of both the young and adult casts, as well as the fact both casts recorded their own vocals, a rarity for musical biopics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blavity.com/11-reasons-why-the-new-edition-story-was-super-lit|title=11 reasons why 'The New Edition Story' was absolutely epic |first=Trey |last=Mangum|work=[[Blavity]]|publisher=Blavity Inc.|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview with [[Bell Biv DeVoe]] on the radio show, ''[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]]'', co-host [[Angela Yee]] described the casting for the film as "fantastic." Michael Bivins praised Algee Smith's portrayal of Tresvant and said he was "real nice, sliding into the most difficult spot."  Smith did an outstanding job portraying Tresvant, especially for his first major role, and displayed amazing vocals somewhat similar to Tresvant's himself. Bivins' own mother pushed for Gray during the casting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject= New Edition |subject-link= New Edition |subject2= Bell Biv DeVoe |subject-link2= Bell Biv DeVoe |subject3= The New Edition Story |subject-link3= The New Edition Story |interviewer= [[DJ Envy]], [[Angela Yee]] and [[Charlamagne Tha God]]|title= Bell Biv DeVoe Discusses The New Edition Story &amp; More on The Breakfast Club |type= radio |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegEmiQpWJI|work= [[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]] |publisher= [[Premiere Radio Networks]] |location= [[New York City]] |date= January 26, 2017 |access-date= January 28, 2017 |dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview, Ricky Bell along with Bivins praised Elijah Kelley for his portrayal of Ricky in the film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23984">The “'''Tower of David Period'''” is the nickname which describes [[Visual arts in Israel|Israeli art]] during the 1920s.  The nickname was coined as a result of the exhibition that took place in the [[Tower of David]] during that period. Instead of one artistic direction, this period was characterized by artistic works of conflicting styles, reflecting the worldview of the artists with regard to the social, political, and artistic reality within the Land of Israel and outside of it. Alongside the art created at “[[Bezalel]]”, which was characterized by decorative motifs and the influence of ars nova, the young Land-of-israel artists produced works of art that reflected a variety of modernist influences.

==Background: The Land of Israel at the Beginning of the 20th Century==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 13451 Davids Citadel Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Tower of David]] in late 1920s]]
[[File:Avineri76.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Tel Aviv]] in the 1920s]]
The variety of expressions and styles in the [[Land of Israel]] in the "Tower of David Period" reflects the historic and decisive division in the history of the [[Jewish]] people which preceded this period and continued through the days of the [[Yishuv]], the body of Jewish residents in Palestine, before the establishment of the State of Israel, under [[Mandatory Palestine|the British Mandate]].

The Yishuv community had been caught up in an accelerated process of change since the [[First Aliyah]] in 1881. The aspiration of the elite groups of new immigrants was not just to settle the Holy Land and to implement an emotional and spiritual awakening there, like most of their predecessors from the “[[Old Yishuv]]”, but also to fashion it in their own image and identity; this included, according to their own consciousness, both old and traditional elements and new and revolutionary elements, intertwined in a unique ideological treatise.

From the beginning of the 20th century, people of the [[Second Aliyah]] worked to change the status and situation of the Jewish community in the Land of Israel. The decisive compensation for their efforts came with the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, and the events that followed in its wake: in 1917 the [[Russian Revolution]] took place and the Bolsheviks seized the government; the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Empires dissolved into individual nations; and even the victorious Colonial powers, headed by Britain and France, began in effect a process of convergence. After the signing of the peace agreements, and as a result of them, a new world order prevailed; and in the Land of Israel, the British Mandate government slowly took root, beginning with the Balfour Declaration and the entry of the army into the Land of Israel, effecting a gradual occupation in 1918, the beginning of the military government, and later the civil government  in 1920, and ending in the publication of the first “White Book” in 1922. The British in fact expressed support for the Zionist leadership, when they allowed delegations of the Zionist Commission and [[Hadassah]] to come to the Land of Israel and found the basis for declaring future Jewish sovereignty there; on the other hand they hampered aliyah to the Land of Israel and disbanded the [[Jewish Legion]], which they had recruited during World War I, and in whom they had instilled with grand Zionist hopes.

A mixture of voices could be heard in the years after World War I in the various Jewish communities, particularly in the battle among the militant members of the Zionist Movement.  Advocates of religiosity and traditionalism, nationalism and modernism, liberalism and Communism all made use of the movement. All these streams found a place in the small Yishuv society in the 1920s, and the different utterances and artist directions were combined in them and influenced by them.

The people of the [[Third Aliyah]], from 1918 to 1923, were imbued with a wide-ranging revolutionary spirit, and they were engaged in a constant interchange with the Yishuv environment. However their influence was also a result of their numbers (by the end of the war the Yishuv numbered 56,000 people, and an estimate of the number of the many new Jewish immigrants, balancing out those who left, stood at 35,000)&lt;ref&gt;1.	See: Yigal Zalmona, 100 Years of Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2010), p. 51 (in Hebrew); Yehuda Erez, ed., Third Aliya Book (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1964) (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  and in addition, to a large extent, because of the broad spectrum of new ideas they brought with them to the Land of Israel.  Most of the new immigrants were from Eastern Europe, young, and with a belief in Zionism in all its varieties. Many of them, particularly the young and inventive among them, underwent a redesign of how they perceived their new Jewish and Hebrew world during the 1920s, while they were involved in Zionist labor like building roads and erecting buildings, and were undergoing the considerable suffering brought about  by poverty, hunger, and the constant illnesses resulting from them. At the same time they were structuring their own personal identity, they also influenced the long-time residents of the Land of Israel who had preceded them: people who had come on the First and Second Aliyah and were members of the “Old Yishuv”.

==The Tower of David Exhibition: “The First Culture War” in Israeli Art”==
The opening of exhibitions in the Tower of David in April 1921, expressed the aspirations toward founding a center for art in the Land of Israel. In spite of the fact that the exhibitions were supposed to include a representation of all the art being created in the Land of Israel, in reality the art of the Arab, Muslim, and Christian residents were presented primarily in a historical-archaeological framework. The Jewish artists, on the other hand, sought to present art that drew its inspiration not just from the Jewish historical past, but also from the movement of art and handicrafts that was grew out of European Modernism. This was most noticeable among the artists of “The Jewish Artists Association”, who attempted to develop a “Jewish ethic”. This group, most of whom were students of “Bezalel”, organized exhibitions in the Tower of David. A number of exhibitions were organized, both in the Tower of David and outside of it, and most of the works exhibited in these exhibitions were influenced by the Post-Impressionists and the Expressionists.  
[[File:Reuven wirh peirot risonim.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Reuven Rubin]] paints "Fruit of the Land" (central panel from the triptych "First Fruits"), 1923)]]
One of the most important exhibitions was that of the works by [[Reuven Rubin]], who mounted an exhibition in the Tower in 1924. Rubin exhibited new works that showed the transition from the influence of the Christian tradition to paintings brimming with the symbolism of the Land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;4.	Cf., Carmela Rubin, A Dream of a Place (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2007), p. 13-37 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the works that drew attention was the triptych “First Fruits” (1924), which received enthusiastic reviews by critics from various fields of culture such as [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]], [[Hugo Bergmann|Samuel (Schmuel) Hugo Bergman]], etc. However the perception of Modernist painting that Rubin presented was not shared by all of the population. His album of woodcuts, “The Godseekers (1923)”, which he sent to the High Commissioner, was rejected because the High Commissioner did not “have any liking for that population of art objects”.&lt;ref&gt;5.	See: Reuven Rubin, cited in: Studio, No. 56 (September 1994), unnumbered pages (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;
Views like those held by Rubin kept spreading among the young artists during the first half of the decade. At the same time "Bezalel" art continued to honor the values of Classicism, Jugendstil (Art Nouveau), and eastern European Realism.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ofrat, Gidon, Art in Israel  (Westview Press, 1998), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of the “Bezalel” artists existed primarily within the space of applied arts, and they were characterized by the introduction of  noncanonical branches of art – such as decoration and design – into high art in order to create a style".&lt;ref&gt;Yigal Zalmona, The Tower of David Days; First Cultural Strife in Israeli Art (Jerusalem: Tower of David, Museum of the History of Jerusalem, 1991). p. 15 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

But first and foremost the young artists began to be aware of the growing gap between “Bezalel” and the international art world.  One attempt to reject totally the world of Modernism can be seen in [[Boris Schatz]]’s closure of the Bezalel library because he was afraid the students would be negatively influenced by it.&lt;ref&gt;See: Benjamin Tammuz, The Story of Israeli Art (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), p. 38 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;  In a critical article published in 1928, Agan wrote that as opposed to the people of “Bezalel”, Modernist artists “draw the land of Israel with love and a desire to understand and grasp its colors and lines in accordance with the dominant trends in the modern art world”.&lt;ref&gt;9.	Agan, “Bezalel” Writings (Tel Aviv: January 12, 1928), cited in: Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz’s Bezalel  (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1983), p. 231 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the decade the principles on which Bezalel based its work had become irrelevant, because they were no longer suitable to the political and ideological conditions of Eretz Israel. Besides the criticism of the varying quality of the results of the “Bezalel” workshops, the strengthening of left-wing elements in the Yishuv, increased the criticism of the use of national and religious symbols as the virtually exclusive expression of Jewish nationality. In 1929, the school closed after the Zionist organizations  refused to support its activities any longer.

[[Yigal Zalmona]] presented the confrontation between the “Bezalel” people and the “rebel” artists as a confrontation between the “immigrant” point of view and the “native”  point of view. The “old-timer” generation of “Bezalel” insisted on creating a national art, which focused on the symbols of its Judeo-European past.  In this way the artists expressed their wish to be integrated into the world of European art. The “Bezalel” artists enjoyed the support of the European Jewish middle classes, and many of the orders for the art coming out of its workshops came from the Conservative and Reform Jews of the United States. The generation of modern students, on the other hand, saw the creation of a local Jewish culture as a central need, a point of view which coincided with spirit of Israel’s Labor Movement. Many of them were influenced  by the European vanguard, to whom they had been exposed in various frameworks, particularly in France.  These artists, Tsalmona contended, wanted to create the reality of the Land of Israel of their time within the framework of the creative activity this vanguard.&lt;ref&gt;See:  Zalmona, p. 49, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==From Jerusalem to Tel Aviv – The Development of the Center of Art of the Land of Israel==
[[File:Bezalel, 1913.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Bezalel Buildings, Jerusalem, 1909]]
The founding of “Bezalel” in Jerusalem in 1906 created a center of art and culture in Jerusalem the likes of which had never before been seen in the Land of Israel. The “Bezalel” people hoped to continue to develop the school as an artistic and ideological center for the country’s inhabitants, and even for the Jewish inhabitants of the Diaspora. This was symbolized above all by the opening of the [[Bezalel National Museum]] in 1925, as a museum intended to be open permanently to the public. In these years the art of young artists from the Land of Israel was eliminated entirely from its exhibitions, which concentrated entirely on historical artistic evidence of the nationalist  message  appropriate to the “Bezalel”  dialogue Boris Schatz was promoting. By the middle of the 1920s, Bezalel’s status in the eyes of the public had seriously deteriorated. A witness to this can be seen in the 1927 letter of [[Mordechai Narkis]] to [[Boris Schatz]], in which he reports that Land of Israeli newspapers have eradicated the name of the Bezalel school from their articles.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, Washington Crosses the Jordan (Jerusalem: Sifria Zionit, 2008), pp. 149-150 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to Bezalel, at the beginning of the 1920s a group of independent artists who sought to cut all ties with the old establishment began to be active in Jerusalem. The establishment of the “[[Association of Jewish Artists]]” symbolized this more than any other phenomenon. In addition to the exhibits organized by the Association, private exhibitions were organized in various places in the city, such as “Menorah” ([[Joseph Zaritsky]]), Hotel Amdursky ([[Abraham Neumann]]), the Lamel School ([[Batya Leschinsky]], [[Ariel Allweil]]), etc.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, Washington Crosses the Jordan (Jerusalem: Sifria Zionit, 2008), pp. 145-153, 151-152 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Jerusalem, the rapid development of the city of [[Tel Aviv]] during this decade, especially during the years of the [[Fourth Aliyah]] (1924-1931), allowed the rise of a community of artists with a modernist orientation, far removed from the historical baggage of the Holy City. This group quickly rejected the centrality of Jerusalem as the center of art.  According to [[Yona Fischer]], the exhibit of modern paintings mounted in the School for Boys in Jerusalem in 1926 marked the end of the competition between these two centers.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yona Fischer, Migdal David: The Beginnings of Painting in Eretz-Israel (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1968), unnumbered pages (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first signs of artistic activity in Tel Aviv was the opening of a school of painting and architecture in 1923 in the home of [[Joseph Berlin]] on Gruzenberg Street.&lt;ref&gt;See: Batia Donner, From the Perman Collection of the Tel Aviv Museum (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2002), p. 13 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; During this decade most of the major artists moved to Tel Aviv, especially those who returned from studying art in France and other places in Europe. Nevertheless, the “Bezalel” approach remained popular in architecture and architectural decoration. This was reflected in the adaptation of the “eclectic style,” in which many of the buildings in Tel Aviv of that period were designed.  In most of them porcelain tiles were used, glazed in the Bezalel style, and reflecting the themes and the ideology and the decorative approach of that Jerusalem institution.
  
One of the major donors to the visual arts in Tel Aviv was [[Yaakov Pereman]], who was the entrepreneur behind the founding of the artists’ cooperative “Ha-Tomer”. In 1920 Pereman opened “The First Art Exhibition in the Land of Israel”, at which various works were exhibited, including those of the artists of the cooperative. In 1921-1922 Pereman founded and managed Tel Aviv’s first art gallery, called “The Permanent Art Exhibition in the Land of Israel” in the exhibition hall in [[Neve Sha'anan, Tel Aviv|Neve Sha’anan]].&lt;ref&gt;The hall was next to the trade school  and opposite the Tel Aviv gate (what is now the corner of Nahalat Binyamin and Mohaliver Streets).&lt;/ref&gt; In this gallery many modernistic works, which Pereman brought from Eastern Europe, were exhibited, along with modernistic works by Land of Israel artists and works by artists from the “Bezalel” school as well. According to [[Batia Donner]], “Pereman’s gallery activity was both an augmentation of and an alternative to the ‘Bezalel’ activity".&lt;ref&gt;See: Batia Donner, From the Pereman Collection of the Tel Aviv Museum (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2002), p. 25 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ohel 1921-1925.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Exhibition of "Modern Artists" in the Ohel Theatre in Tel Aviv]]
On January 14, 1926, an exhibition entitled “Exhibition of Modern Artists” opened in a shed of the “Ha-Ohel” (The Tent) Theater. The poet [[Avraham Shlonsky]] gave a speech at the opening of the exhibition in which he suggested that the opening was a seminal event in the evolution of Jewish culture: “I recommend a substitute for God: the exhibition that is taking place in ‘Ha-Ohel’.  A new synagogue needs to be found; that is, in place of God, we’ll be standing there.  Let the poet be found in the sphere of the painter, and the painter in the sphere of the musician.  And ‘Ha-Ohel’ can serve as a substitute for God in the synagogue of art.”  This exhibition, and two additional exhibitions held in “Ha-Ohel” before 1928, was perceived by Israeli art critics as the event that established the hegemony of Tel Aviv in the country’s cultural life.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yigal Zalmona, 100 Years of Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2010), p. 78 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1929, an exhibition of art by the group known as “Egged” (The Amalgamation), which took place in an apartment on Allenby Street in Tel Aviv, and which exhibited works by artists such as [[Sionah Tagger]], [[Chana Orloff]], [[Reuven Rubin]], and others. Another exhibition held in Tel Aviv during this period under the name “Massad” (The Base") exhibited younger artists, including [[Aaaron Priver]], [[Menahem Shemi]], [[Israel Paldi]], [[Avigdor Stematsky]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Batia Donner, From a Collection to a Museum, 1920-1932 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2002), pp. 20-21 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism in the Land of Israel During the 1920s==
During the 1920s many of the young artists in the Land of Israel were exposed to modern art. Only a small minority of the artists immigrated to the Land of Israel from Eastern Europe with a previous exposure to European avant-garde art.  Others went for a limited period to study in Europe, primarily in [[France]], which was considered the center of art at the time, but also in [[Germany]] and other places.

The various modernist influences included postmodernist influences with regard to color and the way it is applied to the canvas, along with the moderating influences of Cubism and Expressionism, as well as a tendency to Primitivism.  In contrast to the European artists, only a tiny minority of the artists in the Land of Israel leaned toward the avant-garde and the abstract in their works.  The general mood demanded that they express the realistic experience of life in the Land of Israel, combining East and West in their work.
  
Among the outstanding artists of the period was the sculptor [[Abraham Melnikov]]. Melnikov suggested a different lexicon of forms, taken from ancient Eastern art instead of the art forms imported from Europe, and in accordance with the reigning philosophy in Bezalel during the time of Schatz and Lilien. “For generations”, Melnikoff wrote, “the Jews have been cut off from figurative art, and there are many reasons for this, but the main reason is that the foundations of European art are Greco-Roman […] and whenever Athens was the Only source of European art, the Jews instinctively watched from the side”.&lt;ref&gt;Haaretz, December 18, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Land of Israel School", or "The Land of Israel Style," was established by a group of artists who inserted into their works symbols of the reality of the Land of Israel, which could also be interpreted as mystical symbols. In their works we see depictions of the Land of Israel wilderness, full of desert foliage and images drawn from Eastern exoticism. Many of the depictions are of Arab or Middle Eastern figures, which are shown to have a direct connection with Land of Israel nature or with the Land of Israel of the Bible.

In works such as "Woman Carrying a Sheaf" (1926) and "Resting at Noon" (1926) by [[Nachum Gutman]], Middle Eastern figures working at nature-related activities are depicted. The style of the painting emphasizes their monumentality and sensuality.  A similar style can be seen in the work of Israel Paldi, "Arab Sailors" (1928), which depicts a group of sailors in a fishing boat heroically fighting the waves.  The composition of the painting, which reduces the view to the boat, also emphasizes the monumentality of the figures. [[Pinchas Litvinovsky]]'s painting "Arab with Flower" (1926) combines a style that is modernist in the structure of its composition and its flat spaces, and romantic in its depiction of the Middle East and the Middle Eastern.   In the works of Reuven Rubin we see, alongside the Middle Eastern figures, depictions of the way of life of the Jews of the Land of Israel as well. In his paintings such as "Sophie" (1924) or "Dancers of Meron" (1926), then tendency to flatness and decorativeness is very evident.  In these works Rubin identifies Land of Israel Jewishness with Middle Eastern rootedness, as manifested by a large number of Yemenite or Arab figures, or by images of the Land of Israel landscape or foliage.

Even in the 1920s this type of art was the object of criticism. [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]], for example, rejected the symbolic depiction which could be seen in the works of many artists of the time.  In Greenberg's view, these artists were simply providing illustrations for the literary subject – the exotic Middle Easterner – for whom the artist "dragged the Arab from the market and his donkey by the ear to the canvas".&lt;ref&gt;Uri Zvi Greenberg, “Draft of an article on an exhibition of Zaritsky in the Bezalel National Museum , Studio, No. 56 (September 1994), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[Chaim Gliksberg]] in 1923 also described the misuse of this motif by the artists: "Our paintings shocked the world, covered huge canvases, were  illustrations painted in the decorative style without any attempt at solving artistic problems, since the main thing was the subject and the content: the external depiction of the Land of Israel. The canvas and the paint served only as the means to all this: it's no wonder that they considered everyone who put a pioneer, a camel, a donkey, or an Arab village on canvas, as an Israeli artist".&lt;ref&gt;Turim [Tel Aviv literary weekly, 1933-1935], 1933.  Cited in: Tammuz, Benjamin, ed., The Story of Israeli Art (Givatayim: Masada Publishers, 1980), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the artists who rejected the symbolic representation of the Land of Israel was Joseph Zaritsky.  His works during this period included a large number of watercolor landscapes in light colors.  His artistic work gradually became more free in its style.  In works such as “Jerusalem Habashim Gate” (1923), you can still see a desire for a meticulous description of nature, but his later works show an expressive tendency in the creation of their composition; examples of this can be seen in the painting “Haifa, The Technion” (1924), or in the work “Jerusalem, Nahalat Shiva” (1924), in which Zaritsky uses trees as an expressive device for dividing the format into distinct areas.  The use of lines as a means of expression stands out also in his landscapes depicting the houses  of Jerusalem or Safed of that era. 
 
Among the group of artists who were influenced by French Modernism we can see a combination of the influences of Cubism and realism. For example, in Sionah Tagger’s painting, “The Train Passing Through Neve Tzedek” (1928), the tendency to geometric description stands out in monochromatic painted surfaces which combine with a realistic depiction of the urbanity of the developing city of Tel Aviv. In the works of Chana Orloff and Arieh Lubin, perhaps more than in any other artists of the period, we can see the influence of synthetic Cubism and of the tendency toward the use of geometric forms.

'''TuneSat''' is an online audio recognition service launched in 2009 which enables music copyright holders to detect where their work is being used. Rights owners upload their audio files, and TuneSat begins to search and track results of matches.

Founders Chris Woods and [[Scott Schreer]] began by pitching their services to US television networks as an alternative to the cue sheet tracking which has been standard for many years from [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruno |first=Antony |title=Name that Tune – Music Recognition Technology Could Improve Accounting of Broadcast Royalties |url=https://tunesat.com/tunesatportal/static/pdf/Billboard_Name_that_Tunesat_Article.pdf |publisher=Billboard |accessdate=2 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151132/https://tunesat.com/tunesatportal/static/pdf/Billboard_Name_that_Tunesat_Article.pdf |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, TuneSat launched a product to detect unlicensed streaming across the web, in podcasts, movie trailers, fan videos, and flash websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymundo|first=Oscar|title=TuneSat Launches Audio Technology to Detect Unlicensed Streaming  |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/blogs/gear-up/tunesat-launches-audio-technology-to-detect-unlicensed-streaming-20120126|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the spring of 2013, TuneSat raised $1.223 million in equity funding to expand their tracking to more television networks around the world. At the time, TuneSat tracked 320 television networks in 14 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peoples|first=Glenn|title=TuneSat Raises $1.225 Million in Funding|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1556640/tunesat-raises-1225-million-in-funding|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''visionary environment''' or '''fantasy world''' is an extensive/large-scale artistic installations (buildings, sculpture parks, etc.) intended to capture intense subjective/personal experiences (dreams, fantasies, obsessions, etc.) of their creators. The subjective/personal nature of these projects often implies a marginal status for the artists involved, and there is a strong association between visionary environments and [[outsider art]].

'''''A Wheatfield with Cypresses''''' is any of three similar 1889 oil paintings by [[Vincent van Gogh]], as part of his [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|wheat field]] series.  All were exhibited at the [[Saint-Paul-de-Mausole]] mental asylum at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]] near [[Arles]], France, where Van Gogh was voluntarily a patient from May 1889 to May 1890.  The works were inspired by the view from the window at the asylum towards the [[Alpilles]] mountains.

The painting depicts golden fields of ripe wheat, a dark fastigiate [[Provence|Provençal]] [[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress]] towering like a green obelisk to the right and lighter green [[olive tree]]s in the middle distance, with hills and mountains visible behind, and white clouds swirling in an azure sky above.  The first version (F717)  was painted in late June or early July 1889, during a period of frantic painting and shortly after Van Gogh completed ''[[The Starry Night]]'', at a time when he was fascinated by the cypress.  It is likely to have been painted "[[en plein air]]", near the subject, when Van Gogh was able to leave the precincts of the asylum.  Van Gogh regarded this work as one of his best summer paintings.  In a letter to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], written on 2 July 1889, Vincent described the painting: "I have a canvas of cypresses with some ears of wheat, some poppies, a blue sky like a piece of [[tartan|Scotch plaid]]; the former painted with a thick impasto like the [[Adolphe Monticelli|Monticelli]]'s, and the wheat field in the sun, which represents the extreme heat, very thick too."

Van Gogh had to take time off painting in order to deal with some severe problems due to mental illness in late July and early August, but was able to resume painting in late August and early September 1889.  After making a [[Reed pen|reed-pen]] drawing of the work, now held by the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam, he copied the composition twice in oils in his studio, one approximately the same size (F615) and a smaller version (F743).  The larger studio version was probably painted in a single sitting, with a few minor later adjustments adding touches of yellow and brown.  Van Gogh sketched out the design with [[charcoal]] [[underdrawing]]; he applied thin paint on the cypress trees and sky, with the ground allowed to show in places, and thick [[impasto]] for the foreground wheat and the clouds above.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Van Gogh's A Cornfield, with Cypresses, John Leighton, Anthony Reeve, Ashok Roy and Raymond White, National Gallery Technical Bulletin, 1987, Volume 11, pp 42–59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Characteristically, he preferred the brilliant white of [[zinc white]] (zinc oxide) for the white clouds rather than [[lead white]], despite its poor drying qualities, with his [[Palette (painting)|palette]] also including [[cobalt blue]] for the sky, shades of [[chrome yellow]] for the wheat field, [[viridian]] and [[emerald green]] for the bushes and cypresses, and touches of [[vermilion]] for the poppies in the foreground and also synthetic [[ultramarine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/van-gogh-wheatfield-cypresses/ Vincent van Gogh, A Wheatfield with Cypresses], illustrated pigment analysis at ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;  The July "plein air" version was much more heavily worked, and may be considered a study for the more considered September studio painting.  He sent the smaller and less accomplished studio version to his mother and sister as a gift.

Vincent sent the larger July and September versions to his brother in Paris later in September 1889.  The July version was sold by Theo's widow in 1900 to artist [[Émile Schuffenecker]].  It passed through the hands of collector [[Alexandre Louis Philippe Marie Berthier, 4th Prince of Wagram|Alexandre Berthier]] and art dealer [[Paul Cassirer]] in Paris, where it was first exhibited and photographed at Galerie [[Eugène Druet]] in November 1909.  It was sold to banker [[Franz von Mendelssohn]] (1865–1935) in Berlin in 1910 and remained with the Mendelssohn family in Germany and Switzerland until it was sold to industrialist [[Emil Bührle]] in Zurich in 1952.  His son, [[Dieter Bührle]], sold the painting in 1993 to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York for $57 million using funds donated by publisher, diplomat and philanthropist [[Walter Annenberg]].

The [[National Gallery]] in London holds a similar version painted in Van Gogh's studio in September 1889, bought with the [[Courtauld Fund]] in 1923.  It is unlined, and was never varnished or waxed.  The third smaller version is held by a private collection (sold at [[Sotheby's]] in London in 1970; in the US in 1987).

'''Windows Color System''' (WCS) is a platform for [[color management]], first included with [[Windows Vista]], that aims to achieve color consistency across various software and hardware, including cameras, monitors, printers and scanners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/color/WCS.mspx Windows Color System]&lt;/ref&gt; Different devices interpret the same colors differently, according to their software and hardware configurations. As a result, they must be properly calibrated to reproduce colors consistently across different devices. WCS aims to make this process of [[color calibration]] automatic and transparent, as an evolution of [[ICC profile]]s.

Windows Color System features a ''Color Infrastructure and Translation Engine'' (CITE) at its core. It is backed up by a color processing pipeline that supports bit-depths more than 32 bits per pixel, multiple color channels (more than three), alternative [[color space]]s and [[high dynamic range imaging|high dynamic range]] coloring, using a technology named ''Kyuanos''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reuveni|first1=Noam|title=Windows Vista to use Canon Color Management|url=http://cameras.reviewed.com/content/Windows-Vista-to-use-Canon-Color-Management|website=Reviewed.com Cameras|date=13 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[Canon Inc.|Canon]]. The color processing pipeline allows device developers to add their own [[Color management#Gamut mapping|gamut mapping]] algorithm into the pipeline to customize the color response of the device. The new pipeline also supports floating point calculations to minimize [[round-off error]]s, which are inherent in integer processing. Once the color pipeline finishes processing the colors, the CITE engine applies a [[color translation]] according to a color profile, specific to a device to ensure the output color matches to what is expected.

WCS features explicit support for LCD as well as CRT monitors, projectors, printers, and other imaging devices and provides customized support for each. WCS uses color profiles according to [[CIECAM02]], defined using [[XML]], to define how the color representation actually translates to a visible color. [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] V4 color profiles are also supported. [[Windows Photo Gallery]] and Photo Viewer only support the deprecated V2 standard and show dark images when used with V4 profiles, [[Windows Imaging Component]], the [[HD Photo]] format, [[XML Paper Specification|XPS]] print path and XPS documents all support color management.
