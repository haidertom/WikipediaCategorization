[[File:Aleppo Codex (Deut).jpg|thumb|Page from Aleppo Codex, Deuteronomy]]

The '''Aleppo Codex''' ({{lang-he|כֶּתֶר אֲרָם צוֹבָא}} '''''Keter Aram Tzova''''' or '''Crown of Aleppo''') is a medieval bound manuscript of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The [[codex]] was written in the city of [[Tiberias]], in what is currently northern [[Israel]], in the 10th century C.E.,&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/920915.html Fragment of ancient parchment given to Jewish scholars]&lt;/ref&gt; and was endorsed for its accuracy by [[Maimonides]]. Together with the [[Leningrad Codex]], it contains the [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher|Ben-Asher]] [[Masoretic Text|masoretic]] tradition, but the Aleppo Codex lacks most of the Torah section and many other parts.

==History==

=== Overview ===
The [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jewish]] community of [[Jerusalem]] purchased the codex about a hundred years after it was made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebrewbooks.org/32847 M. Nehmad, ''Keter Aram Tzova'', Aleppo 1933]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pfeffer|first1=Anshel|title=Fragment of Ancient Parchment From Bible Given to Jerusalem Scholars|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/fragment-of-ancient-parchment-from-bible-given-to-jerusalem-scholars-1.232641|work=Haaretz|date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First Crusade]], the synagogue was plundered and the codex was transferred to Egypt, whose Jews paid a high price for its ransom.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com" /&gt; It was preserved at the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] then [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbanite]] synagogue in [[Old Cairo]], where it was consulted by [[Maimonides]], who described it as a text trusted by all Jewish scholars. It is rumoured that in 1375 one of Maimonides' descendants brought it to [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]], leading to its present name.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com" /&gt;

The Codex remained in Syria for five hundred years. In 1947, rioters enraged by the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] burned down the [[synagogue]] where it was kept.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com" /&gt; The Codex disappeared, then reemerged in 1958, when it was smuggled into [[Israel]] by [[Syrian Jews|Syrian Jew]] Murad Faham, and presented to the president of the state, [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]]. Some time after arrival, it was found that parts of the codex had been lost. The Aleppo Codex was entrusted to the Ben-Zvi Institute and [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. It is currently (2005) on display in the [[Israel Museum]].

The Aleppo Codex was submitted by Israel for inclusion in UNESCO's [[Memory of the World]] Register and was included in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Aleppo Codex | website=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization | url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-1/aleppo-codex/ | access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ransom===

The Karaite Jewish community of Jerusalem received the book from Israel ben Simha of [[Basra]] sometime between 1040 and 1050.&lt;ref name=judith&gt;[[Judith Olszowy-Schlanger|Olszowy-Schlanger, Judith]]. ''Karaite marriage documents from the Cairo Geniza: legal tradition and community life in mediaeval Egypt and Palestine.'' Etudes sur le judaïsme médiéval, t. 20. Leiden: Brill, 1998 ({{ISBN|9004108866}}), pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; It was cared for by the brothers Hizkiyahu and Joshya, Karaite religious leaders who eventually moved to [[Fustat]] in 1050. The codex, however, stayed in Jerusalem until the latter part of that century.&lt;ref name=judith/&gt; After the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)]] during the [[First Crusade]], the Crusaders held the codex and other holy works for ransom (along with Jewish survivors).&lt;ref name=ols&gt;Olszowy: pp. 54-55 and footnote #86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=codex&gt;[http://www.aleppocodex.org/10.html The Vicissitudes of the Aleppo Codex]&amp;nbsp;– See ''4.4 The Crusades and the Ransoming of Books''. Retrieved on 2008–03–04.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aleppo Codex website cites two letters in the [[Cairo Geniza]] that describe how the inhabitants of [[Ashkelon]] borrowed money from Egypt to pay for the books.&lt;ref name=codex/&gt; These [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] letters were discovered by noted Jewish historian [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Kedar, Benjamin Z. "The Jerusalem Massacre of July 1099 in the Western Historiography of the Crusades." in ''The Crusades'' (Vol. 3). ed. Benjamin Z. Kedar and Jonathan S.C. Riley-Smith. Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2004 ({{ISBN|075464099X}}), pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon]]'', the more descriptive of the two, states that the money borrowed from [[Alexandria]] was used to “buy back two hundred and thirty Bible codices, a hundred other volumes, and eight Torah Scrolls."&lt;ref&gt;Goitein, S.D. ''A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza. Vol. V: The Individual: Portrait of a Mediterranean Personality of the High Middle Ages as Reflected in the Cairo Geniza''. University of California Press, 1988 ({{ISBN|0520056477}}), pg. 376&lt;/ref&gt; The documents were transported to Egypt via a caravan led and funded by the prominent Alexandrian official Abu’l-Fadl Sahl b. Yūsha’ b. Sha‘yā, who was in Ascalon for his wedding in early 1100.&lt;ref&gt;Goitein: pp. 375–376 and footnote #81 on pg. 612&lt;/ref&gt; Judeo-Arabic inscriptions on the first page of the Codex mention the book was then "transferred to the Jerusalemite synagogue in Fustat."&lt;ref name="ols" /&gt; The Aleppo codex website reveals how the book changed hands.
{{quote|[It was] transferred&amp;nbsp;[...] according to the law of redemption from imprisonment [in which it had fallen] in Jerusalem, the Holy City, may it be rebuilt and reestablished, to the congregation in Egypt of Knisat Yerushalayim, may it be built and established in the life of Israel. Blessed be he who preserves it and cursed be he who steals it, and cursed be he who sells it, and cursed be he who pawns it. It may not be sold and it may not be defiled forever.&lt;ref name=codex/&gt;}}

===In Aleppo===
The Aleppo community guarded the Codex zealously for some 600 years: it was kept, together with three other Biblical manuscripts, in a special cupboard (later, an iron safe) in a basement chapel of the [[Central Synagogue of Aleppo]], supposed to have been the [[Cave of Elijah]]. It was regarded as the community's most sacred possession: Those in trouble would pray before it, and oaths were taken by it. The community received queries from Jews around the world, who asked that various textual details be checked, correspondence which is preserved in the [[responsa]] literature, and which allows for the reconstruction of certain details in the parts that are missing today. Most importantly, in the 1850s, [[Shalom Shachne Yellin]] sent his son in law, Moses Joshua Kimchi, to Aleppo, to copy information about the Codex; Kimchi sat for weeks, and copied thousands of details about the codex into the margins of a small handwritten [[Bible]]. The existence of this Bible was known to 20th-century scholars from the book ''‘Ammudé Shesh'' by [[Shemuel Shelomo Boyarski]], and then the actual Bible itself was discovered by [[Yosef Ofer]] in 1989.

However, the community limited direct observation of the manuscript by outsiders, especially by scholars in modern times. [[Paul E. Kahle]], when revising the text of the ''[[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Biblia Hebraica]]'' in the 1920s, tried and failed to obtain a photographic copy. This forced him to use the ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'' instead for the third edition, which appeared in 1937.

The only modern scholar allowed to compare it with a standard printed [[Hebrew Bible]] and take notes on the differences was [[Umberto Cassuto]], who examined it in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Wandering Bible: The Aleppo Codex|url=http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/page_1358|website=The Israel Museum, Jerusalem|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This secrecy made it impossible to confirm the authenticity of the Codex, and indeed Cassuto doubted that it was Maimonides' codex, though he agreed that it was 10th-century.

During the [[1947 Anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo]], the community's ancient synagogue was burned and the Codex was damaged. Later, after the Codex was in Israel, it was found that no more than 294 of the original (estimated) 487 pages survived.&lt;ref name=Pfeffer&gt;{{cite news | title = Fragment of Ancient Parchment From Bible Given to Jerusalem Scholars | author = Anshel Pfeffer | date = November 6, 2007 | url = https://www.haaretz.com/1.4995266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayim Tawil &amp; Bernard Schneider, ''Crown of Aleppo'' (Philadelphia, Jewish Publication Soc., 2010) page 110; there have been various reports and estimates of the original number of pages; Izhak Ben-Zvi, "The Codex of Ben Asher",  ''Textus,''  vol. 1 (1960) page 2, reprinted in Sid Z. Leiman, ed., ''The Canon and Masorah of the Hebrew Bible, an Introductory Reader'' (NY, [[KTAV Publishing House]], 1974) page 758 (estimating an original number of 380 pages).&lt;/ref&gt;  Each page is parchment, 33 cm high by 26.5 cm wide (13 inches x 10.43 inches).&lt;ref&gt;Hayim Tawil &amp; Bernard Schneider, ''Crown of Aleppo'' (Philadelphia, Jewish Publication Soc., 2010) page 110; Izhak Ben-Zvi, "The Codex of Ben Asher",  ''Textus,''  vol. 1 (1960) page 2, reprinted in Sid Z. Leiman, ed., ''The Canon and Masorah of the Hebrew Bible, an Introductory Reader''  (NY, Ktav Pubg. House, 1974) page 758.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, only the last few pages of the [[Torah]] are extant.&lt;ref&gt;The surviving text begins with the last word of Deuteronomy 28:17; Izhak Ben-Zvi, "The Codex of Ben Asher",  ''Textus,''  vol. 1 (1960) page 2, reprinted in Sid Z. Leiman, ed., ''The Canon and Masorah of the Hebrew Bible, an Introductory Reader''  (NY, Ktav Pubg. House, 1974) page 758.&lt;/ref&gt;

The missing leaves are a subject of fierce controversy. Originally it was thought they were destroyed by fire, but scholarly analysis has shown no evidence of fire having reached the codex itself (the dark marks on the pages are due to fungus).&lt;ref name=Pfeffer/&gt; Some scholars instead accuse members of the Jewish community of having torn off the missing leaves and keeping them privately hidden. Two "missing" leaves have turned up, one in 1982 and the other in 2007, leaving open the possibility that even more may have survived the riots in 1947.&lt;ref name=holy&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Ronen Bergman]] |title=A High Holy Whodunit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/magazine/the-aleppo-codex-mystery.html?pagewanted=all |quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the 2012 book, ''The Aleppo Codex''  by [[Matti Friedman]], calls attention to the fact that eyewitnesses in Aleppo who saw the Codex shortly after the fire consistently reported that it was complete or nearly complete, and then there is no account of it for more than a decade, until after it arrived in Israel and was put in the Ben-Zvi Institute, at which point it was as currently described; his book suggests a number of possibilities for the loss of the pages including theft in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Friedman, ''The Aleppo Codex'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2012) chapt. 24 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The community of Damascus possessed a counterpart of the Aleppo Codex, known as the "Damascus Keter", also written in Israel in the 10th century, which is now kept at the [[National Library of Israel]] and numbered ms. Heb 5702. It is available online here [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11364/]. (This should not be confused with another Damascus Keter, of medieval Spanish origin.)

===In Israel===
[[File:Jerusalem Schrein des Buches BW 1.JPG|thumb|right|Exterior view of the [[Shrine of the Book]]]]

In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria and sent to Jerusalem to be placed in the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews.&lt;ref name=friedman2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matti Friedman | title = The Continuing Mysteries of the Aleppo Codex | journal = [[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]] | date = June 30, 2014 | url = http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/176903/aleppo-codex}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given first to [[Shlomo Zalman Shragai]] of the [[Jewish Agency]], who later testified that the Codex was complete or nearly so at the time.&lt;ref name=friedman2/&gt; Later it was given to the [[Yad Ben Zvi|Ben-Zvi Institute]].&lt;ref name=friedman2/&gt; In 1958, the Jewish community of Aleppo sued the Ben-Zvi Institute for the return of the Codex, but the court ruled against them and suppressed publication of the proceedings.&lt;ref name=friedman2/&gt;

In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the [[Shrine of the Book]] at the [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref name=holy /&gt; This finally gave scholars the chance to examine it and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of [[Moshe Goshen-Gottstein]] on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex) that not only was it the oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, it was the first time ever that a complete ''[[Tanakh]]'' had been produced by one or two people as a unified entity in a consistent style.

Later, after the university denied him access to the codex, [[Mordechai Breuer]] began his own reconstruction of the Masoretic text on the basis of other well-known ancient manuscripts. His results matched the Aleppo Codex almost exactly. Thus today, Breuer's version is used authoritatively for the reconstruction of the missing portions of the Aleppo Codex. The ''[[Jerusalem Crown]]'' (כתר ירושלים, "Jerusalem Crown"), printed in Jerusalem in 2000, is a modern version of the Tanakh based on the Aleppo Codex and the work of Breuer: It uses a newly designed typeface based on the calligraphy of the Codex and is based on its page layout.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Documentary film]]maker, Avi Dabach, great grandson of Chacham Ezra Dabach (one of the last caretakers of the Codex when it was still in Syria), announced in December 2015 an upcoming film tracing the history of the Codex and possibly determining the fate of the missing pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maltz|first1=Judy|title=My Great-grandfather, the Man Who Held the Key to the Aleppo Codex|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.693328|website=Haaretz|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritative text==
The consonants in the codex were copied by the scribe Shlomo ben Buya'a in Israel circa 920. The text was then verified, vocalized, and provided with Masoretic notes by [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]], the last and most prominent member of the ben Asher dynasty of grammarians from [[Tiberias]], rivals to the [[ben Naphtali]] school. The tradition of ben Asher has become the one accepted for the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="ej2-ben-asher"&gt;{{citation | author=Zeev Ben-Hayyim | contribution=BEN-ASHER, AARON BEN MOSES | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=3 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=319–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ben Asher vocalization is late and in many respects artificial, compared to other traditions and tendencies reaching back closer to the period of spoken Biblical Hebrew.&lt;ref name="nce2-bible"&gt;{{citation | author=P. W. Skehan | contribution=BIBLE (TEXTS) | title=[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]] | edition=2nd | volume=2 | publisher=Gale | year=2003 | pages=355–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'', which dates to approximately the same time as the Aleppo codex, has been claimed by Paul E. Kahle to be a product of the ben Asher [[scriptorium]]. However, its [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] says only that it was corrected from manuscripts written by ben Asher; there is no evidence that ben Asher himself ever saw it. However, the same holds true for the Aleppo Codex, which was apparently not vocalized by ben Asher himself, although a later colophon, which was added to the manuscript after his death, attributes the vocalization to him.&lt;ref name="ej2-masorah"&gt;{{citation | author=[[Aron Dotan]] | contribution=MASORAH | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=13 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=603–656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aleppo Codex was the manuscript used by Maimonides when he set down the exact rules for writing scrolls of the [[Torah]], ''Hilkhot [[Sefer Torah]]'' ("the Laws of the Torah Scroll") in his ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''.&lt;ref name=codex/&gt; This [[halakha|halachic]] ruling gave the Aleppo Codex the seal of supreme textual authority, albeit only with regard to the type of space preceding sections (''petuhot'' and ''setumot'') and for the manner of the writing of the songs in the Pentateuch.&lt;ref name="ej2-masorah" /&gt; "The codex which we used in these works is the codex known in [[Egypt]], which includes 24 books, which was in [[Jerusalem]]," he wrote. [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]] testifies to this being the same codex that was later transferred to Aleppo.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Contents==
When the Aleppo Codex was complete (until 1947), it followed the Tiberian textual tradition in the order of its books, similar to the ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'', and which also matches the later tradition of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] biblical manuscripts. The [[Torah]] and the [[Nevi'im]] appear in the same order found in most printed Hebrew Bibles, but the order for the books for [[Ketuvim]] differs markedly. In the Aleppo Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is [[Books of Chronicles]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Proverbs]], [[Book of Ruth]], [[Song of Songs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Book of Lamentations]], [[Book of Esther]], [[Book of Daniel]], and [[Book of Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah]].

The current text is missing all of the [[Torah#Pentateuch|Pentateuch]] to the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 28.17; [[Books of Kings|II Kings]] 14.21–18.13; [[Book of Jeremiah]] 29.9–31.33; 32.2–4, 9–11, 21–24; [[Book of Amos]] 8.12–[[Book of Micah]] 5.1; So 3.20–Za 9.17; II Chronicles 26.19–35.7; Book of Psalms 15.1–25.2 (MT enumeration); Song of Songs 3.11 to the end; all of Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, and Ezra-Nehemiah.&lt;ref name="nce2-bible" /&gt;

== Modern editions ==
Several complete or partial editions of the [[Tanakh]] based on the Aleppo Codex have been published over the past three decades in Israel, some of them under the academic auspices of Israeli universities. These editions incorporate reconstructions of the missing parts of the codex based on the methodology of [[Mordechai Breuer]] or similar systems, and by taking into account all available historical testimony about the contents of the codex.

'''Complete Tanakh:'''
These are complete editions of the [[Tanakh]], usually in one volume (but sometimes also sold in three volumes). They do ''not'' include the masoretic notes of the Aleppo Codex.
# [[Mossad Harav Kook]] edition, [[Mordechai Breuer]], ed. [[Torah]] (1977); [[Nebi'im]] (1979); [[Ketubim]] (1982); full [[Tanakh]] in one volume 1989. This was the first edition to include a reconstruction of the letters, vowels, and cantillation marks in the missing parts of the Aleppo codex.
# Horev publishers, Jerusalem, 1996–98. [[Mordechai Breuer]], ed. This was the first edition to incorporate newly discovered information on the [[parashah]] divisions of the Aleppo Codex for [[Nebi'im]] and [[Ketubim]]. The text of the Horev Tanakh has been reprinted in several forms with various commentaries by the same publisher.&lt;ref name="Taj"&gt;In this edition, the masoretic text and symbols were encoded and graphic layout was enabled by the computer program ''Taj'', developed by Daniel Weissman.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Jerusalem Crown]]: The Bible of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem'', 2000. Edited according to the method of [[Mordechai Breuer]] under the supervision of Yosef Ofer, with additional proofreading and refinements since the Horev edition.&lt;ref name="Taj" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13754">:''This article is a discussion of ASIL as a means of classifying hazards, particularly to provide a context for comparison with other methods of classifying hazards, risk, quality, or reliability. For a more thorough description of ASIL, methods of its assessment, and its roles within ISO 26262 processes, see [[ISO 26262#Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL)|ISO 26262 (Automotive Safety Integrity Level)]].''
'''Automotive Safety Integrity Level''' (ASIL) is a risk classification scheme defined by the [[ISO 26262]] - Functional Safety for Road Vehicles standard. This is an adaptation of the [[Safety Integrity Level]] used in [[IEC 61508]] for the automotive industry. This classification helps defining the safety requirements necessary to be in line with the ISO 26262 standard. The ASIL is established by performing a risk analysis of a potential hazard by looking at the Severity, Exposure and Controllability of the vehicle operating scenario. The safety goal for that hazard in turn carries the ASIL requirements.

There are four ASILs identified by the standard: ASIL A, ASIL B, ASIL C, ASIL D. ASIL D dictates the highest integrity requirements on the product and ASIL A the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ni.com/white-paper/13647/en/#toc2 National Instruments White Paper on ISO 26262 functional safety standard&lt;/ref&gt; Hazards that are identified as QM do not dictate any safety requirements.

==Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment==
Because of the reference to SIL and because the ASIL incorporate 4 levels of hazard with a 5th non-hazardous level, it is common in descriptions of ASIL to compare its levels to the SIL levels and [[DO-178C]] Design Assurance Levels, respectively.

The determination of ASIL is the result of ''hazard analysis and risk assessment''.&lt;ref name="ISO26262Part3"&gt;{{cite book | title =ISO 26262-3:2011(en)  Road vehicles — Functional safety — Part 3: Concept phase| publisher =International Standardization Organization | url =https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:26262:-3:ed-1:v1:en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the context of ISO 26262, a hazard is assessed based on the relative impact of hazardous effects related to a system, as adjusted for relative likelihoods of the hazard manifesting those effects.  That is, each hazard is assessed in terms of severity of possible injuries within the context how much of the time a vehicle is exposed to the possibility of the hazard happening as well as the relative likelihood that a typical driver can act to prevent the injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Hobbs | first =Chris | last2 =Lee | first2 =Patrick | title =Understanding ISO 26262 ASILs | publisher =Penton Electronics Group  | series =Embedded Technologies | date =July 9, 2013 | url =http://electronicdesign.com/embedded/understanding-iso-26262-asils | magazine  =Electronic Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, ASIL refers both to risk and to risk-dependent requirements (standard minimal risk treatment for a given risk).  Whereas risk may be generally expressed as 
:&lt;math&gt; \text{Risk} = (\text{expected loss in case of the accident}) \times  (\text{probability of the accident occurring})&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; \text{Risk} = \text{Severity} \times  (\text{Exposure} \times \text{Likelihood})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kinney  | first =G. F.  | last2 =Wiruth  | first2 =A.

ASIL may be similarly expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; \text{ASIL} = \text{Severity} \times  (\text{Exposure} \times \text{Controllability})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author =Steve Hartley | author2 =Ireri Ibarra | author3 =Gunwant Dhadyalla | title =Functional Safety &amp; Diagnostics of Hybrid Vehicles ("Severity x Exposure x Controllability = ASIL") | url =http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/research/lcvtp/documents/presentations/lcvtp072-ws6disseminationeventfunctionalsafetyanddiagnosticsfinalversion_3.pdf | year =2011 | pages =sheet  8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Smart &amp; Compact Battery Cell Management System for Fully Electrical Vehicles (Sheet 9) |url=http://www.green-cars-initiative.eu/workshops/ev-batteries-moving-from-research-towards-innovation/documents/session-1/SMART-LIC%202.1.pdf/at_download/file |publisher=STMicroelectronics }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Hercules™ Safety Microcontrollers - 1 Day Safety MCU Workshop (sheet 25) | series =Texas Instruments | year =2013 | publisher =Texas Instruments}}&lt;/ref&gt;
illustrating the role of Exposure and Controllability in establishing relative probability, which is combined with Severity to form an expression of risk.

==Levels==
The ASIL range from ASIL D, representing the highest degree of automotive hazard and highest degree of rigor applied in the assurance the resultant safety requirements, to QM, representing application with no automotive hazards and, therefore, no safety requirements to manage under the [[ISO 26262]] safety processes.  The intervening levels are simply a range of intermediate degrees of hazard and degrees of assurance required.

=== ASIL D ===
''ASIL D'', an abbreviation of ''Automotive Safety Integrity Level D'', refers to the highest classification of initial hazard (injury risk) defined within [[ISO 26262]] and to that standard’s most stringent level of safety measures to apply for avoiding an unreasonable residual risk.&lt;ref name="ISO26262Part3"/&gt;   In particular, ASIL D represents likely potential for severely life-threatening or fatal injury in the event of a malfunction and requires the highest level of assurance that the dependent safety goals are sufficient and have been achieved.&lt;ref name="ISO26262Part3"/&gt;

''ASIL D'' is noteworthy, not only because of the elevated risk it represents and the exceptional rigor required in development, but because automotive electrical, electronic, and software suppliers make claims that their products have been certified or otherwise accredited to ASIL D,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =News Release: Freescale Qorivva Microcontroller is First Automotive MCU to Receive ISO 26262 Functional Safety Standard Certification | publisher =Freescale Semiconductor | date =September 6, 2012 | url =http://media.freescale.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=196520&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1732156 | accessdate =January 23, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Programming Research certificated to ISO 26262 - ASIL D | publisher =Programming Research | date = July 25, 2013 | url =http://www.programmingresearch.com/industry-coding-standards/automotive | accessdate = April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Certified tools for functional safety ("Certified for software development up ...

===QM===
Referring to "Quality Management", the level QM means that risk associated with a hazardous event is not unreasonable and does not therefore require safety measures in accordance with ISO 26262.&lt;ref name="ISO26262Part3" /&gt;

==Comparison with Other Hazard Level Standards==
Given ASIL is a relatively recent development, discussions of ASIL often compare its levels to levels defined in other well established safety or quality management systems. In particular, the ASIL are compared to the SIL risk reduction levels defined in IEC 61508 and the Design Assurance Levels used in the context of [[DO-178C]] and [[DO-254]].  While there are some similarities, it is important to also understand the differences.

=== IEC 61508 (SIL)===
[[ISO 26262]] is an extension of [[IEC 61508]].&lt;ref name="ISO26262Part3"/&gt; IEC 61508 defines a widely referenced Safety Integrity Level (SIL) classification.  Unlike other functional safety standards ISO 26262 does not provide normative nor informative mapping of ASIL to SIL. While the two standards have similar processes for hazard assessment, ASIL and SIL are computed from different points.  Where ASIL is a qualitative measurement of risk, SIL is quantitatively defined as probability or frequency of dangerous failures depending on the type of safety function.  In the context of IEC 61508, higher risk applications require greater robustness to dangerous failures.

:&lt;math&gt; \text{probability of failure} &lt;  {\text{Tolerable Risk} \over \text{Risk} } &lt;/math&gt;

That is, for a given Tolerable Risk, greater Risk requires more risk reduction, i.e., smaller value for probability of dangerous failure.  For a safety function operating in high demand or continuous mode of operation, SIL 1 is associated with a [[IEC 61508#Improved reliability|probability of dangerous failure limit]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; per hour while SIL 4 is associated with a [[IEC 61508#Improved reliability|probability of dangerous failure rate limit]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;.

In commercial publications, ASIL D has been shown aligned to SIL 3 and ASIL A is comparable to SIL 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frech|first=Marcus|author2=Josef Mieslinger|title=Functional Safety Seminar &amp; 1-Day HerculesTM Workshop|journal=Arrow Roadshow|year=2012|series=Arrow Roadshow|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SAE ARP4761 and SAE ARP4754 (DAL)===
While it is more common to compare the ISO 26262 Levels D though QM to the Design Assurance Levels (DAL) A through E and ascribe those levels to DO-178C; these DAL are actually defined and applied through the definitions of [[ARP4761|SAE ARP4761]] and [[ARP4754|SAE ARP4754]].  Especially in terms of the management of vehicular hazards through a [[ARP4761#Safety life cycle|Safety Life Cycle]], the scope of ISO 26262 is more comparable to the combined scope of SAE ARP4761 and SAE ARP4754.  Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA) is defined in ARP4761 and the DAL are defined in ARP4754.  [[DO-178C]] and [[DO-254]] define the design assurance objectives that must be accomplished for given DAL.

Unlike SIL, it is the case that both ASIL and DAL are statements measuring degree of hazard. DAL E is the ARP4754 equivalent of QM; in both classifications hazards are negligible and safety management is not required.  At the other end, DAL A and ASIL D represent the highest levels of risk addressed by the respective standards, but they do not address the same level of hazard. While ASIL D encompasses at most the hazards of a loaded passenger van&lt;!-- ISO 26262 does not at this time apply to bus transport --&gt;, DAL A includes the greater hazards of large aircraft loaded with fuel and passengers. Publications might illustrate ASIL D as equivalent to either DAL B, to DAL A, or as an intermediate level.

'''Black drink''' is a name for several kinds of ritual beverages brewed by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the [[Southeastern United States]]. Traditional ceremonial people of the [[Yuchi people|Yuchi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|page=59|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caddo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|pages=70–71 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chickasaw]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|pages=61–62 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee people|Muscogee]] and some other [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands]] use the black drink in purification ceremonies.  It was occasionally known as ''white drink'' because of the association of the color white with peace leaders in some Native cultures in the Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|pages=2, 131 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preparation and protocols vary between tribes and ceremonial grounds; a prominent ingredient is the roasted leaves and stems of ''[[Ilex vomitoria]]'' (commonly known as yaupon holly), a plant native to the [[Atlantic]] and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]s. Black drink also usually contains [[emetic]] herbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gibbons |first= E|date=  1964|title= Stalking the Blue-eyed Scallop|url= |location= |publisher=  David McKay Company, Inc |page= |isbn=  0-911469-05-2|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
[[File:Makingblackdrink.png|thumb|''Preparing Black Drink'', engraving by [[Joseph-François Lafitau]], 1723]]
[[File:Ilex vomitoria fws.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Yaupon holly]]

According to the ethnohistorical record, the yaupon leaves and branches used for the black drink were traditionally picked as close to the time of its planned consumption as possible. After picking, historically they were lightly parched in a ceramic container over fire. The roasting increases the solubility in water of the caffeine, which is the same reason [[coffee]] beans are roasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merck Index |edition=12th |editor=Susan Budavari |publisher=Merck &amp; Co., Inc. |place=Whitehouse Station, NJ |year=1996 |page=1674}}&lt;/ref&gt; After browning, they were boiled in large containers of water until the liquid reached a dark brown or black color, giving it its name. The liquid was then strained into containers to cool, until it was cool enough to not scald the skin, and drunk while still hot. Because caffeine is 30 times more soluble in boiling water than room temperature water, this heightened its effect. It was then consumed in a ritual manner. Its physiological effects are believed to be mainly those of massive doses of caffeine. Three to six cups of strong coffee is equal to 0.5 to 1.0 grams of caffeine; the black drink could have delivered at least this much and possibly up to 3.0 to 6.0 grams of caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  author = Hudson, Charles M.  |  title =The Southeastern Indians| year =1976 | page = 226 | authorlink = Charles M. Hudson (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen gives the caffeine content of coffee as between 1.01 and 1.42 percent &lt;ref&gt;Owen, Daiel, 2006. Coffee and Cafeine FAQ: How much caffeine there is in X coffee? Access at http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/23&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, ''Ilex vomitoria'' leaves contain 0.0038 to 0.2288 percent caffeine by weight according to experiments performed by Adam Edwards in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Adam, 2002. [http://www.econbot.org/_about_/06_awards/awards_ morton/pdfs/a_edwards.pdf "Variation of caffeine and related alkaloids in Ilex vomitoria Ait. (Yaupon holly): A model of intraspecific alkaloid variation."] ''Society for Economic Botany'' Julia F. Morton Award.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar methods of production were adopted by European colonists for the production of a drink that often shared the same names with Native names for the black drink but used for different, secular purposes.

While the general method of production is known, not all details of the preparation and ceremonial usage of the black drink are. The source of the emetic effect of black drink is not known and has been speculated upon by historians, archaeologists, and botanists. Some professionals believe it to be caused by the addition of poisonous [[Liatris aspera|button snakeroot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  author = Hudson, Charles M.  |  title =The Southeastern Indians| year =1976 | pages = 4, 59, 62, 138, 140–141, | authorlink = Charles M. Hudson (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary preparation and usage of the black drink by Native Americans is less well documented. Online recipes for the black drink have been criticized by some Native Americans as potentially dangerous and potentially poisonous due those recipes leaving out key steps.

==Archaeological accounts==
[[File:Black Drink map HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of the geographical extent of black drink use by [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands]], prior to 19th century [[Indian Removal]] ]]
Archaeologists have demonstrated the use of various kinds of black drink among Native American groups stretching back far into antiquity, possibly dating to [[Archaic period in the Americas|Late Archaic times]]. During the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell period]], the shell cups known from later black drink rituals become common in high-status burials along with mortuary pottery and engraved stone and copper tablets. The significance of the shell cups may indicate the beginning of black drink ceremonialism. The fact that both the shells and the yaupon holly come from the same geographical location may indicate they were traded together in the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell Interaction Sphere]].&lt;ref name=HUDSONBLACK&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Charles M.

===Black drink at Cahokia===
[[File:Woodhenge motif black drink beaker HRoe 2013.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ceramic beaker from Cahokia with [[Cahokia Woodhenge|woodhenge]] motif]]
Archaeologists working at [[Cahokia]], the largest Mississippian culture settlement located near the modern city of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], found distinctive and relatively rare pottery beakers dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The beakers are small round pots with a handle on one side and a tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the unfired vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the whelk shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a plant residue, which when tested was found to contain [[theobromine]], caffeine and [[ursolic acid]] in the right proportions to have come from the ''Ilex vomitoria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Crown|first= Patricia L.|last2= Emerson|first2= Thomas E.|last3= Gu|first3= Jiyan|last4=Hurst |first4= W.

===Shell cups===
[[File:Spiro s.e.c.c. tattooed figure HRoe 2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Engraved conch shell cup from [[Spiro Mounds]]]]
In historic accounts from the 16th and 17th century, the black drink is usually imbibed in rituals using a cup made of marine shell. Three main species of marine shells have been identified as being used as cups for the black drink, [[lightning whelk]], emperor helmet, and the [[Pleuroploca gigantea|horse conch]]. The most common was the lightning whelk, which has a left-handed or sinistral spiral. The left-handed spiral may have held religious significance because of its association with dance and ritual.  The center columnella, which runs longitudinally down the shell, would be removed, and the rough edges sanded down to make a dipper-like cup. The columnella would then be used as a pendant, a motif that shows up frequently in [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] designs. In the archaeological record columnella pendants are usually found in conjunction with bi-lobed arrows, stone maces, [[earspool]]s, and necklace beads(all of which are motifs identified with the ''[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|falcon dancer/warrior/chunkey player]]'' mythological figure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  editors = F. Kent Reilly and James Garber  |  title = Ancient Objects and Sacred Realms | publisher = [[University of Texas Press]] | year = 2004 | pages = 86–96 |  isbn = 978-0-292-71347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artifacts made from these marine shells have been found as far north as [[Wisconsin]] and as far west as [[Oklahoma]]. Several examples of cups from [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] have been found to have rings of black residue in the bottoms, suggesting they were used for black drink rituals. Many examples of shell cups found in Mississippian culture mounds are engraved with [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex|S.E.C.C.]] imagery. A few examples portray what is theorized to be black drink rituals, including what some anthropologists have interpreted as vomit issuing from the mouths of mythological beings.&lt;ref name=HUDSONBLACK/&gt;{{Clear}}

===Archaeological evidence for use in pre-Hispanic US Southwest and Mexican Northwest===
Pottery samples recovered from sites in modern [[Southwestern United States]] and Northwestern Mexico have tested positive for the ratio of [[Xanthine|methylxanthines]] associated with those produced by ''Ilex vomitoria''. The same study also identified methylxanthines ratios associated with ''[[Theobroma cacao]]''. Neither plants are native to the areas from which the pottery samples were recovered, which suggests trading between areas where those plants are native. The chemical analysis also suggests a possible increase in drinks prepared from cacao after the year 1200, and a decrease in the use of drinks prepared from ''Ilex vomitoria''. Freshwater shells from Texas and Arkansas have been recovered from [[Pueblo Bonito]], which have been used as possible evidence for the trade of ''Ilex vomitoria'' from the east. There are also some stands of ''Ilex vomitoria'' in [[Mesoamerica]], so the exact origins of the ''Ilex vomitoria'' used to prepare the drinks is currently unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Crown|first= Patricia|last2= |first2= |date= 2015|title= Ritual drinks in the pre-Hispanic US Southwest and Mexican Northwest|url= http://www.pnas.org/content/112/37/11436.full|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|publisher= HighWire Press|volume= 112|issue= 37|pages= 11436–11442|doi= 10.1073/pnas.1511799112 |access-date=22 March 2016 |pmid=26372965 |pmc=4577151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accounts==
A number of tribes across the Southeastern United States use a form of the black drink in their ceremonies. [[Muscogee Creeks]], [[Cherokee]]s, [[Choctaw]]s, [[Ais people|Ais]], [[Guale]], [[Chickasaw]]s, [[Chitimacha]], [[Timucua]] and others are documented users of a type of black drink. Although rituals vary amongst the different tribes, there are some common traits among them. Black drink is most commonly drunk by men, who also prepare it, but there are some accounts of its preparation and use by women among some groups. Removal of tribes to areas outside the natural range of ''Ilex vomitoria'' has been partially responsible for a decline in the preparation of the black drink among present Native Americans.

===Ais===
In 1696, [[Jonathan Dickinson]] witnessed the use of a beverage brewed from the [[Yaupon Holly]] among the [[Ais (tribe)|Ais]] of [[Florida]]. Dickinson later learned that the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] called the plant ''casseena''. The Ais parched the leaves in a pot, and then boiled them. The resulting liquid was then transferred to a large bowl using a [[gourd]] that had a long neck with a small hole at the top, and a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} hole in the side. On the occasion Dickinson witnessed, he estimated that there were nearly three gallons of the beverage in the bowl. After the liquid had cooled, the chief was presented with a conch-shell of the beverage. The chief threw part of it on the ground as a blessing and drank the rest. The chief's associates were then served in turn. Lower status men, women, and children were not allowed to touch or taste the beverage. The chief and his associates sat drinking this brew, smoking and talking for most of the day. In the evening, the bowl that had held the beverage was covered with a skin to make a drum. The Ais, accompanied by the drum and some rattles, sang and danced until the middle of the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson|first= Charles M.|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher= University of Georgia Press|pages= 45–46|isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cherokee===
[[Cherokee]] black drink is taken for purification at several traditional ceremonies. Made with [[emetics]], the complete recipe is not shared with the public. The black drink induces vomiting for purification purposes. Other ritual medicinal beverages are also used in the ceremonies. ''Ilex vomitoria'' was not native to the traditional area controlled by the Cherokee before removal, but it was brought in to the area through trade and then transplanted.

===Muscogean peoples===
Among the [[Muscogee people|Muscogee]] the black drink is called ''ássi''.  In the ceremonies of some cultures that use the drink, after its preparation it is passed out to the highest-status person first, then the next highest status, and so forth. During each person's turn to drink, ritual songs may be sung ''Yahola''. Its use was traditionally limited to only adult men.&lt;ref name=HUDSONDRINK&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Charles M. Hudson (author)|last=Hudson|first=Charles M.|title =Black Drink: A Native American Tea|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|year=1979|pages=126–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual name ''Asi Yahola'' or ''Black Drink Singer'' is corrupted into [[English language|English]] as ''[[Osceola]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.npg.si.edu/col/native/osceola.htm | title =Native Americans | access-date =September 17, 2008 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081001173942/http://www.npg.si.edu/col/native/osceola.htm | archivedate =October 1, 2008 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timucua===
[[File:Black drink.jpg|thumb|right|300px|16th-century engraving by [[Jacques le Moyne]] of a [[Timucua]] ceremony involving the black drink]]
Among the [[Timucua]], a type of black drink was called ''cacina'' by the Spanish. The preparation and consumption of the drink were strictly limited to the community council house. Women (other than an occasional female chief) were normally excluded from the council house except for activities such as dances, but did prepare the ''cacina''. In 1678 a bedridden ''cacica'' (a female chief) was given permission to brew and consume ''cacina'' in her house, on the condition that no one else could be present while she did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=John H.|title=A History of the Timucua Indians and Missions|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1424-7|pages=2, 26, 90–91, 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cassina or yaupon tea==
After European contact with tribes in what is today the Southeastern United States, colonists began using the charred leaves of the yaupon holly to make a tea similar to the black drink, but without the ritual vomiting of it. Its use by colonists in [[Spanish Florida]] is documented as far back as 1615. An account from that year describes Spaniards as experiencing symptoms that would now be described as caffeine dependence due to daily consumption of what they called ''cacina'' or ''té del indio''. The use of ''Ilex vomitoria'' by colonists for tea making and for medicinal uses in the Carolinas is documented by the early eighteenth century. In the English-speaking colonies, it was known variously as cassina, yaupon tea, Indian tea, Carolina tea, and Appalachian tea. It was commonly believed to be and used as a [[diuretic]]. By the late 1700s, yaupon tea was described as being more commonly used in North Carolina at breakfast than tea made with ''[[Camellia sinensis]]''. In addition to using it on their own, Spanish and British colonist often drank black drink when engaging in discussions and treaties with Natives. Its preparation by British and Spanish colonists was nearly identical to the method of preparation used by their Native neighbors. Its use by colonists in [[French Louisiana]] is speculated to have occurred, but lacks documentation other than one source describing its medicinal uses from 1716.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson|first= Charles M.|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher= University of Georgia Press|pages= 6–7, 150–155|isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Civil War, yaupon tea was used as a substitute for coffee and tea throughout the South. Yaupon continued to be used in North Carolina for medicinal purposes and as a common drink until the late 1890s. At that point, its use was stigmatized because of its natural abundance as being a habit associated with rural poor people. By 1928 it was described as only being in common use by on [[Knotts Island, North Carolina]]. During the [[Interwar period]] the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] investigated the use of cassina tea as a substitute for coffee and tea. There were also a few attempts at the commercialization of cassina tea during that same period. By 1973 it was believed that cassina tea was only being served at the Pony Island Restaurant on [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke Island, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the early 2000s yaupon tea began witnessing a resurgence in its popularity, and can now be purchased online and at several historical sites related to Native Americans.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/04/429071993/heres-the-buzz-on-americas-forgotten-native-tea-plant | title= Here's The Buzz On America's Forgotten Native 'Tea' Plant| author = Murray Carpenter | date = 4 August 2015 | newspaper = The Salt |  accessdate=  31 May 2018  |publisher= National Public Radio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commodity form theory''' is a theory of [[jurisprudence]] advanced by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] legal theorist [[Evgeny Pashukanis]]. The theory argues that the legal form is the parallel of the commodity form under [[capitalism|capitalist]] society.

All law is concerned with the process of the exchanging of commodities between subjects who act as the "guardians" of commodities and are created by law in order to enable the commodity production form of society to function. The theory can be explained as based on two premises, logical and historical.

==The logical premise==
"Every legal relation" proclaims Pashukanis, "is a relation between subjects". Pashukanis' conceptual account of law begins with the idea of a responsible agent - what he calls "the legal subject".

[[Property]], says Pashukanis, is the basis of the legal form, but only capitalist property that can be disposed of in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. The subject in law is the expression of the freedom of property, that is, the freedom of alienate property.

Thus the key to understanding law is the contradiction between commodities and subjects.

Commodities according to [[Karl Marx]] relate to each other as values, that is exchange takes place on the basis of equivalent amounts of labour-time embodied in commodities passing between buyers and sellers.

Contract is both logically the central legal premise on which all other aspects of law are based, and also the highest form of expression of the commodity owning subject. This is because it is the relations of contract that are crucial for commodity production society since the contract is the necessary legal expression of commodity owners' ability to use their commodities in the market. For Pashukanis, all other forms of legal relations in capitalism flow from this.

==The historical premise==
The commodity form of exchange historically precedes the legal system which emerges from it. But it is not merely that the commodity form produces the legal form; it is that the commodity form exists prior to the legal form and that only with the full development of the commodity form is there the possibility of a fully developed abstract legal form at all.

==Fetishism==
Commodity form theory is related to Marx's theory of [[commodity fetishism]]. Marx argued that the commodity was a fetishized form because the formal equality that the commodity form postulated was only an apparent equality. The legal form is blind to substantive human differences, just as the commodity form is blind to substantive differences in use value. Ultimately, the legal form, just as the commodity form, exists independently of the will of the individual. The illusion is produced that the law&amp;nbsp;– as the universal political equivalent&amp;nbsp;– has a life of its own.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Condom fatigue''' is a term used by medical professionals and [[safer sex]] educators to refer to the phenomenon of decreased condom use. It can also be used to describe a general weariness of and decreased effectiveness of safer sex messages. This is sometimes called "prevention fatigue".

The term has particularly been used to describe [[men who have sex with men]], though the term applies to people of all [[gender]]s and [[sexual orientation]]s.  Condom fatigue has been partially blamed for an increase in [[HIV]] infection rates, though this has not been substantiated in any study.

Condom fatigue is not a universal phenomenon. In Germany, condom use between new sexual partners has increased between 1994 and 2010 from 65% to 87%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bzga.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/hohes-schutzniveau-bei-hiv-aids-schutz-gegen-sexuell-uebertragbare-krankheiten-immer-wichtiger/|title=BZgA : Pressemitteilungen|first=Die Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche|last=Aufklärung|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical university studies (CUS)''' is a new field examining the role of [[higher education]] in contemporary society and its relation to culture, politics, and labor. Arising primarily from [[Cultural Studies]], it takes a [[Critical theory|critical stance]] toward changes to the university since the 1970s, particularly the shift away from a strong [[Public university|public model]] of higher education to a [[neoliberal]] [[privatized]] model. Emerging largely in the United States, which has the most extensive system of higher education, the field has also seen significant work in the United Kingdom, as well as in other countries confronting neoliberalism. Key themes of CUS research are [[corporatization]], academic labor, and [[student debt]], among other issues.

Like those doing research under the banner of [[Critical Legal Studies]] (CLS), scholars of Critical University Studies often have an activist bent.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''[http://www.robertounger.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-critical-legal-studies-movement-another-time-a-greater-task.pdf The Critical Legal Studies Movement]''. New York: Verso, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; CLS and CUS both analyze powerful institutions in order to draw attention to structural inequalities and embedded practices of exploitation and marginalization. In addition, both fields seek to move beyond abstract theorizing, targeting institutional practices and making proposals for policy changes.

In contrast to CLS, which has roots in elite institutions like [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]], CUS largely comes out of public colleges and universities. While CLS has tended to seek remedies in the legal system, CUS has gravitated toward student and labor union movements. Moreover, CUS has emphasized investigative reportage and exposés of current institutional policies and practices alongside academic work. Rather than a uniform group, CUS includes a range of scholars, critics, and activists, among them [[Tenure|tenured professors]], graduate students, and [[Adjunct professors in North America|adjunct instructors]].

== History ==
The term “Critical University Studies” was first defined in print by Jeffrey J. Williams in a 2012 article in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''.&lt;ref name= "Jeff"&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. "[http://www.chronicle.com/article/An-Emerging-Field-Deconstructs/130791 An Emerging Field Deconstructs Academe]." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', February 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaschik, Scott. "[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/01/09/mla-scholars-talk-about-how-their-teaching-focuses-tough-issues-higher-ed Critical University Studies.]" ''Inside Higher Ed'', January 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece, “An Emerging Field Deconstructs Academe,” describes the “new wave of criticism of higher education” that came to the fore in the 1990s and has gained momentum in the ensuing decades. This new work has primarily come from [[Literary Studies|literary]] and cultural critics, as well as those in [[Education Studies|education]], history, [[sociology]], and [[labor studies]].&lt;ref name= "Jeff"/&gt; As Williams notes, criticism of higher education has a strong tradition, and scholars like Heather Steffen have traced CUS's lineage at least to the early 20th century, for example to [[Thorstein Veblen]]’s ''The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men'' (1918) and [[Upton Sinclair]]’s ''The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education'' (1923), which criticize the influence of business principles and [[Gilded Age]] wealth on the emerging university system.&lt;ref&gt;Steffen, Heather. “[https://www.academia.edu/426574/Intellectual_Proletarians_in_the_20th_Century Intellectual Proletarians in the 20th Century.]” ''Chronicle of Higher Education.'' November 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, Thorstein. ''[http://www.elegant-technology.com/resource/HI_LEARN.PDF The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men]''. 1918. Ed. Richard R. Teichgraeber III. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Upton. ''[https://archive.org/details/goosestepstudyof00sinc The Goose-Step: A Study of American Higher Education.] Whitefish: Kessinger, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the 1960s saw a great deal of criticism of social institutions, and much focused on university campuses. [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) started with a strong statement about higher education, and [[anti-war]] and [[civil rights]] protests were a major presence on US campuses. The [[Critical Pedagogy]] movement, inspired by [[Paolo Freire]] and furthered by [[Henry Giroux]] and others, arose from this moment.&lt;ref&gt;Loughead, Tanya. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WXy9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=critical+university+studies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I1dhTaSq6V&amp;sig=Ed4JM6WKR5X2zpM4LelCM5t0nkc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU-oGAnfbVAhWJq1QKHVi3D-I4KBDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=critical%20university%20studies&amp;f=false Critical University: Moving Higher Education Forward]''. Lanham: MD, Lexington Books, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminist movement]] also played a role in criticism of the university during the ‘60s and ‘70s, with activists like [[Adrienne Rich]] calling for “a women-centered university.”&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Adrienne. “Toward a Woman-Centered University.” ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Lies_Secrets_and_Silence_Selected_Pro.html?id=wSm6BwAAQBAJ On Lies, Secrets, and Silence: Selected Prose]'' 1966-1978. New York: Norton, 1979. 125-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] granted universities the right to patent their inventions, thereby encouraging them to conduct research with business aims in mind. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, critics began to address the new direction of higher education, often coming from the graduate student unionization movement.&lt;ref name= "Williams"/&gt; Some met in conferences such as “Reworking/Rethinking the University” at the [[University of Minnesota]] (2008–11), or came out of groups such as Edu-factory, which was inspired by the Italian [[autonomist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://rethinkingtheu.wordpress.com/ Conference – Beneath the University, the Commons]." Reworking/Rethinking the University. November 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Edu-factory Collective, ed. ''[https://libcom.org/files/The%20Edu-factory%20Collection%20-%20Toward%20a%20Global%20Autonomous%20University%20-%20Cognitive%20Labor,%20The%20Production%20of%20Knowledge,%20and%20Exodus%20from%20the%20Education%20Factory.pdf Toward a Global Autonomous University]''. New York, NY: Autonomedia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This first wave of CUS publications addressed the corporatization of higher education, along with the exploitation of academic labor and the rise of student debt. Key texts from this period include Sheila Slaughter and Larry Leslie's ''Academic Capitalism: Politics, Policies, and the Entrepreneurial University'' (1997), [[David F. Noble|David Noble's]] ''Digital Diploma Mills: The Automation of Higher Education'' (2001), Marc Bousquet's “The Waste Product of Graduate Education” (2002) and ''How the University Works: Higher Education and the Low-Wage Nation'' (2008).&lt;ref name= "Ethos"&gt;Walker, Katherine, and Benjamin Mangrum.

''[https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=568d242160614bf7388b4568&amp;assetKey=AS:314904119054338@1452090400464 Steal This University: The Rise of the Corporate University and an Academic Labor Movement]''.

Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, a second wave of CUS scholars have widened the field's scope to address issues including universities’ reliance on proprietorial technology, the dominance of [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial values]], and [[globalization]]. Notable texts in this vein include Newfield's ''The Great Mistake: How We Wrecked Public Universities and How We Can Fix Them'' (2016), [[Benjamin Ginsberg (political scientist)|Benjamin Ginsberg's]] ''The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters'' (2011), Robert Samuels’ ''Why Public Higher Education Should Be Free: How to Decrease Cost and Increase Quality at American Universities'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;Newfield, Christopher.

''Radical Teacher'', Spring 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, after Britain adopted neoliberal policies and raised tuitions from minor fees to major levels, critics such as Stefan Collini, in “Browne’s Gamble” (2010), and Andrew McGettigan, in ''The Great University Gamble: Money, Markets, and the Future of Higher Education'' (2013), focused on the United Kingdom. Meng-Hsuan Chou, Isaac Kamola, and Tamson Pietsch's edited volume ''The Transnational Politics of Higher Education'' (2016) looks at globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Collini, Stefan. “[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n21/stefan-collini/brownes-gamble Browne’s Gamble],” ''London Review of Books'', 32(21): 23-25, 4 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGettigan, Andrew.

London: Routledge, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key themes ==
Although continually responding to new trends in higher education, Critical University Studies has so far concerned itself with several key themes:

* [[Privatization]] and Corporatization: CUS research shows the various ways that public investment in universities has decreased as costs have been shifted to students and their families. As a 2014 report from public policy organization [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] shows, state funding for higher education has progressively decreased since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Hiltonsmith, Robert, and Tamara Draut. "[http://www.demos.org/publication/great-cost-shift-continues-state-higher-education-funding-after-recession The Great Cost Shift Continues: State Higher Education Funding After the Recession]." Demos. March 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, universities appear to be acting more and more like corporations, enhancing managerial administration, cutting full-time faculty labor, and treating students like customers. The result is a higher education system that functions as “a mercantile market rather than a public realm apart from the market,” with those attending reconfigured “as job seekers rather than as citizens” — a dramatic alteration from the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Humanism|humanistic]] university of the postwar US.&lt;ref name ="Williams"&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. “The Need for Critical University Studies,” in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=23SwCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=A+New+Deal+for+the+Humanities:+Liberal+Arts+and+the+Future+of+Public+Higher+Education&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s A New Deal for the Humanities: Liberal Arts and the Future of Public Higher Education]''. Edited by Gordon Hutner and Feisal G. Mohamed. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2016. 145-157.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wage labour|Labor]]: According to the New Faculty Majority, a US-based adjunct advocacy group that formed in 2009, three quarters of college faculty are now off the tenure track, with no access to the job stability that universities historically provided.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newfacultymajority.info/facts-about-adjuncts/ Facts about adjuncts]." New Faculty Majority. January 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this group, over half are adjunct or part-time workers, positions characterized by low wages and lack of [[job security]]. CUS takes issue with this new norm of [[Precarious work|precarious labor]], as well as with the increasing burden on graduate students to take on heavy teaching loads. As such, CUS has organic connections to [[graduate student unionization]] and adjunct labor organization efforts.&lt;ref name= "Jeff" /&gt;
* Student Debt: In 2015, 68% of graduating students in the US left college with some student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Zack. "[https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2017/02/21/student-loan-debt-statistics-2017/#48b00e25daba Student Loan Debt In 2017: A $1.3 Trillion Crisis]." Forbes, February 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a dramatic increase from student debt during previous eras of higher education, a development that CUS attributes to the effects of neoliberal policies on universities. For one thing, higher education now tends to be framed as a private endeavor rather than as a public service, a shift that has resulted in reductions to state funding and subsequent increases in tuition costs.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Michael J. “State Preferences for Higher Education Spending: A Panel Data Analysis, 1977-2001.” ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/What_s_Happening_to_Public_Higher_Educat.html?id=9dFLSnKeKP8C What’s Happening to Public Higher Education? The Shifting Financial Burden]''. Ed. Ronald G. Ehrenberg. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. 3-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, college student loan debt has increased nearly 1000% (while the price of consumer goods has increased only about 250%).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/cost-of-college-degree-increase-12-fold-1120-percent-bloomberg_n_1783700.html Cost Of College Degree In U.S. Has Increased 1,120 Percent In 30 Years, Report Says]." HuffPost. August 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been exacerbated by a shift in policy for [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit institutions]]: Since the late 1990s, they have been able to receive up to 90% of their funding from federal aid, and they now represent around 25% of loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;Shen, Lucinda. "[http://fortune.com/2016/09/29/student-loan-defaults-2/ For-Profit Colleges Account for a Third of All Federal Student Loan Defaults]." Fortune. September 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelchen, Robert. "[https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2017/01/11/how-much-do-for-profit-colleges-rely-on-federal-funds/ How Much Do For-Profit Colleges Rely on Federal Funds?]" Brookings. January 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to raising awareness about the issue of growing student debt, CUS scholars push for policy changes, such as loan forgiveness and debt-free college.&lt;ref name= "JeffW" /&gt;
* Globalization: American universities are increasingly being exported to locations around the globe through the opening of [[Satellite campus|satellite and affiliate campuses]]. This practice—exemplified by schools like [[New York University]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and [[Duke University]]—often seems to be profit-driven rather than beneficent, with universities receiving large sums of money from local governments in exchange for the presence of the school's brand. For many scholars, the so-called “global university” is merely a perpetuation of Western [[hegemony]].&lt;ref name= "Globe" /&gt;
* [[Innovation]] and Entrepreneurship: A new wave of CUS research has drawn attention to the increasing emphasis that universities place on values of innovation and entrepreneurship. While this focus may seem harmless or even beneficial to students, CUS scholars point out the damaging effects of structuring student's college experience around these buzzwords. Both terms reflect the infiltration of a business mindset into academics, with “innovation” often entailing the mechanization of teaching and a subsequent increase in inequality among student populations.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. "[https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/innovation-for-what-the-politics-of-inequality-in-higher-education Innovation for What? The Politics of Inequality in Higher Education.]" ''Dissent'', Winter 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, entrepreneurship encourages students to adopt a corporate work ethos, with science and tech companies—and increasingly Silicon Valley billionaires—reaping the benefits of student labor.&lt;ref&gt;Wiscomb, Avery J. "[http://www.chronicle.com/article/Hyperserfs/239433 Hyperserfs: How Silicon Valley Exploits Students and Their Universities.]" ''The Chronicle for Higher Education'', March 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Critical University Studies research has contributed to student and faculty movements across US campuses, including the aforementioned New Faculty Majority, the graduate student union movement, Oregon's CORE faculty-student advocacy group, and the [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] Student Debt Campaign (on which cultural critic [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]] has worked).&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Andrew. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G0LzAgAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Creditocracy and the Case for Debt Refusal]''. New York: OR Books, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrina, Stephen. "[http://ices.library.ubc.ca/index.php/workplace/article/view/184777/184351. Critical University Studies: Workplace, Milestones, Crossroads, Respect, Truth]." Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor 23 (2014): 62-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

CUS scholars often publish outside of traditional academic outlets, through blogs like Michael Meranze and Christopher Newfield's Remaking the University, as well as through contributions to new media like [[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]], the [[Los Angeles Review of Books]] (LARB), [[Salon (website)|Salon]] and [[HuffPost]].&lt;ref&gt;Newfield, Christopher, and Michael Meranze. [http://utotherescue.blogspot.com/. Remaking the University].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethos"/&gt; Through such non-traditional outlets, as well as through book publications and academic journal articles, CUS has helped to bring issues like student debt into the mainstream political conversation.&lt;ref name= "Williams"/&gt;

=== Unionization ===

Alongside CUS criticism and activism in the 1990s, U.S. campuses saw a rise in unionization efforts. This culminated in a 2000 decision by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) that graduate employees were protected by the [[National Labor Relations Act]] and could unionize.&lt;ref&gt;United Automobile Workers. "[https://uaw.org/uaw-graduate-workers-harvard-reach-historic-union-election-agreement/ UAW Graduate Workers and Harvard Reach Historic Union Election Agreement.]" News release, October 18, 2016. UAW.&lt;/ref&gt; Union efforts proliferated following this decision, with organizations like the [[United Automobile Workers]] (UAW) and the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU) allying with graduate students and adjunct instructors in the fight for employee status and collective bargaining rights. Despite setbacks, including a 2004 reversal of the 2000 ruling, student and adjunct unions have made significant headway. In August 2016, the NLRB reversed itself again, ruling that graduate research and teaching assistants at private universities do have the right to unionize (UAW vs. Columbia).&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, Richard."[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/23/491090762/nlrb-rules-graduate-students-are-employees-with-the-right-to-unionize NLRB Rules Graduate Students Are Employees With The Right To Unionize]." NPR, August 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
The journal ''Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor'', co-founded by Bousquet, stemmed from early efforts in the field and continues to publish open-access issues around themes of academic labor and higher education activism.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ices.library.ubc.ca/index.php/workplace/index Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 2015 saw the formation of ''Academic Labor: Research and Artistry'', a journal devoted to issues of tenure and contingency in the university.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://journals.colostate.edu/labor Academic Labor: Research and Artistry]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In book publishing, The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] initiated a book series on Critical University Studies, edited by Jeffrey J. Williams and Christopher Newfield, and In the UK, [[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]] also launched a series on CUS, edited by John Smyth.&lt;ref&gt;The Johns Hopkins University Press. "[http://ihum.innovate.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.engl.d7_ih/files/sitefiles/CUS%20Announcement.pdf Critical University Studies]." News release, January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.palgrave.com/gb/series/14707 Palgrave Critical University Studies]." Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the whole, the stance of CUS against the status quo of US universities puts it at odds with individuals and administrators who are in favor of the continued privatization, corporatization, and globalization of the university.

Scholars like Williams, Steffen, and others continue to call for the incorporation of CUS into the undergraduate curriculum, encouraging students to think critically about the institutions in which they find themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. “[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/229021 Teach the University!]” ''Pedagogy'' (8)1: 25-42, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, Robert. "[https://radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/radicalteacher/article/view/382/287 Introduction: Teaching Critical University Studies]." ''Radical Teacher'', Spring 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, event schemata are described by pre- and post condition for a single or a set of [[data item]]s. In contrast to ECA ([[Event condition action]]), which considers an event to be a signal, the data event not only refers to the change (signal), but describes specific state transitions, which are referred to in ECA as conditions.

Considering data events as relevant [[data item]] state transitions allows defining complex event-reaction schemata for a database. Defining data event schemata for [[relational database]]s is limited to attribute and instance events. [[Object-oriented database]]s also support collection properties, which allows defining changes in collections as data events, too.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14022">In [[systems engineering]], '''dependability''' is a measure of a system's '''availability''', '''reliability''', and its '''maintainability''', and '''maintenance support performance''', and, in some cases, other characteristics such as '''durability''', '''safety''' and '''security'''.&lt;ref&gt; IEC, ''Electropedia del 192 Dependability'', http://www.electropedia.org, select 192 Dependability, see 192-01-22 Dependability.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[software engineering]], '''dependability''' is the ability to provide services that can defensibly be trusted within a time-period.&lt;ref&gt;R. Kumar, S. A. Khan and R. A. Khan, Revisiting Software Security: Durability Perspective, International Journal of Hybrid Information Technology (SERSC) Vol.8, No.2 pp.311-322, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This may also encompass mechanisms designed to increase and maintain the dependability of a system or software.&lt;ref name="A. Avizienis, J pp. 11-33"&gt;A. Avizienis, J.-C. Laprie, [[Brian Randell]], and C. Landwehr, "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?&amp;arnumber=1335465 Basic Concepts and Taxonomy of Dependable and Secure Computing]," IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, vol. 1, pp. 11-33, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), via its Technical Committee [[International Electrotechnical Commission#External links|TC 56]] develops and maintains international standards that provide systematic methods and tools for dependability assessment and management of equipment, services, and systems throughout their life cycles.

Dependability can be broken down into three elements:
* '''Attributes''' - A way to assess the dependability of a system
* '''Threats''' - An understanding of the things that can affect the dependability of a system
* '''Means''' - Ways to increase a system's dependability 

== History ==
Some sources hold that word was coined in the nineteen-teens in Dodge Brothers automobile print advertising. But the word predates that period, with the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] finding its first use in 1901.

As interest in fault tolerance and system reliability increased in the 1960s and 1970s, dependability came to be a measure of [x] as measures of [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] came to encompass additional measures like safety and integrity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Randell]], "Software Dependability: A Personal View", in the Proc of the 25th International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing (FTCS-25), California, USA, pp 35-41, June 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, Jean-Claude Laprie thus chose ''dependability'' as the term to encompass studies of fault tolerance and system reliability without the extension of meaning inherent in ''reliability''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;J.C. Laprie. "Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance: Concepts and terminology," in Proc. 15th IEEE Int. Symp. on Fault-Tolerant Computing, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of dependability has evolved from these beginnings to be an internationally active field of research fostered by a number of prominent international conferences, notably the [[International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks]], the [[SRDS|International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems]] and the [[ISSRE|International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering]].

Traditionally, dependability for a system incorporates [[availability]], [[reliability engineering|reliability]], [[maintainability]] but since the 1980s, [[safety]] and [[security]] have been added to measures of dependability.&lt;ref&gt;A. Avizienis, J.-C. Laprie and [[Brian Randell]]: ''[http://www.cert.org/research/isw/isw2000/papers/56.pdf Fundamental Concepts of Dependability]''. Research Report No 1145, [[Laboratory_for_Analysis_and_Architecture_of_Systems|LAAS-CNRS]], April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements of dependability ==
=== Attributes ===

[[Image:dep-1.svg|thumb|Taxonomy showing relationship between Dependability &amp; Security and Attributes, Threats and Means (after Laprie et al.)]]

Attributes are qualities of a system. These can be assessed to determine its overall dependability using [[qualitative data|Qualitative]] or [[quantitative property|Quantitative]] measures. Avizienis et al. define the following Dependability Attributes:

* [[Availability]] - readiness for correct service
* [[Reliability engineering|Reliability]] - continuity of correct service
* [[Safety]] - absence of catastrophic consequences on the user(s) and the environment
* [[Integrity]] -  absence of improper system alteration
* [[Maintainability]] -  ability for a process to undergo modifications and repairs

As these definitions suggested, only Availability and Reliability  are quantifiable by direct measurements whilst others are more subjective. For instance Safety cannot be measured directly via metrics but is a subjective assessment that requires judgmental information to be applied to give a level of confidence, whilst Reliability can be measured as failures over time.

[[Confidentiality]], i.e. ''the absence of unauthorized disclosure of information'' is also used when addressing security. Security is a composite of [[Confidentiality]], [[Integrity]], and [[Availability]]. Security is sometimes classed as an attribute &lt;ref&gt;I. Sommerville, Software Engineering: Addison-Wesley, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; but the current view is to aggregate it together with dependability and treat Dependability as a composite term called Dependability and Security.&lt;ref name="A. Avizienis, J pp. 11-33" /&gt;

Practically, applying security measures to the appliances of a system generally improves the dependability by limiting the number of externally originated errors.

=== Threats ===

Threats are things that can affect a system and cause a drop in Dependability. There are three main terms that must be clearly understood: 

* Fault: A fault (which is usually referred to as a bug for historic reasons) is a defect in a system. The presence of a fault in a system may or may not lead to a failure. For instance, although a system may contain a fault, its input and state conditions may never cause this fault to be executed so that an error occurs; and thus that particular fault never exhibits as a failure.
* Error: An error is a discrepancy between the intended behaviour of a system and its actual behaviour inside the system boundary. Errors occur at runtime when some part of the system enters an unexpected state due to the activation of a fault. Since errors are generated from invalid states they are hard to observe without special mechanisms, such as debuggers or debug output to logs.
* Failure:  A failure is an instance in time when a system displays behaviour that is contrary to its specification. An error may not necessarily cause a failure, for instance an exception may be thrown by a system but this may be caught and handled using fault tolerance techniques so the overall operation of the system will conform to the specification.

It is important to note that Failures are recorded at the system boundary. They are basically Errors that have propagated to the system boundary and have become observable.
Faults, Errors and Failures operate according to a mechanism. This mechanism is sometimes known as a Fault-Error-Failure chain.&lt;ref&gt;A. Avizienis, V. Magnus U, J. C. Laprie, and [[Brian Randell]], "Fundamental Concepts of Dependability," presented at ISW-2000, Cambridge, MA, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule a fault, when activated, can lead to an error (which is an invalid state) and the invalid state generated by an error may lead to another error or a failure (which is an observable deviation from the specified behaviour at the system boundary).

Once a fault is activated an error is created. An error may act in the same way as a fault in that it can create further error conditions, therefore an error may propagate multiple times within a system boundary without causing an observable failure. If an error propagates outside the system boundary a failure is said to occur. A failure is basically the point at which it can be said that a service is failing to meet its specification. Since the output data from one service may be fed into another, a failure in one service may propagate into another service as a fault so a chain can be formed of the form: Fault leading to Error leading to Failure leading to Error, etc.

=== Means ===

Since the mechanism of a Fault-Error-Chain is understood it is possible to construct means to break these chains and thereby increase the dependability of a system.
Four means have been identified so far:
# Prevention
# Removal
# Forecasting
# Tolerance

Fault Prevention deals with preventing faults being incorporated into a system. This can be accomplished by use of development methodologies and good implementation techniques.

Fault Removal can be sub-divided into two sub-categories: Removal During Development and Removal During Use.&lt;br&gt;
Removal during development requires verification so that faults can be detected and removed before a system is put into production. Once systems have been put into production a system is needed to record failures and remove them via a maintenance cycle.

Fault Forecasting predicts likely faults so that they can be removed or their effects can be circumvented.

[[Fault Tolerance]] deals with putting mechanisms in place that will allow a system to still deliver the required service in the presence of faults, although that service may be at a degraded level.

Dependability means are intended to reduce the number of failures presented to the user of a system. Failures are traditionally recorded over time and it is useful to understand how their frequency is measured so that the effectiveness of means can be assessed.11

== Dependability of information systems and survivability ==

Recent works, such &lt;ref&gt;John C. Knight, Elisabeth A. Strunk, Kevin J. Sullivan: ''[http://www.cs.virginia.edu/papers/discex.2003.pdf Towards a Rigorous Definition of Information System Survivability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029012406/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/papers/discex.2003.pdf |date=2006-10-29 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; upon dependability take benefit of structured '''[[information system]]s''', e.g. with [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]], to introduce a more efficient ability, the '''[[survivability]]''', thus taking into account the degraded services that an Information System sustains or resumes after a non-maskable failure.

The flexibility of current frameworks encourage system architects to enable reconfiguration mechanisms that refocus the available, safe resources to support the most critical services rather than over-provisioning to build failure-proof system.

With the generalisation of networked information systems, '''[[accessibility]]''' was introduced to give greater importance to users' experience.

To take into account the level of performance, the measurement of '''[[performability]]''' is defined as "quantifying how well the object system performs in the presence of faults over a specified period of time".&lt;ref&gt;John F. Meyer, William H. Sanders ''[http://web.eecs.umich.edu/people/jfm/PMCCS-2.pdf Specification and construction of performability models]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drexler-Smalley cover.jpg|thumb|The debate between [[K. Eric Drexler]] and [[Richard Smalley]] on the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s began in 2001 and concluded in a cover story in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in 2003.]]

The '''Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology''' was a public dispute between [[K. Eric Drexler]], the originator of the conceptual basis of [[molecular nanotechnology]], and [[Richard Smalley]], a recipient of the 1996 [[Nobel prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of the [[nanomaterial]] [[buckminsterfullerene]]. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing [[molecular assembler]]s, which are [[molecular machine]]s which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.

The debate was carried out from 2001 to 2003 through a series of published articles and [[open letter]]s. It began with a 2001 article by Smalley in ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was followed by a [[Counterargument|rebuttal]] published by Drexler and coworkers later that year, and two open letters by Drexler in early 2003. The debate was concluded in late 2003 in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in which both parties participated.

The debate has been often cited in the [[history of nanotechnology]] due to the fame of its participants and its commentary on both the technical and social aspects of [[nanotechnology]]. It has also been widely criticized for its adversarial tone, with Drexler accusing Smalley of publicly misrepresenting his work, and Smalley accusing Drexler of failing to understand basic science, causing commentators to go so far as to characterize the tone of the debate as similar to "a [[pissing contest|pissing match]]"&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"&gt;{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Steven A.  |title=The Nanotech Pioneers: Where Are They Taking Us?  |location=Weinheim |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2006 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "reminiscent of [a] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch".&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=Yes, They Can!

==The participants==

===K. Eric Drexler===
[[File:Eric Drexler 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|K. Eric Drexler developed and popularized the concept of nanotechnology and founded the field of [[molecular nanotechnology]].]]

{{main|K. Eric Drexler}}

K. Eric Drexler is generally considered to have written the first scholarly paper on the topic of nanotechnology,&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pelesko |first=John A. |title=Self-assembly: the science of things that put themselves together |year=2007 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=New York |isbn=978-1-58488-687-7 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a key figure in popularizing these concepts through several publications and advocacy work.&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toumey|first=Christopher|title=Reading Feynman into nanotechnology: a text for a new science|journal=Techné|date=Fall 2008|volume=12|issue=3|page=133–168|doi=10.5840/techne20081231|url=http://litsciarts.org/slsa08/slsa08-650.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trained as an engineer, Drexler was inspired by a then-obscure 1959 talk by physicist [[Richard Feynman]] called ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]'', which posited that it should be physically possible to manipulate individual atoms using [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] engineering methodologies. Drexler was also inspired by recent advances in [[molecular biology]] such as [[recombinant DNA]] technology. In a 1981 publication in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', considered to be the first journal article on nanotechnology, he argued that biological systems such as the [[ribosome]] were already capable of building molecules atom-by-atom, and that artificial machines with this capability could also be constructed. Drexler went on to publish two books on nanotechnology: ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' in 1986, which was intended for the public, and the technical work ''Nanosystems'' in 1992. He also co-founded the [[Foresight Institute]], a public interest group devoted to increasing public awareness and information about molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"&gt;Edwards, pp. 15–21, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexler's vision of nanotechnology, now called [[molecular nanotechnology]], is based on the concept of the [[molecular assembler]], a [[molecular machine]] which would manufacture molecules and molecular devices atom-by-atom. Drexler drew a distinction between [[wet nanotechnology]] based on biological systems, and "second-generation" dry nanotechnology which would be based on [[mechanosynthesis]], positional control of molecules through principles more related to [[mechanical engineering]]. Drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on the latter form of molecular nanotechnology, but Drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"/&gt;

===Richard Smalley===
[[File:Richard Smalley.jpg|thumb|250px|Richard Smalley won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with [[Harry Kroto]] and [[Robert Curl]] for their 1985 discovery of [[buckminsterfullerene]].]]

{{main|Richard Smalley}}

Richard E. Smalley, a chemist at [[Rice University]], was best known as a co-discoverer of the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; [[Allotropes of carbon|form of carbon]] known as [[buckminsterfullerene]] in 1985, along with [[Harry Kroto]], [[Robert Curl]], [[James R. Heath|James Heath]], and [[Sean O'Brien (scientist)|Sean O'Brien]]. Buckminsterfullerene was the first to be discovered of the class of molecules known as [[fullerenes]], which also includes [[carbon nanotube]]s. The study and application of fullerenes forms a significant part of the fields of [[nanomaterials]] and [[nanoelectronics]], and Smalley, Kroto, and Curl were awarded the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 27, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley had also taken a prominent [[public policy]] role in relation to nanotechnology, and was an outspoken advocate for using nanotechnology to develop solutions to the world's energy and health problems, for example raising the possibility of [[Energy applications of nanotechnology|using nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and transmission]], and of developing [[Nanomedicine|nanomaterial-based drugs]] for [[targeted drug delivery]]. Smalley was also active in commercializing his academic research into carbon nanotubes, having founded Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc., and serving on the scientific advisory board of two other biotechnology and nanotechnology [[Startup company|startups]]. Smalley died of [[leukemia]] in October 2005, after the conclusion of his debate with Drexler.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 132, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berube"/&gt;

==The debate==

===Smalley's ''Scientific American'' article===
[[File:Drexler-Smalley SciAm cover.png|thumb|Smalley's 2001 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article doubting the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s led to a rebuttal by Drexler and his colleagues.]]

Smalley wrote an article, "Of Chemistry, Love, and Nanobots", for the September 2001 issue of the [[popular science]] magazine ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was a special issue on the topic of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley |pmid=11524973| volume=285| issue=3| pages=76–7| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0901-76| bibcode=2001SciAm.285c..76S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smalley opened by comparing a chemical reaction to an intricate dance of atoms:

{{Quote|When a boy and a girl fall in love, it is often said that the chemistry between them is good. This common use of the word "chemistry" in human relations comes close to the subtlety of what actually happens in the more mundane coupling of molecules. In a chemical reaction between two 'consenting' molecules, bonds form between some of the atoms in what is usually a complex dance involving motion in multiple dimensions.... And if the chemistry is really, really good, the molecules that do react will all produce the exact product required.}}

He referenced the idea of a [[molecular assembler]], a [[nanorobot]] capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of how long it would take such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one [[Mole (chemistry)|mole]] of material, but [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating]] assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a [[grey goo]] scenario, or, referring to [[Bill Joy]]'s previous article "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]", that the nanorobots could develop [[swarm intelligence]] and become alive in some sense.

Smalley then considered how realistic the concept of a self-replicating nanorobot was. He noted that in a chemical reaction, the [[chemical bond]]s are all interconnected and that the placement of each atom is sensitive to the position of all the other atoms in the vicinity. He then asserted that a molecular assembler would thus have to control many atoms simultaneously in order to work, and would thus have to have many manipulator arms. This led him to raise two objections to the concept of molecular assembler, which he called the "fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem":

{{Quote|Because the fingers of a manipulator arm must themselves be made out of atoms, they have a certain irreducible size. There just isn't enough room in the nanometer-size reaction region to accommodate all the fingers of all the manipulators necessary to have complete control of the chemistry.... [Also,] the atoms of the manipulator hands will adhere to the atom that is being moved. So it will often be impossible to release this minuscule building block in precisely the right spot. Both these problems are fundamental, and neither can be avoided. Self-replicating, mechanical nanobots are simply not possible in our world.}}

Smalley closed the article by returning to the analogy of chemistry as a dance of love, remarking that "you don't make a girl and a boy fall in love by pushing them together."

===Drexler's response===
{{multiple image|direction=vertical|image1=Peptide syn.png|width1=250|image2=ScanningTunnelingMicroscope schematic.png|width2=250|footer=Top, a schematic of the [[ribosome]], which Drexler advanced as an example of a biological [[molecular machine]] due to its ability to precisely construct [[protein]] macromolecules from smaller [[amino acid]]s.

Bottom, a schematic of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]], which Drexler cited as being able to manipulate individual molecules via [[Mechanosynthesis|positional control]].|alt1=Ribosome schematic|alt2=Scanning tunneling microscope schematic}}

Drexler responded by publishing a rebuttal later in 2001 through the [[Institute for Molecular Manufacturing]], which was co-authored with others including [[Robert Freitas]], [[J. Storrs Hall]], and [[Ralph Merkle]].&lt;ref name="drexlerresponse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=On Physics, Fundamentals, and Nanorobots: A Rebuttal to Smalley’s Assertion that Self-Replicating Mechanical Nanorobots Are Simply Not Possible |publisher=Institute for Molecular Manufacturing |year=2001 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |first1=K. Eric |last1=Drexler |first2=David |last2=Forrest |first3=Robert A. |last3=Freitas |first4=J. Storrs |last4=Hall |first5=Neil |last5=Jacobstein |first6=Tom |last6=McKendree |first7=Ralph |last7=Merkle |first8=Christine |last8=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors first discussed the "fat fingers" argument by attacking Smalley's notion that a chemical reaction must involve five to fifteen atoms, stating that many reactions involve only two reactants, one of which can be immobilized and the other attached to a single "finger". They cited as evidence experimental and theoretical results indicating that using [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) tips and related technologies could be used as a reactive structure for positional control and for interaction with surface-bound molecules. They also noted that atomically precise final products do not require precise control of all aspects of the chemical reaction. The authors noted that the "sticky fingers" problem is valid in some reactions, but argue that it would be fallacious to conclude that all reactions have this problem.

The authors put forth the [[ribosome]] as an example of a natural molecular machine; because the ribosome suffers from neither problem, they must not be fundamental, saying:

{{Quote|This ubiquitous biological molecular assembler suffers from neither the “fat finger” nor the “sticky finger” problem. If, as Smalley argues, both problems are “fundamental,” then why would they prevent the development of mechanical assemblers and not biological assemblers? If the class of molecular structures known as proteins can be synthesized using positional techniques, then why would we expect there to be no other classes of molecular structures that can be synthesized using positional techniques?}}

The authors also questioned Smalley's figures for the replication time of nanomachines. Instead of Smalley's figure of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz for the atomic placement frequency, they point out that ''Nanosystems'' suggested a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, a thousand times slower, and that at Smalley's higher frequency diamondoid nanomachines would overheat and decompose in milliseconds. The authors called this a [[straw man]] argument, writing that "in a serious scientific discussion, a discrepancy of three orders of magnitude between what has been proposed in the literature and what is criticized suggests at best an inadequate grasp of the proposal."  The authors closed by stating that the best way to find out whether molecular assemblers are feasible is through experimental and theoretical work, and that "there are many worthy molecular systems engineering challenges to overcome, but thus far, there has been no credible argument that these devices are infeasible."

Drexler followed up with two open letters to Smalley in April and July 2003. The April letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=An Open Letter on Assemblers|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; began, "I have written this open letter to correct your public misrepresentation of my work."  Drexler accused Smalley of continuing to dismiss his work by publicly describing molecular assemblers as requiring what Drexler now calls "Smalley fingers", which he stated to be unlike the enzyme-like systems he had actually proposed. He asserted:

{{Quote|The impossibility of "Smalley fingers" has raised no concern in the research community because these fingers solve no problems and thus appear in no proposals. Your reliance on this straw-man attack might lead a thoughtful observer to suspect that no one has identified a valid criticism of my work. For this I should, perhaps, thank you.}}

Drexler compared the nanotechnology debate's importance to that of discussions of spaceflight before [[Sputnik]] or to theoretical work on [[nuclear chemistry]] before the [[Manhattan Project]]. He disputed Smalley's arguments that the fear of a grey goo scenario would hinder continued funding of nanotechnology research, arguing that the potential for long-term risks made research even more important. His conclusion stated, "your misdirected arguments have needlessly confused public discussion of genuine long-term security concerns."

The July 2003 letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=Toward closure|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter2.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=2 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; referenced a note from Smalley promising to respond, which had yet gone unfulfilled. Drexler mentions inconsistencies in Smalley's previous public statements on atom-by-atom construction, and ended by stating "I would not ordinarily raise an issue so persistently, but the question of what nanotechnology can ultimately achieve is perhaps the most fundamental issue in the field today—it shapes basic objectives and expectations—and your words have been remarkably effective in changing how this issue is perceived."

===Exchange of letters in ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News''===
[[File:Nanob.jpg|thumb|A depiction of a putative [[technomimetic]] molecular [[planetary gear]] set. Smalley questioned whether devices like these could be constructed using an [[enzyme]]-like mechanical process, either in an [[aqueous solution]] or with some other chemistry, and whether such devices would be operational at all.]]

The debate was concluded in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature that was the 1 December 2003 cover story of ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'', the newsmagazine of the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref name="counterpoint"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers' |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=81 |issue=48 |pages=37–42 |publisher=American Chemical Society |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |doi=10.1021/cen-v081n036.p037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The feature first reproduced Drexler's April 2003 open letter to Smalley. Smalley's response began by apologizing for any offense his September 2001 article had caused, and stating that Drexler's book ''Engines of Creation'' had triggered Smalley's own interest in nanotechnology. He agreed that "Smalley fingers" could not work, and then asserted that the same reasons that would preclude atomic control of reactions would also preclude the manipulation of larger building blocks, since each molecule would have multiple atoms which would need to be controlled

He then agreed that something like an enzyme or ribosome would be capable of precise chemistry, but asked how the nanorobot would be able to obtain, control, and repair such an enzyme, and noted the incompatibility of many reactions with water-based biological systems, stating that "biology is wonderous in the vast diversity of what it can build, but it can't make a crystal of silicon, or steel, or copper, or aluminum, or titanium, or virtually any of the key materials on which modern technology is built." Smalley asked what kind of "nonaqueous enzymelike chemistry" Drexler would envision for his molecular assemblers to operate upon, calling this "a vast area of chemistry that has eluded us for centuries."

Drexler's counterresponse began by returning to Feynman's 1959 talk, stating that "although inspired by biology... Feynman's vision of nanotechnology is fundamentally mechanical, not biological." He characterized the challenges as being that of [[systems engineering]] rather than solely chemistry, and referred Smalley to ''Nanosystems'', with its vision of mechanical control of chemical reactions with no enzymes and no reliance on solvents or thermal motion. He stated:

{{Quote|Positional control naturally avoids most side reactions by preventing unwanted encounters between potential reactants. Transition-state theory indicates that, for suitably chosen reactants, positional control will enable synthetic steps at megahertz frequencies with the reliability of digital switching operations in a computer. The supporting analysis for this conclusion appears in "Nanosystems" and has withstood a decade of scientific scrutiny.}}

Drexler reiterated that these molecular assemblers would require no impossible fingers, and would augment solution-phase chemistry to produce [[macroscopic]] products with precise arrangements of chemical building blocks, using solution-phase molecular assemblers to [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] the construction of more sophisticated assemblers. He concluded by writing:

{{Quote|U.S. progress in molecular manufacturing has been impeded by the dangerous illusion that it is infeasible. I hope you will agree that the actual physical principles of molecular manufacturing are sound and quite unlike the various notions, many widespread in the press, that you have correctly rejected. I invite you to join me and others in the call to augment today's nanoscale research with a systems engineering effort aimed at achieving the grand vision articulated by Richard Feynman.}}

Smalley began his concluding letter:

{{Quote|I see you have now walked out of the room where I had led you to talk about real chemistry, and you are now back in your mechanical world. I am sorry we have ended up like this. For a moment I thought we were making progress. You still do not appear to understand the impact of my short piece in Scientific American. Much like you can't make a boy and a girl fall in love with each other simply by pushing them together, you cannot make precise chemistry occur as desired between two molecular objects with simple mechanical motion along a few degrees of freedom in the assembler-fixed frame of reference. Chemistry, like love, is more subtle than that.}}

Smalley stated his belief that most reactions using mechanosynthesis would simply give the wrong product, and that very few reactions and target molecules would likely be compatible with such an approach. He asserted that any robotic assembler arm would need an enzyme-like tool at its end such would require a liquid medium, and as all known enzymes use water as that medium, the range of products must be limited to the "meat and bone of biology."  He accused Drexler of creating "a pretend world where atoms go where you want because your computer program directs them to go there."

Lastly, Smalley recounted his recent experience reading essays written by middle and high school students after an outreach visit, saying that nearly half of them thought that self-replicating nanorobots were possible and that most were worried about the results of them spreading across the world. Smalley called this a deeply troubling bedside story that he did his best to allay. Smalley concluded his letter:

{{Quote|You and people around you have scared our children. I don't expect you to stop, but I hope others in the chemical community will join with me in turning on the light, and showing our children that, while our future in the real world will be challenging and there are real risks, there will be no such monster as the self-replicating mechanical nanobot of your dreams.}}

==Critical response==
{{multiple image|direction=horizontal|image1=Raymond Kurzweil Fantastic Voyage.jpg|width1=160|image2=Lessig portrait.jpg|width2=150|footer=The Drexler–Smalley debate attracted commentary from figures such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] (left) and [[Lawrence Lessig]] (right).|alt1=Ray Kurzweil in 2005|alt2=Lawrence Lessig in 2009}}

===Tone===
The debate has been widely criticized for its adversarial tone. David Berube in ''Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz'' characterized it as "two people talking over each other... not conducive to reasonable rebuttal," and quoted nanotechnology blogger and journalist Howard Lovy as saying "the tenor of the debate is about personal pride, reputation, and a place in the pantheon."&lt;ref name="berube"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berube |first=David |title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2006 |url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1822/ |pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Zyvex]] founder James von Ehr remarked that "Eric [Drexler] didn't do himself any favors by getting into a [[Pissing contest|pissing match]] with a Nobel-prize winner."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;  An article in ''The New York Times'' called the debate "reminiscent of that old ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch... [with] Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin tossing insults at each other while ostensibly debating a serious political issue," referring to a version of the long-running [[Weekend Update#Jane Curtin (1976–1980)|Weekend Update]] segment.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

===Technical commentary===
The debate has received technical criticism as well. Steven A. Edwards in ''The Nanotech Pioneers'' noted that the ambiguity of the specifications and even definition of a molecular assembler makes an evaluation of the argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications. He remarked that "nowhere in it does ''Nanosystems'' contain a blueprint for a molecular assembler... We are told, for instance, that a manipulator arm would involve 4,000,000 atoms, but we are not told which atoms, or how they would be put together."  He concludes that "the debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to the participants, but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most nanotechnologists."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;

On the other hand, [[futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' declared Drexler as the winner of the debate,&lt;ref name="kurzweil"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-14-303788-9|pages=236&amp;ndash;241}}&lt;/ref&gt; reiterating the view that Smalley distorted Drexler's ideas and calling Smalley's responses "short on specific citations and current research and long on imprecise metaphors" and asserting that "Smalley is ignoring the past decade of research on alternative means of positioning molecular fragments using precisely guided molecular reactions... [which have] been extensively studied."  He quoted experimental results on enzyme function in nonaqueous solutions, and pointed out that modern non-biological technology such as airplanes and computers have exceeded the capabilities of natural biological systems. He also noted that "earlier critics also expressed skepticism that either worldwide communication networks or software viruses that would spread across them were feasible... [but today] we are obtaining far more gain than harm from this latest example of intertwined promise and peril."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-drexler-smalley-debate-on-molecular-assembly&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary on public perception of nanotechnology===
The debate's focus on the public perception of nanotechnology has also received commentary. Political blogger [[Glenn Reynolds]] stated that "the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just seems too, well, spooky—and worse, that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"&gt;Berube, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lawrence Lessig]] criticized the scientific establishment, represented by Smalley, for arguing that "if so-called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci-fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day, then serious work can continue, supported by billion-dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries, for example, stem cell research."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|title=Stamping Out Good Science|date=July 2004|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/view.html?pg=5|accessdate=12 July 2011|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kurzweil wrote that Smalley's approach to reassuring the public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="kurzweil"/&gt;

The institution is part of [[IONIS Education Group]].

== History ==

Epitech was created in 1999, taking advantage of the keen interest of the ''[[École Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avancées]]'' to train students with a specific interest for computer sciences related matter only.

In 2007, Epitech opened new campuses in [[Casablanca]], [[Dalian]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Lille]], [[Lyon]], [[Nantes]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Toulouse]].
Since January 2008, the degree delivered has been recognized by the ''[[Commission nationale de la certification professionnelle]]'',&lt;ref name="arrete"&gt;{{cite web| title=Arrêté du 16 janvier 2008 portant enregistrement au répertoire national des certifications professionnelles | location=France | language=French| url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=FADF1CA86320AE687B52F19AB774F9F8.tpdjo13v_3?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000017981284&amp;categorieLien=id | date=24 January 2008 | accessdate=10 October 2013 | publisher=[Legifrance.gouv.fr] }}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Nomenclature des niveaux de formation|level 1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rncp.cncp.gouv.fr/grand-public/visualisationFiche?format=fr&amp;fiche=5588 Le Répertoire National des Certifications Professionnelles (RNCP) - Résumé descriptif de la certification]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the campuses of [[Nice]], [[Montpellier]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Marseille]] and [[Rennes]] were opened.
Since 2009, the school has been recognized by France.&lt;ref name="legifrance" /&gt;

=== New campuses abroad ===
In early 2013, Epitech announced it would open a campus in [[Beijing]], [[China]] in September 2013 and further international branches in [[California]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Spain]] by September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Le groupe d'enseignement privé Ionis s'ancre à l'international |url=http://www.lemondeinformatique.fr/actualites/lire-le-groupe-d-enseignement-prive-ionis-s-ancre-a-l-international-52506.html |date=15 February 2013 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016|1}}

== Partnership ==
EPITECH has partnered with the ''Zup de Co'' association to create the ''[[Web@cademie]]'', a 2-year training completely free for students without the [[French Baccalaureate]] and with a strong motivation in [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://pro.01net.com/editorial/588287/la-web-academie-accueille-sa-troisieme-promotion-d-eleves-decrocheurs/ La Web Académie accueille sa troisième promotion d’élèves « décrocheurs »]&lt;/ref&gt; This course has the goal to attain a job of [[software developer]] for young people who have stopped their regular studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lemouv.fr/diffusion-une-ecole-unique-en-france-la-web-academie Une école unique en France: la "web académie"]&lt;/ref&gt; They are trained by EPITECH teachers at [[Le Kremlin-Bicêtre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.liberation.fr/societe/0101645556-l-ecole-qui-reconnecte-les-decrocheurs L'école qui reconnecte les décrocheurs]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.digischool.fr/formation/la-webcademie-ouvrira-ses-portes-a-lyon-en-avril-2013-13694.php La Web@cademie ouvrira ses portes à Lyon en avril 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diploma ==
At the end of the five-year course, students receive the title of "Expert of Information Technologies" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.epitech.eu/blogs/diplome-epitech-homologue-niveau1-bac-5-art445.html&lt;/ref&gt; who is recognized by French [[Commission Nationale de la Certification Professionnelle|CNCP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letudiant.fr/etudes/ecole-ingenieur/ma-vie-detudiant-en-ecole-dinformatique-selon-zeid-en-3e-annee-a-epitech-13172/apres-epitech-quelle-insertion-professionnelle-17157.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because the school is not certified by the [[Commission des Titres d'Ingénieur]], this professional certification should not be confused in France with a degree of master (like an engineering diploma or a master diploma of public french universities)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-paris-idf.fr/formation/orientation-jeunes/reussir-son-orientation-professionnelle/comment-savoir-diplome-reconnu-par-etat-ou-entreprises-formation&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''evolution of photosynthesis''' refers to the origin and subsequent evolution of [[photosynthesis]], the process by which light energy synthesizes [[sugar]]s from [[carbon dioxide]], releasing [[oxygen]] as a waste product. The process of photosynthesis was discovered by Jan Ingenhousz, a Dutch-born British physician and scientist, first publishing about it in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jan-Ingenhousz |title=Jan Ingenhousz {{!}} Biography, Experiments, &amp; Facts |work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first photosynthetic organisms probably [[evolution|evolved]] early in the [[evolutionary history of life]] and most likely used [[reducing agent]]s such as [[hydrogen]] or  electrons, rather than water.&lt;ref name="pmid16453059"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Photosynthesis in the Archean era | journal=Photosynthesis Research | volume=88 | issue=2 | pages=109–17 |date=May 2006 | pmid=16453059 | doi=10.1007/s11120-006-9040-5  | last1=Olson | first1=JM}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three major [[metabolic pathway]]s by which photosynthesis is carried out: [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis]], [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis]], and [[CAM photosynthesis]]. C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis is the oldest and most common form. C3 is a plant that uses the calvin cycle for the initial steps that incorporate CO2 into organic material. C4 is a plant that prefaces the calvin cycle with reactions that incorporate CO2 into four-carbon compounds. CAM is a plant that uses crassulacean acid metabolism, an adaptation for photosynthesis in arid conditions. C4 and CAM Plants have special adaptations that save water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cropsreview.com/types-of-photosynthesis.html|title=Types of Photosynthesis: C3, C4 and CAM|work=CropsReview.Com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{Life timeline}}
The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved in a [[Common descent|common ancestor]] of extant [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cardona, T. |author2=Murray, J. W. |author3=Rutherford, A. W. |title=Origin and Evolution of Water Oxidation before the Last Common Ancestor of the Cyanobacteria |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=1310–1328 |date=May 2015 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/5/1310 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msv024 |pmid=25657330 |pmc=4408414}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450–2320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tomitani, Akiko |title=The evolutionary diversification of cyanobacteria: Molecular–phylogenetic and paleontological perspectives |journal=PNAS |volume=103 |issue=14 |pages=5442–5447 |date=April 2006 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/14/5442.abstract |doi=10.1073/pnas.0600999103 |pmid=16569695 |pmc=1459374|bibcode=2006PNAS..103.5442T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanofr.html |title=Cyanobacteria: Fossil Record |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Available evidence from geobiological studies of [[Archean]] (&gt;2500 Ma) [[sedimentary rock]]s indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial [[evolution]] opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of blue-greens. [[Cyanobacteria]] remained principal [[primary producers]] throughout the [[Proterozoic Eon]] (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of [[nitrogen fixation]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Green algae]] joined blue-greens as major primary producers on [[Continental shelf|continental shelves]] near the end of the [[Proterozoic]], but only with the [[Mesozoic]] (251–65 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did [[primary production]] in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to [[marine ecosystem]]s as primary producers in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the [[plastid]]s of marine algae.&lt;ref name=Herrero&gt;{{cite book |author1=Herrero, A. |author2=Flores, E. |title=The Cyanobacteria: Molecular Biology, Genomics and Evolution | edition=1st | publisher=Caister Academic Press | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-904455-15-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early photosynthetic systems, such as those from [[Green sulfur bacteria|green]] and [[Purple sulfur bacteria|purple sulfur]] and [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|green]] and [[purple bacteria|purple nonsulfur bacteria]], are thought to have been anoxygenic, using various molecules as [[electron donor]]s. Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used [[hydrogen]] and [[sulfur]] as an electron donor. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various [[amino acid|amino]] and other [[organic acid]]s. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Fossils of what are thought to be [[Protein filament|filamentous]] photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18424671.600-photosynthesis-got-a-really-early-start.html Photosynthesis got a really early start], New Scientist, 2 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19125654.200-revealing-the-dawn-of-photosynthesis.html Revealing the dawn of photosynthesis], New Scientist, 19 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies, reported in March 2018, also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="ELSVR-20180306"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caredona |first=Tanai |title=Early Archean origin of heterodimeric Photosystem I |url=https://www.heliyon.com/article/e00548 |date=6 March 2018 |work=[[Elsevier]] |doi=10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00548 |accessdate=23 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AST-20180307"&gt;{{cit web |last=Howard |first=Victoria |title=Photosynthesis Originated A Billion Years Earlier Than We Thought, Study Shows |url=https://www.astrobio.net/also-in-news/photosynthesis-originated-billion-years-earlier-thought-study-shows/ |date=7 March 2018 |work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] |accessdate=23 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of [[oxygen]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is [[Oxygen evolution|oxygenic photosynthesis]], and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the [[oxygen catastrophe]]. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in [[cyanobacteria]], became important during the [[Paleoproterozoic]] era around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor, which is [[Redox|oxidized]] to molecular oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}) in the [[photosynthetic reaction center]].

==Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts==
[[File:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|150px|left|Plant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss, ''[[Plagiomnium affine]]'')]]

Several groups of animals have formed [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in [[coral]]s, [[sponge]]s and [[sea anemone]]s. It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple [[body plan]]s and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Venn, A. A.; Loram, J. E.; Douglas, A. E. |title=Photosynthetic symbioses in animals |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=1069–80 |year=2008 |pmid=18267943 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erm328}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a few marine [[Mollusca|mollusk]]s ''[[Elysia viridis]]'' and ''[[Elysia chlorotica]]'' also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies. This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time.&lt;ref name="pmid10806222"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rumpho M. E.; Summer E. J.; Manhart J. R. | title=Solar-powered sea slugs. Mollusc/algal chloroplast symbiosis | journal=Plant Physiology | volume=123 | issue=1 | pages=29–38 |date=May 2000 | pmid=10806222 | pmc=1539252 | doi=10.1104/pp.123.1.29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid4587388"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Muscatine, L. |author2=Greene, R. W. | title=Chloroplasts and algae as symbionts in molluscs | journal=International Review of Cytology | volume=36 | issue=| pages=137–69 | year=1973 | pmid=4587388 | doi=10.1016/S0074-7696(08)60217-X | series=International Review of Cytology | isbn=9780123643360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the genes from the plant [[cell nucleus]] have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins that they need to survive.&lt;ref name="pmid19004808"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rumpho, M. E.; Worful, J. M.; Lee, J.; Kannan, K.; Tyler, M. S.; Bhattacharya, D.; Moustafa, A.; Manhart, J. R. | title=Horizontal gene transfer of the algal nuclear gene psbO to the photosynthetic sea slug Elysia chlorotica | journal=PNAS | volume=105 | issue=46 | pages=17867–71 |date=November 2008 | pmid=19004808 | pmc=2584685 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0804968105 |bibcode=2008PNAS..10517867R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with [[cyanobacteria|photosynthetic bacteria]], including a circular [[chromosome]], prokaryotic-type [[ribosome]]s, and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center.&lt;ref name="pmid9914199"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Douglas, S. E. | title=Plastid evolution: origins, diversity, trends | journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development | volume=8 | issue=6 | pages=655–661 |date=December 1998 | pmid=9914199 | doi=10.1016/S0959-437X(98)80033-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17600460"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reyes-Prieto, A.; Weber, A. P.; Bhattacharya, D. | title=The origin and establishment of the plastid in algae and plants | journal=Annu. Rev. Genet. | volume=41 | issue=| pages=147–68 | year=2007 | pmid=17600460 | doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[endosymbiotic theory]] suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by [[endocytosis]]) by early [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells to form the first [[plant]] cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], chloroplasts still possess their own DNA, separate from the [[nuclear DNA]] of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those in [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name="pmid12620099"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raven J. A.; Allen J. F. | title=Genomics and chloroplast evolution: what did cyanobacteria do for plants? | journal=Genome Biol. | volume=4 | issue=3 | page=209 | year=2003 | pmid=12620099 | pmc=153454 | doi=10.1186/gb-2003-4-3-209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA in chloroplasts codes for [[redox]] proteins such as photosynthetic reaction centers. The [[CoRR Hypothesis]] proposes that this '''Co'''-location is required for '''R'''edox '''R'''egulation.

A 2010 study by researchers at [[Tel Aviv University]] discovered that the [[Oriental hornet]] (''Vespa orientalis'') converts sunlight into electric power using a pigment called [[xanthopterin]]. This is the first scientific evidence of a member of the animal kingdom engaging in photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Plotkin | first1=M. | last2=Hod | first2=I. | last3=Zaban | first3=A. | last4=Boden | first4=S.

==Evolution of photosynthetic pathways==
[[File:HatchSlackpathway2.svg|thumb|300px|The C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; carbon concentrating mechanism]]
Photosynthesis is not quite as simple as adding water to {{co2}} to produce sugars and oxygen. A complex chemical pathway is involved, facilitated along the way by a range of [[enzymes]] and co-enzymes. The [[enzyme]] [[RuBisCO]] is responsible for "fixing" {{co2}}&amp;nbsp;– that is, it attaches it to a carbon-based molecule to form a sugar, which can be used by the plant, releasing an oxygen molecule along the way. However, the enzyme is notoriously inefficient, and just as effectively will also fix oxygen instead of {{co2}} in a process called [[photorespiration]]. This is energetically costly as the plant has to use energy to turn the products of photorespiration back into a form that can react with {{co2}}.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Concentrating carbon===
The [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; metabolic pathway]] is a valuable recent evolutionary innovation in plants, involving a complex set of adaptive changes to [[physiology]] and [[gene expression]] patterns.&lt;ref name="williamsjohnston"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams, B. P.; Johnston, I. G.; Covshoff, S.; Hibberd, J. M. | title=Phenotypic landscape inference reveals multiple evolutionary paths to C₄ photosynthesis | journal=eLife | volume=2 | pages=e00961 |date=September 2013 | doi=10.7554/eLife.00961 | pmid=24082995 | pmc=3786385}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7600 species of plants use {{c4}} carbon fixation, which represents about 3% of all terrestrial species of plants.  All these 7600 species are [[angiosperm]]s.

C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants evolved carbon concentrating mechanisms. These work by increasing the concentration of {{co2}} around RuBisCO, thereby facilitating photosynthesis and decreasing photorespiration. The process of concentrating {{co2}} around RuBisCO requires more energy than allowing gases to [[diffusion|diffuse]], but under certain conditions&amp;nbsp;– i.e. warm temperatures (&gt;25&amp;nbsp;°C), low {{co2}} concentrations, or high oxygen concentrations&amp;nbsp;– pays off in terms of the decreased loss of sugars through photorespiration.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

One type of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; metabolism employs a so-called [[Kranz anatomy]]. This transports {{co2}} through an outer mesophyll layer, via a range of organic molecules, to the central bundle sheath cells, where the {{co2}} is released. In this way, {{co2}} is concentrated near the site of RuBisCO operation. Because RuBisCO is operating in an environment with much more {{co2}} than it otherwise would be, it performs more efficiently.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

A second mechanism, [[CAM photosynthesis]], is a [[carbon fixation]] pathway that evolved in some [[plant]]s as an adaptation to [[arid]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

The stomata open at night to collect {{co2}}, which is stored as the four-carbon acid [[malic acid|malate]], and then used during [[photosynthesis]] during the day.

===Evolutionary record===

These two pathways, with the same effect on RuBisCO, evolved a number of times independently&amp;nbsp;– indeed, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; alone arose 62 times in 18 different plant [[family (biology)|families]].  A number of 'pre-adaptations' seem to have paved the way for C4, leading to its clustering in certain clades: it has most frequently been innovated in plants that already had features such as extensive vascular bundle sheath tissue.&lt;ref name="Christin2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Christin | first1=P. -A. | last2=Osborne | first2=C.

The C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; construction is most famously used by a subset of grasses, while CAM is employed by many succulents and [[cacti]]. The trait appears to have emerged during the [[Oligocene]], around {{Ma|25|32}};&lt;ref name=Osborne2006&gt;{{cite journal | author=Osborne, C. P. |author2=Beerling, D.

Isotopic markers are used to deduce their distribution and significance.

C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants preferentially use the lighter of two [[isotopes]] of carbon in the atmosphere, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, which is more readily involved in the chemical pathways involved in its fixation. Because C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; metabolism involves a further chemical step, this effect is accentuated. Plant material can be [[mass spectrometry|analysed]] to deduce the ratio of the heavier &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C. This ratio is denoted {{delta|13|C}}. C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants are on average around 14‰ (parts per thousand) lighter than the atmospheric ratio, while C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants are about 28‰ lighter. The {{delta|13|C}} of CAM plants depends on the percentage of carbon fixed at night relative to what is fixed in the day, being closer to C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants if they fix most carbon in the day and closer to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants if they fix all their carbon at night.&lt;ref name="isotope"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1310735 |last=O'Leary |first=Marion |date=May 1988 |title=Carbon Isotopes in Photosynthesis |journal=BioScience |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=328–336 |jstor=1310735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is troublesome procuring original fossil material in sufficient quantity to analyse the grass itself, but fortunately there is a good proxy: horses. Horses were globally widespread in the period of interest, and browsed almost exclusively on grasses. There's an old phrase in [[isotope palæontology]], "you are what you eat (plus a little bit)"&amp;nbsp;– this refers to the fact that organisms reflect the isotopic composition of whatever they eat, plus a small adjustment factor. There is a good record of horse teeth throughout the globe, and their {{delta|13|C}} has been measured. The record shows a sharp negative inflection around {{Ma|6|7}}, during the Messinian, and this is interpreted as the rise of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants on a global scale.&lt;ref name=Retallack1997&gt;{{cite journal| first=G.

===When is C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; an advantage?===
While C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; enhances the efficiency of RuBisCO, the concentration of carbon is highly energy intensive. This means that C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants only have an advantage over C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; organisms in certain conditions: namely, high temperatures and low rainfall.

In [[cell biology]], '''focal adhesions''' (also '''cell–matrix adhesions''' or '''FAs''') are large [[macromolecular assemblies]] through which mechanical force and regulatory signals are transmitted between the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) and an interacting cell. More precisely, focal adhesions are the sub-cellular structures that mediate the regulatory effects (i.e., signaling events) of a cell in response to ECM adhesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = CS | last2 = Alonso | first2 = JL | last3 = Ostuni | first3 = E | last4 = Whitesides | first4 = GM | last5 = Ingber | first5 = DE | year = 2003 | title = Cell shape provides global control of focal adhesion assembly | url = | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 307 | issue = 2| pages = 355–61 | doi=10.1016/s0006-291x(03)01165-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focal adhesions serve as the mechanical linkages to the ECM, and as a biochemical signaling hub to concentrate and direct numerous signaling proteins at sites of [[integrin]] binding and clustering.  
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:cellmatadhes.png|thumb|300px|Focal Adhesions are complicated macromolecular assemblies]] --&gt;

==Structure and function==
Focal adhesions are integrin-containing, multi-protein structures that form mechanical links between intracellular actin bundles and the extracellular substrate in many cell types. Focal adhesions are large, dynamic [[protein complexes]] through which the [[cytoskeleton]] of a cell connects to the ECM. They are limited to clearly defined ranges of the cell, at which the plasma membrane closes to within 15&amp;nbsp;nm of the ECM substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zaidel-Bar | first1 = R | last2 = Cohen | first2 = M | last3 = Addadi | first3 = L | last4 = Geiger | first4 = B | year = 2004 | title = Hierarchical assembly of cell matrix adhesion complexes | url = | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 416–20 | doi=10.1042/bst0320416 | pmid=15157150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focal adhesions are in a state of constant flux: proteins associate and disassociate with it continually as signals are transmitted to other parts of the cell, relating to anything from [[cell motility]] to [[cell cycle]]. Focal adhesions can contain over 100 different proteins, which suggests a considerable functional diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zamir | first1 = E | last2 = Geiger | first2 = B | year = 2001 | title = Molecular complexity and dynamics of cell–matrix adhesions | url = | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 114 | issue = 20| pages = 3583–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than anchoring the cell, they function as signal carriers (sensors), which inform the cell about the condition of the ECM and thus affect their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riveline | first1 = D | last2 = Zamir | first2 = E | last3 = Balaban | first3 = NQ | last4 = Schwarz | first4 = US | last5 = Ishizaki | first5 = T | last6 = Narumiya | first6 = S | last7 = Kam | first7 = Z | last8 = Geiger | first8 = B | last9 = Bershadsky | first9 = AD | year = 2001 | title = Focal contacts as mechanosensors: externally applied local mechanical force induces growth of focal contacts by an mDia1-dependent and ROCK-independent mechanism | url = | journal = Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 153 | issue = 6| pages = 1175–86 | doi=10.1083/jcb.153.6.1175 | pmid=11402062 | pmc=2192034}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[wiktionary:sessile|sessile]] cells, focal adhesions are quite stable under normal conditions, while in moving cells their stability is diminished: this is because in motile cells, focal adhesions are being constantly assembled and disassembled as the cell establishes new contacts at the leading edge, and breaks old contacts at the trailing edge of the cell. One example of their important role is in the [[immune system]], in which [[white blood cells]] migrate along the connective [[endothelium]] following cellular signals to damaged [[biological tissue]].

==Morphology==

Connection between focal adhesions and proteins of the [[extracellular matrix]] generally involves [[integrins]]. Integrins bind to extra-cellular proteins via short amino acid sequences, such as the [[RGD motif]] (found in proteins such as [[fibronectin]], [[laminin]], or [[vitronectin]]), or the DGEA and GFOGER motifs found in [[collagen]]. Integrins are [[heterodimers]] which are formed from one beta and one alpha subunit. These subunits are present in different forms, their corresponding ligands classify these receptors into four groups: RGD receptors, laminin receptors, leukocyte-specific receptors and collagen receptors. Within the cell, the intracellular domain of integrin binds to the cytoskeleton via adapter proteins such as [[Talin (protein)|talin]], [[Actinin, alpha 1|α-actinin]], [[filamin]], [[vinculin]] and [[tensin]]. Many other intracellular signalling proteins, such as [[focal adhesion kinase]], bind to and associate with this integrin-adapter protein–cytoskeleton complex, and this forms the basis of a focal adhesion.

==Adhesion dynamics with migrating cells==
The dynamic assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions plays a central role in [[cell migration]]. During cell migration, both the composition and the morphology of the focal adhesion change. Initially, small (0.25μm²) focal adhesions called focal complexes (FXs) are formed at the leading edge of the cell in [[lamellipodia]]: they consist of integrin, and some of the adapter proteins, such as [[talin protein|talin]], [[paxillin]] and [[tensin]]. Many of these focal complexes fail to mature and are disassembled as the lamellipodia withdraw. However, some focal complexes mature into larger and stable focal adhesions, and recruit many more proteins such as [[zyxin]]. Recruitment of components to the focal adhesion occurs in an ordered, sequential manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaidel-Bar|first1=R|last2=Cohen|first2=M|last3=Addadi|first3=L|last4=Geiger|first4=B|title=Hierarchical assembly of cell-matrix adhesion complexes.|journal=Biochemical Society Transactions|date=June 2004|volume=32|issue=Pt3|pages=416–20|pmid=15157150|doi=10.1042/bst0320416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in place, a focal adhesion remains stationary with respect to the extracellular matrix, and the cell uses this as an anchor on which it can push or pull itself over the ECM. As the cell progresses along its chosen path, a given focal adhesion moves closer and closer to the trailing edge of the cell. At the trailing edge of the cell the focal adhesion must be dissolved. The mechanism of this is poorly understood and is probably instigated by a variety of different methods depending on the circumstances of the cell. One possibility is that the calcium-dependent protease [[calpain]] is involved: it has been shown that the inhibition of calpain leads to the inhibition of focal adhesion-ECM separation. Focal adhesion components are amongst the known calpain substrates, and it is possible that calpain degrades these components to aid in focal adhesion disassembly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huttenlocher | first1 = A | last2 = Palecek | first2 = SP | last3 = Lu | first3 = Q | last4 = Zhang | first4 = W | last5 = Mellgren | first5 = RL | last6 = Lauffenburger | first6 = DA | last7 = Ginsberg | first7 = MH | last8 = Horwitz | first8 = AF | year = 1997 | title = Regulation of cell migration by the calcium-dependent protease calpain | url = | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 272 | issue = 52| pages = 32719–22 | doi=10.1074/jbc.272.52.32719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actin retrograde flow===
The assembly of nascent focal adhesions is highly dependent on the process of retrograde actin flow. This is the phenomenon in a migrating cell where actin filaments polymerize at the leading edge and flow back towards the cell body. This is the source of traction required for migration; the focal adhesion acts as a molecular clutch when it tethers to the ECM and impedes the retrograde movement of actin, thus generating the pulling (traction) force at the site of the adhesion that is necessary for the cell to move forward. This traction can be visualized with [[traction force microscopy]]. A common metaphor to explain actin retrograde flow is a large number of people being washed downriver, and as they do so, some of them hang on to rocks and branches along the bank to stop their downriver motion. Thus, a pulling force is generated onto the rock or branch that they are hanging on to.

===Natural biomechanical sensor===
Extracellular mechanical forces, which are exerted through focal adhesions, can activate [[Src kinase]] and stimulate the growth of the adhesions. As well as, intracellular force generated by actomyosin contractility is sensed by focal adhesion via adhesion proteins such as talin and vinculin &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Abhishek|last2=Ouyang|first2=Mingxing|last3=Dries|first3=Koen Van den|last4=McGhee|first4=Ewan James|last5=Tanaka|first5=Keiichiro|last6=Anderson|first6=Marie D.|last7=Groisman|first7=Alexander|last8=Goult|first8=Benjamin T.|last9=Anderson|first9=Kurt I.|date=2016-05-09|title=Talin tension sensor reveals novel features of focal adhesion force transmission and mechanosensitivity|url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/213/3/371|journal=J Cell Biol|language=en|volume=213|issue=3|pages=371–383|doi=10.1083/jcb.201510012|issn=0021-9525|pmid=27161398|pmc=4862330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grashoff|first=Carsten|last2=Hoffman|first2=Brenton D.|last3=Brenner|first3=Michael D.|last4=Zhou|first4=Ruobo|last5=Parsons|first5=Maddy|last6=Yang|first6=Michael T.|last7=McLean|first7=Mark A.|last8=Sligar|first8=Stephen G.|last9=Chen|first9=Christopher S.|date=2010-07-08|title=Measuring mechanical tension across vinculin reveals regulation of focal adhesion dynamics|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature09198|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=466|issue=7303|pages=263–266|doi=10.1038/nature09198|issn=1476-4687|pmc=2901888}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Decreasing actomyosin contractility, using the drug blebbistatin, leads to a decrease in talin tension as well as focal adhesion size &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This indicates that focal adhesions may function as mechanical sensors, and suggests that force generated from [[myosin]] fibers could contribute to maturing the focal complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Y | last2 = Botvinick | first2 = EL | last3 = Zhao | first3 = Y | last4 = Berns | first4 = MW | last5 = Usami | first5 = S | last6 = Tsien | first6 = RY | last7 = Chien | first7 = S | year = 2005 | title = Visualizing the mechanical activation of Src | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7036| pages = 1040–5 | doi=10.1038/nature03469 | pmid=15846350}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This gains further support from the fact that inhibition of myosin-generated forces leads to slow disassembly of focal adhesions, by changing the turnover kinetics of the focal adhesion proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolfenson | first1 = H. | last2 = Bershadsky | first2 = A. | last3 = Henis | first3 = Y. I. | last4 = Geiger | first4 = B. | year = 2011 | title = Actomyosin-generated tension controls the molecular kinetics of focal adhesions | url = | journal = J Cell Sci | volume = 124 | issue = 9| pages = 1425–32 | doi=10.1242/jcs.077388| pmc = 3078811 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between forces on focal adhesions and their compositional maturation, however, remains unclear. For instance, preventing focal adhesion maturation by inhibiting myosin activity or stress fiber assembly does not prevent forces sustained by focal adhesions, nor does it prevent cells from migrating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nascent Focal Adhesions Are Responsible for the Generation of Strong Propulsive Forces in Migrating Fibroblasts|url = http://jcb.rupress.org/content/153/4/881|journal = The Journal of Cell Biology|date = 2001-05-14|issn = 0021-9525|pmid = 11352946|pages = 881–888|volume = 153|issue = 4|doi = 10.1083/jcb.153.4.881|first = Karen A.|last = Beningo|first2 = Micah|last2 = Dembo|first3 = Irina|last3 = Kaverina|first4 = J.

Their role in mechanosensing is important for [[durotaxis]].

The '''frailty index (FI)''' is used to measure the health status of older individuals - as a proxy measure of [[Ageing|aging]] and vulnerability to poor outcomes. This measure was developed by Dr. Kenneth Rockwood and Dr. Arnold Mitnitski at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

It is defined as the proportion of deficits present in an individual out of the total number of age-related health variables considered. A frailty index can be created in most secondary data sources related to health by utilizing health deficits that are routinely collected in health assessments. These deficits include [[diseases]], signs, symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, cognitive impairments, and disabilities in activities of daily living.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Biomedcentral.com_August_20_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2318/14/25 |title=BMC Geriatrics |newspaper=Biomedcentral.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Frailty Index (FI) =  (number  of health deficits present) ÷ (number of health deficits measured)''

For example, a person with 20 of 40 deficits collected has an FI score of 20/40 = 0.5; whilst for someone with 10 deficits, the FI score is 10/40 = 0.25. The FI takes advantage of the high redundancy in the human organism. This is why it is replicable across different databases even when different items and different numbers of items are used. The standard procedure for creating a frailty index are found in an open-access publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Searle|first=Samuel D|last2=Mitnitski|first2=Arnold|last3=Gahbauer|first3=Evelyne A|last4=Gill|first4=Thomas M|last5=Rockwood|first5=Kenneth|date=2008-09-30|title=A standard procedure for creating a frailty index|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2318/8/24|journal=BMC Geriatrics|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1471-2318-8-24|pmc=2573877|pmid=18826625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several frailty indices, including a clinical deficits frailty index (FI-CD) and a biomarker-based frailty index (FI-B).&lt;ref name="MyUser2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/13/161 |title=BMC Medicine |newspaper=Biomedcentral.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender Through Comic Books''' (also known as #SuperMOOC because of its popular [[hash tag]] on Twitter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SuperMOOC&amp;src=typd |title=Twitter / Search - #SuperMOOC |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[MOOC]] taught April 2, 2013 through May 18, 2013.

More than 7,000 students enrolled in the April 2013 Gender Through Comic Books course taught by Christina Blanch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/christina-blanch/48/61/982 |title=Christina Blanch |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Ball State University]] on the Canvas platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canvas.net/courses/gender-through-comic-books |accessdate=May 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423235716/https://www.canvas.net/courses/gender-through-comic-books |archivedate=April 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanch, an anthropologist, thought that "using comic books could be a way to approach teaching gender without the trepidation some students feel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knox |first=Kelly |url=https://www.wired.com/geekmom/2013/01/gender-through-comics/ |title=New Online Course Explores Gender Through Comic Books &amp;#124; GeekMom |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when approaching the subject. Students read scholarly articles each week in addition to comics (offered as e-comics by [[Comixology]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comixology.com/mooc&lt;/ref&gt; plus participated in live interviews with comic book creators with questions submitted via Twitter. There has been some controversy over issues of gender and patriarchy related to MOOCS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historiann.com/2013/05/15/guest-post-on-the-lords-of-mooc-creation-whos-really-for-change-and-who-in-fact-is-standing-athwart-history-yelling-stop/ |title=Guest post on the Lords of MOOC Creation: who’s really for change, and who in fact is standing athwart history yelling STOP? : Historiann : History and sexual politics, 1492 to the present |publisher=Historiann |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blanch's class served to break through barriers related to gender, the comics medium, and pedagogy.

The course was divided into six week-long modules and covered the topics of: ''What is gender?'', ''Gender and Culture: How we learn our gender'', ''Who is producing comic book culture?'', ''Femininity'', ''Masculinity'', and ''Gendered Spaces and Consuming Comics''.&lt;ref&gt;https://learn.canvas.net/courses/23/files/21549/download?verifier=FpgcVPH5Lh0uzjpHRImwtJL4Wdun9WMJrglnCxbt&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant to the course content were the interviews with prominent comic book creators: [[Terry Moore (comics)|Terry Moore]] author of ''[[Strangers in Paradise]]''; [[Mark Waid]], writer for ''[[Superman]]''; [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]], [[Steve Wacker]], and [[Sana Amanant]], creators of the new [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]; [[Gail Simone]] author of [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]; [[Scott Snyder]] author of [[Swamp Thing]]; and [[Brian K. Vaughn]] author of [[Y: The Last Man]]. Students could put questions forth in the discussion boards for the class, or use a Twitter hashtag to tweet questions during the interviews.

== Week One: What is gender? ==
Week one was an introduction into what gender is, and how gender differs from sex. Readings for this week included Strangers in Paradise, volumes 1 and 2, and the first issue of Rachel Rising, all by writer/artist Terry Moore. The week's interview was with Moore, as well. Additional reading for the introduction to gender was the article "Night to His Day": The Social Construction of Gender by Judith Lorber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tannerhiggin.com/summer11eng1c/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/social_constructions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Week Two: Gender and Culture: How we learn our gender ==
Week two discussed how gender is learned. Blanch interviewed Mark Waid, and the comic book selections were Action Comics #1 (the first appearance of Superman) and #267, and Waid's Birthright series. Additionally, the article "Doing Gender" by Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.lib.umn.edu/clar0514/academic/west%20and%20zimmerman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was assigned.

== Week Three: Who is producing comic book culture? ==
Week three dealt with comic books as a medium of communication. The interview included Kelly Sue DeConnick, Sana Ammant and Steve Wacker and their roles as writers and editors. The assigned comics were Captain Marvel #1-7, Ms. Marvel #1, vol. 1, Ms. Marvel #1, vol. 2, and Daredevil #1. The article "How Comic Books are Made from Idea to Print"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=laichas |url=http://www.impact-books.com/comics/how-comic-books-are-made-from-idea-to-print |title=How Comic Books are Made from Idea to Print |publisher=IMPACT Books |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the supplemental reading.

== Week Four: Femininity ==
Week four discussed femininity, and the readings included Secret Six (vol. 2) 1-7, Wonder Woman #1, Wonder Woman (New 52) #7, Birds of Prey #56, and Batgirl #0. The interview was with Gail Simone. (Due to technical difficulties, this was a recorded interview, not live as the others were.) The article "Spice World: Constructing Femininity the Popular Way" by Dafna Lemish&lt;ref&gt;http://users.ipfw.edu/tankel/syllabi/spring%202005/com%20507/spicegirls.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was also assigned.

== Week Five: Masculinity ==
Week five discussed masculinity, and the comics assigned were both from the New 52: Batman #0 and Swamp Thing #0. The interview was with Scott Snyder. Additional reading was "Comic Book Masculinity and the New Black Superhero" by Jeffrey A. Brown&lt;ref&gt;http://lmc.gatech.edu/~hcarroll/courses/e1102-sp04/e1102-scans/secondary-sources/brown.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Week Six: Gendered Spaces and Consuming Comics ==
The final week discussed how different spaces can be gendered, and differences in how comics are consumed. The readings were from Y: The Last Man (#1-6) and Saga #1, and the interview was with Brian K. Vaughan. The article "Gendered Spaces: Gym Culture and the Construction of Gender" by Thomas Johansson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://logic.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk/~b114299/young/1996-3/artikkelJohansson3-96.htm |title=T Johansson/JA |publisher=Logic.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102191747/http://logic.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk/~b114299/young/1996-3/artikkelJohansson3-96.htm |archivedate=January 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was also assigned.

The student interaction in the message boards added to the discussions. Since the students were not in a classroom, this was the way they could share ideas and questions, and challenge others to see things from another point of view. Because the class was also global, the students brought with them their own cultural differences, which also added to the discussions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Gender empowerment''' is the [[empowerment]] of people of any [[gender]]. While conventionally being reduced to its aspect of [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], the concept stresses [[Sex and gender distinction|the distinction]] between biological [[sex]] and [[Gender role|gender as a role]], also referring to other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context.

Gender empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in regard to development and economics. Entire nations, businesses, communities, and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;Deneulin, Séverine, with Lila Shahani.  2009.  An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency.  Sterling, VA: Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring ==
Gender empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]], or the GEM. The GEM shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. Gem is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence."&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt;

'''Glass-ceramics''' have an [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] phase and one or more [[crystal]]line phases and are produced by a so-called "controlled crystallization" in contrast to a spontaneous crystallization, which is usually not wanted in glass manufacturing. Glass-ceramics have the fabrication advantage of glass, as well as special properties of ceramics. When used for sealing, some glass-ceramics do not require [[brazing]] but can withstand brazing temperatures up to 700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elantechnology.com/glass/glass-ceramic-composite-components/|title=Glass Ceramic Composite Materials for Hermetic Seals {{!}} Elan|work=Elan Technology|access-date=2017-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass-ceramics usually have between 30%  [m/m] and 90% [m/m] crystallinity and yield an array of materials with interesting properties like zero [[porosity]], high strength, toughness, [[translucency]] or [[opacity (optics)|opacity]], [[pigmentation]], [[opalescence]], low or even negative [[thermal expansion]], high temperature stability, [[fluorescence]], machinability, [[ferromagnetism]], resorbability or high chemical durability, [[biocompatibility]], [[bioactivity]], ion conductivity, [[superconductivity]], isolation capabilities,  low [[permittivity|dielectric constant]] and loss, high [[resistivity]] and break-down voltage.  These properties can be tailored by controlling the base-glass composition and by controlled heat treatment/crystallization of base glass. In manufacturing, glass-ceramics are valued for having the strength of ceramic but the [[hermetic seal]]ing properties of glass.

Glass-ceramics are mostly produced in two steps: First, a glass is formed by a glass-manufacturing process. The glass is cooled down and is then reheated in a second step. In this heat treatment the glass partly [[crystallizes]]. In most cases [[nucleation]] agents are added to the base composition of the glass-ceramic. These nucleation agents aid and control the crystallization process. Because there is usually no pressing and sintering, glass-ceramics have, unlike [[sintered ceramic]]s, no pores.

A wide variety of glass-ceramic systems exists, e.g., the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O × Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; × ''n''SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system (LAS system), the MgO × Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; × ''n''SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system (MAS system), the ZnO × Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; × ''n''SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system (ZAS system).

The LAS system mainly refers to a mix of [[lithium]], [[silicon]], and [[aluminum]] [[oxide]]s with additional components, e.g., glass-phase-forming agents such as Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CaO and refining agents. As nucleation agents most commonly zirconium(IV) oxide in combination with titanium(IV) oxide is used. This important system was studied first and intensively by Hummel,&lt;ref name="Hummel F.A.1951"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hummel |first=F. A. |title=Thermal expansion properties of some synthetic lithia minerals |journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society |year=1951 |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=235–239 |doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1951.tb11646.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smoke.&lt;ref name="Smoke E. J.1951"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smoke  |first=E. J. |title=Ceramic compositions having negative linear thermal expansion |journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society |year=1951 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=87–90 |doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1951.tb13491.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After crystallization the dominant crystal phase in this type of glass-ceramic is a high-quartz solid solution (HQ s.s.). If the glass-ceramic is subjected to a more intense heat treatment, this HQ s.s. transforms into a keatite-solid solution (K s.s., sometimes wrongly named as beta-[[spodumene]]). This transition is non-reversible and reconstructive, which means bonds in the crystal-lattice are broken and new arranged. However, these two crystal phases show a very similar structure as Li could show.&lt;ref name="Li C.T. 1971"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Li |first=C. T. |title=Transformation mechanism between high-quartz and keatite phases of LiAlSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; composition |journal=Acta Crystallographica |year=1971 |volume=27 |issue= |pages=1132–1140 |doi=10.1107/S0567740871003649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most interesting properties of these glass-ceramics are their thermomechanical properties. Glass-ceramic from the LAS system is a mechanically strong material and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 800–1000&amp;nbsp;°C. The dominant crystalline phase of the LAS glass-ceramics, HQ s.s., has a strong ''negative'' [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] (CTE), keatite-solid solution as still a negative CTE but much higher than HQ s.s. These negative CTEs of the crystalline phase contrasts with the positive CTE of the residual glass.  Adjusting the proportion of these phases offers a wide range of possible CTEs in the finished composite. Mostly for today's applications a low or even zero CTE is desired. Also a negative CTE is possible, which means, in contrast to most materials when heated up, such a glass-ceramic contracts. At a certain point, generally between 60% [m/m] and 80%  [m/m] crystallinity, the two coefficients balance such that the glass-ceramic as a whole has a thermal expansion coefficient that is very close to zero. Also, when an interface between material will be subject to thermal [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], glass-ceramics can be adjusted to match the coefficient of the material they will be bonded to.

Originally developed for use in the [[mirror]]s and mirror mounts of astronomical [[telescope]]s, LAS glass-ceramics have become known and entered the domestic market through its use in glass-ceramic [[kitchen stove|cooktops]], as well as [[cookware and bakeware]] or as high-performance reflectors for digital projectors.

== Ceramic matrix composites ==

One particularly notable use of glass-ceramics is in the processing of [[ceramic matrix composite]]s. For many ceramic matrix composites typical sintering temperatures and times cannot be used, as the degradation and corrosion of the constituent fibres becomes more of an issue as temperature and sintering time increase. 
One example of this is SiC fibres, which can start to degrade via pyrolysis at temperatures above 1470K.&lt;ref&gt;G. Chollon et. Al. (1997), Thermal stability of a PCS-derived SiC fibre with a low oxygen content (Hi-Nicalon), Journal of Materials Science&lt;/ref&gt; One solution to this is to use the glassy form of the ceramic as the sintering feedstock rather than the ceramic, as unlike the ceramic the glass pellets have a softening point and will generally flow at much lower pressures and temperatures. This allows the use of less extreme processing parameters, making the production of many new technologically important fibre-matrix combinations by sintering possible.

== Cooktops ==

Glass-ceramic from the LAS-System is a mechanically strong material and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes. However, it is not totally unbreakable.  Because it is still a brittle material as glass and ceramics are, it can be broken. There have been instances where users reported damage to their cooktops when the surface was struck with a hard or blunt object (such as a can falling from above or other heavy items).

At the same time, it has a very low [[Thermal conductivity|heat conduction coefficient]] and can be made nearly transparent (15–20% loss in a typical cooktop) for radiation in the [[infrared]] [[wavelength]]s.

In the visible range glass-ceramics can be transparent, translucent or opaque and even colored by coloring agents.

[[Image:Glass ceramic cooktop.jpg|right|thumb|240px|A glass-ceramic [[kitchen stove|cooktop]]]]

{{As of|2004|alt=Today}}, there are two major types of electrical [[stove]]s with cooktops made of glass-ceramic:
* A glass-ceramic stove uses [[radiant heating]] coils or infrared [[halogen]] lamps as the heating elements. The surface of the glass-ceramic cooktop above the burner heats up, but the adjacent surface remains cool because of the low heat conduction coefficient of the material.
* An [[induction cooker|induction stove]] heats a [[metal]] pot's bottom directly through [[electromagnetic induction]].

This technology is not entirely new, as glass-ceramic ranges were first introduced in the 1970s using [[Corningware]] tops instead of the more durable material used today.  These first generation smoothtops were problematic and could only be used with flat-bottomed cookware as the heating was primarily conductive rather than radiative.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.automaticwasher.org/TD/ARCHIVE/VINTAGE/2005/918x16.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to conventional kitchen stoves, glass-ceramic cooktops are relatively simple to clean, due to their flat surface. However, glass-ceramic cooktops can be scratched very easily, so care must be taken not to slide the cooking pans over the surface. If food with a high sugar content (such as jam) spills, it should never be allowed to dry on the surface, otherwise damage will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geappliances.com/search/fast/infobase/10001689.htm|title=Range - Glass Cooktop Cleaning Instructions|website=www.geappliances.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For best results and maximum heat transfer, all cookware should be flat-bottomed and matched to the same size as the burner zone.

==  Brands and manufacturers ==
[[File:Corningware casserole dishes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[CorningWare]] casserole dish and other cookware pieces, with the 'Cornflower' pattern decoration]]
Some well-known brands of glass-ceramics are [[Pyroceram]], ''[http://www.us.schott.com/hometech/english/products/ceran/index.html Ceran]'' (cooktops), ''[http://www.eurokera.com Eurokera]'' (cooktop, stoves and fireplaces), ''[[Zerodur]]'' (telescope mirrors), and ''[[Macor]]'', ''[http://www.glassceramic.cn Kanger]'' (Glass-Ceramic for cooktop, stoves, microwave and fireplaces door). [[Germany|German]] manufacturer [[Schott Glass|Schott]] introduced Zerodur in 1968, Ceran followed in 1971. [[Nippon Electric Glass]] is another worldwide manufacturer of glass ceramics, whose related products in this area include Firelite and Neoceram fire-rated glass. Keralite, manufactured by [http://www.vetrotech.com/usa/Glass-Framing-Products.aspx Vetrotech Saint-Gobain], is a specialty glass-ceramic fire and impact safety rated material for use in fire-rated applications. Glass-ceramics manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]]/[[Russia]] are known under the name ''[[Sitall]]''.

The same class of material was also used, until the late 1990s, in [[CorningWare]] dishes, which could be taken from the freezer directly to the oven with no risk of thermal shock.

[[File:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A gloss is a marginal notation regarding the main text in a document. Shown is a parchment page from the Royal Library of Copenhagen.]]
A '''gloss''' ({{ety|la|glossa}}; {{ety|gre|''γλῶσσα'' glōssa|language}}) is a brief notation, especially a [[marginalia|marginal]] one or an [[interlinear gloss|interlinear]] one, of the meaning of a word or wording in a text. It may be in the language of the text, or in the reader's language if that is different. 

A collection of glosses is a ''[[glossary]].'' A collection of medieval legal glosses, made by [[glossators]], is called an ''apparatus''. The compilation of glosses into glossaries was the beginning of [[lexicography]], and the glossaries so compiled were in fact the first [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. In modern times a glossary, as opposed to a dictionary, is typically found in a text as an appendix of specialized terms that the typical reader may find unfamiliar. Also, satirical explanations of words and events are called glosses. The [[German Romanticism|German Romantic movement]] used the expression of gloss for poems commenting on a given other piece of poetry, often in the Spanish [[Décima]] style. 

Glosses were originally notes made in the margin or between the lines of a text in a [[classical language]]; the meaning of a word or passage is explained by the gloss. As such, glosses vary in thoroughness and complexity, from simple marginal notations of words one reader found difficult or obscure, to interlinear [[translation]]s of a text with cross references to similar passages. Today [[bracket#Parentheses|parenthetical]] explanations in [[scientific writing]] and [[technical writing]] are also often called glosses. [[Hyperlink]]s to a [[glossary]] sometimes supersede them.

==Etymology==
The word "gloss" was first used in the 1570s to refer to the insertion of a word as an explanation. It began to be used to mean to "explain away" in the 1630s, and originated from the concept of a note being inserted in the margin of a text to explain a difficult word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.etymonline.com/word/gloss|title=Gloss|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Biblical gloss}}
Glosses and other marginal notes were a primary format used in medieval Biblical [[theology]], and were studied and memorized for their own merit. Many Biblical passages came to be associated with a particular gloss, whose truth was taken to be scriptural. Indeed, in one case, it is generally reckoned that an early gloss explicating the doctrine of the Trinity made its way into the Scriptural text itself, in the passage known as the "three heavenly witnesses" or the ''[[Comma Johanneum]]'', which is present in the Vulgate Latin and the third and later editions of the Greek [[Textus Receptus]] collated by Erasmus (the first two editions excluded it for lack of manuscript evidence), but is absent from all modern critical reconstructions of the New Testament text, such as [[Westcott and Hort]], [[Tischendorf]], and [[Nestle-Aland]].

==In law==
{{See also|Glossator}}
In the medieval legal tradition, the glosses on [[Roman law]] and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] created standards of reference, so-called ''sedes materiae'' (literally: seat of the matter). In [[common law]] countries, the term "judicial gloss" refers to what is considered an authoritative or "official" [[Statutory interpretation|interpretation]] of a statute or regulation by a [[judge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial glosses are often very important in avoiding contradictions between statutes, and determining the [[constitutionality]] of various provisions of law.

==In literature==
A gloss, or ''glosa'', is a verse in traditional [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] literature and music which follows and comments on a refrain (the "''mote''"). See also [[villancico]].

==In philology==
[[Image:Codiceemil.jpg|thumb|The [[Glosas Emilianenses]] are glosses added to this Latin codex that are now considered the first phrases written in the [[Castilian language]].]]
Glosses are of some importance in [[philology]], especially if one language&amp;mdash;usually, the language of the author of the gloss&amp;mdash;has left few texts of its own. The [[Reichenau Glosses]], for example, gloss the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] [[Bible]] in an early form of one of the [[Romance languages]], and as such give insight into late [[Vulgar Latin]] at a time when that language was not often written down. A series of glosses in the [[Old English language]] to Latin Bibles give us a running translation of Biblical texts in that language; see ''[[Old English Bible translations]]''. Glosses of Christian religious texts are also important for our knowledge of [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]]. Glosses frequently shed valuable light on the vocabulary of otherwise little attested languages; they are less reliable for [[syntax]], because many times the glosses follow the word order of the original text, and translate its [[idiom]]s literally.

==In linguistics{{anchor|In linguistics}}==
{{Main|Interlinear gloss}}
In [[linguistics]], a simple gloss in running text may be marked by quotation marks and follow the transcription of a foreign word. Single quotes are a widely used convention.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lyle. 2004. ''Historical Linguistics: An Introduction''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; For example: 

* A [[Cossack]] longboat is called a ''chaika'' 'seagull'.
* The [[moose]] gains its name from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] ''mus'' or ''mooz'' ('twig eater').

A longer or more complex transcription may rely upon an ''[[interlinear gloss]]''.  Such a gloss may be placed between a [[text corpus|text]] and its translation when it is important to understand the structure of the language being glossed, and not just the overall meaning of the passage.

===Glossing sign languages{{anchor|Glossing signed languages}}{{anchor|Glossing sign languages}}===
[[Sign language]]s are typically transcribed word-for-word by means of a gloss written in the predominant oral language in all capitals; [[American Sign Language]] and [[Auslan]] would be written in English. [[Prosody (linguistics)|Prosody]] is often glossed as superscript words, with its scope indicated by brackets. 

{{quotation|[I LIKE]&lt;sup&gt;NEGATIVE&lt;/sup&gt; [WHAT?]&lt;sup&gt;RHETORICAL&lt;/sup&gt;, GARLIC.
&lt;br&gt;"I don't like garlic."}}

Pure [[fingerspelling]] is usually indicated by hyphenation.  Fingerspelled words that have been lexicalized (that is, fingerspelling sequences that have entered the sign language as linguistic units and that often have slight modifications) are indicated with a hash.  For example, ''W-I-K-I'' indicates a simple fingerspelled word, but ''#JOB'' indicates a lexicalized unit, produced like ''J-O-B'', but faster, with a barely perceptible ''O'' and turning the "B" hand palm side in, unlike a regularly fingerspelled "B".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4105">In [[computer science]], '''Hennessy–Milner logic''' (HML) is a [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] used to specify properties of a [[labeled transition system]] (LTS), a structure similar to an automaton. It was introduced in 1980 by [[Matthew Hennessy]] and [[Robin Milner]] in their paper "On observing nondeterminism and concurrency"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hennessy|first=Matthew|last2=Milner|first2=Robin|date=1980-07-14|title=On observing nondeterminism and concurrency|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-10003-2_79|journal=Automata, Languages and Programming|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=299–309|doi=10.1007/3-540-10003-2_79|isbn=3540100032}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[ICALP]]).  

Another variant of the HML involves the use of recursion to extend the expressibility of the logic, and is commonly referred to as 'Hennessy-Milner Logic with recursion'.&lt;ref name="HMLwithRecursion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holmström|first=Sören|title=Hennessy-Milner Logic with Recursion as a Specification Language, and a Refinement Calculus based on It|journal=Proceedings of the BCS-FACS Workshop on Specification and Verification of Concurrent Systems|year=1990|pages=294–330|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recursion is enabled with the use of maximum and minimum fixed points.

==Syntax==
A formula is defined by the following [[BNF grammar]] for ''Act'' some set of actions:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi ::= \textit{tt} \,\,\, | \,\,\,\textit{ff}\,\,\, | \,\,\,\Phi_1 \land \Phi_2 \,\,\, | \,\,\,\Phi_1 \lor \Phi_2\,\,\, | \,\,\,[Act] \Phi\,\,\, | \,\,\, \langle Act \rangle \Phi&lt;/math&gt;

That is, a formula can be

; constant truth &lt;math&gt;\textit{tt}&lt;/math&gt;: always true
; constant false &lt;math&gt;\textit{ff}&lt;/math&gt;: always false
; formula [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]
; formula [[logical disjunction|disjunction]]
; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{[Act]\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; formula : for all ''Act''-derivatives, ''Φ'' must hold
; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\langle Act \rangle \Phi}&lt;/math&gt; formula : for some ''Act''-derivative, ''Φ'' must hold

==Formal semantics==
Let &lt;math&gt;L = (S, \mathsf{Act}, \rightarrow)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[labeled transition system]], and let
&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{HML}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of HML formulae. The satisfiability
relation &lt;math&gt;{} \models {} \subseteq (S \times \mathsf{HML})&lt;/math&gt; relates states of the LTS
to the formulae they satisfy, and is defined as the smallest relation such that, for all states &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt;
and formulae &lt;math&gt;\phi, \phi_1, \phi_2 \in \mathsf{HML}&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;s \models \textit{tt} &lt;/math&gt;,
* if there exists a state    &lt;math&gt;s' \in S&lt;/math&gt;  such that &lt;math&gt;s \xrightarrow{a} s'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s' \models \phi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;s \models \langle a \rangle \phi&lt;/math&gt;,
* if for all &lt;math&gt;s' \in S &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;s \xrightarrow{a} s'&lt;/math&gt; it holds that &lt;math&gt;s' \models \phi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;s \models [ a ] \phi&lt;/math&gt;,
* if &lt;math&gt;s \models \phi_1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;s \models \phi_1 \lor \phi_2&lt;/math&gt;,
* if &lt;math&gt;s \models \phi_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;s \models \phi_1 \lor \phi_2&lt;/math&gt;,
* if &lt;math&gt;s \models \phi_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s \models \phi_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;s \models \phi_1 \land \phi_2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''How Music Works''''' is a non-fiction book by [[David Byrne]], a musician, writer, and public figure best known for his work with the group [[Talking Heads]]. He discusses the form and influence of music in a non-linear narrative fashion, using a variety of experiences from his career to create something part [[autobiography]] and part [[music theory]]. The book was published through [[McSweeney's]] on September 12, 2012, and was named as one of [[Amazon.com]]'s "Best Books of the Month" in that same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000829021|title=Best Books of the Month: September 2012|accessdate=November 3, 2012|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; It has received mainly positive reviews.&lt;ref name=keens/&gt;&lt;ref name=club/&gt;&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Contents==
[[File:Talking Heads band3.jpg|thumb|Talking Heads performing at [[Horseshoe Tavern]] in [[Toronto]] in 1978.]]

The book, despite being non-fiction, has a highly non-linear structure with manual-like information, elements of Byrne's [[autobiography]], and anthropological data on [[music theory]] all intermixed, each chapter able to stand alone. Byrne looks at the influence of music, even in such subtle forms as birdsongs, from a rational perspective that eschews [[romanticism]].&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; Overall, he writes that no music "is aimed exclusively at either the body or the head", with complex human beings interacting with it on different levels.&lt;ref name=club/&gt;

He discusses his career with [[Talking Heads]], detailing many points of background for their music. He describes how the lyrics to the 1980 song "[[Once in a Lifetime (Talking Heads song)|Once in a Lifetime]]" drew inspiration from a recording of a preacher as well as how the oversize suits worn in their [[concert film]] ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' drew inspiration from ancient Japanese theatre.&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; Byrne avoids bringing back up the personality conflicts leading to the band's demise, and he instead goes through their history, [[Talking Heads discography|album by album]], to detail his views on performances versus recordings as well as the effects of money and fame. In particular, he spends a chapter on the [[CBGB]] [[nightclub]] and the underlying conditions that supported the development of new, avant-garde artists such as [[Patti Smith]], [[the Ramones]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], and others besides his own band.&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-byrne/how-music-works/|publisher=''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''|accessdate=November 3, 2012|title=HOW MUSIC WORKS|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrne writes,
{{quote|"I’ve made money, and I’ve been ripped off... I’ve had creative freedom, and I’ve been pressured to make hits. I have dealt with diva behavior from crazy musicians, and I have seen genius records by wonderful artists get completely ignored... If you think success in the world of music is determined by the number of records sold, or the size of your house or bank account, then I’m not the expert for you.

==Reviews==
A supportive review ran in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', with Oliver Keens stating that "David Byrne deserves great praise". Keens referred to the book as "as accessible as pop yet able to posit deep and startlingly original thoughts and discoveries in almost every paragraph", and he added that "this book will make you hear music in a different way." He remarked as well that "Talking Heads fans will find much to savour" and that "Byrne shows not just how music works, but how music publishing should work too."&lt;ref name=keens&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/artsandentertainmentbooksreview/9573776/How-Music-Works-by-David-Byrne-review.html|title=How Music Works by David Byrne: review|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=3 November 2012|first=Oliver|last=Keens|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' also published a positive review. Critic Jason Heller remarked that "joy—of singing and playing, of thinking and dancing, of listening and wondering—renders almost every page a song." In addition, he wrote, "Byrne’s knack for paradox and passion carries his erratic narrative."&lt;ref name=club&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/david-byrne-how-music-works,84993/|first=Jason|last=Heller|date=September 17, 2012|accessdate=November 3, 2012|publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]''|title=David Byrne: How Music Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' critic [[Tim Page (critic)|Tim Page]] commented, "This is a decidedly generous book—welcoming, informal, digressive, full of ideas and intelligence—and one has the pleasant sense that Byrne is speaking directly to the reader, sharing a few confidences he has picked up over the years." Stating that "Byrne has plenty of smart things to say about pop music", Page lauded the "ambitious" work.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' praised the book as "a supremely intelligent, superbly written dissection of music as an art form and way of life." The magazine stated in addition that "anyone at all interested in music will learn a lot from this book."&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;

On the other hand, for ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]], the book is "a roll of mental wallpaper, a textbook for a survey course you didn’t mean to sign up for. It drifts between music history, sonic anthropology, mild biographical asides, broad pop theory and grandfatherly financial and artistic advice. It’s all the things Mr. Byrne’s twitchy and alienated music with Talking Heads never was: genial, well-meaning, as forgettable as a real estate agent’s handshake." &lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/books/how-music-works-by-david-byrne.html?_r=0|first=Dwight|last=Garner|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=February 23, 2013|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=A Talking Head Has Something to Say. ‘How Music Works,’ by David Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hunveyor-model.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The Hunveyor-1.]]

The '''Hunveyor''' is an experimental space probe model constructed in the Hungarian universities. Its name is coming from the following words:
HUNVEYOR = Hungarian UNiversity surVEYOR. Recently 10 university or college space research groups and high school groups build Hunveyor (or the [[Husar-rover]]) developed later to work around Hunveyor in Hungary.

==Design and construction==
The clear construction and the well recognizable instrumentation of the [[NASA]] Surveyors (which were built in the [[Surveyor program]] and which landed on the [[Moon]] between 1966 and 1968) have given the possibility to construct an educational version of the [[space probe]]. In 1997, the teachers and students of the [[Eötvös Loránd University]], [[Budapest]], Department of General Technology examined the literature published on Surveyor missions and a group led by Szaniszlo Berczi constructed the Hunveyor-1 with [[robotic arm]] and TV camera (similar to [[Surveyor 3]]) with some other simple measurements on board.

Construction of a Surveyor-type planetary lander is one of the space science education programs on Eotvos University, Budapest, Hungary. It focuses on both planetary science and technologies. The new initiative of experimental space probe model construction uses interactions between measuring instruments and environmental streams. Similar is the case between artificially planned technologies and environmental currents (water, wind flows, other transport mechanisms). All these activities are involved in the construction and continuous development of a training and experimental space probe model.

Students played an important role in the construction of this Hunveyor probe. The first training space probe lander, Hunveyor-1, was initiated at the Eotvos University, Department of General Technology, in October 1997. It had two previous ideas helping to start the Hunveyor program. First: the space science education program by activities (i.e. by construction) was the essential program in NASA International [[United States Space Camp]], [[Huntsville, Alabama]], USA. There, every year, NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] organizes an International Space Camp where all participant countries delegate two students (high-school age) and their accompanying teacher. The strength and value of the in situ experiments in [[space science]] education were experienced by several Hungarian teachers and students during the last 10 years. Second: the program had been helped by [[Eugene Shoemaker]] who sent to Szaniszlo Berczi scientific materials about the [[Surveyor program]] in the late 1960s.

In 1998 the program was continued on other universities and colleges in Hungary: in Pecs University, Dept. of Informatics and General Technology (Sandor Hegyi, head) where the Hunveyor-2 has been built, then in 2000 on the Berzsenyi College, Dept. of Technology (Zsolt Kovacs, head) and in 2001 in the Kandó Kálmán College in Szekesfehervar (Gyorgy Hudoba, head) where the Hunveyor-3 and Hunveyor-4 has been built, respectively. In 2003 this program of Hunveyor construction has been extended in the high schools, too. In [[Pannonhalma]], at the Saint Benedict [[Pannonhalma Archabbey]]'s Gymnasium (Ambrus Pinter, head) the Hunveyor-7 is in construction. Three other high schools in Hungary also participate in the project of building the space probe model.

The Hunveyor program is: construction of a planetary lander model, the experimental part, from the very beginning of the work. Important goal is: measuring the interactions between instruments (technologies) and environmental currents (water, wind flows, other transport mechanisms). Planning, construction, carrying out testing activities, and also the continuous development of the training space probe model are also important parts of the program with the Surveyor type Hunveyor.

Students played important role in the construction of this Hunveyor probe which shows that the training space probe lander model Hunveyor is an intensive experimental tool for education. It concentrates and focuses efforts
*how to teach [[technologies]] and
*how to teach [[planetary science]],
*how to connect disciplinary knowledge.
It involves theoretical education and practice in construction and technologies.

The first level of this work was a minimal space probe model for experiments, while the first unit was a tetrahedral skeleton (Surveyor-like) as a holding frame. For a minimal probe the personal minimal environmental observations and activities in a new environment were copied: visuality, touch, temperature experience. Television camera with mirror to "see around", telescopic arm to dig small graben, and a bimetallic temperature-measuring instrument can be corresponded to them. Passive magnets were also fixed on the legs.

==Electronics of the Hunveyor System==

Also the first level contains the electronics of the Hunveyor System. Essentially, two computers are talking with each other. One is the "Terrestrial Direction and Control" computer, the other is the "Computer on Board of the Space Probe Model". Their connection can be gradually "liberated". First by cables later separated radio electronic connection was built. This Surveyor-like minimal probe gave us many pleasure during building. The skeleton was made from copper pipes with 15&amp;nbsp;mm diameter. The robotics are constructed by microcontrollers. They can operate both motors and measuring units. Solar panels, the web cameras and other units were purchased in the shops. Computers are PCs. Husar-rovers gave new impetus to the program later.

Basic points of the Hunveyor constructing works are as follows:

#Hierarchy levels in the operating [[mechatronic]] system
#Modul principle ([[modularity]]) in the robotic system
#Compatible subsystems in construction
#PC based electronics
#Group-works by students, teachers.

==Educational books, field tests, supports from HSO, reports in LPSC==

Material on Hunveyor has been published in Hungarian in the form of various lecture note series booklets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1177.pdf Book on Field Works with Hunveyor]&lt;/ref&gt; while a Surveyor-Hunveyor concise atlas has been published in English.

Field tests and various Hunveyor Husar planetary analog field trips and [[simulations]] are the next steps in using Hunveyor in planetary science education. [[Mathematica]] demonstrations (a computer program of the [[Wolfram Research]]) help planning and studying motions, extensions, and other operations with the new instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/HunveyorSurveyorFieldWorkSimulations/ Hunveyor-Surveyor Field Work Simulations of Motions.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hunveyor experimental and training space probe model construction works were also helped by the [[Hungarian Space Office]] (HSO). Developments were reported in the NASA [[Lunar and Planetary Science Conference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/LPSC98/pdf/1267.pdf The first report on Hunveyor construction.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/LPSC99/pdf/1332.pdf New developments on Hunveyor instruments.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2001/pdf/1130.pdf Construction of the Hunveyor-3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hunveyor Teams==

The work is continuously tutored by the Materials Physics, Institute of Physics, [[Eötvös Loránd University]] and the [[Hungarian Space Office]] also supports the Hunveyor groups. Recent works are at: Hunveyor-1, ELTE, [[Budapest]]; Hunveyor-2, PTE, [[Pécs]]; Hunveyor-3, BDTF, [[Szombathely]]; Hunveyor-4, BMF, [[Székesfehérvár]]; Hunveyor-5, NYME, [[Sopron]]; Hunveyor-6, High School, [[Dorog]]; Hunveyor-7, High School, [[Pannonhalma]]; Hunveyor-8, GAMF College, [[Kecskemét]]; Hunveyor-9, High School, [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]]; Hunveyor-10, Eötvös University, Faculty of Informatics ELTE, [[Budapest]].

==Abnormalities==
In the [[dog whelk]], the growth of a penis in imposex females gradually blocks the [[oviduct]], although [[ovule]] production continues. An imposex female dog whelk passes through several stages of penis growth before it becomes unable to maintain a constant production of ovules. Later stages of imposex lead to [[Infertility|sterility]] and the premature death of the females of reproductive age, which can adversely affect the entire [[population]].&lt;ref name="Castro"/&gt;

==Biomonitoring==

The imposex stages of female dog whelks and other molluscs (including ''[[Nucella lima]]'') are used in the United Kingdom and worldwide to [[biomonitoring|monitor]] levels of tributyltin. The RPSI (Relative Penis Size Index) of females to males, and the VDSI (Vas Deferens Sequence Index) are used to monitor levels of tributyltin in [[marine environment]]s.

On September 29, 2007, the [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], newspaper ''The Chronicle Herald'' featured a story on female dog whelks on the shores of Halifax Harbour and other parts of Nova Scotia, where they live on the beach in the [[intertidal zone]]. The report stated that female dog whelks still grow penises even after a ban on tributyltin.&lt;ref&gt;"Tiny Snail, Big Problem" The Chronicle Herald, Halifax, NS, Canada.

This is a list of political topics, including political science terms, political philosophies, political issues, etc.

'''[[Politics]]''' is the process by which groups of people make decisions. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within civil [[government]]s, politics is observed in all human group interactions, including [[corporation|corporate]], [[academia|academic]], and [[religion|religious]] institutions. Politics consists of "social relations involving authority or power"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.die.net/politics/ Definition of politics from die.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the regulation of a political unit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=303454 Politics (definition)@Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply [[policy]].&lt;ref name="freedict"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/politics Definition of politics from "The Free Dictionary"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Political science]]''' (also known as political studies) is the study of political behavior and examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]]. Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behavior, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.

The '''Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB)''' is a non-profit autonomous institute set up by the Department of IT, BT and S&amp;T, Government of Karnataka. It is located in a 20-acre campus in the southern part of the City of Bengaluru and is a part of Biotech Park. Its mission is to help grow the biotech industry and, to fulfill this mission, it has adopted the strategies of education, research and promoting entrepreneurship.

==History==

The [http://www.bangaloreitbt.in/ Department of Information Technology and Biotechnology of the Government of Karnataka] established the institute in 2001, with financial support from ICICI Bank. The institute has received overwhelming support from academic and industry scientists, primarily those in Bengaluru. Its programmes would not be possible without this ongoing support.

IBAB's first Director, Prof. Manju Bansal, is a professor at the [[Indian Institute of Science]], [[Bengaluru]]. She was with the institute for the first three years. She was succeeded by Prof. N. Yathindra of the [[University of Madras]] in the year 2004. He served as the Director of IBAB until February, 2018. Dr. Hosahalli Subramanya is the current Director of IBAB, since February, 2018.

Originally located at the [http://www.itpbangalore.com International Tech Park], IBAB moved to its own campus in the Biotech Park, Electronic City in Bengaluru in June 2009. The two-storeyed academic block of the new campus has (in its first phase) 30,000 sq ft. There is a three-storeyed men's hostel, which can accommodate almost 100 students, and a dining block. The lady students moved into their spacious new 4-storeyed hostel on 20 March 2015. In addition, a neighbouring 40,000 sq. ft. life science and med-tech incubator  hosted its first incubatee in December 2015. It currently has about 40 startups on its premises.

==Funding support==

The institute continues to be supported by the Government of Karnataka's Department of IT, BT and S&amp;T. It has been funded under DST's FIST programme, and has received research funding from the MeitY, Department of Biotechnology and Department of Science &amp; Technology, all of the Government of India. It has been recognized as a Centre of Excellence of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.

Most recently the institute has received generous funding from the Infosys Foundation to fund the Infosys Chair. In the past, the institute has received faculty chairs from AstraZeneca Research Foundation, [http://www.biocon.com Biocon] and Merck &amp; Co. and has also been funded by the [http://www.wadhwani-foundation.org Wadhwani Foundation] and Institut Merieux. IBAB has received scholarship support from the Government of Karnataka, Accelrys, Merck &amp; Co, Millipore, Sartorius, [http://www.strandls.com Strand Life Sciences] and an anonymous donor. Sudha Murty of the [http://www.infosys.com/infosys_foundation Infosys Foundation] has endowed medals to two of the best students of the graduating bioinformatics class each year, and a scholarship in the name of Purnima Chaudhury.  Several companies and individuals have supported the students' entrepreneurship activities.

==Education==

The institute offered a Postgraduate Diploma in Bioinformatics (starting in 2002), and Biotechniques (since 2003). The bioinformatics course involved 12 months of classes and, in the third term, a six-month internship placement in industry or academia. The biotechniques course involved eight months of coursework and an optional six-month research project. These courses have now been stopped.

Starting in August 2011, IBAB offered an M.Sc. degree in 'Bioinformatics and Biotechnology', recognized by [[IGNOU]], New Delhi. The affiliation of the M.Sc. program was changed to [[Mysore University]] starting from  2013 and subsequently to [[Bangalore University]] from 2018.   IBAB has an ongoing Ph.D program in affiliation with MAHE, Manipal and TDU, Bangalore.

IBAB offers short term courses on Data Analytics, Omics and Next Generation Sequencing frequently.

The institute has an excellent record in placing its students in various companies (about 95% of its graduating students have been placed in the past). Details of student's placement are available at http://www.ibab.ac.in/index.php/placements/.

==Research==

Research work by the faculty has led to bioinformatics tools, such as ExPrimer for primer design. It has also led to several publications in international journals such as ''Cell'', ''Nature Biotechnology'', ''Nucleic Acids Research'', ''PLoS One'', ''Journal of Medicinal Chemistry'', ''Journal of Biological Chemistry'', ''BMC Genomics'', ''Bioinformatics'', ''Drug Discovery Today'' and ''FEBS Journal''. Eight articles in the area of bio-business have appeared in [http://www.currentscience.ac.in ''Current Science''].

==GANIT Labs, Bio-IT Centre==
IBAB, in collaboration with [http://www.strandls.com Strand Life Sciences], has set up [http://www.ganitlabs.in GANIT Labs, Bio-IT Centre], a not-for-profit centre in  2011 that is dedicated to Functional Genomics, Next Generation Sequencing and Computational Biology. housed at IBAB, the Centre was headed by Dr. Binay Panda. The Centre's initial funding came from the MeitY, Government of India and Department of IT, BT and S&amp;T, Government of Karnataka. Various projects at the Centre are funded by Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), all Government of India agencies.

GANIT Labs worked on several India-centric projects, namely sequencing and analysis of diseases prevalent in India, and sequencing and analysis of species that are of particular interest to India and have tremendous biotechnological potential. In late 2011, GANIT Labs announced the sequencing of [[Azadirachta indica|neem]]. Besides these, the Centre is working on several other subjects, including sequencing of other complex higher organisms, developing bioinformatics and computational pipeline for massive amount of sequencing data. 

Since 2017, the facility has been integrated into IBAB, as Bio-IT Centre. The Bio-IT center, comprises state-of-the-art facility for NGS with the high throughput sequencer Hi Seq 2500, which can generate 480-500GB data in 10 days equivalent to sequencing 6 human genomes at 30X coverage. Other equipment in the facility include Hi-Scan (Illumina bead-array) for genotyping and Ion-torrent for NGS and Qubit, C-bot, Covaris, Bio-analyzer and Tape-station for the processing of DNA and RNA samples. The Bio-IT centre  provides service to the scientific community in a collaborative program mode or on a purely service basis. 

==Promoting entrepreneurship==

In 2004, the institute received a grant from the [http://wadhwani-foundation.org/ Wadhwani Foundation] to promote entrepreneurship. It has since become a partner of the Foundation. The bioinformatics students took a course in entrepreneurship. In addition, the institute does research in the areas of patents and company formation.

Several companies have availed the incubation services of IBAB, including [http://www.cellworksgroup.com CellWorks Group], Symbiosis Biowares, Novozymes R&amp;D, [http://www.shodhaka.com Shodhaka Life Sciences], Ixora Biosciences, BioCOS Life Sciences, Geniron Biolabs, Microtest Innovations, MIR Life Sciences, DeNovo BioLabs, Privils, String Bio, Omix R&amp;D Laboratories, Pentavalent, Indoor Biotechnologies, Techsicon Biotech and Plasmatech Solutions.

The '''International Centre for Mathematical Sciences''' ('''ICMS''') is a mathematical research centre based in [[Edinburgh]]. According to its website, the Centre is "designed to bring together mathematicians and practitioners in science, industry and commerce for research workshops and other meetings." 

The Centre was jointly established in 1990 by the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[Heriot-Watt University]], under the supervision of Professor [[Elmer Rees]], with initial support from [[Edinburgh District Council]], the [[Scottish Development Agency]] and the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]]. In April 1994 the Centre moved to 14 India Street, Edinburgh, the birthplace of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and home of the [[James Clerk Maxwell Foundation]]. In 2010 it relocated to 15 South College Street to accommodate larger events. The current scientific director (appointed in 2016) is Professor Paul Glendinning.

'''Intuition''' is the ability to acquire knowledge without [[proof (truth)|proof]], [[evidence]], or conscious [[reason]]ing, or without understanding how the knowledge was acquired.&lt;ref name="Webster dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=intuition|url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/intuition |accessdate= 22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different writers give the word "intuition" a great variety of different meanings, ranging from direct access to unconscious knowledge, unconscious cognition, inner sensing, inner insight to unconscious pattern-recognition and the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.&lt;ref name="AurobindoDef"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=479–480|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;Intuition and consciousness – Rosenblatt AD, Thickstun JT. Psychoanal Q. 1994 Oct;63(4):696-714.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''intuition'' comes from the Latin verb ''intueri'' translated as "consider" or from the [[Late Middle Ages|late middle English]] word ''intuit'', "to contemplate".&lt;ref name="Webster dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=intuition|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intuition |access-date= 22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Both [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern]] and [[Western philosophy|Western]] philosophers have studied the concept in great detail. [[Philosophy of mind]] deals with the concept of intuition.

===Eastern philosophy===
In the East intuition is mostly intertwined with [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], and various meanings exist from different religious texts.&lt;ref name="eastern"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leaman |first1=Oliver   |title=Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=FLuEAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2014 |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-415-17357-4 |pages=5–40 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism various attempts have been made to interpret the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and other esoteric texts.

For [[Sri Aurobindo]]  intuition comes under the realms of knowledge by identity, he describes the psychological plane in human (often referred to as mana in [[sanskrit]]) has two arbitrary nature, the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information (mind seeking to become aware of external world). The second nature being the action when it seeks to be aware of itself, resulting in humans being aware of their existence or aware of being angry &amp; aware of other emotions, he terms this second nature is knowledge by identity.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=68|ps=}}
He finds that at present as the result of evolution the mind has accustomed itself to depend upon certain physiological functioning and their reactions as its normal means of entering into relation with outer material world, as a result when we seek to know about external world the dominant habit is through arriving at truth about things via as much as senses convey to us.  However, with  knowledge by identity which we currently only gives the awareness of human beings existence can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|pp=69-71|ps=}}

He finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans ([[Vedic]]) and later was taken over by [[reason]] which currently organises our perception, thoughts and actions resulting in from Vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science. he finds that this process which seems to be a decent, is actual a circle of progress.  As a lower faculty is being pushed to take up as much from a higher way of working.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=75|ps=}} He finds when self-awareness in mind is applied to own-self and the outer (other-Self), results in luminous self-manifest identity, the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=72|ps=}}&lt;ref name="Integral yoga"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=799–800|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}

[[Rajneesh|Osho]] believed consciousness of human beings to be in increasing order from basic animal [[instinct]]s to intelligence and intuition, and humans being constantly living in that conscious state often moving between these states depending on their affinity and he also suggests living in the state of intuition is one of the ultimate aims of humanity.&lt;ref name="osho"&gt;{{cite book |last1= osho |first1=  Bhagwan  |title=Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zyBfk5V5HRkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=osho+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y8maVNOMEInzPJHLgbgN&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=10–20|publisher=osho international foundation |location=New York |isbn= 0-312-27567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advaita]] vedanta (a school of thought) takes intuition to be an experience through which one can come in contact with and experience [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="advaita"&gt;{{cite book |last1= M. Indich |first1=  William   |title=Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7ykZjWOiBMoC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=advaitha+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=49CaVPG_HIHlOJOygfAP&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=advaitha%20on%20intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=8–10|publisher=Motilal banarisdas |location=varanasi |isbn= 81-208-1251-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====
Buddhism finds intuition being a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge and puts the term intuition beyond mental process of conscious [[thinking]], as the conscious intellect cannot necessarily access subconscious information, or render such information into a communicable form.&lt;ref name="Sumedho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhismnow.com/2013/08/07/buddha-by-ajahn-sumedho/|title=Buddha, by  Ajahn Sumedho|work=Buddhism now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zen Buddhism]] various techniques have been developed to help develop ones intuitive capability, such as [[koans]] – the resolving of which leads to states of minor enlightenment ([[satori]]). In parts of Zen Buddhism intuition is deemed a mental state between the Universal mind and one's individual, discriminating mind.&lt;ref name="Bdictionary"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Humphreys |first1= Christmas |title=A Popular Dictionary of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TlWRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT406&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=enmZVNyjLs32O8vlgdAM&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-203-98616-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zen Buddhism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Conners |first1=  Shawn  |title=Zen Buddhism – The Path to Enlightenment |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zVPUsSW-by0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iXeZVLu3LsjDOZjFgfgD&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |page=81|publisher=El paso trust |location=Texas |isbn= 1-934255-97-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
In Islam there are various scholars with varied interpretation of intuition (often termed as hads ([[Arabic]]: حدس), hitting correctly on a mark), sometimes relating the ability of having intuitive knowledge to [[prophet]]hood. 
[[Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Siháb al Din-al Suhrawadi]], in his book ''Philosophy Of Illumination'' (ishraq) finds that intuition is a knowledge acquired through illumination and is mystical in nature and also suggests mystical contemplation ([[mushahada]]) on this to bring about correct judgments.&lt;ref name="Islam1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lawson |first1=  Todd  |title=Reason and Inspiration in Islam: Theology, Philosophy and Mysticism in Muslim Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq9zSbNr8gIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=210–225|publisher=I.B touris co ltd |location=London |isbn=1-85043-470-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ibn Sīnā]] finds the ability of having intuition as a "prophetic capacity" and terms it as a knowledge obtained without intentionally acquiring it. He finds that regular knowledge is based on imitation while intuitive knowledge as based on intellectual certitude.&lt;ref name="Islam2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kalin |first1=  Ibrahim  |title=Knowledge in Later Islamic Philosophy: Mulla Sadra on Existence, Intellect, and Intuition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6EGwDLio0QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=155–160|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophy===
In the West, intuition does not appear as a separate field of study, and early mention and definition can be traced back to [[Plato]]. In his book ''[[Plato Republic|Republic]]'' he tries to define intuition as a fundamental capacity of human [[reason]] to comprehend the true nature of [[reality]].&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite web |title=Plato: Education and the Value of Justice |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2h.htm |accessdate= |last = Kemerling|first = Garth|date = 12 November 2011|website = Philosophy Pages }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the "soul of eternity," and a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge. He provides an example of mathematical truths, and posits that they are not arrived at by reason. He argues that these truths are accessed using a knowledge already present in a dormant form and accessible to our intuitive capacity. This concept by Plato is also sometimes referred to as [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]. The study was later continued by his [[Neo-platonism|followers]].&lt;ref name="Meno"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1= Jacob |title=A Commentary on Plato's Meno|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Commentary_on_Plato_s_Meno.html?id=HXI2lcrSsxIC&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=22 December 2014 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-43959-3 |pages=103–127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[René Descartes|Descartes]] refers to an intuition as a pre-existing knowledge gained through rational reasoning or discovering truth through contemplation. This definition is commonly referred to as [[logical intuition|rational intuition]].&lt;ref name="Descartes"&gt;{{cite book |last1= L. Mursell |first1=James |title=The Philosophical Review  |series=4 |volume=28 |publisher= Duke University Press |location=USA |pages=391–401 |chapter=The Function of Intuition in Descartes' Philosophy of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later philosophers, such as [[David Hume|Hume]], have more ambiguous interpretations of intuition. Hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships (relation of time, place, and causation) while he states that "the resemblance" (recognition of relations) "will strike the eye" (which would not require further examination) but goes on to state, "or rather in mind" – attributing intuition to power of mind, contradicting the theory of [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="hume"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hume|first1=David |title=A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RIusIRd2q8C|accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press  |isbn= 9781775410676|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  A.

[[Immanuel Kant]] finds intuition is thought of as basic sensory information provided by the [[cognitive]] faculty of sensibility (equivalent to what might loosely be called [[perception]]). Kant held that our [[mind]] casts all of our external intuitions in the form of [[space]], and all of our internal intuitions ([[memory]], thought) in the form of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url= https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=5144&amp;pageno=35|title= Critique of Pure Reason|publisher= gutenberg.org|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intuitionism]] is a position advanced by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]] in [[philosophy of mathematics]] derived from Kant's claim that all [[mathematics|mathematical knowledge]] is knowledge of the pure forms of the intuition – that is, intuition that is not empirical. [[Intuitionistic logic]] was devised by [[Arend Heyting]] to accommodate this position (and has been adopted by other forms of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] in general). It is characterized by rejecting the [[law of excluded middle]]: as a consequence it does not in general accept rules such as [[double negation elimination]] and the use of [[reductio ad absurdum]] to prove the existence of something.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Intuitions are customarily appealed to independently of any particular theory of how intuitions provide evidence for claims, and there are divergent accounts of what sort of mental state intuitions are, ranging from mere spontaneous judgment to a special presentation of a necessary truth.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lynch "Trusting Intuitions", in P. Greenough and M. Lynch (ed) ''Truth and Realism'', pp. 227-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in recent years a number of philosophers, especially [[George Bealer]] have tried to defend appeals to intuition against [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quinean]] doubts about [[conceptual analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Bealer "Intuition and The Autonomy of Philosophy" in M. Depaul and W. Ramsey (eds) ''Rethinking Intuition: The Psychology of Intuition and Its Role In Philosophical Inquiry'' 1998, pp. 201-239.&lt;/ref&gt; A different challenge to appeals to intuition has recently come from [[experimental philosophy|experimental philosophers]], who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[metaphilosophy|metaphilosophical]] assumption that philosophy depends on intuitions has recently been challenged by some philosophers. [[Timothy Williamson]] has argued that intuition plays no special role in philosophy practice, and that skepticism about intuition cannot be meaningfully separated from a general [[skepticism]] about judgment. On this view, there are no qualitative differences between the methods of philosophy and common sense, the sciences or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Timothy (2008) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=YN2KGBgKwOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false The Philosophy of Philosophy]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

===Freud===
According to Sigmund [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations and rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition, and his findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject.&lt;ref name="Freud"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  Walker Punerr|first1= Helen |title=Sigmund Freud: His Life and Mind |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=386tCTzeb28C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=intuition+sigmund+freud&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1DqgVLCrJcvfPYeWgLAK&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 December 2014  |publisher=Transaction Publishers |pages=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jung===
In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of the [[Human ego|ego]], described in 1916 in ''[[Psychological Types]]'', intuition is an "irrational function", opposed most directly by sensation, and opposed less strongly by the "rational functions" of thinking and feeling. Jung defined intuition as "perception via the unconscious": using sense-perception only as a starting point, to bring forth ideas, images, possibilities, ways out of a blocked situation, by a process that is mostly unconscious.&lt;ref name=ptypes /&gt;

Jung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant, an "intuitive type", acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception. An extraverted intuitive type, "the natural champion of all minorities with a future", orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities, often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit, oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change. An introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious, ever exploring the psychic world of the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], seeking to perceive the meaning of events, but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself. Jung thought that extraverted intuitive types were likely entrepreneurs, speculators, cultural revolutionaries, often undone by a desire to escape every situation before it becomes settled and constraining—even repeatedly leaving lovers for the sake of new romantic possibilities. His introverted intuitive types were likely mystics, prophets, or cranks, struggling with a tension between protecting their visions from influence by others and making their ideas comprehensible and reasonably persuasive to others—a necessity for those visions to bear real fruit.&lt;ref name=ptypes&gt;C.G. Jung. ''Psychological Types''. Bollingen Series XX, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern psychology===
In more-recent psychology, intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and [[decision making]]. For example, the [[recognition primed decision]] (RPD) model explains how people can make relatively fast decisions without having to compare options. [[Gary A. Klein|Gary Klein]] found that under time pressure, high stakes, and changing parameters, experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions. Thus, the RPD model is a blend of intuition and analysis. The intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. The [[analysis]] is the mental simulation, a conscious and deliberate review of the courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Gary. ''Intuition At Work''. Random House, NY, NY. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Instinct]] is often misinterpreted as intuition and its reliability considered to be dependent on past knowledge and occurrences in a specific area. For example, someone who has had more experiences with children will tend to have a better instinct about what they should do in certain situations with them. This is not to say that one with a great amount of experience is always going to have an accurate intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sadler-Smith. Inside Intuition. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuitive abilities were quantitatively tested at Yale University in the 1970s. While studying [[nonverbal communication]], researchers noted that some subjects were able to read nonverbal facial cues before reinforcement occurred.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, J Daood, MC Giannini, R Boniface, PG Rhodes. Intellect versus intuition--dichotomy in the reception of nonverbal communication.Journal of General Psychology. 99:19-24,1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In employing a similar design, they noted that highly intuitive subjects made decisions quickly but could not identify their rationale. Their level of accuracy, however, did not differ from that of non intuitive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, ME Barringer, MC Giannini, RH Loiselle. Lack of relationship between handedness and intuitive and intellectual (rationalistic) modes of information processing. Journal of General Psychology. 111:31-37 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloquial usage==
Intuition, as a gut feeling based on experience, has been found to be useful for business leaders for making judgement about people, culture and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=gcm_pubs|title=Australian Elite Leaders, Intuition and Effectiveness |publisher=epubs.scu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officers often claim to observe suspects and immediately "know" that they possess a weapon or illicit narcotic substances, which could also be action of [[instinct]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/concept-creep/477939/|title=Why Americans Are So Sensitive to Harm|first=Conor|last=Friedersdorf|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often unable to articulate why they reacted or what prompted them at the time of the event, they sometimes retrospectively can plot their actions based upon what had been clear and present danger signals. Such examples liken intuition to "[[Feeling#Stomach feeling|gut feelings]]" and when viable illustrate [[preconscious]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Pinizzotto, PhD, Edward F. Davis, MA, and Charles E. Miller III [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Emotional%2Frational+decision+making+in+law+enforcement-a0114370262 Emotional/rational decision making in law enforcement] (Federal Bureau of Investigation), ''Free Online Library'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
[[Intuition Peak]] in [[Antarctica]] is so named "in appreciation of the role of scientific intuition for the advancement of human knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=134566 Intuition Peak.] SCAR [[Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jingle Cats''' is a series of [[Christmas]] [[novelty record]]ings from producer '''Mike Spalla'''.

The songs are created by Spalla who mixes actual animal sounds to match [[pitch (music)|tones]] of the songs.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; He started with a version of "[[Jingle Bells]]" that was released to radio stations a few years before the full album came out.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; In all, it took more than 1,000 meows, screeches and growls to assemble 20 [[melody|melodies]].&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;Wharton, David (1993).

{{Arab culture}}
The '''''Kitāb al-Hayawān''''' (كتاب الحيوان; English: ''Book of Animals'') is an [[Arabic]] translation in 19 treatises (''maqālāt'') of the following [[Aristotle's biology|zoological texts]] by [[Aristotle]]:

''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]'' : treatises 1-10&lt;br /&gt;
''[[On the Parts of Animals|De Partibus Animalium]]'' : treatises 11-14&lt;br /&gt;
''[[Generation of Animals|De Generatione Animalium]]'' : treatises 15-19

While the book is often attributed to [[Yahya ibn al-Bitriq|Yahyà bin al-Bitrīq]], the translator is unknown. However, from certain oddities in the Arabic, it has been deduced that it is a translation of a lost [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version. The complete text is available only in [[manuscript]] form (in [[Tehran]]), but treatises 11-14 (''De Partibus'') have been edited as ''Ajzā’ al-hayawān (The Parts of Animals)''&lt;ref&gt;Edited by ‘Abd al-Rahmān al-Badawī. Kuwait: Wakālat al-matbū‘āt, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and 15-19 (''De Generatione'') as ''Fī kawn al-hayawān (On the Being of Animals)''.&lt;ref&gt;''Fī kawn al-hayawān (On the Being of Animals)'' (Ed. J. Brugman and H.J. Drossaart Lulofs. Leiden: Brill, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in philosophy==
The first known mention of the book appears in a text by the [[Arab]] philosopher [[Al-Kindī]] (d. 850). Ibn Sīnā ([[Avicenna]]) seems to have had direct knowledge of the book, as he paraphrased and commented upon the full text in his encyclopedic [[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifā’]]. In Spain, the 12th-century philosopher Ibn Bājja ([[Avempace]]) wrote on ''De Partibus'' and ''De Generatione''. It has been remarked that one usually finds references to the ''Historia'' in the Eastern Islamicate world, while the other two books are generally referred to in the West, and in conformity to this pattern, Ibn Rushd ([[Averroes]]), like Ibn Bājja, wrote commentaries on ''De Partibus'' and ''De Generatione'' (see below), in which he criticizes Ibn Sīnā’s interpretations.

==References in zoography==
[[File:Al-Jahiz - pages from Kitaab al Hayawaan 3.jpg|thumb|Page from the Kitāb al-Hayawān by [[Al-Jahiz]].]]

''Kitāb al-hayawān'' was known at least indirectly to several important zoographers including [[Al-Jahiz|Al-Jāhiz]] (''Kitāb al-hayawān''), Al-Mas‘ūdī (''Murawwaj al-dhahab''), [[Al-Tawhidi|Abū Hayyān al-Tawhīdī]] (''Al-Imtā‘ wa al-mu’ānasa''), Al-Qazwīnī (''‘Ajā’ib al-makhlūqāt''), and Al-Damīrī (''Hayāt al-hayawān''). They may have known the Aristotelian ''Kitāb al-hayawān'' at second hand from Arabic compendiums of selected passages from the book. The only extant compendium is the ''Maqāla tushtamalu ‘à la fusūl min kitāb al-hayawān'', attributed (probably falsely) to Mūsà bin Maymūn ([[Moses Maimonides]]), and the Greek ''Compendium'' of [[Nicolaus Damascenus]] was at least partially available by the 11th century.

==In the Christian West==
Finally, [[Michael Scot]]’s early 13th-century [[Latin]] translation of the ''Kitāb al-hayawān'', ''De Animalibus'', is worthy of mention as the vehicle of transmission into Western Europe. It was alleged by [[Roger Bacon]] that Scot "had appropriated to himself the credit of translations which more properly belonged to one Andreas the Jew." This may mean that he had help with the Arabic manuscript, or that he worked fully or in part from a [[Judaeo-Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]] version. Scot's ''De Animalibus'' is available in a partial edition.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Michael. ''De Animalibus''. Vols 1-3. Leiden: Brill, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malacidins''' are a class of [[Secondary metabolite|chemicals made by bacteria]] found in soil that can kill [[Gram-positive bacteria]]. Their activity appears to be dependent on [[calcium]]. The discovery of malacidins was published in 2018.&lt;ref name = "Hover_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hover BM, Kim SH, Katz M, Charlop-Powers Z, Owen JG, Ternei MA, Maniko J, Estrela AB, Molina H, Park S, Perlin DS, Brady SF | title = Culture-independent discovery of the malacidins as calcium-dependent antibiotics with activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 3| issue = 4| pages = 415-422| date = February 2018 | pmid = 29434326 | pmc = 5874163 | doi = 10.1038/s41564-018-0110-1 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The malacidin family were discovered using a new method of soil microbiome screening that does not require cell culturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | page = 6 | date = February 19, 2018 | first = Stu | last = Borman | name-list-format = vanc | journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News | title = Genetic screen of soil microbes uncovers novel antibiotics: Method could help researchers discover new natural products from hard-to-culture microorganisms }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed researchers to identify genetic components necessary to produce the chemical.  Malacidin A was shown to kill ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and other Gram-positive bacteria.

At the time of publication it was not certain if the discovery would lead to any new [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] drugs, because large investments of time and money are required to determine whether any drug is safe and effective.&lt;ref name="wapost" /&gt;

==Chemical structure==
Malacidins are [[macrocycle]] [[lipopeptide]]s.  The 2018 paper described two chemicals in the malacidin family, differing only by a [[Methylene group|methylene]] at their [[lipid]] tails.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt; Their [[peptide]] cores include four [[non-proteinogenic amino acids]].&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt; The name "malacidin" is derived from the abbreviation of ''metagenomic acidic lipopeptide antibiotic'' and the suffix ''-cidin''.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web | first = Melissa | last = Healy | name-list-format = vanc | url =  http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-new-antibiotic-soil-20180213-story.html | title = In soil-dwelling bacteria, scientists find a new weapon to fight drug-resistant superbugs | date = 13 February 2018 | access-date = 13 February 2018 | website = [[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Malacidins appear to take on their active conformation after they bind to calcium; the calcium-bound molecule then appears to bind to [[lipid II]], a bacterial [[cell wall]] precursor molecule, leading to destruction of the cell wall and death of the bacteria.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = King | first1 = Anthony | name-list-format = vanc | title = Soil search unearths new class of antibiotics | url = https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/soil-search-unearths-new-class-of-antibiotics-/3008658.article | work = Chemistry World | date = 14 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, they would be a new member of the class of calcium-dependent antibiotics.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapost"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/02/13/a-potentially-powerful-new-antibiotic-is-discovered-in-dirt/ | title = A potentially powerful new antibiotic is discovered in dirt | first = Sarah | last = Kaplan | name-list-format = vanc | date = February 13, 2018 | access-date = February 13, 2018 | website = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of malacidins supported the view that the calcium-dependent antibiotics are a larger class than previously thought.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt;

==History==
Malacidins were discovered by researchers at [[Rockefeller University]], led by Brad Hover and Sean Brady. The group had been looking into antibiotics related to [[daptomycin]] and their calcium-dependent nature, but determined that it would be impractical to [[Cell culture|culture]] variations in lab conditions.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; Instead, the team used a genetics approach that was more scalable.  They focused on searching for novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) – genes that are usually expressed together, that bacteria use to make secondary metabolites. To do this, they extracted DNA from around 2,000 soil samples to build [[metagenomics|metagenomic]] libraries that captured the genetic diversity of the environmental microbiome.  They then designed [[Primer (molecular biology)#Degenerate primers|degenerate primers]] to amplify genes likely to be similar to the BGC that make daptomycin by using a [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) procedure, [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] the amplified genes, and then used [[metagenomics]] to confirm that these genes were indeed likely to be the kind of BGCs they sought. One of the novel BGCs they found was present in around 19% of the screened soil samples but not readily found in cultured microbial collections, so they took that BGC, put it into other host bacteria, and then isolated and analyzed the secondary metabolites.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; The work was published in ''[[Nature Microbiology]]'' in February 2018.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/health-43032602 | title = New antibiotic family discovered in dirt | date = 13 February 2018 | access-date = 13 February 2018 | website = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research directions==
The approach of screening the soil for useful compounds using genomics has been done by others, and is likely to continue to be pursued as a method to further explore [[primary metabolite]]s and secondary metabolites made by microrganisms.&lt;ref name="wapost"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Hotz | first1 = Robert Lee | name-list-format = vanc | title = Scientists Unearth Hope for New Antibiotics | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/genetic-sequencing-unearths-hope-for-new-antibiotics-1518451201 | work=Wall Street Journal | date = 12 February 2018 | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|February}}, the malacidins had not been tested on humans. At the time of their discovery it was unknown whether the discovery would lead to any new antibiotic drugs; showing that a potential drug is safe and effective takes years of work and millions of dollars, and the scientists said at the time that they had no plans to try to develop a drug based on the work.&lt;ref name="wapost" /&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; In the 2018 paper, malacidins were shown to kill only Gram-positive bacteria and not [[Gram-negative bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Hover_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; They were, however, able to kill [[Multiple drug resistance|multidrug-resistant]] pathogens, including bacteria resistant to [[vancomycin]] in the laboratory, and [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) skin infections in an animal wound model.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

Brady, Hover, and two other authors disclosed in the 2018 paper that they had "competing financial interests, as they are employees or consultants of Lodo Therapeutics."&lt;ref name="Hover_2018" /&gt; Lodo was founded in 2016 out of Brady's laboratory, to discover new chemicals in nature as [[Drug_discovery#Nature_as_source|starting points for drug discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jarvis|first1=Lisa M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Lodo Therapeutics|url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i43/Lodo-Therapeutics.html|work=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Music]] can be described and represented in many different ways including [[sheet music]], symbolic representations, and audio recordings. For each of these representations, there may exist different versions that correspond to the same musical work. The general goal of '''music alignment''' (sometimes also referred to as '''music synchronization''') is to automatically link the various data streams, thus interrelating the multiple information sets related to a given musical work. More precisely, music alignment is taken to mean a procedure which, for a given position in one representation of a piece of music, determines the corresponding position within another representation.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_Chapter3FMP_SPRINGER&gt;

==Basic procedure==
[[File:MusicAlignment Procedure.png|thumb|300px|right|Overview of the processing pipeline of a typical music alignment procedure.]]

Given two different music representations, typical music alignment approaches proceed in two steps.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_Chapter3FMP_SPRINGER/&gt; In the first step, the two representations are transformed into sequences of suitable features. In general, such feature representations need to find a compromise between two conflicting goals. On the one hand, features should show a large degree of [[robustness]] to variations that are to be left unconsidered for the task at hand. On the other hand, features should capture enough characteristic information to accomplish the given task. For music alignment, one often uses '''[[chroma feature|chroma-based features]]''' (also called [[chromagram]]s or [[harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]]), which capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation, are being used.

In the second step, the derived feature sequences have to be brought into (temporal) correspondence. To this end, techniques related to '''[[dynamic time warping|dynamic time warping (DTW)]]''' or '''[[hidden Markov model|hidden Markov models (HMMs)]]''' are used to compute an optimal alignment between two given feature sequences.

==Related tasks==
Music alignment and related synchronization tasks have been studied extensively within the field of [[music information retrieval]]. In the following, we give some pointers to related tasks. Depending upon the respective types of music representations, one can distinguish between various synchronization scenarios. For example, audio alignment refers to the task of temporally aligning two different audio recordings of a piece of music. Similarly, the goal of score–audio alignment is to coordinate note events given in the score representation with audio data. In the  [[offline]] scenario, the two data streams to be aligned are known prior to the actual alignment. In this case, one can use global optimization procedures such as [[dynamic time warping|dynamic time warping (DTW)]] to find an optimal alignment. In general, it is harder to deal with scenarios where the data streams are to be processed online. One prominent online scenario is known as '''[[score following]]''', where a musician is performing a piece according to a given musical score. The goal is then to identify the currently played musical events depicted in the score with high accuracy and low latency.&lt;ref&gt;

In this context, alignment techniques such as hidden Markov models or particle filters have been employed, where the current score position and tempo are modeled in a statistical sense.&lt;ref&gt;

However, as a main disadvantage, an online strategy is very sensitive to local tempo variations and deviations from the score - once the procedure is out of sync, it is very hard to recover and return to the right track. A further online synchronization problem is known as '''[[Pop music automation#Automatic accompaniment|automatic accompaniment]]'''. Having a solo part played by a musician, the task of the computer is to accompany the musician according to a given score by adjusting the tempo and other parameters in real time. Such systems were already proposed some decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''National Audiovisual Conservation Center''', also known as the '''Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation''', is the [[Library of Congress|Library of Congress's]] audiovisual archive located inside Mount Pony in  [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpeper]], [[Virginia]].

==Establishment==
From 1969 to 1988, the campus was a high-security storage facility operated by the [[Federal Reserve Board]]. With the approval of the United States Congress in 1997, it was purchased by the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]] from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond]] via a $5.5 million grant, done on behalf of the Library of Congress. With a further $150 million from the [[Packard Humanities Institute]] and $82.1 million from [[United States Congress|Congress]], the facility was transformed into the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center, which completed construction in mid-2007, and after transfer of the bulk of archives, opened for scheduled tours and visitors in fall 2008. The campus offered, for the first time, a single site to store all 6.3 million pieces of the library's movie, television, and sound collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/the-library-of-congress-unlocks-the-ultimate-archive-system|title=Library of Congress Unlocks the Ultimate Archive System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, the Packard Campus (PCAVC) is just the largest part of the whole National Audio-Visual Conservation Center (NAVCC), which also consists of the Library of Congress's Motion Picture and Television Division and Recorded Sound Division reference centers on [[Capitol Hill]], the [[Mary Pickford Theater]], and any other Library of Congress audio-visual storage facilities that remain outside the Packard Campus.

The PCAVC design, named Best of 2007 by ''Mid-Atlantic Construction Magazine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://midatlantic.construction.com/projects/MA_BestOf2007.pdf|title=Mid-Atlantic Construction Magazine Best of 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved upgrading the existing bunker and creating an entirely new, below-ground entry building that also includes a large screening room, office space and research facilities. Designers BAR Architects, project-architect [[SmithGroupJJR|SmithGroup]] and landscape designers SWA Group, along with DPR Construction, Inc., collaborated in what is now the largest green-roofed commercial facility in the eastern United States, blending into the surrounding environment and ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/avconservation/packard/features.html|title=Features of Packard Campus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal Reserve Bunker==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MtPonyFedReserve.jpg|thumb|Federal Reserve site before renovation by Library of Congress (c. 1990)|right]] --&gt;
With [[Cold War]] tensions came fear that in the event of a nuclear war, the economy of the United States would be destroyed.  In response to this, the [[United States Federal Reserve]] constructed a bunker to house enough [[U.S. currency]] to replenish the cash supply east of the [[Mississippi River]] in the event of a catastrophic event.&lt;ref name="McCamley"&gt;McCamley, N.J. ''Cold War Secret Nuclear Bunkers''. Pen &amp; Sword Books Ltd, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dedicated on December 10, 1969, the {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}  radiation-hardened facility was constructed of steel-reinforced concrete one foot (30.5 centimeters) thick. Lead-lined shutters could be dropped to shield the windows of the semi-recessed facility, which is covered by {{convert|2|to|4|ft}} of dirt and surrounded by barbed-wire fences and a guard post. The seven computers at the facility, operated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, were the central node for all American electronic funds transfer activities.&lt;ref name="McCamley"/&gt;

Between 1969 and 1988, the bunker stored several billion dollars worth of U.S. currency, including a large number of $2 bills shrink-wrapped and stacked on pallets 9 feet (2.7 meters) high. Following a nuclear attack, this money was to be used to replenish currency supplies east of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref name="McCamley"/&gt;

Prior to July 1992, the bunker also served as a [[continuity of government]] facility. With a peacetime staff of 100, the site was designed to support an emergency staff of 540 for 30 days, but only 200 beds were provided in the men's and women's dormitories (to be shared on a "hot-bunk" basis by the staff working around the clock). A pre-planned menu of [[Freeze-drying|freeze-dried]] foods for the first 30 days of occupation was stored on site; private wells would provide uncontaminated water following an attack. Other noteworthy features of the facility were a cold storage area for maintaining bodies unable to be promptly buried (due to high radiation levels outside), an incinerator, indoor pistol range, and a helicopter landing pad.&lt;ref name="McCamley"/&gt;

The facility also housed the Culpeper Switch, which was the central switching station of the Federal Reserve's [[Fedwire]] electronic funds transfer system, which at the time connected only the Fed's member banks. The Culpeper Switch also served as a data backup point for member banks east of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref name="McCamley"/&gt;

==Post Cold War==
In 1988, all money was removed from Mount Pony. The Culpeper Switch ceased operation in 1992, its functions having been decentralized to three smaller sites.  In addition, its status as continuity of government site was removed.  The facility was poorly maintained by a skeleton staff until 1997 when the bunker was offered for sale.  With the approval of the [[United States Congress]], it was purchased by the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]] from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond via a $5.5 million grant, done on behalf of the [[Library of Congress]].  With a further $150 million from the Packard Humanities Institute and $82.1 million from Congress, the facility was transformed into the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center, which opened in mid-2007.  The center offered, for the first time, a single site to store all 6.3 million pieces of the library's movie, television, and sound collection.

==Campus Architecture==
The Packard Campus was designed to be a [[green building]], being situated mostly underground and topped with [[sod]] roofs. It was designed to have minimal visual impact on the Virginia countryside by blending into the existing landscape.  From the northwest, only a semi-circular terraced arcade appears in the hill to allow natural light into the administrative and work areas.  Additionally, the site also included the largest private sector re-forestation effort on the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], amassing over 9,000 tree saplings and nearly 200,000 other plantings.&lt;ref name="Packard Campus Architecture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitol.gov/html/VGN_2010061458862.html|title=Packard Campus Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avcon theater.jpg|thumb|Packard Campus Theater|left]]
The underground vaults (some set to temperatures below freezing) contain nearly {{convert|90|mi|km}} of shelving, not including 124 [[nitrate film]] vaults:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/LOC.cfm|title=Architect of the Capitol (AOC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest nitrate film storage complex in the [[Western hemisphere]].  The campus's data center is the first archive to preserve digital content at the [[petabyte]] (1 million [[gigabyte]]) level.&lt;ref name="Packard Campus Architecture"/&gt;

The campus also contains a 206-seat theater capable of projecting both film and modern digital cinema and which features a digital [[Organ (music)|organ]] that rises from under the stage to accompany [[silent film]] screenings.&lt;ref name="Packard Campus Architecture"/&gt;  The Packard Campus currently holds semi-weekly screenings of films of cultural significance in its reproduction [[Art Deco]] theater according to [https://www.loc.gov/loc/events/#eventlist9 this schedule].

==Events==

==="Mostly Lost" Silent Film Workshop===
Every summer the Packard Campus hosts the '''Mostly Lost''' identification workshop for silent films.  Unidentified or misidentified silent films and film clips are screened for registered attendees, who collectively attempt to identify the unknown works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culpepertheatre.org/mostly-lost/|title=Mostly Lost}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The films screened are not only from the Library of Congress's collections, but also from other participating film archives, which have included the [[George Eastman House]], the [[UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive]], the [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands|EYE Film Institute]] of the [[Netherlands]], the [[University of Southern California|University of Southern California's]] Hugh M. Hefner Moving Image Archive, the Lobster Film Archive, and the Newsfilm Library at the [[University of South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2014/14-100.html|title=Library's Packard Campus Hosts "Mostly Lost"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Screenings are held in the Packard Campus Theater.

The '''National Centre for Earth Science Studies'''(NCESS) ([[Malayalam]]: ദേശിയ  ഭൂമി ശാസ്ത്ര പഠന കേന്ദ്രം) is an autonomous research centre to promote scientific and technological research and development studies in the [[earth sciences]]. NCESS pursues problems related to land, sea and atmosphere. It was instituted by the government of Kerala in 1978, at [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala]]. CESS was the earliest institute in the country to embrace the concept of Earth System Science (ESS). CESS contributions over the years have enhanced knowledge of the geological evolution of south India, the complexity of coastal processes and natural hazards, as well as in proposing mitigatory measures to deal with natural hazards.

CESS carries out studies in [[river]] basin evaluation, [[ground water]] management, coastal [[erosion]], and other special problems. 
CESS does research in [[earth]] system, micro-level watershed planning, [[natural hazards]] management, [[chemical analysis]], CRZ mapping, and studies of air, water, land, [[noise pollution]], etc.

CESS also does [[environmental impact assessment]], coastal and [[estuarine]] management, [[terrain]] analysis, natural resources management, laser applications, river [[sand mining]], and microlevel planning. CESS conducts research courses leading to doctoral degree.

Recognizing the growth potential of CESS, resource constraints of the State Government and the role CESS can play in national development, the government of Kerala proposed the taking over of the institute by the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]], Government of India. An expert committee made an assessment of the scientific programs pursued by the institute and deliberated on a long term vision for the institute as a national centre. The committee recommended the taking over of CESS by the MoES and according it the status of an autonomous institute under the [[Ministry_of_Earth_Sciences|Earth System Science Organization]] (ESSO) of MoES. The proposed thrust areas of research will be [[earth's crustal evolution|crustal evolution]] and geodynamics, sedimentology and depositional processes, coastal dynamics and cloud microphysics.

The total estimated budget requirements of CESS will be Rs.128.67 crore for the balance period of the 12th FYP.

== Campus ==
The Centre for Earth Science Studies is housed in a 50,000 sq. ft building constructed in a campus of 19 acres. The development of the CESS campus in 1986 saw the transformation of an abandoned clay mining site to a beautiful green campus within one year. The campus was the vision of the founder Director Prof. C. Karunakaran, realised through the leadership of Dr. H. K. Gupta, the then director and Sri M. Sethumadhavan, the then registrar, and Dr S. Satheeschandran Nair.

The CESS building is constructed on natural gradients, slopes and excavated mining areas in a nature friendly architectural design. Buildings are spread as different blocks. Main building houses Administration, Library, Conference Hall and an auditorium. Four interconnected blocks provide seating spaces for scientists. Laboratory block houses main laboratories of all divisions with a centralised access to scientists of all disciplines. A separate building for canteen and guest house is built away from the main buzz of activity. 

The canteen functions from 9 am to 4:30 pm providing Kerala style breakfast and lunch with snacks and tea and coffee. In 2004 a laboratory block was added over the existing block to house new facilities and provide two smaller meeting and discussion halls.

'''Performance studies''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies [[Performance (disambiguation)|performance]] and uses performance as a lens to study the world. The term 'performance' is broad, and can include artistic and aesthetic performances like concerts, theatrical events, and [[performance art]]; sporting events; social, political and religious events like rituals, ceremonies, proclamations and public decisions; certain kinds of language use; and those components of identity which require someone to do, rather than just be, something. Consequently, performance studies is interdisciplinary, drawing from theories of the performing arts, anthropology and sociology, literary theory, and legal studies.

Performance Studies has been challenged as an emerging discipline. Many academics have been critical of its instability. As an academic field it is difficult to pin down; either that is the nature of the field itself or it is still too young to tell. There are, however, numerous degree-granting programs that train researchers being offered by universities. Some have referred to it as an "inter discipline" or a "post discipline".&lt;ref&gt;Schechner, Richard. "Foreword: Fundamentals of Performance Studies," Nathan Stucky and Cynthia Wimmer, eds., ''Teaching Performance Studies,'' Southern Illinois University Press, 2002. P.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance Studies tends to concentrate on a mix of research methods. The application of practice-led or practice-based research methods has become a widespread phenomenon not just in the anglophone world. As such research projects integrate established methods like literature research and oral history with performance practice, i.e. artistic autoethnographic approaches and verbatim theatre. The documentation of ''Practice-as-Research in Performance'' (PARIP), a devoted research project conducted at the University of Bristol between 2001 and 2006, offers a number of inspiring articles and portraits of such research projects and was key for a breakthrough of using creative thinking within this subject field.&lt;ref&gt;Allegue, L., Jones, S., Kershaw, B., &amp; Piccini, A. (2009). Practice-as-Research in performance and screen. Basingstoke.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and basic concepts==

Richard Schechner author of ''Performance Studies: An Introduction'' states that Performance studies examine performances in two categories: Artistic and Cultural Performances. A. Artistic Performance are marked and understood as art. solo-performance, performance art, performance of literature, theatrical storytelling, plays, and performance poetry, This category considers performance as the art form. B. Cultural Performance includes events that occur in everyday life in which a culture values are displayed for their perpetuation: rituals such as parades, religious ceremonies, community festivals, controversial storytelling, and performances of social and professional roles, and individual performances of race, gender, sexuality and class. 

===Theatre and anthropology===
Performance Studies as an academic field has multiple origin narratives. On the theatrical and anthropological front, this origin is often regarded as the research collaborations of director [[Richard Schechner]] and anthropologist [[Victor Turner]]. This origin narrative emphasizes a definition of performance as being "between theatre and anthropology" and often stresses the importance of [[intercultural]] performances as an alternative to either traditional proscenium theatre or traditional anthropological fieldwork. [[Dwight Conquergood]] developed a branch of performance ethnography that centered the political nature of the practice and advocated for methodological dialogism from the point of encounter to the practices of research reporting. [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] has contributed an interest in tourist productions and ethnographic showmanship to the field, Judd Case has adapted performance to the study of media and religion,&lt;ref&gt;Case, J. A. "Sounds from the Center: Liriel's Performance and Ritual Pilgrimage" ''Journal of Media &amp; Religion'', October 2009, 209–225.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diana Taylor (professor)|Diana Taylor]] has brought a hemispheric perspective on Latin American performance and theorized the relationship between the [[archive]] and the performance repertoire, while Corinne Kratz developed a mode of performance analysis that emphasizes the role of multimedia communication in performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kratz, Corinne A. ''Affecting Performance: Meaning, Movement and Experience in Okiek Women's Initiation'', Smithsonian Institution Press, 1994 (new edition, Wheatmark 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Laurie Frederik argues for the importance of ethnographic research and a solid theoretical base in anthropological perspective.

===Literature===
On the literature front, Wallace Bacon (1914–2001), considered by many to be the father of performance theory, taught the performance of literature as the ultimate act of humility. In his defining statement of performance theory, "Our center is in the interaction between readers and texts which enriches, extends, clarifies, and (yes) alters the interior and even the exterior lives of students [and performers and audiences] through the power of texts" (''Literature in Performance'', Vol 5 No 1, 1984; p.&amp;nbsp;84). In addition, Robert Breen's text ''[[Chamber theatre|Chamber Theatre]]'' is a cornerstone in the field for staging narrative texts, though it remains controversial in its assertions about the place of narrative details in chamber productions. Breen is also regarded by many as a founding theorist for the discipline, along with advocate Louise Rosenblatt. More recently, performance theorist and novelist [[Barbara Browning]] has suggested that narrative fiction itself—and particularly the novel—demands the performative participation of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Browning|first1=Barbara|title='Dear Reader': The Novel's Call to Perform|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1m4uWyRjvo|website=YouTube|publisher=The Book Lovers|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speech-act theory and 'performatives'===
An alternative origin narrative stresses the development of [[J.L. Austin|speech-act theory]] by philosophers [[J.L. Austin]] and [[Judith Butler]], literary critic [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], and also [[Shoshana Felman]]. The theory proposed by Austin in ''How To Do Things With Words''  states that "to say something ''is to do something'', or ''in'' saying something we do something, and even ''by'' saying something we do something".&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''How To Do Things With Words''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. P. 94&lt;/ref&gt; the most illustrative example being "I do", as part of a marriage ceremony. For any of these performative utterances to be felicitous, per Austin, they must be true, appropriate and conventional according to those with the proper authority: a priest, a judge, or the scholar, for instance. Austin accounts for the infelicitous by noting that "there will always occur difficult or marginal cases where nothing in the previous history of a conventional procedure will decide conclusively whether such a procedure is or is not correctly applied to such a case".&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''How To Do Things With Words''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. P. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of failure in performatives (utterances made with language and the body) is taken up by Butler and is understood as the "political promise of the performative".&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith. ''[[Excitable Speech : A Politics of the Performative]].'' New York: Routledge, 1997 P. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Her argument is that because the performative needs to maintain conventional power, convention itself has to be reiterated, and in this reiteration it can be expropriated by the unauthorized usage and thus create new futures. She cites Rosa Parks as an example:&lt;blockquote&gt;
When [[Rosa Parks]] sat in the front of the bus, she had no prior right to do so guaranteed by any…conventions of the South. And yet, in laying claim to the right for which she had no prior authorization, she endowed a certain authority on the act, and began the insurrectionary process of overthrowing those established codes of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;''Excitable Speech : A Politics of the Performative.'' New York: Routledge, 1997 P. 147&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The question of the infelicitous  utterance (the misfire)is also taken up by Shoshana Felman when she states "Infelicity, or failure, is not for Austin an accident of the performative, it is inherent in it, essential to it. In other words…Austin conceives of failure not as external but as internal to the promise, as what actually constitutes it."&lt;ref&gt;Felman, Shoshana ''Scandal of the Speaking Body: Don Juan with J.L. Austin, or Seduction in Two Languages'' P. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance studies has also had a strong relationship to the fields of feminism, [[psychoanalysis]], critical race theory and [[queer theory]]. Theorists like [[Peggy Phelan]],&lt;ref&gt;Phelan, Peggy. ''Unmarked: The Politics of Performance''. London; New York: Routledge, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Esteban Muñoz]],&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban. ''Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics''. University of Minnesota Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. Patrick Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Patrick Johnson. Appropriating Blackness: Performance and the Politics of Authenticity. Duke University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Schneider,&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Rebecca. ''The Explicit Body in Performance''. London ; New York: Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[André Lepecki]] have been equally influential in both performance studies and these related fields.

==Academic programs==
Performance studies incorporates theories of [[drama]], [[dance]], [[art]], [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], [[philosophy]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[comparative literature]], [[communication studies]], and increasingly, music performance.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.
Nicholas Cook and Richard Pettengill (eds.), "Taking It to the Bridge. Music as Performance", University of Michigan Press, 2013; Nicholas Cook, "Between Process and Product: Music and/as Performance", in: [http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.01.7.2/mto.01.7.2.cook.html "The Online Journal of the Society for Music Theory", Vol. 7, No. 2, April 2001]; Philip Auslander, "Music as Performance: Living in the Immaterial World," in: [http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/Auslander-Immaterial.pdf "Theatre Survey", Vol. 47, No. 4, Fall 2006]"; Melanie Fritsch and Stefan Strötgen, "Relatively Live: How to Identify Live Music Performances", in: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.5406/musimoviimag.5.1.0047?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103032208791 "Music and the Moving Image", Vol. 5 No. 1, 2012 (March), p. 47–66.]&lt;/ref&gt; More can be found out by reading Schechner's book: ''Performance Studies: An Introduction'' or in D. Soyini Madison and Judith Hamera's The Sage Handbook for Performance Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, D. Soyini and Judith Hamera, eds. The Sage Handbook for Performance Studies. SAGE 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The first performance studies department was created at [[New York University|NYU]]. However, there is some debate that the joint-cradles of Performance Studies are [[Northwestern University]] and NYU. For more information on the different origins and disciplinary traditions of performance studies see Shannon Jackson's book ''Professing Performance'' and the introductory chapter in Nathan Stucky and Cynthia Wimmer's ''Teaching Performance Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky, Nathan and Cynthia Wimmer, eds. ''Teaching Performance Studies.'' Southern Illinois University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the differences between the NYU and Northwestern models cite different disciplinary concerns. NYU is generally characterized as a program that pushed the definitions of theatrical practice influenced by the thearical avant-garde thus expanding its definition of what can be framed as an event. Interaction with departments that include [[New York University|NYU]]'s Postdoctoral Program in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy have made this an ongoing pursuit. Northwestern transitioned from an elocution and performance of literature tradition to expand its definition of presentational aesthetics beyond oral interpretation. Northwestern's unique brand of performance studies has its origins in [[anthropology]], having been started by the ethnographer [[Dwight Conquergood]] with the goal of understanding all manner of local cultures through their performance practices. In both instances a focus on practice lead to a research methodology beyond theatre or literature/speech. In the United States, the interdisciplinary and multi-focus field has spread to [[Brown University|Brown]], [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]], University of Northern Iowa, [[University of California at Irvine|UCI]],  [[University of California at Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], and elsewhere. Undergraduate and graduate programs are offered at [http://www.utexas.edu/finearts/tad/graduate-programs/performance-public-practice The University of Texas at Austin], [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]]'s [http://www.wacd.ucla.edu/ Culture and Performance Program], [http://performancestudies.ucdavis.edu/ UC Davis], [http://drama.arts.uci.edu/graduate-programs/phd/phd-program/ UC Irvine], [[Kennesaw State University]], [[Louisiana State University]], [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]], [[California State University, Northridge]], [[San Jose State University]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Maryland]], the [[University of North Carolina Chapel Hill]], and [https://pad.artsci.wustl.edu/amprogram Washington University in St. Louis]. [[Texas A&amp;M University]]'s [http://performancestudies.tamu.edu/ Department of Performance Studies] is unique in including both Music and Theatre degree programs.

In the United Kingdom [[Aberystwyth University]] offers a degree scheme in performance studies with highly acclaimed performance artists such as Mike Pearson, Heike Roms and Jill Greenhalgh. The [[University of Roehampton]] in London offers a BA in Drama, Theatre and Performance Studies. [[Richmond University]], London also offers a BA in Performance and Theatre Arts. The University of Plymouth has offered a BA in Theatre &amp; Performance since the early 1990s; its postgraduate research programme (ResM and MPhil/PhD) specialises in performance studies. The [[University of Warwick]] also offers a BA in Theatre and Performance Studies, in addition to leading Postgraduate programmes.

In Denmark [[Roskilde University]] offers a master and ph.d. degree in "performance design", focusing on subjects such as theatrical performances, live music, festivals, and urban performances.

In Germany [[University of Hamburg]] offers a master program in performance studies at the centre for performance studies run by [[Gabriele Klein]]. The Centre for Performance Studies at the [[University of Bremen]] offers a certificate in performance studies focussing on the combination of academic and artistic research within performance projects.

In India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] offers MPhil and PhD program in Theatre &amp; Performance Studies at the School of Arts &amp; Aesthetics. Since 2012, School of Culture and Creative Expressions, [[Ambedkar University Delhi]], started a MA program in Performance Studies, which focus on redefining methodologies of cultural studies and research on the basis of the nuances of performance studies. It is formulating the first Practice based PhD in the country and working extensively in the realm of Practice-as-Research. On the similar lines, the Centre for Performance Research and Cultural Studies in South Asia (CPRACSIS), Kerala have organised series of workshops and seminars over the last few years to engage scholars, artists and practitioners in conversation informed by Performance Studies.

In Australia, the [[University of Sydney]], [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]] and [[Queensland University of Technology]] offer degrees majoring in performance studies, Honours, Masters and Phd. Performance Studies in some countries is also an A-level (AS and A2) course consisting of the integration of the discrete art forms of Dance, Music and Drama in performing arts.

In Brazil, The [[Universidade Federal de Goiás]], started an interdisciplinary program (masters) in Performances Culturais (Cultural Performances) in 2012, the first in a Latin country. The goal of this program is to analyze "rituals, games, performances, drama, dance" from a cross-cultural point of view.

'''Print design''', a subset of [[graphic design]], is a form of [[visual communication]] used to convey information to an audience through intentional aesthetic design printed on a tangible surface, designed to be printed on paper, as opposed to presented on a digital platform. A design can be considered print design if its final form was created through an imprint made by the impact of a stamp, seal, or dye on the surface of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;"print, n. and adj.2." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 30 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There are several methods used to create print design artworks, spanning more than five hundred years. Printing technologies available throughout history heavily influenced the style of designs created by [[graphic designer]]s at the time of production, as different methods of creating print design offer varying features.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hollis, Richard''. Graphic Design: A Concise History''. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the emergence of the design and printing technologies of the twentieth and twenty-first century such as the [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printer]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], and [[Adobe InDesign]], print design relied on mechanical technologies such as the letterpress and lithography.

=== Letterpress ===
[[File:Letterpress from earliest days of printing (25794045595).jpg|thumb|Letterpress from the earliest days of printing]]
[[File:15020-Virgil Scott Letterpress Exhibit 4677 (16217955040).jpg|thumb|Metal type blocks arranged for printing with a letterpress]]
The [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]], perfected in the mid fifteenth century by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] (1398-1468) through the combined use of the printing press, oil-based inks, and cast metal type, remained the most common and efficient method of printing until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Eskilson, Stephen. ''Graphic Design: A New History''. New Haven: Yale UP, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Used frequently with [[typography]] design and type layout, the letterpress operates through the stamping of type and photo-engraved metal blocks on paper. The metal blocks are arranged in a frame by the printer, and the text columns and etchings are separated by vertical or horizontal metal bars; it is even possible to arrange the blocks at an angle using a letterpress.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Becker, Lutz, and Richard Hollis. ''Avant-Garde Graphics 1918-1934'': From the Merrill C. Berman Collection. London: Hayward Gallery, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; With the letterpress, print design and graphics remained black and white print on paper until the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The letterpress was the first technology that allowed for mass production and distribution of printed material at a large scale, and because of this, quickly replaced the slow processes of [[woodblock printing]] and hand copying of print design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Lithography ===
[[File:Klingenberg Lithostein.jpg|thumb|Lithographic stone artwork]]
[[Lithography]], introduced at the end of the nineteenth century, allowed for the use of color in prints and allowed artists to print on larger surfaces than the letterpress. Additionally, lithography enabled artists to draw their own lettering on designs, which was not possible with the letterpress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The design was drawn directly onto the stone by the artist, and then transferred onto the surface of the paper.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Uses ==
Print design remains prevalent in society through all forms of communicative design. The importance of printed visual design was highlighted during the first world war, as posters helped to inform and instruct the audience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A short list of print design's uses today includes:
* [[Poster]]s
* [[Brochure]]s
* Flyers
* [[Packaging and labeling|Packaging labels]]
* [[Business card]]s
* [[Book cover]]s
* Book design and layout
* [[Magazine]]s
* [[Banner]]s
* Receipts
* [[Shopping bag]]s

{{Reading}}

'''Reading education''' is the process by which individuals are taught to derive meaning from text. Schoolchildren not capable of reading competently by the end of third grade can face obstacles to success in education. The third grade marks a crucial point in reading because students start to encounter broader variety of texts in their fourth grade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/research/learning-read-reading-learn-glance|title=http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/research/learning-read-reading-learn-glance|website=www.centerforpubliceducation.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Government-funded research on reading and reading instruction in the [[United States]] began in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began publishing findings based on converging evidence from multiple studies. However, these findings have been slow to move into typical classroom practice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/jameskim/publications/research-and-reading-wars-0|title=Research and the reading wars|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Competencies for proficient reading ==

Proficient reading is equally dependent on two critical skills: the ability to understand the [[language]] in which the text is written, and the ability to recognize and process printed text. Each of these competencies is likewise dependent on lower level skills and cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/overview.html |author1=Hoover, Wesley A. |author2=Gough, Philip B. |title=Overview - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |work=The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who readily understand spoken language and who are able to fluently and easily recognize printed words do not usually have difficulty with [[reading comprehension]]. However, students must be proficient in both competencies to read well; difficulty in either domain undermines the overall reading process. At the conclusion of reading, children should be able to retell the story in their own words including characters, setting, and the events of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/framework.pdf |author=Wren, Sebastian  |title=The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reading researchers define a skilled reader as one who can understand written text as well as they can understand the same passage if spoken.

There is some debate as to whether print recognition requires the ability to perceive printed text and [[translate]] it into spoken language, or rather to [[translate]] printed text directly into meaningful symbolic models and relationships. The existence of speed reading, and its typically high comprehension rate would suggest that the translation into verbal form as an intermediate to understanding is not a prerequisite for effective reading comprehension. This aspect of reading is the crux of much of the reading debate.

The purpose of reading is to have access to the literature of a specific language. Reading materials have traditionally been chosen from literary texts that represent 'higher' forms of culture. According to many traditional approaches, the learner's aim is to study vocabulary items, grammar and sentence structures, with a concern for learning the syntax of these 'higher' cultures. These approaches assume that authentic reading material is limited to the work or experience of great authors.

== Instructional methods ==

A variety of different methods of teaching reading have been advocated in [[English-speaking countries]].
In the United States, the debate is often more political than objective.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 13"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1995 |pages=13 |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=469305891 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties often divide into two camps which refuse to accept each other's terminology or frame of reference. Despite this both camps often incorporate aspects of the other's methods. Both camps accuse the other of causing failure to learn to read and write.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 13"/&gt; [[Phonics]] advocates assert that, to read a large vocabulary of words correctly and fluently requires detailed knowledge of the structure of the English language, particularly spelling-speech patterns.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1995 |pages=23, 24 |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=469305891 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whole Language  advocates assert that students do not need to be able to sound out words, but should look at unknown words and figure them out using context.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"/&gt;

===Research===
In 2000, the [[National Reading Panel]] (NRP) issued a report based on a meta-analysis of published research on effective reading instruction. The report found varying evidence-based support for some common approaches to teaching reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phonemic awareness====
The NRP called phonemic awareness (PA) instruction "impressive":

:Overall, the findings showed that teaching children to manipulate phonemes in words was highly effective under a variety of teaching conditions with a variety of learners across a range of grade and age levels and that teaching phonemic awareness to children significantly improves their reading more than instruction that lacks any attention to PA.
:
The report singles out PA instruction based on teaching children to manipulate phonemes with letters as highly effective. Phonemic awareness instruction also improved spelling in grade-level students, although it did not improve spelling in disabled readers.

===Lexical reading===
Lexical reading&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt; involve acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using [[Whole language]] learning and teaching methodology. Sometimes argued to be in competition with phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning how to spell.

Historically, the two camps have been called [[Whole Language]] and [[Phonics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/Reading_Wars.html|title=Reading Wars: Phonics vs. Whole Language|last=Reyhner|first=Jon|website=jan.ucc.nau.edu|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although the Whole Language instructional method has also been referred to as "literature-based reading program" and "integrated language arts curriculum".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chall, Jeanne S. and Helen M. Popp, Teaching and Assessing Phonics: Why, What, When and How, Educators Publishing Service, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Currently (2007), the differing perspectives are frequently referred to as "balanced reading instruction" (Whole Language) and "scientifically-based reading instruction" (Phonics).&lt;ref&gt;Louisa Moats, Whole Language Lives On: The
Illusion of "Balanced" Reading Instruction, The Fordham Foundation, Oct 2000. Downloaded from http://www.edexcellence.net/doc/moats.pdf July 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Whole Word ====

Whole word, also known as "Sight Word" and "Look and Say", teaches reading skills and strategies in the context of authentic literature.  Word recognition accuracy is considered less important than meaning accuracy; therefore, there is an emphasis on comprehension as the ultimate goal.

Students in this method memorize the appearance of words, or learn to recognize words by looking at the first and last letter from rigidly selected vocabularies in progressive texts (such as ''The [[Cat in the Hat]]''). Often preliminary results show children taught with this method have higher reading levels than children learning phonics, because they learn to automatically recognise a small selection of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Marilyn|title=Beginning to Read:  Thinking and Learning About Print|year=1995|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later tests demonstrate that literacy development becomes stunted when hit with longer and more complex words later.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"/&gt;

===Sub-lexical reading===

The method teaches sounds to be associated with letters and combinations of letters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moats, Louisa |title=Spelling: development, disabilities, and instruction |publisher=York Press |location=Baltimore, Md |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-912752-40-8 |oclc=33404834 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Phonics]]" is distinct from the [[linguistics]] terms "[[phoneme]]" and "[[phonetics]]", which refer to sounds and the study of sounds respectively.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Varieties of phonics include:

* [[Whole language|Embedded phonics]] is an instructional approach where letter sounds are taught opportunistically, as the need arises and in meaningful contexts, such as the reading of a storybook. Embedded phonics is often associated with a whole language approach to teaching reading.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* [[Synthetic phonics]] and analytic phonics are different but popular methods of teaching phonics. Synthetic and analytic phonics approaches both generally involve explicit, carefully sequenced instruction that teach a large body of phonics patterns.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
** [[Synthetic phonics]] emphasizes the one-to-one correspondences between [[phonemes]] and [[graphemes]]. In synthetic phonics programs students say the sounds for the graphemes they see and orally blend them together to produce a spoken word. In the context of phonics, the word "[[wikt:blend|blend]]" takes on a different meaning from its use in [[linguistics]].
** In analytic phonics, students often learn phonograms, the [[syllable rime|rime]] parts of words including the vowel and what follows it. Students are taught to generalize the [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonogram]] to multiple words. The phonogram ''-ail'' can be used to read ''fail, trail, mail, wail, sail'', and other words.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The [[Samuel Orton|Orton phonography]], originally developed to teach brain-damaged adults to read, is a form of phonics instruction that blends synthetic and analytic components. Orton described 73 "phonograms", or letter combinations, and 23 rules for spelling and pronunciation which Orton claimed would allow the reader to correctly pronounce and spell all but 123 of the 13,000 most common English words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eslhq.com/forums/esl-articles/teaching-reading-121/|title=Teaching of Reading - ESL Articles - eslHQ|website=www.eslhq.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pronunciation guides ====
In contrast to phonics which teaches the pronunciation rules of English, a new technology [[Phonetically Intuitive English]] directly shows English words' pronunciation by adding diacritical marks on them. This solves the problem that pronunciation rules can often be confusing (for example, "ea" has a wide range of diverse pronunciations in "speak", "steak", "bread", "Korea", "reality", "create" and "ocean").

The pronunciation-guide approach has been proven very successful in reading education for languages with very complex orthography such as Chinese. [[Pinyin]] and [[Zhuyin]] are systems of phonetic transcription for Mandarin Chinese used in [[China]] and [[Taiwan]] respectively, and are printed above or next to Chinese characters in children's books, textbooks and newspapers as a pronunciation guide, and have enabled Chinese-speaking countries to achieve high literacy rates for one of the most difficult languages in the world.

=== Other instructional methods ===

===Guided Reading===
During guided reading teachers work with small groups of students. These are students with similar reading levels. Students will read with teachers in books at their personal reading level, not where the grade level is at. During this time the teachers will work with students to practice decoding, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension skills.

====Native reading====
Some methods of mix phonics and whole word. Native reading, for example, differs from both in that it emphasizes teaching reading beginning at a very early age, when the human brain is neurodevelopmentally most receptive to learning language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nativereading.com/introduction.html Native Reading Chapter 1] by Timothy Kailing&lt;/ref&gt; Native readers learn to read as toddlers, starting at the same time they learn to speak, or very soon thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kailing | first = Timothy D. | title = Native Reading | publisher = Elliptical Research Books |year=2008 | isbn = 978-1-4348-4881-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reading Workshop ====
Reading Workshop is based on the premise that readers need time to read and discuss their reading.  Readers need access to a wide variety of reading materials of their choice. Classrooms must acquire a wide variety of reading materials to accommodate this need. Readers need to respond to the text and demonstrate quality literate behaviors. There is not a script to follow but a frame work to guide instruction.  Students are exposed to a variety of learning experiences.  There is time for student collaboration and a time for engaged reading.&lt;ref name="Serafini"&gt;{{cite web|last=Serafini|first=Frank |url=http://www.frankserafini.com/MainPages/WorkshopHandouts.html |title=Workshop Handouts Serafini, F. (2008) |work= |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During reading workshop, the teacher models a whole-group strategy lesson and then gives students large blocks of time to read and to practice the strategy.  This practice can occur independently, with partners, or in small groups with a book or text chosen by the student.  The teacher moves around the room and confers with the students about their reading.  The teacher can meet with small, flexible groups to provide additional needs-based instruction.  At the end of the workshop the whole groups comes together to share their learning.&lt;ref name="Goudvis"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Anne Goudvis |author2=Stephanie Harvey |title=Strategies that work: teaching comprehension for understanding and engagement |publisher=Stenhouse Publishers |location=York, Me |year=2007 |pages=37–38 |isbn=1-57110-481-X |oclc=232347335 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Improving Reading===
An adult or peer reads with the student by modeling fluent reading and then asking the student to read the same passage aloud with encouragement and feedback by the adult or peer.
A student listens to a tape of a fluent reader reading text at the student's independent level at a pace of about 80-100 words a minute. The student listens to the tape the first time and then practices reading along with the tape until the student is able to read fluently.
The student reads with a peer partner. Each partner takes a turn reading to the other. A more fluent reader can be paired with a less fluent reader to model fluent reading. The more fluent reader can provide feedback and encouragement to the less fluent reader. Students of similar reading skills can also be paired, particularly if the teacher has modeled fluent reading and the partner reading involves practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Guided Oral Reading?|url=http://www.readingrockets.org/article/what-guided-oral-reading|website=Reading Rockets|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of the seven important strategies that all readers must be able to apply to text in order to read and understand content. The seven strategies are:
* 1.	Making Connections;
* 2.	Creating Mental Images;
* 3.	Making Inferences/Drawing Conclusions;
* 4.	Asking Questions;
* 5.	Determining What Is Important;
* 6.	Synthesizing; and
* 7.	Monitoring Comprehension and Meaning.&lt;ref name="Serafini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goudvis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Debbie S. |title=Reading with meaning: teaching comprehension in the primary grades |publisher=Stenhouse Publishers |location=York, Me |year=2002 |pages=53–157 |isbn=1-57110-307-4 |oclc=48773960 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reading comprehension ====
{{Main|Reading comprehension}}

Reading comprehension requires making sense of text, which allows a reader to gain knowledge, enjoy a story, and make connections with the larger world.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cain|first=Kate|title=Making Sense of Text:  Skills That Support Text Comprehension and Its Development|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2009|pages= |url=http://www.eprints.lancs.ac.uk/26618/1/Cain2009IDAPerspectives.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several skills support reading comprehension, including making predictions and inferences, monitoring understanding, using text structures, and using prior knowledge effectively.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duffy 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duffy|first=Gerald|title=Explaining Reading:  A Resource for Teaching Concepts, Skills, and Strategies|year=2009|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60623-075-6|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most important aspects of successful comprehension are activating prior knowledge and metacognition, which are two of the principles of learning identified in the National Research Council's report.''&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=M.

Many studies have identified the importance of prior knowledge in reading comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carr|first=S. C.|author2=B. Thompson |title=The Effects of Prior Knowledge and Schema Activation Strategies on the Inferential Reading Comprehension of Children With and Without Learning Disabilities|journal=Learning Disability Quarterly|year=1996|volume=19|issue=1|pages=49 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ519854&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ519854 |accessdate=2/7/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many researchers have shown that having some prior knowledge about the topic of a passage enables both greater comprehension of the text and better memory for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Priebe SJ, Keenan JM, Miller AC |title=How Prior Knowledge Affects Word Identification and Comprehension |journal=Read Writ |volume=7 |issue= |pages=581–586 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21799586 |doi=10.1007/s11145-010-9260-0 |url= |pmc=3142886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "if we have prior knowledge about a topic in a text, we construct meaning based on our experience, and we can adjust and change those plans as we go along."&lt;ref name="Duffy 2009"/&gt; Some authors specify two types of prior knowledge necessary for successful comprehension.  World knowledge aids in understanding fiction and domain-specific knowledge facilitates comprehension of nonfiction.&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNamara|first=Danielle|title=The Importance of Teaching Reading Strategies|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best-Practice Articles form the International Dyslexia Association|year=2009|pages= |url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/RtI/resources/documents/research/Teaching_Reading_Strategies_McNamara.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who lack this, request background information, so as to make connections with and within the text.&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKeown|first=Margaret|author2=Isabel Beck |author3=Ronette Blake |title=Reading Comprehension Instruction:  Focus on Content or Strategies?|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best-Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2009|pages= |url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/RtI/resources/documents/research/Rand_Report.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another learning principle that greatly influences reading comprehension is the use of metacognition.  The 'metacognitive' approach to instruction can help students learn to take control of their own learning by defining learning goals and monitoring their progress in achieving them."&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt; A great deal of research indicates that accomplished readers "monitor their comprehension as they read by engag[ing] in strategic processing, such as rereading previous text, to resolve comprehension failure."&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt; Students who are not able to track their own understanding gain neither information or enjoyment from reading as they do not know how to obtain meaning from the text.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Many strategies have been applied.&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt;  Many studies point to the success of strategy instruction, particularly for students who are poor comprehenders.&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt; Some strategies that have been helpful are summarization, question generation, making predictions and inferences, image making, knowledge and use of text structure, rereading, self-regulation, activation of prior knowledge, questioning the author, and using graphic organizers.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolman|first=Carol|title=Working Smarter, Not Harder:  What Teachers of Reading Need to Know and Be Able to Teach|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best-Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2012|pages= |url=http://www.winsorlearning.com/site/resources/articles/working-smarter-not-harder/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of strategies allows the teacher to choose a strategy or strategies to suit the text and the needs of the student.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

For an example of a specific intervention incorporating four strategies for comprehension building, utilized reciprocal teaching to model summarizing, questioning, clarifying, and predicting.&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palinscar|first1=Aannemarie Sullivan|last2=Brown|first2=Ann L.|title=Reciprocal Teaching of Comprehension-Fostering and Comprehension-Monitoring Activities|journal=Cognition and Instruction|volume=1|issue=2|year=1984|pages=117–175|issn=0737-0008|doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0102_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors indicate that they choose these skills due to their dual functions as "comprehension-fostering and comprehension monitoring activities."&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"/&gt;  The reciprocal teaching method, which involves the teacher modeling the designated activities and gradually turning the procedure over to the students themselves, uses Vygotsky's idea of scaffolding.  In this process, "children first experience a particular set of cognitive activities in the presence of experts, and only gradually come to perform these functions by themselves.&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"/&gt;  In this study, the students who participated in the reciprocal teaching intervention showed dramatic improvement in comprehension scores and maintained them for at least eight weeks.&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"/&gt;

==== Non-traditional approaches ====
Programs have been established to provide certified therapy animals, such as dogs, as non-judgmental "listeners" to build motivation and help children build proficiency and gain confidence in their reading ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westhartford.patch.com/groups/schools/p/read-benefits-all-readers-in-bugbee-classroom |title=Reading with Dogs Benefits All in Bugbee Classroom |last=Newton |first=Ronni (editor) |date=June 21, 2013 |website=West Hartford Patch |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IHPAQiGk |archivedate=July 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success rate of reading education in the US==
{{Main|Literacy in the United States}}

National literacy rates range from about 10 percent to 99+ percent.

There are several approaches used to teach reading and the U.S. Office of Education Cooperative Research Program has a compilation of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Teach Balanced Reading and Writing|last=Burns|first=Bonnie|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2006|isbn=1412937418|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is a list based on 29 individual studies that identify effective approaches when teaching reading for beginners. The bulk of the studies revealed that successful instructional strategies include [[Synthetic phonics|systematic phonics]] and approaches that focus on connected reading and meaning. These strategies were proved to be more effective than basal alone approaches. Specific studies that show instructional models that achieve high success rates in reading education include the so-called Actual Community Empowerment (ACE) program, which is a small-group tutoring framework that focuses on fluency, [[word recognition]], decoding and the concept of comprehension that is based on the appropriate pace of learning according to individual learning profiles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community Action Research: Benefits to Community Members and Service Providers|last=Reeb|first=Roger|publisher=Haworth Press|year=2006|isbn=9780789030467|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, thus, has different variations. Once ACE was implemented in 40 locations in [[Philadelphia]], learners posted a 95 percent success rate for significant reading improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Traditional reading instruction approaches that are considered effective include those under a [[Cognitive model|cognitive-based model]], which treats reading acquisition and reading comprehension to be dependent on [[Cognitive development|cognitive development.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cognitive Revolution on Educational Psychology|last=Royer|first=James|publisher=Information Age Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1593111630|location=Greenwich, CT|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Print exposure ==
[[Print exposure]] the amount of time a child or person spends being visually aware of the written word (reading)--whether that be through newspapers, magazines, books, journals, scientific papers, or more. Research has shown that the amount of print material that a child accesses has deep cognitive consequences. In addition, the act of reading itself, for the most part irrespective of what is being read, increases the achievement difference among children.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Children who are exposed to large amounts of print often have more success in reading and have a larger vocabulary to draw from than children who see less print. The average conversations among college graduates, spouses or adult friends contain less rare (advanced) words than the average preschool reading book. Other print sources have increasingly higher amounts of rare words, from children's books, to adult books, to popular magazines, newspapers, and scientific articles (listed in increasing level of difficulty). Television, even adult news shows, do not have the same level of rare words that children's books do.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012|author=Massaro, D. W.|title=Two Different Communication Genres and Implications for Vocabulary Development and Learning to Read. Journal of Literacy Research December 2015 47: 505–527, first published on February 17, 2016 .}}

The issue is that oral language is very repetitive. To learn to read effectively a child needs to have a large vocabulary. Without this, when the child does read they stumble over words that they do not know, and have trouble following the idea of the sentence. This leads to frustration and a dislike of reading. When a child is faced with this difficulty he or she is less likely to read, thus further inhibiting the growth of their vocabulary.

Children who enjoy reading do it more frequently and improve their vocabulary. A study of out-of-school reading of fifth graders, found that a student in the 50th percentile read books about 5 minutes a day, while a student in the 20th percentile read books for less than a minute a day. This same study found that the amount of time a child in the 10th percentile spent reading in two days, was the amount of time a child in the 90th percentile spent reading all year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Print exposure can also be a big factor in learning English as a second language. [[Book flood]] experiments are an example of this. The book flood program brought books in English to the classroom. Through focusing their English language learning on reading books instead of endless worksheets the teachers were able to improve the rate at which their students learned English.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Alphabetic principle and English orthography ==
{{Main|Alphabetic principle}}

Beginning readers must understand the concept of the ''alphabetic principle'' in order to master basic reading skills. A [[writing system]] is said to be ''alphabetic'' if it uses symbols to represent individual language sounds. In comparison, [[Logogram#Logographic systems|Logographic writing systems]] such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kanji]] and [[Written Chinese|Chinese]] [[Chinese characters|hanzi]] use a symbol to represent a word. And both cultures also use [[syllabary|syllabic writing systems]] such as Japanese [[kana]] and Chinese [[Yi script]], there are also many Chinese alphabets.

English is one of several languages using the [[Latin Alphabet]] [[writing system]]. The [[orthographic depth]] of such languages varies. The [[Italian orthography|Italian]] and [[Finnish language]]s have the purest, or shallowest orthographies, and [[English orthography]] is the deepest or most complex. In the shallow [[Spanish language|Spanish]] orthography; most words are spelled the way they sound, that is, word spellings are almost always regular. English orthography, on the other hand, is far more complex in that it does not have a one-to-one correspondence between symbols and sounds. English has individual sounds that can be represented by more than one symbol or symbol combination. For example, the long |a| sound can be represented by a-[[consonant]]-e as in ate, -ay as in hay, -ea as in steak, -ey as in they, -ai as in pain, and -ei as in vein. In addition, there are many words with irregular spelling and many [[homophones]] (words that sound the same but have different meanings and often different spellings as well). Pollack Pickeraz (1963) asserted that there are 45 phonemes in the [[English language]], and that the 26 letters of the English alphabet can represent them in about 350 ways.

The irregularity of English spelling is largely an artifact of how the language developed.
English is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] language with substantial influences and additional vocabulary from [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[French language|French]], among others. Imported words usually follow the spelling patterns of their language of origin.&lt;ref name="King 2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Diana Hanbury King |title=English isn't crazy!: the elements of our language and how to teach them |publisher=York Press |location=Baltimore, Md |year=2000 |pages=xii, 15|isbn=0-912752-59-9 |oclc=45166702 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced English phonics instruction includes studying words according to their origin, and how to determine the correct spelling of a word using its language of origin.

Clearly, the complexity of [[English orthography]] makes it more difficult for children to learn decoding and encoding rules, and more difficult for teachers to teach them.&lt;ref name="King 2000"/&gt; However, effective [[word recognition]] relies on the basic understanding that letters represent the sounds of spoken language, that is, word recognition relies on the reader's understanding of the [[alphabetic principle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Marilyn|title=Beginning to Read:  Thinking and Learning About Print|year=1995|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spelling reform ===

Attempts to make English spelling behave phonetically have given rise to various campaigns for [[spelling reform]]; none have been generally accepted. Opponents of simplified spellings point to the impossibility of phonetic spelling for a language with many diverse accents and dialects. Several distinguished scholars, however, have thoroughly disproven all reasonable objections to spelling reform, including this objection. See, for example, ''Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling.''&lt;ref&gt;Rondthaler, Edward and Edward J. Lias, ''Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling'' (New York: The American Language Academy, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Lounsbury presented a devastating rebuttal to all reasonable objections to spelling reform in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lounsbury, Thomas Raynesford |title=English spelling and spelling reform |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=1970 |pages=331–341 |isbn=0-8371-4264-4 |oclc=134359 |url=https://archive.org/details/englishspellings00lounuoft|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shorter rebuttal of all the reasonable objections to spelling reform was made by Bob C Cleckler in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bob C. Cleckler |title=Lets End Our Literacy Crisis: The Desperately Needed Idea Whose Time Has Come |publisher=American University &amp; Colleges Press |location=Salt Lake City |year=2005 |pages=166–170 |isbn=1-58982-230-7 |oclc=636405856 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists documenting the sounds of speech use various special symbols, of which the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is the most widely known. Linguistics makes a distinction between a [[Phone (phonetics)|phone]] and phoneme, and between [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://esl.fis.edu/grammar/langdiff/phono.htm|title=Language differences - Phonetics and phonology|last=Shoebottom|first=Paul|website=esl.fis.edu|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The study of words and their structure is [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and the smallest units of meaning are [[morpheme]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntid.rit.edu/sea/processes/wordknowledge/grammatical/whatare|title=What are Morphemes? {{!}} SEA - Supporting English Acquisition|website=www.ntid.rit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The study of the relationship between words present in the language at one time is [[etymology|synchronic etymology]], part of [[descriptive linguistics]], and the study of word origins and evolution is [[etymology|diachronic etymology]], part of [[historical linguistics]]

[[English orthography]] gives priority first to morphology, then to etymology, and lastly to phonetics. Thus the spelling of a word is dependent principally upon its structure, its relationship to other words, and its language or origin. It is usually necessary to know the meaning of a word in order to spell it correctly, and its meaning will be indicated by the similarity to words of the same meaning and family&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myenglishlanguage.com/linguistics-language-guide/english-orthography/|title=English Orthography - The English Writing System - English Spelling|work=My English Language|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[English language|English]] uses a 26 letter [[Latin alphabet]], but the number of [[grapheme]]s is expanded by several [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]], and [[tetragraph]]s, while the letter "q" is not used as a grapheme by itself, only in the digraph "qu"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theschoolrun.com/what-is-a-grapheme|title=What is a grapheme?|work=TheSchoolRun|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Each grapheme may represent a limited number of phonemes depending on [[etymology]] and location in the word. Likewise each phoneme may be represented by a limited number of graphemes. Some letters are not part of any grapheme, but function as etymological markers. Graphemes do not cross [[morpheme]] boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prowritingaid.com/art/317/What-are-Phonemes,-Graphemes,-and-Digraphs.aspx|title=What is the Difference Between a Phoneme, a Grapheme and a Digraph?|website=prowritingaid.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes are spelled consistently, following rules inflection and word-formation, and allow readers and writers to understand and produce words they have not previously encountered&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tesol-direct.com/tesol-resources/english-grammar-guide/morphemes/|title=Morphemes in English grammar {{!}} TESOL Direct|work=TESOL Direct|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Initial teaching alphabet ====
{{Main|Initial teaching alphabet}}
This method was designed to overcome the fact that English orthography has a many-to-many relationship between graphemes and phonemes. The method fell into disuse because children still had to learn the [[Latin alphabet]] and the conventional English spellings in order to integrate with society outside of school. It also recreated the problem of dialect dependent spelling, which the standardization of spelling had been created to eliminate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itafoundation.org/about-us/what-is-i-t-a/|title=Initial Teaching Alphabet Foundation {{!}}   What is i.t.a.?|website=itafoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Augmenting spelling with pronunciation information ===

Unlike spelling reforms, we can actually keep a word's original spelling intact but add pronunciation information to it, e.g. using diacritics. [[Phonetically Intuitive English]] is a Chrome browser extension that automatically adds such a pronunciation guide to English words on Web pages, for English-speaking children to recognize a written word's pronunciation and therefore map the written word to the mental word in his mind.

== Practical application ==

In practice, many children are exposed to both "Phonic" and "Whole Language" methods, coupled with reading programs that combine both elements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutlearningpress.com/whole-language-or-phonics-which-approach-is-best|title=Whole Language or Phonics: Which Approach Is Best?|website=www.allaboutlearningpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, the extremely popular book, ''Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons'', by Siegfried Engelman, et al. ({{ISBN|0-671-63198-5}}), teaches pronunciation and simple phonics, then supplements it with progressive texts and practice in directed reading. The end result of a mixed method is a casually phonetic student, a much better first-time pronouncer and speller, who still also has look-say acquisition, quick fluency and [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]]. Using an eclectic method, students can select their preferred learning style. This lets all students make progress, yet permits a motivated student to use and recognize the best traits of each method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/02/13/72233.php|title=Eclectic approach to teaching language|website=www.observerbd.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Speed reading]] continues where basic education stops. Usually after some practice, many students' reading speed can be significantly increased. There are various speed-reading techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-ferriss/speed-reading_b_5317784.html|title=How I Learned to Read 300 Percent Faster in 20 Minutes|last=Ferriss|first=Tim|date=2014-05-13|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, speed reading does not guarantee comprehension or retention of what was read.

[[Readability]] indicates the ease of understanding or comprehension due to the style of writing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profweb.ca/en/publications/articles/using-readability-analysis-to-make-students-stronger-writers|title=Using readability analysis to make students stronger writers|website=Profweb|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
[[File:Alice-gorham-burt-1905.png|upright|thumb|1905 edition cover of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland retold in words of one syllable'']]
In colonial times, reading instruction was simple and straightforward: teach children the code and then let them read. At that time, reading material was not specially written for children but consisted primarily of the Bible and some patriotic essays; the most influential early textbook was ''[[The New England Primer]],'' published late 1680s. There was little consideration for how best to teach children to read or how to assess reading comprehension.
&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1990 |pages=21–25 |isbn=0-262-01112-3 |oclc=256731826 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the mid-19th century did this approach change significantly. Educators, in particular [[Horace Mann]], began to advocate changes in reading instructional methods. He observed that children were bored and "death-like" at school, and that instruction needed to engage children's interest in the reading material by teaching them to read whole words.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; The [[McGuffey Readers]] (1836) were the most popular of these more engaging [[graded reader]]s. In the mid-19th century, [[Kate Harrington (Poet)|Rebecca Smith Pollard]] developed a sequential reading program of intensive synthetic phonics, complete with a separate teacher's manual and [[spelling]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]] books&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/reading-education-united-states/history-reading-education-us|title=History of Reading Education in the U.S. {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

From the 1890s to at least 1910, A. L. Burt of New York and other publishing companies published series of books aimed at young readers, using simple language to retell longer classics. Mrs J. C. Gorham produced three such works, ''Gulliver's Travels in words of one syllable'' (1896), ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland retold in words of one syllable]]'' (1905), and ''Black Beauty retold in words of one syllable'' (1905). In the UK, Routledge published a similar series between 1900 and 1910.

The meaning-based curriculum did not dominate reading instruction until the second quarter of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1930s and 1940s, reading programs became very focused on comprehension and taught children to read whole words by sight. [[Phonics]] was not to be taught except sparingly and as a tool to be used as a last resort.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt;

In the 1950s [[Rudolf Flesch]] wrote a book called ''Why Johnny Can't Read'',&lt;ref name="Flesch, R"&gt;{{cite book |author=Flesch, Rudolf Franz |title=Why Johnny can't read: and what you can do about it |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=0-06-091340-1 |oclc=12837722 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a passionate argument in favor of teaching children to read using [[phonics]].&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; Addressed to the mothers and fathers of America, he also hurled severe criticism at publishers' decisions that he claimed were motivated by profit, and he questioned the honesty and intelligence of experts, schools, and teachers.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; The book was on the best seller list for 30 weeks and spurred a hue and cry in general population. It also polarized the reading debate among educators, researchers, and parents.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt;

This polarization continues to the present time. In the 1970s an instructional philosophy called [[whole language]] (which de-emphasizes teaching phonics out of context) was introduced, and it became the primary method of [[Reading (process)|reading]] instruction in the 1980s and 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helpingeverychildtoread.com/index.php/causes-of-difficulty/reading-theories/whole-word-method|title=Whole Word Method|website=www.helpingeverychildtoread.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During this time, researchers (such as the [[National Institute of Health]]) conducted studies showing that early [[Learning to read|reading acquisition]] depends on the understanding of the connection between sounds and letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=256731826 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sight-word (Whole Word) method was invented by Rev. [[Thomas H. Gallaudet]], the director of the American Asylum at Hartford in the 1830s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sightwords.com/sight-words/lessons/|title=Sight Words Teaching Strategy {{!}} Sight Words: Teach Your Child to Read|website=www.sightwords.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was designed for the education of the [[Deaf]] by juxtaposing a word, with a picture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/reverend-thomas-hopkins-gallaudet.htm|title=Reverend Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|last=Vicars|first=William|website=www.lifeprint.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.In 1830, Gallaudet provided a description of his method to the American Annals of Education which included teaching children to recognize a total of 50 sight words written on cards and by 1837 the method was adopted by the Boston Primary School Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/gallaudet-thomas-hopkins3.htm|title=Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet American Sign Language (ASL)|website=www.lifeprint.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Horace Mann]] the then Secretary of the Board of Education of [[Massachusetts]], [[United States|USA]] favored the method and it soon became the dominant method statewide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/onlyateacher/horace.html|title=PBS Online: Only A Teacher: Schoolhouse Pioneers|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By 1844 the defects of the new method became so apparent to [[Boston]] schoolmasters that they issued an attack against it urging a return to an intensive, systematic phonics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/onlyateacher/horace.html|title=PBS Online: Only A Teacher: Schoolhouse Pioneers|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Again Dr. [[Samuel Orton]], a [[neuropathologist]] in [[Iowa]] in 1929 sought the cause of children's reading problems and concluded that their problems were being caused by the new sight method of teaching reading&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=View source for Reading education in the United States|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_education_in_the_United_States?action=edit|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''remnant natural area''', also known as '''remnant habitat''', is an ecological [[community (ecology)|community]] containing [[native species|native]] flora and fauna that has not been significantly [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbed]] by destructive activities such as [[agriculture]], [[logging]], [[pollution]], [[land development|development]], [[Fire_ecology#Some_examples_of_fire_in_different_ecosystems|fire]] suppression, or [[invasive species|non-native species invasion]].&lt;ref name="wiscarb"&gt;{{cite web |title=Remants and Restorations |url=https://arboretum.wisc.edu/explore/remnants/ |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more disturbed an area has been, the less characteristic it becomes of remnant habitat. Remnant areas are also described as "[[biological integrity|biologically intact]]" or "ecologically intact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Defining wilderness |url=https://www.wild.org/how-we-work/policy-mgmt/defining-wilderness/ |website=wild.org |publisher=WILD Foundation |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remnant natural areas are often used as [[reference ecosystem]]s in [[ecological restoration]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=McDonald |first1=T. |last2=Gann |first2=G. D. |last3=Jonson |first3=J. |last4=Dixon |first4=K. W. |title=International Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration - Including Principles and Key Concepts |url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.ser.org/resource/resmgr/docs/SER_International_Standards.pdf |publisher=Society for Ecological Restoration |accessdate=2018-08-20 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
A remnant natural area can be described in terms of its natural quality or [[biological integrity]], which is the extent to which it has the internal [[biodiversity]] and [[abiotic]] elements to replicate itself over time.&lt;ref name=fotcr17&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Gerould |authorlink1=Gerould Wilhelm |last2=Rericha |first2=Laura |authorlink2=Laura Rericha |date=2017 |title=Flora of the Chicago Region: A Floristic and Ecological Synthesis |publisher=Indiana Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition of biological integrity is "the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a [[species]] composition, [[species diversity|diversity]], and functional organization comparable to that of the natural [[habitat]] of the region."&lt;ref name="karr1981"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=J. R. |last2=Dudley |first2=D. R. |title=Ecological perspectives on water quality goals |journal=Environmental Management |date=1981 |volume=5 |pages=55-68 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x96t510nu2418348/fulltext.pdf |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abiotic elements determining the quality of a natural area may include factors such as hydrologic connectivity or fire. In areas that have been [[dredging|dredged]], [[drainage|drained]], or [[dam|dammed]], the altered hydrology can [[habitat destruction|destroy]] a remnant natural area. Similarly, too much or too little [[fire ecology|fire]] can degrade or destroy a remnant natural area.&lt;ref name="fotcr17"/&gt;

Remnant natural areas are characterized by the presence of "[[Floristic_Quality_Assessment#Coefficient_of_Conservatism|conservative]]" plants and animals—organisms that are restricted to or highly characteristic of areas that have not been disturbed by humans.&lt;ref name=swink1994&gt;{{cite book |last1=Swink |first1=Floyd |authorlink1=Floyd Swink |last2=Wilhelm |first2=Gerould  |date=1994 |title=Plants of the Chicago Region}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools to measure aspects of natural areas quality in remnant areas include [[Floristic Quality Assessment]] and the [[Macroinvertebrate Community Index]].

==Examples==
In the upper [[Midwestern United States]], remnant natural areas date prior to [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlement]], going back to the end of the [[Wisconsinian Glaciation]] approximately 15,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="wiscarb"/&gt; Diverse remnant plant community examples in that region include [[tallgrass prairie]], [[beech-maple forest]], [[Eastern savannas of the United States|savannas]], [[bog]]s, and [[fen]]s.&lt;ref name="heggen2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heggen |first1=Katy |title=Remnant Prairie: A closer look at Iowa's rarest landscape |url=http://www.inhf.org/blog/blog/remnant-prairie-a-closer-look-at-iowas-rarest-landscape/ |accessdate=2018-08-20 |publisher=Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation |date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remnant natural areas in [[Illinois]] have largely been classified by the [[Illinois Natural Areas Inventory]] as Category I "high quality terrestrial or wetland natural communities."&lt;ref name="white1978"&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=J. |title=Illinois Natural Areas Inventory, Technical Report |date=1978 |publisher=Illinois Natural Areas Inventory |location=Urbana, IL |url=https://archive.org/details/technicalreporti12univ |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], remnant habitats are sometimes called "[[bushland]]," and include communities such as forest, woodland, grasslands, [[Mallee_(biogeographic_region)|mallee]], coastal [[heathland]], and [[rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Save the Bush: General Information: What is remnant vegetation? |url=http://www.uralla.nsw.gov.au/files/uploaded/file/Environment/Road%20Side%20Vegetation/What%20is%20remnant%20vegetation%20NPWS%20Information%20Sheet%20No%201.pdf |publisher=National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eglise Saint-Ayoul Provins retable maitre-autel.jpg|thumb|On one strict definition, this French 17th-century construction is a retable rather than a reredos, as it is all one construction]] 
A '''retable''' is a structure or element placed either on or immediately behind and above the [[altar]] or [[communion table]]&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Retable |volume=23 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a church. At the minimum it may be a simple shelf for candles behind an altar, but it can also be a large and elaborate structure. A retable which incorporates sculptures or painting is often referred to as an [[altarpiece]].

According to the Getty ''Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online'', "A 'retable' is distinct from a '[[reredos]]'; while the reredos typically rises from ground level behind the altar, the retable is smaller, standing either on the back of the altar itself or on a pedestal behind it. Many altars have both a reredos and a retable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=retable&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300076035 ''Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online''] 'Retable'&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is not always upheld in common use, and the terms are often confused or used as synonyms. In several foreign languages, such as [[French language|French]] (also using 'retable'), the usage is different, usually equating the word with the English 'reredos' or 'altarpiece', and this often leads to confusion, and incorrect usage in translated texts. The [[Medieval Latin]] ''retrotabulum'' (modernized ''retabulum'') was applied to an architectural feature set up at the back of an altar, and generally taking the form of a screen framing a picture, carved or sculptured work in wood or stone, or [[mosaic]], or of a movable feature such as the  ''[[Pala d'Oro]]'' in [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]], of gold, jewels and enamels.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The non-English word "retable" therefore often refers to what should in English be called a [[reredos]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The situation is further complicated by the frequent modern addition of free-standing altars in front of the old integrated altar, to allow the celebrant to face the congregation, or be closer to it. 

[[Dossal]]' is another term that may overlap with both retable and reredos; today it usually means an altarpiece painting rising at the back of the altar to which it is attached, or a cloth usually hanging on the wall directly behind the altar.

The cognate Spanish term, ''[[retablo]]'', refers also to a reredos or retrotabulum, although in the specific context of Mexican folk art it may refer to any two-dimensional depiction (usually a framed painting) of a saint or other Christian religious figure, as contrasted with a ''[[bulto]]'', a three-dimensional statue of same.

The retable may hold the [[altar cross]], mostly in Protestant churches, as well as candles, flowers and other things.

Riken conducts research in many areas of science, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[medical science]], [[engineering]], [[high-performance computing]] and [[computer science|computational science]], and ranging from [[basic research]] to [[applied research|practical applications]] with 485 partners worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riken.jp/en/outreach/research/&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost entirely funded by the [[Japanese government]], and its annual [[budget]] is about ¥88 billion (US$760 million).{{when|date=June 2016}}

==History==
[[Image:RIKEN building in Taisho period.JPG|thumb|Riken in the [[Taishō period]]]]
[[Image:RIKEN VITAMIN.png|thumb|A 1938 ad for Riken Vitamin A]]
In 1913, the well-known scientist [[Jokichi Takamine]] first proposed the establishment of a national science research institute in Japan. This task was taken on by Viscount [[Shibusawa Eiichi]], a prominent businessman, and following a resolution by the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] in 1915, Riken came into existence in March 1917. In its first incarnation, Riken was a private foundation (''zaidan''), funded by a combination of industry, the government, and the [[Japanese royal family|Imperial Household]]. It was located in the Komagome district of [[Tokyo]], and its first Director was the mathematician Baron [[Dairoku Kikuchi]].

In 1927, Viscount [[Masatoshi Ōkōchi]], the third Director, established the Riken Konzern (a [[zaibatsu]]). This was a group of spin-off companies that used Riken's scientific achievements for commercial ends and returned the profits to Riken. At its peak in 1939 the Konzern comprised about 121 factories and 63 companies, including Riken Kankōshi, which is now [[Ricoh]].

During [[World War II]] the [[Japanese atomic program|Japanese army's atomic bomb program]] was conducted at Riken. In April 1945 the US bombed Riken's laboratories in Komagome, and in November, after the end of the war, Allied soldiers destroyed its two [[cyclotron]]s.

After the war, the Allies dissolved Riken as a private foundation, and it was brought back to life as a company called {{nihongo |Kagaku Kenkyūjyo|科学研究所}}, or {{nihongo|Kaken|科研}}. In 1958 the Diet passed the Riken Law, whereby the institute returned to its original name and entered its third incarnation, as a {{nihongo |public corporation|特殊法人|tokushu hōjin}}, funded by the government. In 1963 it relocated to a large site in [[Wakō, Saitama|Wakō]] in [[Saitama Prefecture]], just outside [[Tokyo]].

Since the 1980s Riken has expanded dramatically. New labs, centers, and institutes have been established in Japan and overseas, including:
* in 1984, the Life Science Center in [[Tsukuba]]
* in 1995, the Muon Research Facility at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]
* in 1997, the [[Harima]] Institute, the Brain Science Institute in Wako, and the center at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in the [[United States|USA]]
* in 1998, the Genomic Sciences Center
* in 2000, the Yokohama Institute, which now contains four centers for research in the life sciences

In October 2003, Riken's status changed again, to [[Independent Administrative Institution]]. As such, Riken is still publicly funded, and it is periodically evaluated by the government, but it has a higher degree of autonomy than before. Riken is regarded as the flagship research institute in Japan and conducts basic and applied experimental research in a wide range of science and technology fields including physics, chemistry, medical science, biology and engineering.

Riken was the subject of international attention in 2014 after the [[Stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency cell]] (also known as '''STAP''') publication, investigation, retraction, and suicide of [[Yoshiki Sasai]], the principal investigator. Observers, journalists, and former members of Riken have stated that the organization is riddled with unprofessional and inadequate scientific rigor and consistency, and that this is reflective of serious issues with scientific research in Japan in general.&lt;ref&gt;Otake, Tomoko, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/04/20/national/stapgate-shows-japan-must-get-back-to-basics-in-science/#.U1WkzMKRVZI 'STAPgate' shows Japan must get back to basics in science]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 21 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/07/05/national/media-national/ongoing-obokata-story-seeks-scandal/#.U7qcsY2KB9A Ongoing Obokata story seeks out scandal]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 5 July 2014, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sacramento Delta at flood stage, 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta|Sacramento (California) Delta]] at flood stage, early-March 2009]]
A '''river delta''' is a [[landform]] that forms from [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] of [[sediment]] carried by a [[river]] as the flow leaves its [[river mouth|mouth]] and enters slower-moving or stagnant water.&lt;ref&gt;Miall, A. D. 1979. Deltas. in R. G. Walker (ed) Facies Models. Geological Association of Canada, Hamilton, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, T. 1986. Deltas. in H. G. Reading (ed.). Sedimentary environments and facies. Backwell Scientific Publications, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs where a river enters an [[ocean]], [[sea]], [[estuary]], [[lake]], [[reservoir]], or (more rarely) another river that cannot carry away the supplied sediment. The size and shape of a delta is controlled by the balance between watershed processes that supply sediment, and receiving basin processes that redistribute, sequester, and export that sediment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = M.D. | last2 = Tornqvist | first2 = T.E. | year = 2000 | title = Fluvial responses to climate and sea-level change: a review and look forward | url = | journal = Sedimentology | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 2–48 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-3091.2000.00008.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|last2=Brush|first2=Grace S.|last3=Hilgartner|first3=William B.|date=2001-04-01|title=Impact of historic land-use change on sediment delivery to a Chesapeake Bay subestuarine delta|journal=[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=409–427|doi=10.1002/esp.189|issn=1096-9837}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size, geometry, and location of the receiving basin also plays an important role in delta evolution. River deltas are important in human civilization, as they are major agricultural production centers and population centers. They can provide coastline defense and can impact drinking water supply.&lt;ref name="Anthony 53–78"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Edward J.|date=2015-03-01|title=Wave influence in the construction, shaping and destruction of river deltas: A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025322714003788|journal=Marine Geology|volume=361|pages=53–78|doi=10.1016/j.margeo.2014.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also ecologically important, with different species' assemblages depending on their landscape position.

== Formation ==
[[File:Delta Formation.svg|thumb|Delta forms where river meets lake&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA19071 |title=How a Delta Forms Where River Meets Lake |date=2014-08-12 |access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or [[reservoir]], (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This [[alluvium]] builds up to form the river delta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/tidal-freshwater-deltas/tfd-modeling/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack – Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics :: TFD Modeling|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its [[stream channel|channel]] and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to [[sediment transport|transport sediment]]. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and [[deposition (geology)|deposits]]. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the [[gradient]] of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see [[slope]]).

As the slope of the river channel decreases, it becomes unstable for two reasons. First, gravity makes the water flow in the most direct course down slope. If the river breaches its natural levees (i.e., during a flood), it spills out into a new course with a shorter route to the ocean, thereby obtaining a more stable steeper slope.&lt;ref name="SlingerlandSmith"&gt;Slingerland, R. and N. D. Smith (1998), "Necessary conditions for a meandering-river avulsion," ''Geology'' (Boulder), 26, 435–438.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, as its slope gets lower, the amount of shear stress on the bed decreases, which results in deposition of sediment within the channel and a rise in the channel bed relative to the floodplain. This makes it easier for the river to breach its levees and cut a new channel that enters the body of standing water at a steeper slope. Often when the channel does this, some of its flow remains in the abandoned channel. When these channel-switching events occur, a mature delta develops a [[distributary]] network.

Another way these distributary networks form is from deposition of [[Shoal#Harbour and river bars|mouth bars]] (mid-channel sand and/or gravel bars at the mouth of a river). When this mid-channel bar is deposited at the mouth of a river, the flow is routed around it. This results in additional deposition on the upstream end of the mouth-bar, which splits the river into two distributary channels. A good example of the result of this process is the [[Wax Lake Delta]].

In both of these cases, depositional processes force redistribution of deposition from areas of high deposition to areas of low deposition. This results in the smoothing of the planform (or map-view) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment. Because the sediment is laid down in this fashion, the shape of these deltas approximates a fan. The more often the flow changes course, the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan, because more rapid changes in channel position results in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front. The Mississippi and Ural River deltas, with their bird's-feet, are examples of rivers that do not [[Avulsion (river)|avulse]] often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape. [[Alluvial fan]] deltas, as seen by their name, avulse frequently and more closely approximate an ideal fan shape.

Deltas are typically classified according to the main control on deposition, which is a combination of river, [[wind wave|wave]], and [[tide|tidal]] processes,&lt;ref name="Galloway1975"&gt;Galloway, W.E., 1975, Process framework for describing the morphologic and stratigraphic evolution of deltaic depositional systems, in Brousard, M.L., ed., Deltas, Models for Exploration: Houston Geological Society, Houston, Texas, p. 87– 98.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the strength of each.&lt;ref&gt;Perillo, G. M. E. 1995. Geomorphology and Sedimentology of Estuaries. Elsevier Science B.V., New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orton | first1 = G.J. | last2 = Reading | first2 = H.G. | year = 1993 | title = Variability of deltaic processes in terms of sediment supply, with particular emphasis on grain size | url = | journal = Sedimentology | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 475–512 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1993.tb01347.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave-dominated deltas ===
In wave dominated deltas, wave-driven sediment transport controls the shape of the delta, and much of the sediment emanating from the river mouth is deflected along the coast line.&lt;ref name="Galloway1975" /&gt; The relationship between waves and river deltas is quite variable and largely influenced by the deepwater wave regimes of the receiving basin. With a high wave energy near shore and a steeper slope offshore, waves will make river deltas smoother. Waves can also be responsible for carrying sediments away from the river delta,  causing the delta to retreat.&lt;ref name="Anthony 53–78" /&gt; For deltas that form further upriver in an estuary, there are complex yet quantifiable linkages between winds, tides, river discharge, and delta water levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/tidal-freshwater-deltas/tfd-hydrometeorology/|title=Dr. Gregory B.

[[File:Ganges River Delta, Bangladesh, India.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Ganges Delta]] in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] is the largest delta in the world, and one of the most fertile regions in the world.]]

=== Tide-dominated deltas ===
Erosion is also an important control in tide-dominated deltas, such as the [[Ganges Delta]], which may be mainly submarine, with prominent sandbars and ridges. This tends to produce a "dendritic" structure.&lt;ref name="Fagherazzi2008"&gt;Fagherazzi S., 2008, Self-organization of tidal deltas, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 105 (48): 18692–18695,&lt;/ref&gt; Tidal deltas behave differently from a river- and wave-dominated deltas, which tend to have a few main distributaries.  Once a wave- or river-dominated distributary silts up, it is abandoned, and a new channel forms elsewhere. In a tidal delta, new distributaries are formed during times when there is a lot of water around – such as floods or [[storm surge]]s. These distributaries slowly silt up at a more or less constant rate until they fizzle out.&lt;ref name="Fagherazzi2008" /&gt;

=== Gilbert deltas ===
A Gilbert delta (named after [[Grove Karl Gilbert]]) is a specific type of delta formed from coarse sediments, as opposed to gently-sloping muddy deltas such as that of the Mississippi. For example, a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta.&lt;ref name=maine&gt;[http://www.maine.gov/doc/nrimc/mgs/explore/surficial/facts/dec03.htm Characteristics of deltas].

=== Tidal freshwater deltas ===
A tidal freshwater delta&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/tidal-freshwater-deltas/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack – Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics :: Tidal Freshwater Deltas|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a sedimentary deposit formed at the boundary between an upland stream and an estuary, in the region known as the "subestuary".&lt;ref&gt;Pasternack, G. B. 1998. Physical dynamics of tidal freshwater delta evolution.  Ph. D. Dissertation. The Johns Hopkins University, 227pp, 5 appendices.&lt;/ref&gt; Drowned coastal river valleys that were inundated by rising sea levels during the late Pleistocene and subsequent Holocene tend to have dendritic estuaries with many feeder tributaries. Each tributary mimics this salinity gradient from their brackish junction with the mainstem estuary up to the fresh stream feeding the head of tidal propagation. As a result, the tributaries are considered to be "subestuaries". The origin and evolution of a tidal freshwater delta involves processes that are typical of all deltas&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as well as processes that are unique to the tidal freshwater setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|last2=Hilgartner|first2=William B.|last3=Brush|first3=Grace S.|date=2000-09-01|title=Biogeomorphology of an upper Chesapeake Bay river-mouth tidal freshwater marsh|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1672/0277-5212(2000)0202.0.CO;2|journal=Wetlands|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=520–537|doi=10.1672/0277-5212(2000)020&lt;0520:boaucb&gt;2.0.co;2|issn=0277-5212}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B|last2=Brush|first2=Grace S|date=2002-03-01|title=Biogeomorphic controls on sedimentation and substrate on a vegetated tidal freshwater delta in upper Chesapeake Bay|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X01001398|journal=Geomorphology|volume=43|issue=3–4|pages=293–311|doi=10.1016/s0169-555x(01)00139-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of processes that create a tidal freshwater delta result in a distinct morphology and unique environmental characteristics. Many tidal freshwater deltas that exist today are directly caused by the onset of or changes in historical land use, especially deforestation, intensive agriculture, and urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|last2=Brush|first2=Grace S.|date=1998-09-01|title=Sedimentation cycles in a river-mouth tidal freshwater marsh|journal=Estuaries|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=407–415|doi=10.2307/1352839|issn=0160-8347|jstor=1352839|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/61w6m8kc|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are well illustrated by the many tidal freshwater deltas prograding into Chesapeake Bay along the east coastline of the United States. Research has demonstrated that the accumulating sediments in this estuary derive from post-European settlement deforestation, agriculture, and urban development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gottschalk | first1 = L.

=== Estuaries ===
Other rivers, particularly those on coasts with significant [[tidal range]], do not form a delta but enter into the sea in the form of an [[estuary]].  Notable examples include the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the [[Tagus]] estuary.

=== Inland deltas ===
[[File:OkavangoDelta.png|thumb|right|Okavango Delta]]In rare cases the river delta is located inside a large valley and is called an [[inverted river delta]]. Sometimes a river divides into multiple branches in an inland area, only to rejoin and continue to the sea. Such an area is called an ''inland delta'', and often occurs on former lake beds. The [[Inner Niger Delta]] and [[Peace–Athabasca Delta]] are notable examples. The [[Amazon River|Amazon]] also has an inland delta before the island of [[Marajó]], and the [[Danube]] has one in the valley on the Slovak-Hungarian border between [[Bratislava]] and [[Iža]].

In some cases, a river flowing into a flat arid area splits into channels that evaporate as it progresses into the desert. [[Okavango Delta]] in [[Botswana]] is one well-known example.

=== Mega deltas ===
The generic term ''mega delta'' can be used to describe very large Asian river deltas, such as the [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze]], [[Pearl River Delta|Pearl]], [[Red River Delta|Red]], [[Mekong Delta|Mekong]], [[Irrawaddy Delta|Irrawaddy]], [[Ganges Delta|Ganges-Brahmaputra]], and [[Indus River Delta|Indus]].

== Sedimentary structure ==
[[File:Line5066 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Delta on [[Kachemak Bay]] at low tide]]
The formation of a delta is complicated, multiple, and cross-cutting over time, but in a simple delta three main types of bedding may be distinguished: the bottomset beds, foreset/frontset beds, and topset beds. This three part structure may be seen in small scale by [[crossbedding]].&lt;ref name=maine /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.G.A Whitten, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Geology'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The bottomset beds are created from the lightest suspended particles that settle farthest away from the active delta front, as the river flow diminishes into the standing body of water and loses energy. This suspended load is deposited by [[sediment gravity flow]], creating a [[turbidite]]. These beds are laid down in horizontal layers and consist of the finest grain sizes.
*The foreset beds in turn are deposited in inclined layers over the bottomset beds as the active lobe advances. Foreset beds form the greater part of the bulk of a delta, (and also occur on the lee side of [[sand dunes]]).&lt;ref name="BatesDict"&gt;Robert L. Bates, Julia A. Jackson, ''Dictionary of Geological Terms'' [[American Geological Institute|AGI]] (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The sediment particles within foreset beds consist of larger and more variable sizes, and constitute the [[bed load]] that the river moves downstream by rolling and bouncing along the channel bottom. When the bed load reaches the edge of the delta front, it rolls over the edge, and is deposited in steeply dipping layers over the top of the existing bottomset beds. Under water, the slope of the outermost edge of the delta is created at the [[angle of repose]] of these sediments. As the foresets accumulate and advance, [[Wiktionary:subaqueous|subaqueous]] landslides occur and readjust overall slope stability. The foreset slope, thus created and maintained, extends the delta lobe outward. In cross section, foresets typically lie in angled, parallel bands, and indicate stages and seasonal variations during the creation of the delta.
*The topset beds of an advancing delta are deposited in turn over the previously laid foresets, truncating or covering them. Topsets are nearly horizontal layers of smaller-sized sediment deposited on the top of the delta and form an extension of the landward alluvial plain.&lt;ref name="BatesDict" /&gt; As the river channels meander laterally across the top of the delta, the river is lengthened and its gradient is reduced, causing the suspended load to settle out in nearly horizontal beds over the delta's top. Topset beds are subdivided into two regions: the upper delta plain and the lower delta plain. The upper delta plain is unaffected by the tide, while the boundary with the lower delta plain is defined by the upper limit of tidal influence.&lt;ref&gt;Hori, K. and Saito, Y. ''Morphology and Sediments of Large River Deltas''. Tokyo, Japan: Tokyo Geographical Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of deltas ==
[[File:EbroRiverDelta ISS009-E-09985.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[Ebre]] River delta at the [[Mediterranean Sea]]]]

The [[Ganges]]/[[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] combination delta, which spans most of [[Bangladesh]] and empties into the Bay of Bengal, is the world's largest delta.

The [[St. Clair River]] delta, between the Canadian province of [[Ontario]] and the U.S. state of [[State of Michigan|Michigan]], is the largest delta emptying into a body of fresh water.

== Ecological threats to deltas ==
Human activities, such as the creation of [[dam]]s for [[hydroelectric]] power or to create [[reservoir]]s can radically alter delta ecosystems.  Dams block sedimentation, which can cause the delta to erode away.  The use of water upstream can greatly increase salinity levels as less fresh water flows to meet the salty ocean water.  While nearly all deltas have been impacted to some degree by humans, the [[Nile Delta]] and [[Colorado River Delta]] are some of the most extreme examples of the ecological devastation caused to deltas by damming and diversion of water. Construction, irrigation, and land alteration have impacted delta formation. As humans have altered surface roughness, runoff, and groundwater storage, studies have shown river delta retreat. However, historical data documents show that during the Roman Empire and Little Ice Age (times where there was considerable anthropogenic pressure), there were significant sediment accumulation in deltas. The industrial revolution has only amplified the impact of humans on delta growth and retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maselli |first1=Vittorio |last2=Trincardi |first2=Fabio |date=2013-05-31 |title=Man made deltas |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01926 |journal=Scientific Reports |language=en |volume=3 |pages=1926 |doi=10.1038/srep01926 |issn=2045-2322 |pmc=3668317 |pmid=23722597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deltas in the economy ==
Ancient deltas are a benefit to the economy due to their well sorted [[sand]] and [[gravel]]. Sand and gravel is often quarried from these old deltas and used in concrete for [[highways]], buildings, sidewalks, and even landscaping. More than 1 billion tons of sand and gravel are produced in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;Mineral Information Institute. 2011. Sand and Gravel. {{cite web |url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/photosandgr.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006200708/http://www.mii.org/Minerals/photosandgr.html |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all sand and gravel quarries are former deltas, but for ones that are, much of the sorting is already done by the power of water.

As lowlands often adjacent to urban areas, deltas often comprise extensive industrial and commercial areas as well as agricultural land.  These uses are often in conflict.  The [[Fraser Delta]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada, includes the [[Vancouver Airport]] and the [[Roberts Bank Superport]] and the [[Annacis Island]] industrial zone, and a mix of commercial, residential and agricultural land.  Space is so limited in the [[Lower Mainland]] region, and in British Columbia in general, which is very mountainous, that the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] was created to preserve agricultural land for food production.

== Deltas on Mars ==
Researchers have found a number of examples of deltas that formed in Martian lakes.  Finding deltas is a major sign that Mars once had large amounts of water.  Deltas have been found over a wide geographical range.  Below are pictures of a few.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin III, R. et al.  2005.  An intense terminal epoch of widespread fluvial activity on early Mars:  2. Increased runoff and paleolake development.  Journal of Geophysical Research: 10. E12S15&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3479">'''Saudi Arabian art''' should be understood in the light of the country being the birthplace of [[Islam]] and to include both the arts of Bedouin nomads and those of the sedentary peoples of regions such as the [[Hejaz]], [[Tihamah]], [[Asir]] and the [[Najd]].

==Architecture==
The first mosque of Islam was the house of the Islamic prophet [[Mohammed]] in [[Medina]]. It is the prototype of all later sacred architecture of Islam. In it are most important the floor and carpet that are touched in prayer with the head.&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr: ''Islamic Art and Spirituality'', Albany, 1987, p. 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different regional styles of architecture in Saudi Arabia, and they are divided into different styles. In the Najd region, most buildings are made of mud-brick covered by mud-plaster. In the Hijaz region, most buildings are made of coral rag and wood, with roofs made of palm thatch and wooden beams. There are many Ottoman influences on the architecture in this region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Al-Hufud regions, the houses are usually two or three stories and they surround a central courtyard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Asir region, many houses are made of rough-cut stone, and other houses are made of a stone and mud combination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Visual arts==
Tribal symbols referred to as "wusum" were carved by Bedouins during prehistoric times and are found as rock art in the hills and deserts of [[Arabia]]. During the years 1985-1990l there was a rock art and epigraphic survey of Saudi Arabia. During this time, over 1000 rock art sites were recorded. In the earlier stages of rock art, there were large human and animal faces, and in the later stages the human and animals faces were smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=Majeed|date=1991|title=Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabic Studies|jstor=41223107|journal=Twenty Fourth Seminar for Arabian Studies, Oxford|volume=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art Movement==
The Art Movement in Saudi Arabia started in the mid 60's by a group of School Art Teachers and lasted till mid 80's.

In 1972 Mohammed Said Farsi became the mayor of the coastal city of Jeddah, making the city one of the largest open-air art galleries in the world.

== Portable art forms ==
There are many portable art forms in Saudi Arabia. For example, there is metalware, jewelry, pottery and leatherwork. Even today, many Bedouin women weave, and they make brightly colored striped rugs, camel trapping and tents. The tents are black and are made of goat-hair, mixed with sheep’s wool and camel-hair.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T076144.|title=Saudi Arabia|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2011|website=Oxford Art Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science Week Ireland''' is an annual week-long event in Ireland each November, celebrating [[science]] in our everyday lives. Science Week is an initiative of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahlstrom|first1=Dick|title=Science Week offers parents a look at alternative paths for students|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/innovation/science-week-offers-parents-a-look-at-alternative-paths-for-students-1.3292760|website=The Irish Times Online|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the largest science festival in the country, engaging tens of thousands of members of the general public in workshops, science shows, talks, laboratory demonstrations, science walks and other science-related events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Events|url=http://www.sfi.ie/events/|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Week is a collaboration of events involving industry, colleges, schools, libraries, teachers, researchers and students throughout Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key objective of Science Week is to inspire young people to take up careers in area|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/key-objective-of-science-week-is-to-inspire-young-people-to-take-up-careers-in-area-1.1971458|website=Irish Times Online|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Science Week supports Science Foundation Ireland’s mission to catalyse, inspire and guide the best in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) education and public engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SFI Discover Funding Programme|url=http://www.sfi.ie/engagement/sfi-discover/|website=sfi.ie|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate aim of this effort is that Ireland will have the most engaged and scientifically informed public by 2020 as outlined in Science Foundation Ireland’s strategy Agenda 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Agenda2020|url=http://www.sfi.ie/resources/Agenga-2020.pdf|website=sfi.ie|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also aligns to the national science innovation strategy, Innovation 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovation 2020|url=https://dbei.gov.ie/en/Publications/Innovation-2020.html|publisher=Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Over the years, Science Week Ireland has grown from a small pilot initiative to a large promotional and event engine to its current identity as a recognised vehicle for regional activity supported by a national promotional campaign.&lt;ref name="oak1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahlstrom|first1=Dick|title=Science Week: From small acorn to giant oak tree . . .|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sponsored/science-week-from-small-acorn-to-giant-oak-tree-1.2403471|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The first Science Week in Ireland was held in 1996.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; It was organised by Forfás on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation under the name 'Information Technology and Science Week'. The week aimed to raise general awareness of the benefits of science and information technology to people, young and old throughout society. In 1997 it was renamed as Science Week. Professional bodies, voluntary groups, colleges, businesses and the public sector combined to organise 50 events countrywide.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; Events included conferences, lectures, interactive exhibitions, debates, and competitions for primary school students. 

SFI took over Science Week from the Forfás Discover Science and Engineering programme in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New legislation to focus scientific research on turning good ideas into good jobs|url=https://www.irishbuildingmagazine.ie/2012/12/12/new-legislation-to-focus-scientific-research-on-turning-good-ideas-into-good-jobs|publisher=Irish Building Magazine|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Week continued to grow and develop over the following years into what it represents today, a week-long&lt;ref name="sfi ie1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Week|url=http://www.sfi.ie/engagement/science-week/|website=sfi.ie|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebration of STEM public engagement, enhancing the public’s interest in STEM and enabling them to see the relevance of STEM to their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Discover Programme Call 2017|url=http://www.sfi.ie/funding/funding-calls/sfi-discover-programme/1.-SFI-Discover-Programme-Call-2017-FINAL.pdf|website=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soreq Nuclear Reactor 1960.jpg|thumb|250px|Reactor building under construction in 1960.]]
The '''Soreq Nuclear Research Center''' ({{lang-he|המרכז למחקר גרעיני - שורק}}) is a research and development institute situated near the localities of [[Palmachim]] and [[Yavne]] in Israel. It operates under the auspices of the [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]] (IAEC). The center conducts research in various physical sciences, particularly the development of many kinds of sensors, [[laser]]s, atmospheric research, [[Nondestructive testing|non-destructive testing]] techniques, space environment, nuclear safety, medical diagnostics and [[nuclear medicine]]. It is also one of three facilities in Israel which produce various types of [[radiopharmacology|radiopharmacuticals]] for use by health care organizations throughout the country.

The institute houses a wide array of laboratories and research facilities including an [[American Machine and Foundry|AMF]] 5 [[megawatt|MW]] [[Pool-type reactor|pool-type]] light water [[nuclear reactor]] supplied in the late 1950s from the United States under the [[Atoms for Peace]] program,&lt;ref name=archdaily&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/398642/ad-classics-soreq-nuclear-research-center-philip-johnson/ Soreq Nuclear Research Center / Philip Johnson], Gili Merin, ArchDaily, 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; a 10 [[MeV]] [[proton]] [[cyclotron]] accelerator, and a continuous wave, 5-40 MeV, 0.04-5 mA proton and deuteron superconducting [[Linear particle accelerator|linear accelerator]] – the first phase of which was commissioned in 2013 (''see also:'' [[SARAF – Soreq Applied Research Accelerator Facility]]).

Commissioned by the Israeli government in 1956, the reactor building was designed by American architect [[Philip Johnson]].&lt;ref name=archdaily/&gt; With its distinctive brutalist style, it has appeared on stamps and was one of Johnson's favorite buildings, though security precautions prevented him from visiting the completed structure while in Israel in 1966.&lt;ref name=archdaily/&gt;

The Center is named after the nearby stream of [[Brook of Sorek|Soreq]].

The Center operates under the [[IAEA safeguards|safeguards]] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Research Center - Soreq|url=http://iaec.gov.il/English/Soreq/Pages/default.aspx|website=Israel Atomic Energy Commission website|publisher= [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]]|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triple Award Science''' is the name for a course in the United Kingdom which delivers three separate [[GCSE]]s in Biology, Chemistry and Physics although it's commonly referred to as "Triple Science".

The course is usually studied throughout Years 10 and 11 (Years 11 and 12 in Northern Ireland) but may be started in the later stages of Year 9 (Year 10 in Northern Ireland). The course provides the broadest coverage of the main three science subjects at [[Key Stage 4]] available, and incorporates the compulsory programme of study for Science.

The course is offered by the five main awarding bodies in the United Kingdom; [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]], [[Edexcel]], [[OCR (examination board)|OCR]], [[Cambridge International Examinations|CIE]] and [[WJEC (exam board)|WJEC]]. In Northern Ireland the awarding board is [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment|CCEA]].

There are 3 different types of science:
*Chemistry 
*Biology 
*Physics

==OCR==
[[OCR (examination board)|OCR]] have awarded a Triple Science award since 2007 through their 21st Century Science program. The course aims to develop scientific literacy.

For the 2012 specifications, OCR's singular award science has 3 modules of work. In their double award there are 6 modules. Their Triple Science Award has 7 modules for each science, which are made up of the six modules from double award and an extra one module from each science.
* The Biology module is called "Biology across the Ecosystem"
* The Chemistry module is called "Chemistry for a Sustainable World"
* The Physics module is called "Observing the Universe".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.21stcenturyscience.org/the-courses/triple-science,1423,NA.html&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the exam boards offering triple science have new specifications with first examinations in June 2018. Many schools will begin teaching this to their year 9 in 2015-16. Other schools will begin teaching the new specifications to year 10 in September 2016.

'''Writeprint''' is a method in [[forensic linguistics]] of establishing author identification over the internet, likened to a digital fingerprint.  Identity is established through a comparison of distinguishing [[stylometry|stylometric]] characteristics of an unknown written text with known samples of the suspected author ([[writer invariant]]s).  Even without a suspect, writeprint provides potential background characteristics of the author, such as nationality and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Jiexun|last2=Zheng|first2=Rong|last3=Chen|first3=Hsinchun|title=From Fingerprint to Writeprint|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=April 2006|volume=49|issue=4|pages=76–82|doi=10.1145/1121949.1121951|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1121951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five broad aspects to author identification in writeprint:  
:*lexical features- The analysis of the [[lexicon]], the author's choice of vocabulary.  
:*syntactic features- The analysis of the author's writing style and sentence structure, such as: punctuation, use of passive voice, and sentence complexity.
:*structural features- The analysis of the author's organization of the work.  These include paragraph length, spacing, and indentation.  
:*content-specific features- The analysis of the language that is contextually significant to subject of the written work.  Examples include the use of slang or acronyms that are specific to a crime like pirating software or hacking.
:*idiosyncratic features- The analysis of errors and other ungrammatical elements that may be unique to the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbasi|first1=Ahmed|last2=Chen|first2=Hsinchun|last3=Nunamaker Jr.|first3=Jay F.|title=Stylometric Identification in Electronic Markets: Scalability and Robustness|journal=Journal of Management Information System|date=Summer 2008|volume=25|issue=1|pages=49–78|jstor=40398926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the five features above are the traditional methods of author identification, there are features unique to online text. Features such as choice in font, the use of emojis, and links to other websites all provide a path to identification which is absent in traditional text analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rehmeyer|first1=Juli|title=Digital Fingerprints|journal=Science News|date=Jan 13, 2007|volume=171|issue=2|pages=26–28|jstor=3982506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2009). In ''Penguin dictionary of psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference database&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was introduced, but not fully developed, by psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896&amp;ndash;1934) during the last ten years of his life.&lt;ref name="bioBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A.

Vygotsky: ''Mind in Society: Development of Higher Psychological Processes'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky and some other educators believe that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning such as skills and strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Berk, L &amp; Winsler, A. (1995).  Vygotsky also felt that social interaction was very important when it came to learning. "Vygotsky: His life and works" and "Vygotsky's approach to development".  In ''Scaffolding children's learning: Vygotsky and early childhood learning''. Natl. Assoc for Educ. Of Young Children. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Lev Vygotsky 1896-1934.jpg|thumb|Lev Vygotsky 1896-1934]]

The concept of the zone of proximal development was originally developed by Vygotsky to argue against the use of academic, knowledge-based tests as a means to gauge students' intelligence. He also created ZPD to further develop [[Jean Piaget]]'s theory of children being lone learners.&lt;ref name="Scaffolding"&gt;''Zone of Proximal Development'' and ''Cultural Tools Scaffolding, Guided Participation'', 2006. In ''Key concepts in developmental psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference Database&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky spent a lot of time studying the impact of school instruction on children and noted that children grasp language concepts quite naturally, but that maths and writing don’t come naturally, that these are concepts taught in schools and tend to come along with some difficulty, while Piaget believed that there was a clear distinction between development and teaching. He said that development is a spontaneous process that is initiated and completed by the children, stemming from their own efforts. Piaget was a proponent of independent thinking and critical of the standard teacher-led instruction that was common practice in schools.&lt;ref name="Theories"&gt;Crain, W. (2010). Theories of development: Concepts and applications, 6th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, Vygotsky saw natural, spontaneous development as important, but not all-important. He believed that children would not advance very far if they were left to discover everything on their own. It's crucial for a child's development that they are able to interact with more knowledgeable others. They would not be able to expand on what they know if this wasn't possible. He noted cultural experiences where children are greatly helped by knowledge and tools handed down from previous generations. Vygotsky noted that good teachers shouldn't present material that is too difficult and “pull the students along.”&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt;

Vygotsky argued that, rather than examining what a student knows to determine intelligence, it is better to examine their ability to solve problems independently and ability to solve problems with an adult's help.&lt;ref&gt;Berk, L &amp; Winsler, A. (1995).  "Vygotsky: His life and works" and "Vygotsky's approach to development".  In ''Scaffolding children's learning: Vygotsky and early childhood learning''. Natl. Assoc for Educ. of Young Children. pp. 25&amp;ndash;34&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a question: "if two children perform the same on a test, are their levels of development the same?" He concluded that they were not.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Stages of development. (2010). In Curriculum connections psychology: Cognitive development. Retrieved from Credo Reference Database&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vygotsky's untimely death interrupted his work on the zone of proximal development, and it remained mostly incomplete.&lt;ref name="Zaretskii 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaretskii|first=V. K.|title=The Zone of Proximal Development What Vygotsky Did Not Have Time to Write|journal=Journal of Russian and East European Psychology|date=November–December 2009|volume=47|issue=1061–0405/2010 $9.50 + 0.00.|pages=70–93|doi=10.2753/RPO1061-0405470604|url=http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=The+Zone+of+Proximal+Development&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Russian+and+East+European+Psychology&amp;rft.au=Zaretskii%2C+V+K&amp;rft.date=2009-11-01&amp;rft.pub=M+E+Sharpe+Inc&amp;rft.issn=1061-0405&amp;rft.volume=47&amp;rft.issue=6&amp;rft.spage=70&amp;rft.epage=93&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.2753%2FRPO1061-0405470604&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=10_2753_RPO1061_0405470604|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Since Vygotsky's original conception, the definition for the zone of proximal development has been expanded and modified. The zone of proximal development is an area of learning that occurs when a person is assisted by a teacher or peer with a higher skill set.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The person learning the skill set cannot complete it without the assistance of the teacher or peer. The teacher then helps the student attain the skill the student is trying to master, until the teacher is no longer needed for that task.&lt;ref&gt;Burkitt, E. (2006). Zone of proximal development. In ''Encyclopaedic dictionary of psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference database&lt;/ref&gt;

Any function within the zone of proximal development matures within a particular internal context that includes not only the function’s actual level but also how susceptible the child is to types of help, the sequence in which these types of help are offered, the flexibility or rigidity of previously formed stereotypes, how willing the child is to collaborate, along with other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Bozhovich, E. D. (2009). Zone of Proximal Development: The Diagnostic Capabilities and Limitations of Indirect Collaboration. Journal of Russian &amp; East European Psychology, 47(6), 48-69. Retrieved from EBSCOHost Database&lt;/ref&gt; This context can impact the diagnosis of a function’s potential level of development.&lt;ref name="Zaretskii 2009" /&gt;

Vygotsky stated that we can’t just look at what students are capable of doing on their own; we have to look at what they are capable of doing in a social setting. In many cases students are able to complete a task within a group before they are able to complete it on their own. He notes that the teacher’s job is to move the child’s mind forward step-by-step (after all, teachers can’t teach complex chemical equations to first-graders). At the same time, teachers can’t teach all children equally; they must determine which students are ready for which lessons.&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt; An example is the often-used [[Accelerated Reader|accelerated reading]] program in schools. Students are assessed and given a reading level and a range. Books rated below their level are easy to read, while books above their level challenge the student. Sometimes students are not even allowed to check out books from the school library that are outside their range. Vygotsky argued that a major shortcoming of [[standardized test]]s is that they only measure what students are capable of on their own, not in a group setting where their minds are being pushed by other students.&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt;

In the context of [[Second-language acquisition|second language learning]], the ZPD can be useful to many adult users. Prompted by this fact as well as the finding that adult peers don't necessarily need to be more capable to provide assistance in the ZPD, Vygotsky’s definition has been adapted to better suit the adult L2 developmental context &lt;ref&gt;Fani, Tayebeh &amp; Ghaemi, Farid. (2011). Implications of Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) in Teacher Education: ZPTD and Self-scaffolding. Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences. 29. 1549-1554. 10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.11.396. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Scaffolding==

The concept of the ZPD is widely used to study children's mental development as it relates to education. The ZPD concept is seen as a [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]], a structure of "support points" for performing an action.&lt;ref&gt;Obukhova, L. F., &amp; Korepanova, I. A. (2009). The Zone of Proximal Development: A Spatiotemporal Model. ''Journal of Russian &amp; East European Psychology'', 47(6), 25-47. {{doi|10.2753/RPO1061-0405470602}}&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to the help or guidance received from an adult or more competent peer to permit the child to work within the ZPD.&lt;ref name="Morgan, A. 2009"&gt;Morgan, A. (2009, July 28). What is "Scaffolding" and the "ZPD"? Retrieved October 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Vygotsky himself never mentioned the term, scaffolding was first developed by [[Jerome Bruner]], David Wood, and Gail Ross, while applying Vygotsky's concept of ZPD to various educational contexts.&lt;ref name="Scaffolding"/&gt; According to Wass and Golding, giving students the hardest tasks they can do with scaffolding leads to the greatest learning gains.&lt;ref name="Wass"&gt;Wass, R., &amp; Golding, C. (2014). Sharpening a tool for teaching: the zone of proximal development. ''Teaching in Higher Education'', 19(6), 671-684.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scaffolding is a process through which a teacher or a more competent peer helps a student in their ZPD as necessary and tapers off this aid as it becomes unnecessary—much as workers remove a scaffold from a building after they complete construction. "Scaffolding [is] the way the adult guides the child's learning via focused questions and positive interactions."&lt;ref&gt;Balaban, Nancy. (1995). "Seeing the Child, Knowing the Person." In Ayers, W. ''To Become a Teacher''. Teachers College Press. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been further developed by [[Mercedes Chaves Jaime]], [[Ann Brown]], among others. Several instructional programs were developed based on this interpretation of the ZPD, including [[reciprocal teaching]] and [[dynamic assessment]]. For scaffolding to be effective, one must start at the child's level of knowledge and build from there.&lt;ref name="Morgan, A. 2009"/&gt; 

One example of children using ZPD is when they are learning to speak. As their [[speech]] develops, it influences the way the child thinks, which in turn influences the child's manner of speaking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This process opens more doors for the child to expand their vocabulary. As they learn to convey their thoughts in a more effective way, they receive more sophisticated feedback, therefore increasing their vocabulary and their speaking skills. Wells gives the example of dancing: when a person is learning how to dance, they look to others around them on the dance floor and imitate their moves. A person does not copy the dance moves exactly, but takes what they can and adds their own personality to it.&lt;ref name="Wells 1999"&gt;Wells, G. (1999). ''Dialogic Inquiries in education: Building on the legacy of Vygotsky''. Cambridge University Press. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

In mathematics, proximal development uses [[mathematical exercise]]s for which students have seen one or more worked examples. In secondary school some scaffolding is provided, and generally much less at the tertiary level. Ultimately students must find library resources or a tutor when presented with challenges beyond the zone.

Another example of scaffolding is learning to drive. Parents and [[driving]] instructors guide driving students along the way by showing them the mechanics of how the car operates, the correct hand positions on the steering wheel, the technique of scanning the roadway, etc. As the student progresses, less and less instruction is needed, until they are ready to drive on their own.

The concept of scaffolding can be observed in various life situations and arguably in the basis of how everyone learns. One does not (normally) begin knowing everything that there is to know about a subject. The basics must be learned first so one can build on prior knowledge towards mastery of a particular subject or skill. 

== Implications for educators ==
Various investigations, using different approaches and research frameworks have proved collaborative learning to be effective in many kinds of settings and contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, P., Wineburg, S., &amp; Woolworth, S. (2001). Toward a theory of teacher community. ''[[Teachers College Record]]'', ''103''(6), 942-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers should assign tasks that students cannot do on their own, but which they can do with assistance; they should provide just enough assistance so that students learn to complete the tasks independently and then provide an environment that enables students to do harder tasks than would otherwise be possible.&lt;ref name="Wass" /&gt; Teachers can also allow students with more knowledge to assist students who need more assistance. Especially in the context of collaborative learning, group members who have higher levels of understanding can help the less advanced members learn within their zone of proximal development. &lt;ref&gt;McLeod, S. A. (2012). Zone of proximal development. Retrieved from www.simplypsychology.org/Zone-of-Proximal-Development.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of adults, peers should challenge each other in order to support collaboration and success.&lt;ref&gt;Kuusisaari, H. (2014). Teachers at the zone of proximal development: Collaboration promoting or hindering the development process. ''Teaching and Teacher Education'', ''43'', 46-57.&lt;/ref&gt;
