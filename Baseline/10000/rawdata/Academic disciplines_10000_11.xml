      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5146">{{Advanced Placement}}
In the United States, '''Advanced Placement Computer Science''' is a suite of [[Advanced Placement]] courses and examinations covering areas of [[computer science]]. They are offered by the [[College Board]] to [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]] students as an opportunity to earn college credit for [[college]]-level courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement | title = Credit &amp; Placement | work = AP Students | publisher = The [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suite consists of two current classes and one discontinued class.

AP Computer Science was taught in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] for the 1984–1998 exams, in [[C++]] for 1999–2003, and in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsi.thecubscientist.com/05_DailySchedule/historyAPCS.pdf|title=AP Computer Science: A Brief History|last=Lew|first=Michael|date=|website=Thecubscientist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Computer Science Principles==
[[AP Computer Science Principles]] is an introductory course to computer science, "with a focus on how computing powers the world".&lt;ref name=CSPcoursedetails&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles/course-details | title = AP Computer Science Principles: Course Details | work = AP Students | publisher = The College Board | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed as a parallel to AP Computer Science A, to emphasize [[computational thinking]] and fluency. It is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computer science.

AP Computer Science Principles was introduced in the 2016–2017 school year.

==AP Computer Science A==
[[AP Computer Science A]] is a programming class.&lt;ref name=CSAcoursedetails&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/course-details | title = AP Computer Science A: Course Details | work = AP Students | publisher = The College Board  | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The course emphasizes [[object-oriented programming]] methodology, especially problem solving and [[algorithm]] development, plus an overview of data structures and abstraction. The [[AP Computer Science A]] exam tests students on their knowledge of [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

It is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computer science. 

The [[Microsoft]]-sponsored program [[Technology Education and Literacy in Schools]] (TEALS) aims to increase the number of students taking AP Computer Science classes.&lt;ref name="Bishop2012-07-27"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bishop |first=Todd |date=2012-07-27 |title=Geek of the Week: Kevin Wang is putting computer scientists into high schools |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/kevin-wang/ |newspaper=[[GeekWire]] |accessdate=2015-07-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Zo1zm7iP?url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/kevin-wang/ |archivedate=2015-07-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Computer Science AB (discontinued)==
[[AP Computer Science AB]] included all the topics of AP Computer Science A, as well as a more formal and a more in-depth study of [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], and [[data abstraction]]. For example, [[binary trees]] were studied in AP Computer Science AB but not in AP Computer Science A. The use of [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] data structures and [[dynamic allocation|dynamically allocated]] structures were fundamental to AP Computer Science AB. 

AP Computer Science AB was equivalent to a full-year college course.&lt;ref name=CSABhomepage&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/8153.html | title = AP Computer Science AB Course Home Page | work = AP Central | publisher = The College Board | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516202349/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/8153.html | archive-date = May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to low numbers of students taking the exam, AP Computer Science AB was discontinued following the May 2009 exam administration.&lt;ref name=CSABdiscontinued&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195948.html | title = Important Announcement about AP Computer Science AB | work = AP Central | publisher = The College Board | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409195847/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195948.html | archive-date = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cech | first = Scott J. | url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2008/04/09/32ap.h27.html | title = College Board Intends to Drop AP Programs in Four Subjects | work = Education Week | date = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''architecture of Mesopotamia''' is ancient architecture of the region of the Tigris–Euphrates river system (also known as [[Mesopotamia]]), encompassing several distinct cultures and spanning a period from the 10th millennium BC, when the first permanent structures were built, to the 6th century BC. Among the Mesopotamian architectural accomplishments are the development of [[urban planning]], the [[courtyard house]], and [[ziggurat]]s. No architectural profession existed in Mesopotamia; however, scribes drafted and managed construction for the government, nobility, or royalty.

==Building materials==
Sumerian masonry was usually mortarless although [[bitumen]] was sometimes used. Brick styles, which varied greatly over time, are categorized by period.&lt;ref&gt;Harmansah, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

*Patzen 80×40×15&amp;nbsp;cm: Late [[Uruk period]] (3600&amp;ndash;3200 BC)
*Riemchen 16×16&amp;nbsp;cm: Late [[Uruk period]] (3600&amp;ndash;3200 BC)
*Plano-convex 10x19x34 cm: [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer|Early Dynastic Period]] (3100&amp;ndash;2300 BC)

The favored design was rounded bricks, which are somewhat unstable, so Mesopotamian bricklayers would lay a row of bricks perpendicular to the rest every few rows. The advantages to plano-convex bricks were the speed of manufacture as well as the irregular surface which held the finishing plaster coat better than a smooth surface from other brick types.

Bricks were sun baked to harden them. These types of bricks are much less durable than oven-baked ones so buildings eventually deteriorated. They were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This planned structural life cycle gradually raised the level of cities, so that they came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resulting mounds are known as [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]s, and are found throughout the ancient Near East. Civic buildings slowed decay by using cones of colored stone, terracotta panels, and [[clay nail]]s driven into the adobe-brick to create a protective sheath that decorated the façade. Specially prized were imported building materials such as cedar from [[Lebanon]], [[diorite]] from [[Arabia]], and [[lapis lazuli]] from [[India]].

Babylonian temples are massive structures of crude brick, supported by [[buttress]]es, the rain being carried off by drains. One such drain at [[Ur]] was made of lead. The use of brick led to the early development of the [[pilaster]] and column, and of [[fresco]]es and enamelled tiles. The walls were brilliantly colored, and sometimes plated with [[zinc]] or gold, as well as with tiles. Painted ''[[terra-cotta]]'' cones for torches were also embedded in the plaster. Assyria, imitating Babylonian architecture, also built its palaces and temples of brick, even when stone was the natural building material of the country&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; faithfully preserving the brick platform, necessary in the marshy soil of Babylonia, but little needed in the north.

[[File:Human headed winged bull facing.jpg|thumb|right|An Assyrian [[lamassu]], [[Bas-relief]] c. 713–716 BC]]
As time went on, however, later Assyrian architects began to shake themselves free of Babylonian influence, and to use stone as well as brick. The walls of Assyrian palaces were lined with sculptured and coloured slabs of stone, instead of being painted as in [[Chaldea]]. Three stages may be traced in the art of these ''bas-reliefs'': it is vigorous but simple under [[Ashurnasirpal II]], careful and realistic under [[Sargon II]], and refined but wanting in boldness under [[Ashurbanipal]].

In Babylonia, in place of the ''bas relief'', there is greater use of three-dimensional figures in the round&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the earliest examples being the statues from [[Girsu]], that are realistic if somewhat clumsy. The paucity of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious, and led to a high perfection in the art of gem-cutting. Two seal-cylinders from the age of [[Sargon of Akkad]] are among the best examples of their kind. One of the first remarkable specimens of early [[metallurgy]] to be discovered by archaeologists is the silver vase of [[Entemena]]. At a later epoch, great excellence was attained in the manufacture of such jewellery as earrings and bracelets of gold. Copper, too, was worked with skill; indeed, it is possible that Babylonia was the original home of copper-working.

The people were famous at an early date for their embroideries and rugs. The forms of Assyrian pottery are graceful; the porcelain, like the glass discovered in the palaces of [[Nineveh]], was derived from Egyptian models. Transparent glass seems to have been first introduced in the reign of Sargon. Stone, clay and glass were used to make vases, and vases of hard stone have been dug up at Girsu similar to those of the early dynastic period of Egypt.

The study of ancient Mesopotamian architecture is based on available [[archaeological]] evidence, pictorial representation of buildings, and texts on building practices. According to [[Archibald Sayce]], the primitive pictograms of the [[Uruk period]] era suggest that "Stone was scarce, but was already cut into blocks and seals. Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities, forts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a tower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a hinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a larger scale, and seems to have been double. ... Demons were feared who had wings like a bird, and the foundation stones&amp;nbsp;– or rather bricks&amp;nbsp;– of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them."&lt;ref name="Sayce"&gt;[[Archibald Sayce|Sayce, Rev. A. H.]], Professor of Assyriology, Oxford, [https://archive.org/stream/archaeologyofcun00sayc/archaeologyofcun00sayc_djvu.txt "The Archaeology of the Cuneiform Inscriptions"], Second Edition-revised, 1908, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London, Brighton, New York; at pages 98–100 [https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofcun00sayc Not in copyright]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly literature usually concentrates on the architecture of temples, palaces, city walls and gates, and other monumental buildings, but occasionally one finds works on residential architecture as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sally|last=Dunham|chapter=Ancient Near Eastern architecture|title=A Companion to the Ancient Near East|editor=Daniel Snell|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell|year=2005|pages=266–280|isbn=0-631-23293-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological surface surveys also allowed for the study of urban form in early Mesopotamian cities.

==Urban planning==
{{Main|Urban history}}
The Sumerians were the first society to construct the city itself as a built form. They were proud of this achievement as attested in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] which opens with a description of [[Uruk]]—its walls, streets, markets, temples, and gardens. Uruk itself is significant as the center of an urban culture which both colonized and urbanized western Asia.

The construction of cities was the end product of trends which began in the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The growth of the city was partly planned and partly organic. Planning is evident in the walls, high temple district, main canal with harbor, and main street. The finer structure of residential and commercial spaces is the reaction of economic forces to the spatial limits imposed by the planned areas resulting in an irregular design with regular features. Because the Sumerians recorded real estate transactions it is possible to reconstruct much of the urban growth pattern, density, property value, and other metrics from cuneiform text sources.

The typical city divided space into residential, mixed use, commercial, and civic spaces. The residential areas were grouped by profession.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 2004, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of the city was a high temple complex always sited slightly off of the geographical center. This high temple usually predated the founding of the city and was the nucleus around which the urban form grew. The districts adjacent to gates had a special religious and economic function.

The city always included a belt of irrigated agricultural land including small hamlets. A network of roads and canals connected the city to this land. The transportation network was organized in three tiers: wide processional streets (Akkadian:''sūqu ilāni u šarri''), public through streets (Akkadian:''sūqu nišī''), and private blind alleys (Akkadian:''mūṣû''). The public streets that defined a block varied little over time while the blind-alleys were much more fluid. The current estimate is 10% of the city area was streets and 90% buildings.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2009"&gt;Baker, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The canals; however, were more important than roads for good transportation.

==Houses==
The materials used to build a Mesopotamian house were similar but not exact as those used today: mud brick, mud plaster and wooden doors, which were all naturally available around the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Nicholas Postgate, J N Postgate|title=Early Mesopotamia: Society and Economy at the Dawn of History|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; although wood was not common in some cities of Sumer. Most houses had a square center room with other rooms attached to it, but a great variation in the size and materials used to build the houses suggest they were built by the inhabitants themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/282/5393/1442 |title=The first cities: Why Settle Down? The Mystery of Communities  |doi=10.1126/science.282.5393.1442 |accessdate=2010-04-17 |volume=282 |journal=Science |page=1442}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest rooms may not have coincided with the poorest people; in fact, it could be that the poorest people built houses out of perishable materials such as reeds on the outside of the city, but there is very little direct evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Susan Pollock|title=Ancient Mesopotamia|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential design was a direct development from [[Ubaid house]]s. Although Sumerian [[cylinder seal]]s depict [[Mudhif|reed house]]s, the [[courtyard house]] was the predominant typology, which has been used in Mesopotamia to the present day. This house called ''[[É (temple)|é]]'' ([[Cuneiform]]: {{cuneiform|&amp;#x1208D;}}, {{transl|Xsux|E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}; [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; {{lang-akk|bītu}}) faced inward toward an open courtyard which provided a cooling effect by creating convection currents. This courtyard called ''tarbaṣu'' (Akkadian) was the primary organizing feature of the house, all the rooms opened into it. The external walls were featureless with only a single opening connecting the house to the street. Movement between the house and street required a 90° turn through a small antechamber. From the street only the rear wall of the antechamber would be visible through an open door, likewise there was no view of the street from the courtyard. The Sumerians had a strict division of public and private spaces. The typical size for a Sumerian house was 90 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2009"/&gt;

==Palace==
The [[palace]] came into existence during the Early Dynastic I period. From a rather modest beginning the palace grows in size and complexity as power is increasingly centralized. The palace is called a 'Big House' (Cuneiform: E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.GAL Sumerian e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gal Akkdian: ''ekallu'') where the [[lugal]] or [[Ensí|ensi]] lived and worked.

The palaces of the early Mesopotamian elites were large-scale complexes, and were often lavishly decorated. Earliest known examples are from the [[Diyala River]] valley sites such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar. These third millennium BC palaces functioned as large-scale socio-economic institutions, and therefore, along with residential and private functions, they housed craftsmen workshops, food storehouses, ceremonial courtyards, and are often associated with shrines. For instance, the so-called "giparu" (or Gig-Par-Ku in Sumerian) at Ur where the Moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]'s priestesses resided was a major complex with multiple courtyards, a number of sanctuaries, burial chambers for dead priestesses, and a ceremonial banquet hall. A similarly complex example of a Mesopotamian palace was excavated at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in [[Syria]], dating from the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] period.

Assyrian palaces of the Iron Age, especially at Kalhu/[[Nimrud]], Dur Sharrukin/[[Khorsabad]] and Ninuwa/[[Nineveh]], have become famous due to the [[Assyrian palace reliefs]], extensive pictorial and textual narrative programs on their walls, all carved on stone slabs known as [[orthostat]]s. These pictorial programs either incorporated cultic scenes or the narrative accounts of the kings' military and civic accomplishments. Gates and important passageways were flanked with massive stone sculptures of apotropaic mythological figures, ''[[lamassu]]'' and [[winged genie]]s. The architectural arrangement of these Iron Age palaces were also organized around large and small courtyards. Usually the king's throne room opened to a massive ceremonial courtyard where important state councils met and state ceremonies were performed.

Massive amounts of [[Nimrud Ivories|ivory furniture pieces]] were found in some Assyrian palaces pointing to an intense trade relationship with North Syrian [[Neo-Hittite]] states at the time. Bronze repousse bands decorated the wooden gates of major buildings, but were mostly looted at the fall of the empire; the [[Balawat Gates]] are the principal survivors.

==Temples==
{{see|É (temple)}}
Temples often predated the creation of the urban settlement and grew from small one room structures to elaborate multiacre complexes across the 2,500 years of Sumerian history. Sumerian temples, fortifications, and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques, such as [[buttress]]es, [[wiktionary:recess|recesses]], and [[Column|half column]]s. Chronologically, Sumerian temples evolved from earlier [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] temples. As the temple decayed it was ritually destroyed and a new temple built on its foundations. The successor temple was larger and more articulated than its predecessor temple. The evolution of the [[É (temple)|E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.abzu]] temple at [[Eridu]] is a frequently cited case-study of this process. Many temples had inscriptions engraved into them, such as the one at [[Tell Uqair]]. Palaces and city walls came much later after temples in the [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer|Early Dynastic Period]].

The form of a Sumerian temple is manifestation of Near Eastern [[cosmology]], which described the world as a disc of land which was surrounded by a salt water ocean, both of which floated on another sea of fresh water called [[apsu]], above them was a hemispherical firmament which regulated time. A world mountain formed an [[axis mundi]] that joined all three layers. The role of the temple was to act as that axis mundi, a meeting place between gods and men.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, 1983 p205-208&lt;/ref&gt; The sacredness of 'high places' as a meeting point between realms is a pre-Ubaid belief well attested in the Near East back the Neolithic age. The plan of the temple was rectangular with the corners pointing in cardinal directions to symbolize the four rivers which flow from the mountain to the four world regions. The orientation also serves a more practical purpose of using the temple roof as an observatory for Sumerian timekeeping. The temple was built on a low terrace of [[rammed earth]] meant to represent the sacred mound of primordial land which emerged from the water called dukug, 'pure mound' (Sumerian: du&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-ku&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Cuneiform:) during creation.

The doors of the long axis were the entry point for the gods, and the doors of the short axis the entry point for men. This configuration was called the bent axis approach, as anyone entering would make a ninety degree turn to face the cult statue at the end of the central hall. The bent axis approach is an innovation from the Ubaid temples which had a linear axis approach, and is also a feature of Sumerian houses. An offering table was located in the center of the temple at the intersection of the axes.

Temples of the Uruk Period divided the temple rectangle into tripartite, T-shaped, or combined plans. The tripartite plan inherited from the Ubaid had a large central hall with two smaller flanking halls on either side. The entry was along the short axis and the shrine was at the end of the long axis. The T-shaped plan, also from the Ubaid period, was identical to the tripartite plan except for a hall at one end of the rectangle perpendicular to the main hall. Temple C from the Eanna district of [[Uruk]] is a case-study of classical temple form.

There was an explosion of diversity in temple design during the following Early Dynastic Period. The temples still retained features such as cardinal orientation, rectangular plans, and buttresses. Now however they took on a variety new configurations including courtyards, walls, basins, and barracks. The [[É (temple)|Sin Temple]] in [[Khafajah]] is typical of this era, as it was designed around a series of courtyards leading to a [[cella]].

The high temple was a special type of temple that was home to the patron god of the city. Functionally, it served as a storage and distribution center as well as housing the priesthood. The [[É (temple)|White Temple]] of [[Anu]] in [[Uruk]] is typical of a high temple which was built very high on a platform of adobe-brick. In the Early Dynastic period high temples began to include a [[ziggurat]], a series of platforms creating a stepped pyramid. Such ziggurats may have been the inspiration for the Biblical [[Tower of Babel]].

===Ziggurats===

[[Ziggurat]]s were huge pyramidal temple towers which were first built in Sumerian City-States and then developed in Babylonia and Assyrian cities as well. There are 32 ziggurats known at, or near, Mesopotamia&amp;mdash;28 in [[Iraq]] and 4 in [[Iran]]. Notable ziggurats include the [[Great Ziggurat of Ur]] near [[Nasiriyah]], Iraq, the [[Ziggurat of Aqar Quf]] near [[Baghdad]], Iraq, [[Chogha Zanbil]] in [[Khūzestān Province|Khūzestān]], Iran (the most recent to be discovered), and the [[Tappeh Sialk|Sialk]] near [[Kashan]], Iran. Ziggurats were built by the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylon]]ians, [[Elam]]ites, and [[Assyria]]ns as monuments to local religions. The earliest examples of the ziggurat were raised platforms that date from the [[Ubaid period]]&lt;ref name="Crawford, page 73"&gt;Crawford, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; during the fourth [[millennium]] BC, and the latest date from the 6th century BC. The top of the ziggurat was flat, unlike many pyramids. The step pyramid style began near the end of the Early Dynastic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in receding tiers upon a rectangular, oval, or square platform, the ziggurat was a [[pyramid]]al structure. Sun-baked bricks made up the core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the outside. The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had [[astrology|astrological]] significance. Kings sometimes had their names engraved on these glazed bricks. The number of tiers ranged from two to seven, with a shrine or temple at the summit. Access to the shrine was provided by a series of ramps on one side of the ziggurat or by a spiral ramp from base to summit. It has been suggested that ziggurats were built to resemble mountains, but there is little textual or archaeological evidence to support that hypothesis.

Classical ziggurats emerged in the Neo-Sumerian Period with articulated buttresses, vitreous brick sheathing, and [[entasis]] in the elevation. The Ziggurat of Ur is the best example of this style. Another change in temple design in this period was a straight as opposed to bent-axis approach to the temple.

Ur-Nammu's ziggurat at Ur was designed as a three-stage construction, but today only two of these survive. This entire mudbrick core structure was originally given a facing of baked brick envelope set in [[bitumen]], 2.5&amp;nbsp;m on the first lowest stage, and 1.15&amp;nbsp;m on the second. Each of these baked bricks were stamped with the name of the king. The sloping walls of the stages were buttressed. The access to the top was by means of a triple monumental staircase, which all converges at a portal that opened on a landing between the first and second stages. The height of the first stage was about 11&amp;nbsp;m while the second stage rose some 5.7&amp;nbsp;m. Usually, a third stage is reconstructed by the excavator of the ziggurat ([[Leonard Woolley]]), and crowned by a temple. At the C[[Dur-Untash|hogha Zanbil]] ziggurat, archaeologists have found massive reed ropes that ran across the core of the ziggurat structure and tied together the mudbrick mass.

The most notable architectural remains from early Mesopotamia are the temple complexes at [[Uruk]] from the 4th millennium BC, temples and palaces from the [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer#Early Dynastic period|Early Dynastic]] period sites in the [[Diyala River]] valley such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar, the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] remains at [[Nippur]] (Sanctuary of [[Enlil]]) and [[Ur]] (Sanctuary of [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]), Middle [[Bronze Age]] remains at Syrian-Turkish sites of [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Alalakh]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Kultepe]], Late Bronze Age palaces at [[Bogazkoy]] (Hattusha), [[Ugarit]], [[Ashur]] and [[Nuzi]], Iron Age palaces and temples at [[Assyria]]n ([[Kalhu]]/Nimrud, [[Khorsabad]], [[Nineveh]]), [[Babylonia]]n ([[Babylon]]), [[Urartian]] ([[Tushpa]]/Van, [[Haykaberd]], Ayanis, [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], [[Erebuni Fortress|Erebuni]], [[Bastam]]) and [[Neo-Hittite]] sites ([[Carchemish|Karkamis]], [[Tell Halaf]], [[Karatepe]]). Houses are mostly known from Old Babylonian remains at Nippur and Ur. Among the textual sources on building construction and associated rituals are Gudea's cylinders from the late 3rd millennium are notable, as well as the Assyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions from the [[Iron Age]].

==Design of Assyrian buildings, fortifications and temples==
[[File:Mesopotamia male worshiper 2750-2600 B.C.jpg|thumb|[[Tell Asmar]] "Standing man" votive sculpture 2750-2600 B.C]]
The plans of all the Assyrian buildings are rectangular, and we know that long ago, as now, the Eastern architects used this outline almost invariably, and upon it reared some of the most lovely and varied forms ever devised. They gather over the angles by graceful curves, and on the basis of an ordinary square hall carry up a minaret or a dome, an octagon or a circle. That this was sometimes done in Assyria is shown by the sculptures. Slabs from [[Kouyunjik]] show domes of varied form, and tower-like structures, each rising from a square base. The resemblance between the ancient form of the dome and those still used in the Assyrian villages is very striking. Whether sloping roofs were used is uncertain. Mr. Bonomi believes that they were, and a few sculptures seem to support his view. Of the private houses nothing, of course, remains; but they are represented on the slabs as being of several stories in height, the ground floor as usual having only a door and no windows. All have flat roofs, and we gather from one of the bas-reliefs, which represents a town on fire, that these roofs were made, just as they now are, with thick layers of earth on strong beams. These roofs are well-nigh fireproof, and the flames are represented as stopped by them, and coming out of the windows. No remains of a window, or, so far as we are aware, of an internal staircase, have been found.

Of the fortifications we know much more. In the north wall of Nimroud fifty-eight towers have been traced, and at [[Kouyunjik]] there are large remains of three walls, the lower part being of stone, and the upper of sun-dried bricks. At [[Khorsabad]] there are the remains of a wall, still {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, built of blocks of stone 3 to {{convert|4|ft|m}} thick, and the evidences wanting as to finishing of these is completely supplied by the sculptures, which show an extraordinary resemblance to medieval works of the same class. Tier upon tier of walls are represented, enclosing a great tower or keep in the centre. The entrances are great arched gateways flanked by square towers. These and the other towers have overhanging parapets just like the mediaeval machicolations, and are finished at top with battlements, remains of which have been found at [[Kalhu|Nimrud]] and [[Kouyunjik]], and at [[Assur]], the capital of Assyria before Nineveh.

Of temples distinct from the palace we have a few supposed remains, but little is absolutely known as to their general form.

But in Chaldea there are some enormous masses of ruins, evidently remains of the vast mounds which formed the substructure of their temples. The grandest of all these and the most interesting is the temple of [[Nabu|Nabû]] at [[Borsippa]] (now Birs Nimrod), near [[Babylon]], which has been identified as the temple of the Seven Spheres. This was reconstructed by Nebuchadnezzar, as appears by a well-known inscription. Another example is at [[Ur|Mugheir]], which was {{convert|198|ft|m}} by {{convert|133|ft|m}} at the base, and is even now {{convert|70|ft|m}} high, and it is clear that both it and the Birs were built with diminishing stages, presenting a series of grand platforms, decreasing in length as they ascended, and leaving a comparatively small one at top for the temple cell. This has been found, it is supposed, at the Birs Nimroud, of vitrified brick made in ancient ovens.

==Landscape architecture==
Text sources indicate open space planning was a part of the city from the earliest times. The description of [[Uruk]] in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' tells of one third of that city set aside for orchards. Similar planned open space is found at the one fifth enclosure of [[Nippur]]. Another important landscape element was the vacant lot (Akkadian: ''kišubbû'').

External to the city, Sumerian irrigation agriculture created some of the first garden forms in history. The garden (sar) was 144 square cubits with a perimeter canal.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, [[Sumer]]&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the enclosed quadrangle was the basis for the later paradise gardens of [[Persia]].

In Mesopotamia, the use of [[fountain]]s date as far back as the 3rd millennium BC. An early example is preserved in a carved [[Babylonia]]n basin, dating back to ''circa'' 3000 B.C., found at [[Girsu]], [[Lagash]]. An ancient Assyrian fountain "discovered in the gorge of the Comel River consists of basins cut in solid rock and descending in steps to the stream." The water was led from small [[Channel (geography)|conduit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=fountain|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/214794/fountain|accessdate=2010-03-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100502072841/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/214794/fountain| archivedate= 2 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13244">The '''argument from beauty''' (also the '''aesthetic argument''') is an argument for the existence of a realm of immaterial ideas or, most commonly, for the [[existence of God]].

Plato argued there is a transcendent plane of abstract ideas, or universals, which are more perfect than real-world examples of those ideas.  Later philosophers connected this plane to the idea of goodness, beauty, and then the Christian God.

Various observers have also argued that the experience of beauty is evidence of the existence of a universal God. Depending on the observer, this might include artificially beautiful things like music or art, natural beauty like landscapes or astronomical bodies, or the elegance of abstract ideas like the laws of mathematics or physics.

The best-known defender of the aesthetic argument is [[Richard Swinburne]].

==History of the argument from Platonic universals==

The argument from beauty has two aspects. The first is connected with the independent existence of what philosophers term a "universal" (see [[Universal (metaphysics)]] and also [[Problem of universals]]). [[Plato]] argued that particular examples of, say a [[circle]], all fall short of the perfect exemplar of a circle that exists outside the realm of the senses as an eternal Idea. Beauty for Plato is a particularly important type of universal. Perfect beauty exists only in the eternal Form of beauty  (see [[Platonic epistemology]]). For Plato the argument for a timeless idea of beauty does not involve so much whether the gods exist (Plato was not a monotheist) but rather whether there is an immaterial realm independent and superior to the imperfect world of sense. Later Greek thinkers such as [[Plotinus]] (c. 204/5–270 CE) expanded Plato's argument to support the existence of a totally transcendent "One", containing no parts. Plotinus identified this "One" with the concept of "Good" and the principle of "Beauty". [[Christianity]] adopted this Neo-Platonic conception and saw it as a strong argument for the existence of a supreme [[God]]. In the early fifth century, for example, [[Augustine of Hippo]] discusses the many beautiful things in nature and asks "Who made these beautiful changeable things, if not one who is beautiful and unchangeable?"&lt;ref&gt;''Sermons of St. Augustine'', 241, Easter: c.411 CE&lt;/ref&gt; This second aspect is what most people today understand as the argument from beauty.

==Richard Swinburne==

A contemporary British philosopher of religion, [[Richard Swinburne]], known for philosophical arguments about the existence of God, advocates a variation of the argument from beauty:

{{quote|God has reason to make a basically beautiful world, although also reason to leave some of the beauty or ugliness of the world within the power of creatures to determine; but he would seem to have overriding reason not to make a basically ugly world beyond the powers of creatures to improve. Hence, if there is a God there is more reason to expect a basically beautiful world than a basically ugly one. A priori, however, there is no particular reason for expecting a basically beautiful rather than a basically ugly world. In consequence, if the world is beautiful, that fact would be evidence for God's existence. For, in this case, if we let k be 'there is an orderly physical universe', e be 'there is a beautiful universe', and h be 'there is a God', P(e/h.k) will be greater than P(e/k)... Few, however, would deny that our universe (apart from its animal and human inhabitants, and aspects subject to their immediate control) has that beauty. Poets and painters and ordinary men down the centuries have long admired the beauty of the orderly procession of the heavenly bodies, the scattering of the galaxies through the heavens (in some ways random, in some ways orderly), and the rocks, sea, and wind interacting on earth, ''[[The Spacious Firmament on High|The spacious firmament on high, and all the blue ethereal sky]]'', the water lapping against 'the old eternal rocks', and the plants of the jungle and of temperate climates, contrasting with the desert and the Arctic wastes. Who in his senses would deny that here is beauty in abundance? If we confine ourselves to the argument from the beauty of the inanimate and plant worlds, the argument surely works." &lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard, ''The Existence of God'', OUP, 2nd Edition, 2004, {{ISBN|0199271682}}. {{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Art as a route to God==

The most frequent invocation of the argument from beauty today involves the aesthetic experience one obtains from great literature, music or art.  In the concert hall or museum one can easily feel carried away from the mundane.  For many people this feeling of transcendence approaches the religious in intensity.  It is a commonplace to regard concert halls and museums as the cathedrals of the modern age because they seem to translate beauty into meaning and transcendence.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

[[Dostoevsky]] was a proponent of the transcendent nature of beauty. His enigmatic statement: "Beauty will save the world" is frequently cited.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], ''[[The Idiot]]''. {{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] in his [[Nobel Prize]] lecture reflected upon this phrase:

{{quote|And so perhaps that old trinity of Truth and Good and Beauty is not just the formal outworn formula it used to seem to us during our heady, materialistic youth. If the crests of these three trees join together, as the investigators and explorers used to affirm, and if the too obvious, too straight branches of Truth and Good are crushed or amputated and cannot reach the light—yet perhaps the whimsical, unpredictable, unexpected branches of Beauty will make their way through and soar up to that very place and in this way perform the work of all three. And in that case it was not a slip of the tongue for Dostoyevsky to say that "Beauty will save the world" but a prophecy. After all, he was given the gift of seeing much, he was extraordinarily illumined. And consequently perhaps art, literature, can in actual fact help the world of today.&lt;ref&gt;"Beauty Will Save the World: The Nobel Lecture on Literature" by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his book, ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] describes the argument thus:

{{quote|Another character in the [[Aldous Huxley]] novel just mentioned proved the existence of God by playing [[Beethoven's string quartet no. 15]] in A minor ('Heiliger Dankgesang') on a gramophone. Unconvincing as that sounds, it does represent a popular strand of argument. I have given up counting the number of times I receive the more or less truculent challenge: 'How do you account for [[Shakespeare]], then?' (Substitute [[Schubert]], [[Michelangelo]], etc. to taste.) The argument will be so familiar, I needn’t document it further. But the logic behind it is never spelled out, and the more you think about it the more vacuous you realize it to be. Obviously [[Beethoven]]'s late quartets are sublime. So are [[Shakespeare's sonnets]]. They are sublime if God is there and they are sublime if he isn't. They do not prove the existence of God; they prove the existence of Beethoven and of Shakespeare. A great conductor is credited with saying: 'If you have [[Mozart]] to listen to, why would you need God?'&lt;ref name=Dawkins110&gt;Dawkins, Richard, ''The God Delusion'', (Mariner Books:2008), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Philosophical basis of science and mathematics==

Exactly what role to attribute to [[Mathematical beauty|beauty in mathematics]] and science is hotly contested, see [[Philosophy of mathematics]]. The argument from beauty in science and mathematics is an argument for [[philosophical realism]] against [[nominalism]]. The debate revolves around the question, "Do things like scientific laws, numbers and sets have an independent 'real' existence outside individual human minds?". The argument is quite complex and still far from settled. Scientists and philosophers often marvel at the congruence between [[patterns in nature|nature and mathematics]]. In 1960 the Nobel Prize–winning physicist and mathematician [[Eugene Wigner]] wrote an article entitled "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]". He pointed out that "the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bordering on the mysterious and that there is no rational explanation for it."&lt;ref&gt;"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences," in ''[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]]'', vol. 13, No. I (February 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; In applying mathematics to understand the natural world, scientists often employ aesthetic criteria that seem far removed from science. [[Einstein]] once said that "the only physical theories that we are willing to accept are the beautiful ones."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Graham Farmelo, ''It Must be Beautiful: Great Equations of Modern Science'' (Granta Books, 2002), p. xii. Farmelo provides an extensive discussion of this topic and gives numerous examples from the history of science.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, beauty can sometimes be misleading; [[Thomas Huxley]] wrote that "Science is organized common sense, where many a beautiful theory was killed by an ugly fact."&lt;ref name=Stewart278&gt;Quoted in [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)]], ''Why Beauty is Truth'' (Basic Books, 2007), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

When developing hypotheses, scientists use beauty and elegance as valuable selective criteria. The more beautiful a theory, the more likely is it to be true. The mathematical physicist [[Hermann Weyl]] said with evident amusement, "My work has always tried to unite the true with the beautiful and when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful."&lt;ref name=Stewart278/&gt; The quantum physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]] wrote to Einstein, "You may object that by speaking of simplicity and beauty I am introducing aesthetic criteria of truth, and I frankly admit that I am strongly attracted by the simplicity and beauty of the mathematical schemes which nature presents us."&lt;ref name=Stewart278/&gt;

==Criticisms==

The argument implies beauty is something immaterial instead of being a subjective neurological response to stimuli. Philosophers since [[Immanuel Kant]] increasingly argue that beauty is an artifact of individual human minds.  A 'beautiful' sunset is according to this perspective aesthetically neutral in itself.  It is our cognitive response that interprets it as 'beautiful.' Others would argue that this cognitive response has been developed through the evolutionary development of the brain and its exposure to particular stimuli over long ages.  Others point to the existence of evil and various types of ugliness as invalidating the argument. [[Joseph McCabe]], a [[freethought]] writer of the early 20th century, questioned the argument in ''The Existence of God'', when he asked whether God also created parasitic microbes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]] (1933), The Existence of God, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] had no trouble seeing beauty in mathematics but he did not see it as a valid argument for the existence of God. In the Study of Mathematics, he wrote: "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1919). "The Study of Mathematics". Mysticism and Logic: And Other Essays. Longman. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also wrote: "My conclusion is that there is no reason to believe any of the dogmas of traditional theology and, further, that there is no reason to wish that they were true. Man, in so far as he is not subject to natural forces, is free to work out his own destiny. The responsibility is his, and so is the opportunity." &lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand "Is There a God?" (1952: repr. ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, Volume 11: Last Philosophical Testament'', 1943-68, ed. John G Slater and Peter Köllner (London: Routledge, 1997), pp. 543–48&lt;/ref&gt;  [[H. L. Mencken]] stated that humans have created things of greater beauty when he wrote, "I also pass over the relatively crude contrivances of this Creator in the aesthetic field, wherein He has been far surpassed by man, as, for example, for adroitness of design, for complexity or for beauty, the sounds of an orchestra."&lt;ref&gt;''Minority Report'', H. L. Mencken's Notebooks, Knopf, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Dawkins summarises the argument as: "How dare another human being make such beautiful music/poetry/art when I can't? It must be God that did it".&lt;ref name=Dawkins110/&gt;

An '''artist's portfolio''' is an edited collection of their best artwork intended to showcase an artist's style or method of work. A portfolio is used by artists to show employers their versatility by showing different samples of current work. Typically, the work reflects an artist's best work or a depth in one specific area of work.

Historically, portfolios were printed out and placed into a book. With the increased use of the internet and email, however, there are now websites that host [[online portfolio]]s that are available to a wider audience. Sometimes an artist's portfolio can be referred to as a [[lookbook]].

== Photography ==
A [[photography]] portfolio can focus on a single subject. It can be a collection of photographs taken with a certain type of camera, in one geographic area, of one person or a group of people, only black &amp; white or sepia photos, a special event, etc.

Many photographers use portfolios to show their best work when looking for jobs in the photography industry. For example, wedding photographers may put together a book of their best wedding photos to show to engaged couples who are looking for a wedding photographer. [[Photojournalists]] may take a collection of their best freelance work with them when looking for a job.

==Artist design book ==
An artist design book is a collection of photographs meant to show off a model, photographer, style, or clothing line.  Sometimes they are made to compile the looks of other people such as a celebrity, politician or socialite. This is an especially popular term with fashion bloggers.

Artist design books, or ADBs, in their online form, can be described as "fashion diaries" because bloggers are constantly updating them on a daily or weekly basis. 

It is common for stores or clothing designers to use an ADB to show off products.&lt;ref&gt;Fasanella, Kathleen. [http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive/what_are_look_books/ "What are Look books?], ''Fashion-Incubator'', 2005-26-08. Retrieved on 2010-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; They may include photos of multiple types of clothes, shoes and other accessories from a season or line.

CMOS was officially created in 1967 as the Canadian Meteorological Society and adopted its present name in 1977, following an invitation by the Canadian Meteorological Society to the oceanographic community in Canada to join the Society. However, CMOS has a rich history dating back to 1939 when it was known as the Canadian Branch of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]].&lt;ref name="cmos"/&gt;

In 2007, CMOS issued a position statement on [[global warming]]:

:CMOS endorses the process of periodic climate science assessment carried out by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and supports the conclusion, in its [[Third Assessment Report]], which states that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmos.ca/climatechangepole.html Position Statement on Global Warming]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Orphan|date=March 2017}}

''''Capacity theory''' is the theoretical approach that pulled researchers from Filter theories with Kahneman's published 1973 study, ''Attention and Effort'' (https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/attention_and_effort/Attention_hi_quality.pdf - bottom of page 7 of the book, page 14 of the pdf) positing attention was limited in overall capacity, that a person's ability to perform simultaneous tasks depends on how much "capacity" the jobs require.  Further researchers - Johnson and Heinz (1978) and Navon &amp; Gopher (1979) - went further with Kahneman's study.&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg, Ronald T. (2016). pp. 79-83.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Shalom Fisch used Kahneman's capacity theory, just as others did for their research, to published a paper on children's understanding of educational content on television.&lt;ref name=Fisch6391&gt;{{harvnb|Fisch|2000|pp=63&amp;ndash;91}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a communication theory based on model which is used to explain and predict how children learn from [[educational television programing]]. It is formed by combining [[cognitive psychology]] and [[LC4MP|limited capacity]] of working memory. Working memory is explained as having limited resources available for processing external information and when demands exceed capabilities, then the material will not be attended to.
The model attempts to explain how cognitive resources are allocated when individuals, particularly children, comprehend both the educational and the narrative content of an educational program
Capacity theory suggests that when educational content is tangential to the narrative content the two information sources compete with one another for limited resources in working memory. However, when the distance between educational content and narrative content is small, the process complement one another rather than compete for resources, therefore an individual is likely comprehend more.

== Three basic components of the capacity model ==
The capacity model consists of three basic components.
# ''Processing of narrative content''
# ''Processing of education content''
# ''Distance between narrative and educational content''

=== Processing of narrative content ===
Capacity model implies that television viewers will construct their understanding of the [[narrative content]] by accessing prior knowledge and draw inferences on the new material based on previous exposure. Theory and empirical research has supported the notion that people are using working memory to process information needed to follow the story line or plot.&lt;ref name=AndBry331354&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|Bryant|1983|pp=331&amp;ndash;354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins125150&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1983|pp=125&amp;ndash;150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HustonWright9991058&gt;{{harvnb|Huston|Wright|1997|pp=999&amp;ndash;1058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HustonWright10191020&gt;{{harvnb|Huston|Wright|1997|pp=1019&amp;ndash;1020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PalmerMacNeil2744&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|MacNeill|1991|pp=27&amp;ndash;44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PearlBouLaz2227&gt;{{harvnb|Pearl|Bouthilet|Lazar|1982|pp=22&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the audio/visual nature of television, individual program factors will influence how much demand is used. For example, a fast paced action sequence will require more working memory to follow the action than perhaps a slow dialogue between two characters.
This is best understood by breaking it down to two types of characteristics, viewer characteristics and program characteristics.

==== Viewer characteristics ====
* Viewer's prior knowledge – if an individual is familiar with the narrative content, such as knowing the characters or storyline, then cognitive demand will be low and more working memory will be made available.
* Story schema – ability to understand the basic components of a story and the hierarchy of events will help influence the amount of cognitive demand required.&lt;ref name=MeadowReev352374&gt;{{harvnb|Meadowcroft|Reeves|1989|pp352&amp;ndash;374}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive abilities – individuals with higher intelligence and higher cognitive abilities will make more efficient use of cognitive resources when encoding the narrative.&lt;ref name=EckhardtWoodJacob636649&gt;{{harvnb|Eckhardt|Wood|Jacobvitz|1991|pp=636&amp;ndash;649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JacWoodAlbin219235&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobvitz|Wood|Albin|1991|pp=219&amp;ndash;235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interest in the story - the viewer's interest in the story will affect how much attention is paid to the narrative and therefore will influence how resources are allocated.

==== Program characteristics ====
Developmental research in text comprehension has found that young children can use schemata to process stories only when they are structured simply and clearly state causal linkages&lt;ref name=MandlerJohnson111151&gt;{{harvnb|Mandler|Johnson|1977|pp=111&amp;ndash;151}} cf. Meadowcroft &amp; Reeves, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complexity of the narrative - the number of events in the story and the connections among them will influence how much working memory is required. Studies have shown that children process stories only when they are simple in their construction and clearly show casual linkage. Long narratives with lots of complex chains will increase demands required for processing.&lt;ref name=MandlerJohnson111151/&gt;
* Structure of the Story - stories that are constructed in easily recognizable patterns, such as a beginning, middle, and end are easier to follow, thus reducing demand.
* Explicit vs inferred information - whether or not the information is clearly presented or if it is less clear, thus requiring making inference about the narrative, will affect the amount of cognitive processing required.

=== Processing educational content ===
The processing of educational content has not received as much attention as processing of narrative content. Many of the guiding principles in this section were developed out of speculation and then verified through current studies. As with the narrative content, there are viewer and program characteristics that effect comprehension.

==== Viewer characteristics ====
* Prior knowledge of content - similar to the processing of narrative content, previous exposure to educational information can reduce the amount of working memory required to process the information in children. This has been shown to be true in adults.
* Interest in content - viewers will be able to dedicate a greater pool of resources to information in they are interested in the content. This was suggested by testing children's comprehension of mathematical word problems. The study showed that comprehension was enhanced if the child was interested in the narrative context which the problem occurred in.&lt;ref name=Renninger228238&gt;{{harvnb|Renninger|1998|pp=222&amp;ndash;238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Program characteristics ====
* Clarity of presentation - the degree to which the information is clearly presented will decrease required resources for processing information.
* Explicitness of content - whether or not the content is clearly identifiable as educational material or if it hidden beneath the narrative will affect amount of cognition.

=== Distance ===
Distance is the final component of this model. The idea of distance separates this model from other cognitive processing models such as Limited Capacity. Distance referrers to the degree to which the educational content is integrated into the narrative. This concept has been dubbed "content on the plotline" by the Children's Television Workshop.&lt;ref name=FischEtAl&gt;{{harvnb|Fisch|Goodman|McCann|Rylander|Ross|1995|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HallWilliams&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Williams|1993|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is best described as the role the content has in the story of events. Distance is not binary, but is best described in length as small or large.
* Small distance suggests that the narrative and educational content are related to one another and that the educational content is causally embedded into the plot.
* Large distance suggests that educational content is not involved in the story line and does not assist in moving the story forward. It may only be featured at low levels in the story hierarchy.

Understanding the effect distance has on processing will explain how certain content competes for attention. Large distances will require more resources due to the increase in competition, however resources are limited. The process used to encode, store, and retrieve narrative content is the same as educational content. When the narrative and educational content are intertwined, then it is said to be a small distance, thus reducing the amount of competition for limited resources. The parallel process responsible for comprehending narrative and educational content complement one another, thus increasing information retention.
- This model predicts that educational content will be better attended to when the distance from the narrative is small and has been shown in previous studies&lt;ref name=FischEtAl/&gt;

== Factors which influence processing of narrative and educational content ==
There are several factors that will influence the processing of narrative and educational content.
* Cognitive maturity of the child - studies have shown that cognitive capabilities develop in children at different ages.
* Prior exposure to the material - if the child has been exposed to the educational material before, cognitive demand will be lessened.
* Complexity of formal features - as mentioned previously, television has the opportunity to provide several audio and video features. Studies have shown that features such as fast program pacing may decrease processing capabilities.

== Governing principles ==
This theory is governed by several broad principles detailing the allocation of resources among the two content types.

===Narrative dominance===
This principle suggests that priority is given to comprehension of the narrative content over the educational content assuming all things are equal. This primarily occurs when the distance between the educational content and narrative content is large. Working memory will be devoted to narrative before educational content. This is largely due to the fact that people typically select television content for its entertainment value before its educational value. Secondly, narrative content is featured as the primary or “surface” contents, whereas educational content is secondary or “deep” content.

=== Relative availability of resources ===
Each individual will have various levels of resource ability. As with any type of content the individual is exposed to, there will always be a competition for resources. Several factors can increase or decrease the demands required for processing, such as pacing, graphics, audio, and other production features. When high demands are required for processing the narrative content of educational programming, then less resources will be available for educational content. This demand to process both sources can be reduced if the educational content and narrative content are closely related.

=== Voluntary allocation ===
Individuals will select media to achieve certain goals or objectives. As a result, an individual may choose to watch an educational program and consciously attempt to allocate more resources to the educational content rather than the narrative content. Studies have consistently shown that viewer’s reason for watching can affect at which level the narrative is recalled and understood.&lt;ref name=KwaitekWatkins&gt;{{harvnb|Kwaitek|Watkins|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SalomanLeigh&gt;{{harvnb|Saloman|Leigh|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research using this model has revealed that the same has been shown to occur with educational content. It should be understood that this model does not assume that the attention paid to the educational content will cause the viewer to abandon resources to the narrative.

'''Cognitive psychology''' is the study of [[mental process]]es such as "[[attention]], language use, [[memory]], [[perception]], problem solving, [[creativity]], and [[thinking]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/glossary.aspx |title=American Psychological Association (2013). Glossary of psychological terms |publisher=Apa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines such as Cognitive Science and of psychological study, including [[educational psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[abnormal psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[economics]].

==History==
Philosophically, ruminations of the human mind and its processes have been around since the times of the ancient Greeks. In 387 BCE, [[Plato]] is known to have suggested that the brain was the seat of the mental processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/courses/1010/mangels/neuro/history/history.html |title=Mangels, J. History of neuroscience |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] posited that humans are born with innate ideas, and forwarded the idea of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body dualism]], which would come to be known as substance dualism (essentially the idea that the mind and the body are two separate substances).&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;Malone, J.C. (2009). ''Psychology: Pythagoras to Present''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. (a pp. 143, b pp. 293, c pp. 491)&lt;/ref&gt; From that time, major debates ensued through the 19th century regarding whether human thought was solely experiential ([[empiricism]]), or included innate knowledge ([[Psychological nativism|nativism]]). Some of those involved in this debate included [[George Berkeley]] and [[John Locke]] on the side of empiricism, and [[Immanuel Kant]] on the side of nativism.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, J.R. (2010). ''Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications''. New York, NY: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the philosophical debate continuing, the mid to late 19th century was a critical time in the development of psychology as a scientific discipline. Two discoveries that would later play substantial roles in cognitive psychology were [[Paul Broca]]'s discovery of the area of the brain largely responsible for language production,&lt;ref name="Malone" /&gt; and [[Carl Wernicke]]'s discovery of an area thought to be mostly responsible for comprehension of language.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M.W. (1990). ''Cognitive Psychology: An International Review''. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. (pp. 111)&lt;/ref&gt; Both areas were subsequently formally named for their founders and disruptions of an individual's language production or comprehension due to trauma or malformation in these areas have come to commonly be known as [[Expressive aphasia|Broca's aphasia]] and [[Receptive aphasia|Wernicke's aphasia]].

From the 1920s to the 1950s, the main approach to psychology was [[behaviorism]]. Initially, its adherents viewed mental events such as thoughts, ideas, attention, and consciousness as unobservables, hence outside the realm of a science of psychology. One pioneer of cognitive psychology, who worked outside the boundaries (both intellectual and geographical) of behaviorism was [[Jean Piaget]]. From 1926 to the 1950s and into the 1980s, he studied the thoughts, language, and intelligence of children and adults.&lt;ref name="AboutPiaget"&gt;Smith, L. (2000). About Piaget. Retrieved from http://piaget.org/aboutPiaget.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:
* With the development of new warfare technology during [[World War II|WWII]], the need for a greater understanding of human performance came to prominence. Problems such as how to best train soldiers to use new technology and how to deal with matters of attention while under duress became areas of need for military personnel. [[Behaviorism]] provided little if any insight into these matters and it was the work of [[Donald Broadbent]], integrating concepts from human performance research and the recently developed [[information theory]], that forged the way in this area.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;
* Developments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of [[Computationalism|psychological thought]]. Allen Newell and Herbert Simon spent years developing the concept of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and later worked with cognitive psychologists regarding the implications of AI. This encouraged a conceptualization of mental functions patterned on the way that computers handled such things as memory storage and retrieval,&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; and it opened an important doorway for [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].
* [[Noam Chomsky]]'s 1959 critique&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1959"&gt;Chomsky, N. A. (1959), ''A Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt; of behaviorism, and empiricism more generally, initiated what would come to be known as the "[[cognitive revolution]]". Inside psychology, in criticism of behaviorism, J. S. Bruner, J. J. Goodnow &amp; G. A. Austin wrote "a study of thinking" in 1956. In 1960, G. A. Miller, E. Galanter and K. Pribram wrote their famous "Plans and the Structure of Behavior". The same year, Bruner and Miller founded the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies, which institutionalized the revolution and launched the field of cognitive science.
* Formal recognition of the field involved the establishment of research institutions such as [[George Mandler]]'s Center for Human Information Processing in 1964. Mandler described the origins of cognitive psychology in a 2002 article in the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences&lt;ref name=Mandler&gt;Mandler, G. (2002). Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 38, 339–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Neisser}}[[Ulric Neisser]] put the term "cognitive psychology" into common use through his book ''Cognitive Psychology'', published in 1967.&lt;ref name=Neisser&gt;Neisser, U. (1967). ''Cognitive Psychology''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. Neisser's definition on page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Neisser's definition of "cognition" illustrates the then-progressive concept of cognitive processes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The term "cognition" refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used. It is concerned with these processes even when they operate in the absence of relevant stimulation, as in images and [[hallucinations]]. ... Given such a sweeping definition, it is apparent that cognition is involved in everything a human being might possibly do; that every psychological phenomenon is a cognitive phenomenon. But although cognitive psychology is concerned with all human activity rather than some fraction of it, the concern is from a particular point of view. Other viewpoints are equally legitimate and necessary. [[Psychodynamics|Dynamic psychology]], which begins with motives rather than with sensory input, is a case in point. Instead of asking how a man's actions and experiences result from what he saw, remembered, or believed, the dynamic psychologist asks how they follow from the subject's goals, needs, or instincts.&lt;ref name=Neisser/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mental processes==
{{see also|Cognitive control}}
The main focus of cognitive psychologists is on the [[mental processes]] that affect behavior. Those processes include, but are not limited to, the following:

===Attention===
{{main|Attention}}
The psychological definition of [[attention]] is "a state of focused awareness on a subset of the available perceptual information".&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|title=How does the APA define "psychology"? |url=http://www.apa.org/support/about/apa/psychology.aspx#answer |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key function of [[attention]] is to identify irrelevant data and filter it out, enabling significant data to be distributed to the other [[mental processes]].&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; For example, the human brain may simultaneously receive [[Auditory system|auditory]], [[visual]], [[olfactory]], [[taste]], and [[Touch|tactile]] information. The brain is able to handle only a small subset of this information, and this is accomplished through the attentional processes.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

Attention can be divided into two major attentional systems: exogenous control and endogenous control&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2012.09.027|pmid=23000534|title=Two cognitive and neural systems for endogenous and exogenous spatial attention|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=237|pages=107–123|year=2013|last1=Chica|first1=Ana B.|last2=Bartolomeo|first2=Paolo|last3=Lupiáñez|first3=Juan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exogenous control works from bottom-up and is responsible for [[orienting reflex]], and pop-out effects.&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013" /&gt; Endogenous control works top-down and is the more deliberate attentional system, responsible for divided attention and conscious processing.&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013" /&gt;

One major focal point relating to [[attention]] within the field of cognitive psychology is the concept of divided [[attention]]. A number of early studies dealt with the ability of a person wearing headphones to discern meaningful conversation when presented with different messages into each ear; this is known as the dichotic listening task.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt; Key findings involved an increased understanding of the mind's ability to both focus on one message, while still being somewhat aware of information being taken in from the ear not being consciously attended to. E.g., participants (wearing earphones) may be told that they will be hearing separate messages in each ear and that they are expected to attend only to information related to basketball. When the experiment starts, the message about basketball will be presented to the left ear and non-relevant information will be presented to the right ear. At some point the message related to basketball will switch to the right ear and the non-relevant information to the left ear. When this happens, the listener is usually able to repeat the entire message at the end, having attended to the left or right ear only when it was appropriate.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; The ability to attend to one conversation in the face of many is known as the [[cocktail party effect]].

Other major findings include that participants can't comprehend both passages, when shadowing one passage, they can't report content of the unattended message, they can shadow a message better if the pitches in each ear are different.&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.1907229|title=Some Experiments on the Recognition of Speech, with One and with Two Ears|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=25|issue=5|pages=975–979|year=1953|last1=Cherry|first1=E. Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while deep processing doesn't occur, early sensory processing does. Subjects did notice if the pitch of the unattended message changed or if it ceased altogether, and some even oriented to the unattended message if their name was mentioned.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt;

===Memory===
The two main types of memory are short-term memory and long-term memory; however, short-term memory has become better understood to be working memory. Cognitive psychologists often study memory in terms of [[working memory]].

====[[Working memory]]====
Though working memory is often thought of as just short-term memory, it is more clearly defined as the ability to remember information in the face of distraction. The famously known capacity of memory of [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|7 plus or minus 2]] is a combination of both memory in working memory and long term memory.

One of the classic experiments is by Ebbinghaus, who found the [[serial position effect]] where information from the beginning and end of list of random words were better recalled than those in the center.&lt;ref name="Eb"&gt;Ebbinghaus, Hermann (1913). On memory: A contribution to experimental psychology. New York: Teachers College.&lt;/ref&gt; This primacy and recency effect varies in intensity based on list length.&lt;ref name="Eb" /&gt; Its typical U-shaped curve can be disrupted by an attention-grabbing word; this is known as the [[Von Restorff effect]].
[[File:Working-memory-en.svg|thumbnail|The Baddeley &amp; Hitch Model of Working Memory]]
Many models of working memory have been made. One of the most regarded is the [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch model of working memory]]. It takes into account both visual and auditory stimuli, long-term memory to use as a reference, and a central processor to combine and understand it all.

A large part of memory is forgetting, and there is a large debate among psychologists of [[decay theory]] versus [[interference theory]].

====[[Long-term memory]]====
Modern conceptions of [[memory]] are usually about long-term memory and break it down into three main sub-classes. These three classes are somewhat [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] in nature, in terms of the level of [[conscious]] thought related to their use.&lt;ref name="Balota"&gt;Balota, D.A. &amp; Marsh, E.J. (2004). ''Cognitive Psychology: Key Readings''. New York, NY: Psychology Press. (pp. 364–365)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Procedural memory]] is memory for the performance of particular types of action. It is often activated on a [[subconscious]] level, or at most requires a minimal amount of [[conscious]] effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/43595-procedural-memory.html|title=Procedural Memory: Definition and Examples|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procedural memory]] includes [[Stimulus-response model|stimulus-response]]-type information, which is activated through association with particular tasks, routines, etc. A person is using [[procedural knowledge]] when they seemingly "automatically" respond in a particular manner to a particular situation or process.&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt; An example is driving a car.
* [[Semantic memory]] is the encyclopedic knowledge that a person possesses. Knowledge like what the [[Eiffel Tower]] looks like, or the name of a friend from sixth grade, represent [[semantic memory]]. Access of [[semantic memory]] ranges from slightly to extremely effortful, depending on a number of variables including but not limited to recency of encoding of the information, number of associations it has to other information, frequency of access, and levels of meaning (how deeply it was processed when it was encoded).&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt;
* [[Episodic memory]] is the memory of autobiographical events that can be explicitly stated. It contains all memories that are temporal in nature, such as when one last brushed one's teeth or where one was when one heard about a major news event. [[Episodic memory]] typically requires the deepest level of [[consciousness|conscious]] thought, as it often pulls together [[semantic memory]] and temporal information to formulate the entire [[memory]].&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt;

===Perception===
[[Perception]] involves both the physical senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and [[proprioception]]) as well as the [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] involved in interpreting those senses. Essentially, it is how people come to understand the world around them through interpretation of stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/ss/perceptproc.htm Cherry, K. (2013). [[Perception] and the perceptual process]&lt;/ref&gt; Early psychologists like [[Edward Titchener|Edward B. Titchener]] began to work with perception in their [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralist]] approach to psychology. [[Structuralism (psychology)|Structuralism]] dealt heavily with trying to reduce human thought (or "consciousness," as Titchener would have called it) into its most basic elements by gaining understanding of how an individual perceives particular stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/titchener.shtml |title=Plucker, J. (2012). Edward Bradford Titchener |publisher=Indiana.edu |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717212235/http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eintell/titchener.shtml# |archive-date=2014-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current perspectives on [[perception]] within cognitive psychology tend to focus on particular ways in which the human mind interprets stimuli from the senses and how these interpretations affect behavior. An example of the way in which modern psychologists approach the study of [[perception]] is the research being done at the Center for Ecological Study of Perception and Action at the University of Connecticut (CESPA). One study at CESPA concerns ways in which individuals perceive their physical environment and how that influences their navigation through that environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970412101520/http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1997-04-12 |title=University of Connecticut (N.D.). Center for the ecological study of perception |publisher=Ione.psy.uconn.edu |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Psychologists have had an interest in the cognitive processes involved with [[language]] that dates back to the 1870s, when [[Carl Wernicke]] proposed a model for the mental processing of language.&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Christine M. (1990). "Developments and applications of cognitive neuropsychology." In M. W. Eysenck (Ed.)''Cognitive Psychology: An International Review''. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Current work on [[language]] within the field of cognitive psychology varies widely. Cognitive psychologists may study [[language acquisition]],&lt;ref name="Ramsden"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11065-012-9208-z|pmid=22707315|title=Language Development and Assessment in the Preschool Period|journal=Neuropsychology Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=384–401|year=2012|last1=Conti-Ramsden|first1=Gina|last2=Durkin|first2=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual components of [[language]] formation (like [[phoneme]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.4000/cognitextes.211|title=The phoneme in cognitive phonology: Episodic memories of both meaningful and meaningless units?|journal=Cognitextes|issue=2|year=2009|last1=Välimaa-Blum|first1=Riitta}}&lt;/ref&gt; how language use is involved in [[Mood (psychology)|mood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpi.nl/departments/other-research/research-projects/language-in-action/subprojects/Mood-and-language-comprehension |title=Berkum, J. Language in action - Mood and language comprehension |publisher=Mpi.nl |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or numerous other related areas.
[[File:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumbnail|Broca's and Wernicke's areas of the brain, which are critical in language]]

Significant work has been done recently with regard to understanding the timing of [[language acquisition]] and how it can be used to determine if a child has, or is at risk of, developing a [[learning disability]]. A study from 2012, showed that while this can be an effective strategy, it is important that those making evaluations include all relevant information when making their assessments. Factors such as individual variability, [[socioeconomic status]], [[Short-term memory|short-term]] and [[long-term memory]] capacity, and others must be included in order to make valid assessments.&lt;ref name="Ramsden" /&gt;

===Metacognition===
[[Metacognition]], in a broad sense, is the thoughts that a person has about their own thoughts. More specifically, metacognition includes things like:
* How effective a person is at monitoring their own performance on a given task (self-regulation).
* A person's understanding of their capabilities on particular mental tasks.
* The ability to apply [[Cognitive style|cognitive strategies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Martinez |first=M. E. |year=2006 |title=What is metacognition |journal=The Phi Delta Kappan |volume=87 |issue=9 |pages=696–699 |jstor=20442131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the current study regarding metacognition within the field of cognitive psychology deals with its application within the area of education. Being able to increase a student's metacognitive abilities has been shown to have a significant impact on their learning and study habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.brainscape.com/2010/04/learning-study-less/ |title=Cohen, A. (2010). The secret to learning more while studying |publisher=Blog.brainscape.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; One key aspect of this concept is the improvement of students' ability to set goals and self-regulate effectively to meet those goals. As a part of this process, it is also important to ensure that students are realistically evaluating their personal degree of knowledge and setting realistic goals (another metacognitive task).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html |title=Lovett, M. (2008). Teaching metacognition |publisher=Serc.carleton.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common phenomena related to metacognition include:
*'''[[Déjà Vu]]:''' feeling of a repeated experience
*'''Cryptomnesia:''' generating thought believing it is unique but it is actually a memory of a past experience, aka unconscious plagiarism.
*'''False Fame Effect:''' non-famous names can be made to be famous
*'''[[illusory truth effect|Validity effect]]:''' statements seem more valid upon repeated exposure
*'''[[Imagination inflation]]:''' imagining an event that did not occur and having increased confidence that it did occur

==Modern==
Modern perspectives on cognitive psychology generally address cognition as a [[dual process theory]], expounded upon by [[Daniel Kahneman]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=Kahneman&gt;Kahneman D. (2003) "A perspective on judgement and choice." ''American Psychologist''. ''58'', 697–720.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahneman differentiated the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.&lt;ref name=Kahneman /&gt;

==Applications==

===Abnormal psychology===
Following the cognitive revolution, and as a result of many of the principle discoveries to come out of the field of cognitive psychology, the discipline of cognitive therapy evolved. [[Aaron T. Beck]] is generally regarded as the father of cognitive therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/suicide/beck/index.html |title=University of Pennsylvania (N.D). Aaron T. Beck, M.D |publisher=Med.upenn.edu |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914094322/http://www.med.upenn.edu/suicide/beck/index.html |archive-date=2017-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in the areas of recognition and treatment of depression has gained worldwide recognition. In his 1987 book titled ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression'', Beck puts forth three salient points with regard to his reasoning for the treatment of depression by means of therapy or therapy and antidepressants versus using a pharmacological-only approach:
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Despite the prevalent use of antidepressants, the fact remains that not all patients respond to them. Beck cites (in 1987) that only 60 to 65% of patients respond to antidepressants, and recent [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] (a statistical breakdown of multiple studies) show very similar numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grohol |first=John M. |url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/02/03/efficacy-of-antidepressants/ |title=Grohol, J. (2009). Efficacy of Antidepressants |publisher=Psychcentral.com |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Many of those who do respond to antidepressants end up not taking their medications, for various reasons. They may develop side-effects or have some form of personal objection to taking the drugs.&lt;br&gt;3. Beck posits that the use of [[Psychotropic|psychotropic drugs]] may lead to an eventual breakdown in the individual's [[Coping (psychology)|coping mechanisms]]. His theory is that the person essentially becomes reliant on the medication as a means of improving mood and fails to practice those coping techniques typically practiced by healthy individuals to alleviate the effects of depressive symptoms. By failing to do so, once the patient is weaned off of the antidepressants, they often are unable to cope with normal levels of depressed mood and feel driven to reinstate use of the antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, A.T. (1987). ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression''. New York, NY: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Social psychology===
Many facets of modern social psychology have roots in research done within the field of cognitive psychology.{{Citation needed|reason=The reverse is also true, and the page linked in the next sentence also has a citation needed tag related to the link between social cognition and cognitive psychology.|date=November 2017}} [[Social cognition]] is a specific sub-set of social psychology that concentrates on processes that have been of particular focus within cognitive psychology, specifically applied to human interactions. [[Gordon Moskowitz|Gordon B. Moskowitz]] defines social cognition as "... the study of the mental processes involved in perceiving, attending to, remembering, thinking about, and making sense of the people in our social world".&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, G.B. (2004). ''Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others''. New York, NY: The Guilford Press. (pp. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of multiple [[social information processing (theory)|social information processing]] (SIP) models  has been influential in studies involving aggressive and anti-social behavior. Kenneth Dodge's SIP model is one of, if not the most, empirically supported models relating to aggression. Among his research, Dodge posits that children who possess a greater ability to process social information more often display higher levels of socially acceptable behavior. His model asserts that there are five steps that an individual proceeds through when evaluating interactions with other individuals and that how the person interprets cues is key to their reactionary process.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine, R.G. (2012). ''The Mind of the Criminal: The Role of Developmental Social Cognition in Criminal Defense Law''. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. (p. 41)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental psychology===
Many of the prominent names in the field of developmental psychology base their understanding of development on cognitive models. One of the major paradigms of developmental psychology, the [[Theory of Mind]] (ToM), deals specifically with the ability of an individual to effectively understand and attribute cognition to those around them. This concept typically becomes fully apparent in children between the ages of 4 and 6. Essentially, before the child develops ToM, they are unable to understand that those around them can have different thoughts, ideas, or feelings than themselves. The development of ToM is a matter of [[metacognition]], or thinking about one's thoughts. The child must be able to recognize that they have their own thoughts and in turn, that others possess thoughts of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/documents/Astington-EdwardANGxp.pdf |title=Astington, J.W. &amp; Edward, M.J. (2010). The development of theory of mind in early childhood. Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development, 2010:1–6 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

One of the foremost minds with regard to developmental psychology, Jean Piaget, focused much of his attention on cognitive development from birth through adulthood. Though there have been considerable challenges to parts of his [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|stages of cognitive development]], they remain a staple in the realm of education. Piaget's concepts and ideas predated the cognitive revolution but inspired a wealth of research in the field of cognitive psychology and many of his principles have been blended with modern theory to synthesize the predominant views of today.&lt;ref&gt;Brainerd, C.J. (1996). "Piaget: A centennial celebration." ''Psychological Science'', 7(4), 191–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational psychology===
Modern theories of education have applied many concepts that are focal points of cognitive psychology. Some of the most prominent concepts include:
* Metacognition: Metacognition is a broad concept encompassing all manners of one's thoughts and knowledge about their own thinking. A key area of educational focus in this realm is related to self-monitoring, which relates highly to how well students are able to evaluate their personal knowledge and apply strategies to improve knowledge in areas in which they are lacking.&lt;ref name="Reif"&gt;Reif, F. (2008). ''Applying Cognitive Science to Education: Thinking and Learning in Scientific and Other Complex Domains''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. (a pp. 283–84, b pp. 38)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Declarative knowledge]] and [[procedural knowledge]]: Declarative knowledge is a persons 'encyclopedic' knowledge base, whereas procedural knowledge is specific knowledge relating to performing particular tasks. The application of these cognitive paradigms to education attempts to augment a student's ability to integrate declarative knowledge into newly learned procedures in an effort to facilitate accelerated learning.&lt;ref name="Reif" /&gt;
* [[Knowledge organization]]: Applications of cognitive psychology's understanding of how knowledge is organized in the brain has been a major focus within the field of education in recent years. The hierarchical method of organizing information and how that maps well onto the brain's memory are concepts that have proven extremely beneficial in classrooms.&lt;ref name="Reif" /&gt;

===Personality psychology===
Cognitive therapeutic approaches have received considerable attention in the treatment of personality disorders in recent years. The approach focuses on the formation of what it believes to be faulty schemata, centralized on judgmental biases and general cognitive errors.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, A.T., Freeman, A., &amp; Davis, D.D. (2004). ''Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford Press. (pp. 300).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive psychology vs. cognitive science==
The line between cognitive psychology and [[cognitive science]] can be blurry. The differentiation between the two is best understood in terms of cognitive psychology's relationship to [[applied psychology]], and the understanding of psychological phenomena. Cognitive psychologists are often heavily involved in running psychological experiments involving human participants, with the goal of gathering information related to how the human mind takes in, processes, and acts upon inputs received from the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, A. &amp; Bernses, O.A. (1989). ''Cognitive Psychology: Research Directions In Cognitive Science: European Perspectives'', Vol 1 (pp. 7). East Sussex, UK: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Ltd. (pg. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; The information gained in this area is then often used in the applied field of clinical psychology.

Cognitive science is better understood as predominantly concerned with gathering data through research. Cognitive science envelopes a much broader scope, which has links to philosophy, linguistics, anthropology, neuroscience, and particularly with artificial intelligence. It could be said that cognitive science provides the database of information that fuels the theory from which cognitive psychologists operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/ |title=Thagard, P. (2010). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive scientists' research sometimes involves non-human subjects, allowing them to delve into areas which would come under ethical scrutiny if performed on human participants. I.e., they may do research implanting devices in the brains of rats to track the firing of neurons while the rat performs a particular task. Cognitive science is highly involved in the area of artificial intelligence and its application to the understanding of mental processes.

==Criticisms==
In the early years of cognitive psychology, [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental states. [[Cognitive neuroscience]], however, continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and putative mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Howard |title=Changing Minds |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard Business School Publishing |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-1-4221-0329-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers have suggested that as cognitive psychology became a movement during the 1970s, the intricacies of the phenomena and processes it examined meant it also began to lose cohesion as a field of study. In ''Psychology: Pythagoras to Present'', for example, John Malone writes: "Examinations of late twentieth-century textbooks dealing with "cognitive psychology", "human cognition", "cognitive science" and the like quickly reveal that there are many, many varieties of cognitive psychology and very little agreement about exactly what may be its domain."&amp;#8201;&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt;  This misfortune produced competing models that questioned information-processing approaches to cognitive functioning such as [[Naturalistic decision-making|Decision Making]] and [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences|Behavioral Science]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16684">The '''conservation and restoration of Ancient Greek pottery''' is a sub-section of the broader topic of [[conservation and restoration of ceramic objects]]. [[Ancient Greek pottery]] is one of the most commonly found types of artifacts from the ancient Greek world. The information learned from vase paintings forms the foundation of modern knowledge of ancient Greek art and culture. Most ancient Greek pottery is [[terracotta]], a type of earthenware [[ceramic]], dating from the 11th century BCE through the 1st century CE. The objects are usually excavated from archaeological sites in broken pieces, or shards, and then reassembled. Some have been discovered intact in tombs. Professional [[conservator-restorer]]s, often in collaboration with [[curators]] and [[conservation scientist]]s, undertake the [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation-restoration]] of ancient Greek pottery.

== History of conservation and restoration approaches ==
=== Ancient ===
Ancient repairs were made to damaged pottery using metal pins or staples, which could be made of copper, lead, or bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal or vegetable based adhesives may have also been used. Fragments from other vessels were sometimes used to replace damaged or missing sections of an object.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/&lt;/ref&gt; The decorative elements on the replacement pieces may or may not have matched the rest of the vase.

[[File:Greek - Black-figure Kylix with Sirens - Walters 4837 - Side B.jpg|thumb|Greek - Black-figure Kylix with Sirens - Walters 4837 - Side B. Several small holes around the handles were used for repairs in antiquity.]]

=== 18th to early 20th century ===
Restoration methods used during the 18th through early 20th century generally attempted to restore vessels to a near pristine state and hide any evidence of past damage.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological discoveries and a surge in the popularity of ancient Greek art in the 18th and 19th centuries created a high demand for objects and artifacts. The customary restoration method started with reassembling vessel fragments. Missing fragments were replaced with new glazed and fired pieces of pottery and gaps were filled in with plaster. The surface was then painted, sometimes extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Materials used included [[shellac]], protein glues, oil paints, gypsum, plaster of Paris, barium sulphate, calcite, clay, kaolin, and waterglass (calcium silicate).&lt;ref&gt;Conservation Project: Greek Vases. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston http://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation/feature_greekvases&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, decorative imagery was censored and painted over, in order to appeal to the tastes of contemporary society and potential collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern ===
The modern approach to conservation generally involves using non-destructive methods to evaluate objects and restoration techniques which emphasize the difference between areas of modern repair and ancient craftsmanship. Reversible adhesives, paint, and other materials are used in restorations.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation departments at museums such as the Getty Villa approach conservation of ancient pottery with the goal to "visually integrate filled areas and make them less obtrusive while still distinguishing them from the original ceramic and preserving an object's history."&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials ==
Most ancient Greek pottery is terracotta, a type of earthenware fired clay ceramic. The composition of minerals, metal, organic and other inorganic materials in the clay varies depending on its source. These variations impact the color of the clay before and after firing. Iron is the most common material found in clay, and can add red, grey, or buff coloring to the object.&lt;ref&gt;Care of Ceramics and Glass - Canadian Conservation Institute  http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170205&lt;/ref&gt; Pottery can be course wares, which are undecorated or only minimally decorated utilitarian vessels, or fine wares, which are decorated, finely potted, and used for a variety of purposes, including ceremonial use. Vase paintings were primarily created using slip, a thin, transparent layer of clay which turned color after firing. Other materials used in vase paintings include added pigment, added clay to create a relief on the surface, or dilute gloss that added color after firing.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley, John H. The Greek Vase: Art of the Storyteller (London: British Museum, 2013), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Unevenly applied gloss or misfiring also created variations in color or surface texture. Gilding was also sometimes added after firing.

== Agents of deterioration ==
Ceramics, and ancient ceramics in particular, can suffer a variety of types of damage. Most agents of deterioration are due to environment and are inherent to the materials, however the most common damage is caused by human action.

=== Physical damage ===
Breaks, losses, or abrasions can be caused by improper handling, impact (dropping), or excavation. Ceramics are strong in compression, but weak under tension, meaning they are fragile and susceptible to mechanical shock.&lt;ref&gt;Buys, Susan and Victoria Oakley, Conservation and Restoration of Ceramics (Routledge, 2014), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soluble salts ===
If a piece of pottery has been buried in salty or alkaline soil or submersed in seawater, the clay may have soaked up soluble salts, such as sulphite, nitrates, or chlorides. Changes in [[relative humidity]] can cause the salts to react and dissolve (in high humidity) or recrystallize (in low humidity).&lt;ref&gt;Care of Ceramics and Glass - Canadian Conservation Institute http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170205&lt;/ref&gt;  These reactions can cause pottery to suffer surface losses or delamination.&lt;ref&gt;Conservation Project: Greek Vases. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston http://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation/feature_greekvases&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Previous restorations ===
Previous restorations can cause unintended damage over time. Metal pins or staples can corrode and deteriorate. Plaster repairs may become unstable. In-painting may fade or discolor. Intentional over-painting from past conservation efforts is another form of damage. Scenes were sometimes altered in order to appeal to current tastes. A common example is a fig leaf being painted over a nude figure. Overly aggressive cleaning with acid can also cause damage. Acid cleaning is meant to remove insoluble salts and minerals from the surface of archaeological ceramics. Pottery that has been improperly cleaned and damaged by acid may have pitted, cracked, powdery, or flaking surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service. "Long-term Effects of acid-cleaning on archaeological ceramics," Conserve-O-Gram (September 1999) https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/06-06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventative conservation ==
Preventative conservation measures can help slow further deterioration or damage.

=== Handling ===
As with any fragile ceramic object, proper handling techniques will help prevent accidental damage. Objects should be handled as little as possible. When handling is necessary, objects should be held at their strongest points only. Pressure on the weakest points, such as handles, necks, or areas with existing damage, should be avoided. Objects should be handled with clean, dry hands, or with nitrile gloves. Cotton gloves are not recommended, because the fabric prevents a stable grip and threads can snag on rough surfaces. Objects on display in museums are secured with mounts or protected by cases to prevent unwanted or accidental contact. Vessels may be displayed upright or at an angle, depending on the decorative elements on display. Any mounts should keep the object stable without putting pressure on any fragile areas.

=== Environmental conditions ===
Despite being dried and fired, pottery clay is still a porous material which will react to changes in environmental conditions. Avoiding extreme changes in temperature can help maintain the condition of ancient Greek pottery. As discussed above in the section on damage from Soluble Salts, preventing extreme fluctuations in relative humidity can also help prevent further deterioration. Objects should be protected from water and dirt.

== Examination ==
The following techniques are used by conservators to evaluate the condition of ancient Greek pottery and determine appropriate treatment. Examination is the first step in the conservation process.

=== Visual inspection ===
Conservators begin the evaluation of an object with careful visual inspection to identify areas of weakness, loss, delamination, discoloration, or old repairs. Further examination with a low power microscope can help conservators identify materials and technical features, such as pigment, gilding, or added clay.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ultraviolet (UV) visible fluorescence ===
When exposed to invisible [[UV light]], many types of materials will display certain colors of visible light. This can enable conservators to identify areas of different media throughout the object.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== X-radiography ===
X-rays can reveal breaks, internal features, or hidden ancient repairs, such as pins.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Another type of x-ray, called X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectroscopy can reveal the elemental and chemical composition of a material. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy can reveal the iron oxidation states in pottery (the factor that determines black and red color) and X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses can provide information on the molecular structure of iron minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Melissa. "Deciphering the Elements of Iconic Pottery," National Science Foundation (March 28, 2011) https://www.nsf.gov/mobile/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=119082&amp;org=NSF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation treatment ==
After evaluation is completed, conservator-restorers can determine the most appropriate form of treatment. Treatments can range from non-invasive techniques, such as cleaning, to more invasive conservation such as disassembly, reconstruction, and restoration.

[[File:Ancient Greek pottery from Cyclades, shard with painting, 7th c BC, AM Paros, 143923.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek pottery from Cyclades, shard with painting, 7th c BC, AM Paros, 143923]]

=== Cleaning ===
Basic mechanical cleaning can remove dirt, dust, and grime. Cleaning solvents and water can also be used to remove dirt, varnish, wax, in-painting, or adhesives. Acids should be used with caution. [[Desalination]] is a cleaning method that removes as much soluble salt from the porous fired clay as possible. Fragments are soaked in highly purified water for multiple days. The water is changed regularly until salt levels are reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Usui, Emiko and Julia Gaviria, Eds., Conservation and Care of Museum Collections (Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, 2011), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disassembly ===
For vessels that have been previously conserved and reassembled, shards may need to be disassembled in order to remove old restoration materials and complete conservation. Adhesives and fill are systematically removed, revealing the original pottery and allowing the vessel to be deconstructed.

=== Reconstruction and restoration ===
Separated shards are carefully reassembled. Conservators use identifying clues such as shape, texture, and decorative pattern or painted scenes to piece together fragments. Missing shards can be recreated out of plaster and replaced. In-painting is used to disguise areas of repair. In modern conservation treatment, the media used by conservators is reversible and can easily be distinguished from ancient material. Different conservators, or conservation departments, may have different policies regarding in-painting. Some conservators leave replacement fragments completely undecorated in order to easily distinguish them as modern additions. Some conservators paint silhouettes of missing figures, using existing fragments, scene narrative, and other extant vases as examples. This approach helps show the narrative of the painted scene, while still distinguishing the modern restoration from the original fragments. Some conservators use more extensive in-painting to recreate missing decoration.

== Notable examples ==
The Affecter Amphora, in the collection of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland, is a case study for the history of conservation of Greek vases. The black figured Attic (meaning from Athens region) vessel was created around 540 BCE by a well documented vase painter known as the [[Affecter|Affecter Painter]]. Treatment of the vase in the 1980s provided the conservation field with significant insight into the history of the restoration of Greek vases. Conservators discovered that the amphora had been broken and repaired in antiquity. Samples of burial dirt found within holes in the vase proved that the repairs were made prior to the vase being used in an ancient funeral. Conservators also discovered that the vase was restored in the late19th century with materials and methods typical of the time period. Plaster, replacement pieces of terracotta, and extensive overpainting had been used in the restoration. Overpainting disguised repairs and also altered the appearance of nude satyrs on the decorative panels. The 1980s conservation revealed the original work of the Affecter Painter and restored the vase to a stable condition.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Francois Vase]], in the collection of the National Archaeological Museum in Florence, Italy, is a large Attic volute krater, which is both a superb example of black-figure pottery from c. 570-560 BCE, as well as an example of extensive conservation work. The vase was discovered in a tomb in 1844. In the year 1900, a member of the museum staff smashed the display case and the vase shattered into over 600 pieces. It was restored by 1902, and then restored again in 1973, with previously missing pieces.

'''The context-based model of the counterintuitiveness effect''' &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2010). "An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect", ''Journal of Cognitive Systems Research'', 11(2), 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt; is a cognitive model of [[The Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect]] (or MCI-effect for short) i.e., the finding by many cognitive scientists of religion that minimally counterintuitive concepts are more memorable for people than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive concepts &lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. ''The Naturalness of Religious Ideas'' University of California Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P., &amp; Ramble, C. (2001). "Cognitive templates for religious concepts". ''Cognitive Science'', 25, 535–564.&lt;/ref&gt; The context-based model emphasizes the role played by the context in which a concept appears in making it counterintuitive. This is in contrast to the traditional (also called ''content-based'') accounts of the MCI-effect which underscore the role played by context.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L., &amp; Nyhof, M. (2001). "Spreading non-natural concepts: the role of intuitive conceptual structures in memory and transmission of cultural materials". Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1, 69–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L. (2008) Coding and Quantifying Counterintuitiveness in religious concepts: Theoretical
and methodological reflections. Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, 20,308-338.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barrett &amp; Nyhoff (2001) claim that this is necessary in order to explain cross-cultural success of religious concepts.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although research on schemas and scripts suggests the possibility that incongruent concepts may be better remembered thus contributing to their transmission, these conceptual structures are culturally variable to a large extent and will not provide an explanation for cross-culturally prevalent classes of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L., &amp; Nyhof, M. (2001). "Spreading non-natural concepts: the role of intuitive conceptual structures in memory and transmission of cultural materials". Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1, 69–100.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The context-based model was first proposed by cognitive scientist [[Afzal Upal]] in 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2005). Role of context in memorability of intuitive and counterintuitive concepts. In B. Bara, L.
Barsalou, &amp; M. Bucciarelli (Eds.). Proceedings of the 27th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 2224–2229). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been subsequently elaborated in a number of publications.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Upal, L. Gonce, R. Tweney, and J. Slone (2007) Contextualizing counterintuitiveness: How context affects comprehension and memorability of counterintuitive concepts, Cognitive Science, 31(3), 415-439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2011) From Individual to Social Counterintuitiveness: How layers of innovation weave together to form tapestries of human cultures, Mind and Society, 10(1), 79-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the context-based model, counterintuitiveness of a concept depends on the mental knowledge activated in the mind of a reader at the time at which the reader processes the concept in question.  Since this mental knowledge clearly varies from person to person, a concept that is counterintuitive to one person may not be so for another person.  Furthermore, a concept may be counterintuitive to a person at one time but not at another time.  In fact the context-based model predicts that since people learn, their conceptual representations change over time.  When people encounter a minimally counterintuitive concept for the first time, they are forced to make sense out of it (Upal (2005) labelled it as the ''postdiction'' process).  The postdiction process results in the formation of new knowledge structures and in strengthening of existing knowledge structures.  Because of these new knowledge structures, when the same concept is encountered again, it does not seem as counterintuitive as it did in the past.  The context-based model predicts that over time the counterintuitive concepts come to lose their very counterintuitiveness (and the memory advantages it confers upon the concept).

'''Contrastive linguistics''' is a practice-oriented [[linguistics|linguistic]] approach that seeks to describe the differences and similarities between a pair of languages (hence it is occasionally called "''differential'' linguistics").

== History ==

While traditional linguistic studies had developed comparative methods ([[comparative linguistics]]), chiefly to demonstrate family relations between cognate languages, or to illustrate the historical developments of one or more languages, modern contrastive linguistics intends to show in what ways the two respective languages differ, in order to help in the solution of practical problems. (Sometimes the terms [[diachronic linguistics]] and [[synchronic linguistics]] are used to refer to these two perspectives.) 

Contrastive linguistics, since its inception by [[Robert Lado]] in the 1950s, has often been linked to aspects of [[applied linguistics]], e.g., to avoid [[Linguistic interference|interference]] errors in foreign-language learning, as advocated by Di Pietro (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Di Pietro, R.J. (1971) ''Language Structures in Contrast'', Newbury House.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[contrastive analysis]]), to assist interlingual transfer in the process of [[translation|translating]] texts from one language into another, as demonstrated by Vinay &amp; Darbelnet (1958)&lt;ref&gt;Vinay, J.P. &amp; Darbelnet, J. (1958) ''Stylistique Comparée du Français et de l'Anglais'', Didier-Harrap.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently by Hatim (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Hatim, B. (1997) ''Communication across Cultures. Translation Theory and Contrastive Text Linguistics'', University of Exeter Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[translation]]), and to find lexical equivalents in the process of compiling bilingual dictionaries, as illustrated by Heltai (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Heltai, P. (1988) "Contrastive analysis of terminological systems and bilingual technical dictionaries", ''International Journal of Lexicography'' Vol. 1(1) pp. 32-40.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hartmann (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, R.R.K. (1991) "Contrastive linguistics and bilingual lexicography", in ''Woerterbuecher/Dictionaries/Dictionnaires. International Encyclopedia of Lexicography'' ed. by F.J. Hausmann et al. (Vol. III, pp. 2854-2859), De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[bilingual lexicography]]). 

Contrastive descriptions can occur at every level of linguistic structure: speech sounds ([[phonology]]), written symbols ([[orthography]]), word-formation ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]), word meaning ([[lexicology]]), collocation ([[phraseology]]), sentence structure ([[syntax]]) and complete discourse ([[textology]]). Various techniques used in [[corpus linguistics]] have been shown to be relevant in intralingual and interlingual contrastive studies, e.g. by 'parallel-text' analysis (Hartmann 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, R.R.K. (1997) "From contrastive textology to parallel text corpora: Theory and applications", in ''Language History and Linguistic Modelling. A Festschrift for Jacek Fisiak'' ed. by R. Hickey &amp; S. Puppel. De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrastive linguistic studies can also be applied to the differential description of one or more varieties within a language, such as styles ([[contrastive rhetoric]]), dialects, registers or terminologies of technical genres.

[[File:Elephant-sculpture-dhauli.JPG|thumb|The Dhauli [[Edicts of Ashoka|Major Rock Inscription of Ashoka]]. The front is shaped as an elephant. Dhauli, [[Puri District]], India.]]
[[File:Rock edicts of Ashoka at Dhauli.jpg|thumb|Dhauli edicts of Ashoka.]]
'''Dhauli''' hills ({{lang-or|[[:or:ଧଉଳି|'''ଧଉଳିଗିରି''']]}}) are located on the banks of the river [[Daya River|Daya]], 8&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Bhubaneswar]] in [[Odisha]] ([[India]]). It is a hill with vast open space adjoining it, and has major [[Edict]]s of [[Ashoka]] engraved on a mass of rock, by the side of the road leading to the summit of the hill.

== Significance ==
Dhauli hill is presumed to be the area where the [[Kalinga War]] was fought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.indiavideo.org/text/maurya-dynasty-kalinga-war-ashoka-49.php | title= Kalinga War and its impact on Ashoks | publisher= India Video |accessdate= April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rock Edicts]] found here include Nos. I-X, XIV and two separate [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] Edicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lahiri |first1=Nayanjot |title=Ashoka in Ancient India |date=2015 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674915251 |page=425 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaVRCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT425 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kalinga Edict VI, he expresses his concern for the "''welfare of the whole world''". The rock-cut elephant above the Edicts is the earliest [[Buddhist]] sculpture of Odisha. The stone elephant shows the animal's foreparts only, though it has a fine sense of form and movement.&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century |date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=9788131711200 |page=361 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA361 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered as one of the few remains of [[Mauryan art]].&lt;ref name=US/&gt;

[[Ashoka]] had a special weakness for Dhauli, where the battle was fought. The [[Daya River|Daya river]] is said to have turned red with the blood of the many deceased after the battle, and enabled Ashoka to realize the magnitude of horror associated with war. He saw to it that Dhauli became an important centre of Buddhist activities. He built several [[chaitya]]s, [[stupa]]s and [[Column|pillars]] there. He got abodes excavated for the recluse, instructions inscribed for officials, expounded the main principles of '''dandaniti''' (strict enforcement of laws) for the public, provided special status to his new kingdom including the stupas at Dhauli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.dhauli.net/ | title= Dhauli Hills, Bhubaneswar, Odisha |publisher= |accessdate= April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the top of the hill, a dazzling white peace pagoda has been built by the ''Japan Buddha Sangha'' and the ''Kalinga Nippon Buddha Sangha'' in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://odishatourism.gov.in/?q=node/210 | title= Dhauli | publisher= Odisha Tourism, Government of Odisha |accessdate= August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby region also houses Ashokan edicts and possibly a [[Stupa]] at Bhaskareshwar temple at Tankapani road as arglars.
The Dhauligiri hills also has an ancient [[Shiva]] temple which is the place for mass gathering during [[Maha Shivaratri|Shiva Ratri]] Celebrations.

'''Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute''' (Астрофизический институт имени В. Г. Фесенкова, АФИФ), or '''FAPHI''', is a research institute in [[Almaty|Almaty, Kazakhstan]]. The institute was founded in 1941 as the Institute for Astronomy and Physics of the Kazakh branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences, when a group of Soviet astronomers was evacuated during [[World War II]] from the European parts of the USSR to Almaty. In 1948 [[Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov|G.A. Tikhov]] had organized an independent sector of [[astrobotany]], and in 1950 astronomers established the Astrophysical Institute of the Kazakh SSR. In 1989 the Institute was renamed after [[Vasily Fesenkov]], one of its founders.

FAPHI conducts both [[observation#observation in science|observational]] and theoretical research. The prime objects of observations are the [[Sun]], [[outer planets]], [[comets]], [[Herbig Ae/Be stars]], and [[active galaxy|active galaxies]]. The topics of theoretical research include [[stellar dynamics]] and [[computational astrophysics]], [[active galactic nuclei]], [[cosmology]], physics of comets and [[interstellar medium]]. The institute runs three observational bases in mountains near Almaty: [[Kamenskoe Plateau Observatory]], [[Assy-Turgen Observatory]] and [[Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory]].

FAPHI is a member of the [[International Astronomical Union]].

'''GNS Science''' ([[Māori language|Māori]]: '''Te Pū Ao''') is a [[New Zealand]] [[Crown Research Institutes|Crown Research Institute]]. It focuses on [[geology]], [[geophysics]] (including [[seismology]] and [[volcanology]]), and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear science]] (particularly [[ion beam|ion-beam technologies]], [[isotope|isotope science]] and [[radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]]).

GNS Science was known as the '''Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences''' (IGNS) from 1992 to 2005. Originally part of the New Zealand Government's [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (DSIR), it was established as an independent organisation when the Crown Research Institutes were set up in 1992.&lt;ref name="CRIact" &gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1992/0047/latest/DLM264292.html], Crown Research Institutes Act 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of that process, GNS Science became semi-commercial, and {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} operates as a government-owned company rather than as a government department. This change led to greater autonomy, accompanied by greater emphasis on financial viability. This is essential in the [[corporation | corporate environment]], especially for the purchase and maintenance of research equipment and infrastructure, because the New Zealand public science funding system doesn't normally provide grants for these purposes. 

As well as undertaking basic research, and operating the national geological hazards monitoring network (GeoNet)&lt;ref name="geonet"&gt;[http://www.geonet.org.nz/], GeoNet Hazards Monitoring Network.&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Isotope Centre (NIC),&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = The National Isotope Centre at GNS Science is New Zealand’s premier provider of isotope science expertise and associated commercial applications.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
GNS Science contracts its services to various private groups (notably energy companies) both in New Zealand and overseas, as well as to central and local government agencies, to provide scientific advice and information.&lt;ref name="Annual Report"&gt;

'''Gel bracelets''', or '''jelly bracelets''' are an inexpensive type of [[wristband]] often made from [[Silicone]]. They come in a variety of colors, and several can be worn on each arm. They have been popular in waves throughout the [[Western world]] and elsewhere since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara (2003). [http://www.snopes.com/risque/school/bracelet.asp "Sex Bracelets"]. snopes.com. Retrieved December 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; One style of these wristbands, known as "'''awareness bracelets'''", carry debossed messages demonstrating the wearer's support of a [[Social movement|cause]] or [[charitable organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4220000/newsid_4226500/4226529.stm "What are wristbands about?"] (February 01, 2005). news.bbc.co.uk.

The silicone wristband first became popular in 2004 with the [[Livestrong wristband|Livestrong]] yellow band which was set up by American cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] to raise awareness of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Walker | first = Rob | title = Yellow Fever | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2004-08-29 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=980CE7DA153EF93AA1575BC0A9629C8B63 | accessdate = 2007-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2014}} A larger, 1" wide variety became more popular in 2007, with bands selling the inexpensive items to young concert fans.

The price of these wristbands varies depending on the particular campaign, but are often $1 or £1 and usually the majority of the money goes towards the charity involved.

==Urban legend of sex bracelets==
{{see also|Handkerchief code}}
During a resurgence in popularity in 2003, gel bracelets became the subject of a widespread [[urban legend]] linking them to a supposed sex game explaining their popularity among young teenagers: they were subsequently dubbed "'''sex bracelets'''".&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aguilar, Alexa|author2=Bell, Kaitlin|date=November 18, 2003|url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/News/A9286BCB3F0E79D386256DE30017FF18?OpenDocument&amp;Headline=Rumors+link+bracelets+to+sex+game+|title=Rumors Link Bracelets to Sex Game.|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|archiveurl=https://business.highbeam.com/435553/article-1G1-110317398/rumors-link-bracelets-sex-game|archivedate=November 19, 2003|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/EDUCATION/12/10/sex.bracelet.ap/|title=Student 'sex bracelets' an urban legend?|date=December 12, 2003|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=February 10, 2006|location=CHICAGO, Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031220191943/http://www.cnn.com/2003/EDUCATION/12/10/sex.bracelet.ap/|archivedate=December 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to rumors, people who wore the jewelry implied they were willing to engage in various acts with whoever pulled them from their wrists; the acts ranged from hugging and [[kiss]]ing to [[sexual intercourse]], and were determined by the bracelet's color.

In October 2003, the rumors were prominent enough in Alachua Elementary School in [[Gainesville, Florida]] that the principal banned the bracelets to avert disruption and inappropriate comments about them.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031018/LOCAL/210180317&amp;SearchID=73258459105519|title=Principal puts ban on 'sex bracelets'|last=James|first=Douane D.|date=October 18, 2003|work=[[The Gainesville Sun]]|accessdate=September 30, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307005654/http://search.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20031018%2FLOCAL%2F210180317&amp;SearchID=73258459105519|archivedate=2007-03-07|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were subsequently banned in other schools around Florida and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; The effectors of these early bans did not insinuate that the rumors were true; however, some later media reports suggested that they may have been,&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;For example, see: {{cite web|url=http://www.nbc10.com/family/2649800/detail.html|title='Sex Bracelets' Cause Parental Concern|date=November 20, 2003|work=NBC Philadelphia|publisher=NBC10.com|accessdate=September 30, 2006|location=RALEIGH, N.C.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211223640/http://www.nbc10.com/family/2649800/detail.html|archivedate=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating something of a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; The supposed meanings of the colours of the bands were reported in the British press in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1486387/Blair-joins-wristband-celebrities-who-make-charity-cool.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Sally | last=Pook | title=Blair joins wristband celebrities who make charity cool | date=March 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very similar set of stories surfaced (or re-surfaced) in the British media in 2009, in which the bracelets were allegedly nicknamed ''shag bands''.&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fury-over-sex-bracelets-sold-420820|title=Fury over 'sex' bracelets sold to school children|last=Stretch|first=Euan|date=25 Sep 2009|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=mirror.co.uk|accessdate=25 Oct 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article6910040.ece|title=Would you let your daughter wear a "shag band"?|last=Midgley|first=Carol|date=10 Nov 2009|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=10 Nov 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/2658958/Bracelet-which-means-your-child-is-having-SEX.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024020040/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/2658958/Bracelet-which-means-your-child-is-having-SEX.html|archivedate=2015-10-24|title=Bracelet which means your child is having SEX|last=Pearce|first=Dulcie|date=29 Sep 2009|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=16 November 2010|location=London|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar stories circulated widely in Brazil during the 2009–2010 summer, where the bracelets were referred to as ''pulseiras do sexo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/SaoPaulo/0,,MUL1412235-5605,00-PULSEIRA+DO+SEXO+GERA+POLEMICA+ENTRE+PAIS+E+EDUCADORES+EM+SP.html |title=‘Pulseira do sexo’ gera polêmica entre pais e educadores em SP|trans-title='Sex bracelets' generates controversy among parents and educators in São Paulo |author=Paulo Toledo Piza|date=13 December 2009|language=Portuguese|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, a 13-year-old girl in Brazil was raped by three teenage boys after one of them snatched the bracelet she was wearing. The police stated that the crime was motivated by the use of sex bracelets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL1552238-5598,00-APOS+TER+PULSEIRA+DO+SEXO+ARRANCADA+ADOLESCENTE+E+ESTUPRADA+EM+LONDRINA.html |title=Após ter 'pulseira do sexo' arrancada, adolescente é estuprada em Londrina|trans-title=After 'sex bracelet' ripped off teen is raped in Londrina|author=Glauco Araújo|date=31 March 2010|language=Portuguese|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different versions associate different colors with sex acts (similar to the [[handkerchief code]]). For example, purple might be associated with kissing, red with [[lap dance|lapdancing]], and black with intercourse.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce"/&gt; Some versions said the involved action occurs at parties held for the purpose, making them similar to contemporary rumors of "[[rainbow party (sexuality)|rainbow parties]]", a gathering at which groups of girls wearing varying shades of [[lipstick]] supposedly take turns [[fellatio|fellating]] their classmates, leaving an array of colors on their penises. Other tales of teenage [[group sex|sex parties]] have circulated at various times. [[Folkloristics|Folklorist]] Barbara Mikkelson of [[snopes|snopes.com]] associates the "sex bracelet" stories with similar ones of the past.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; In the 1970s, pulltabs from [[beverage can|aluminum cans]] and labels from [[beer bottle]]s were supposedly considered "sex coupons" and obligated any girl presented with one to sleep with the bearer; by the 1990s the rumors shifted to include an assortment of plastic items, including some worn as bracelets. According to Mikkelson, there is likely little truth behind the stories, and the vast majority of teenagers who contact her site express shock and disappointment that so many have believed them.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;

At least one particular type of gel bracelet called the MY Single Band was specifically designed to advertise the wearer's relationship status.&lt;ref name=nydaily&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Victoria|title=Will bracelets for singles revolutionize dating?|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/single-band-shows-world-single-article-1.1434446|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=22 August 2013|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web|last=Dockterman|first=Eliana|title=MY Single Band: A Bracelet That Advertises You’re Single|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/09/01/wear-your-heart-on-your-sleeve-bracelets-advertise-youre-single/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1 September 2013|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press release, creators, Rina Mardahl and Rob Young, compared their concept to that of [[wedding rings]] that show the married status of a wearer,&lt;ref name=pr&gt;{{cite press release | title =Meeting Other Singles Just Got a Whole Lot Easier!  | publisher =[[PR Newswire]] | date =20 August 2013 | url =http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/meeting-other-singles-just-got-a-whole-lot-easier-220313101.html | accessdate = 1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young saying he "saw hundreds of people each day that could potentially be a suitable partner, yet there was no way of knowing their relationship status."&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite web|last=De Lacey|first=Martha|title=Would you wear a wristband to show you're single?

The following article gives a list of '''[[association football]] confederations, sub-confederations and associations around the world'''. The sport's international governing body is [[FIFA]], but those associations not affiliated to FIFA are also included in this article.

Most [[Europe]]an, [[Africa]]n, and [[Asia]]n countries have two principal competitions: a more prestigious league which is typically a double [[round-robin tournament]] restricted to the elite clubs, and a cup which is a [[single-elimination tournament]] open to both the elite and lesser clubs.  In the [[Americas]], leagues are often organised as either [[Tournament#Multi-stage tournaments|multi-stage tournaments]] or separate [[Apertura and Clausura]] stages.

===Regional===
Beneath the national level, governance of football may be divided up into regional or territorial associations. Other non-national associations represent stateless populations, [[diaspora]]s or [[micronation]]s. Details of these are listed at [[non-FIFA international football]].

'''Harappan architecture ''' is the [[architecture]] of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]], an ancient people who lived in the [[Indus Valley]] from about [[3300 BCE]] to [[1300 BCE]].  The Harappans were advanced for their time, especially in architecture.Harappa can be located in Punjab Pakistan, sitting roughly 150 km (93 miles) away from the Indus River. Historically it was common for cities in this area to be gateway cities for the inner cities.

== City Planning ==
Sites built by the Harappan would be raised, or built on man made hills.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthrojournal.com/issue/october-2011/article/exploring-the-use-of-monumental-public-architecture-and-sculpture-in-the-harappan-society|title=ANTHROJOURNAL|website=anthrojournal.com|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This could be to combat flooding in the nearby areas. Another aspect of Harappan architecture is they often built walls around their entire cities. This could have served several different needs. Many believe that the walls were built as defensive structures, where “Large and impressive construction works can be used to intimidate potential attackers (Trigger 1990),” . It was also an obvious feature to show the city was strong and powerful by being able to divert resources and labor to make such a large structure and not focus all of their energy on survival.  This was not the only purpose for the wall, it is thought that the wall also served as protection from floods. There is also evidence of a tapering at the bottom of the wall to guide the water away from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/world-history-beginnings/ancient-india/a/the-indus-river-valley-civilizations|title=Indus River Valley civilizations|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/695/harappa-an-overview-of-harappan-architecture-and-t/|title=Harappa: An Overview of Harappan Architecture and Town Planning|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city could be split into 2 different categories. There is an upper “acropolis” and a “lower town”. The lower town consisted of lower valued residential building located on the eastern side of the city, while the upper acropolis would be on the western side of the city which contained of the higher value buildings and public buildings. The acropolis was a “parallelogram that was 400-500 yards north-south and 200-300 yards east-west”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Daniel|date=June 18, 1984|title=Ideology and the Harappan Civilization|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/anthropology/v3922/pdfs/miller.pdf|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|volume=4|pages=34-71|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also thought that the acropolis area would be built on the highest part of the mound in the city showing the importance and status of the area was much higher than the rest of the area. Another feature which suggests the acropolis is of higher importance is that the fortifications around the area where bigger and stronger than those around the rest of the city.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Buildings and materials ==
The materials of houses depended on the location of the building. If the house was more rural the bricks would be mud. If the building was in an urban area then the bricks would be baked. The bricks were made in ratios of 1x2x4. “Houses range from 1-2 stories in height, with a central courtyard around which the rooms are arranged”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:CityDiagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of how Indus Valley cities were laid out (click on picture for bigger image).]]

The '''Institute of Molecular Biotechnology (IMBA)''' is an independent research organisation founded as a joint initiative of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in cooperation with the pharmaceutical company [[Boehringer Ingelheim]]. IMBA operates in close collaboration with the [[Research Institute of Molecular Pathology]], Boehringer's basic research center both located next to each other at the [[Vienna Biocenter]] (VBC).

==Research==
IMBA's research aims to understand the fundamental [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] processes and is currently focused on [[cell biology]], [[RNA interference]], and [[epigenetics]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Associated projects===
The Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC) is located at IMBA, and is available to researchers worldwide.&lt;ref name="IMBAFlies"&gt;{{cite web | title=Fly House | website=IMBA - Institute of Molecular Biotechnology | url=https://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at/scientific-facilities/fly-house/ | access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It collects an RNAi library of over 22,000 [[Drosophila]] strains.

==History==
The Institute of Molecular Biotechnology was founded in 1999 as a joint initiative of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and Boehringer Ingelheim. The Austrian Government and the city of Vienna would also contribute to its funding and in 2002 the geneticist [[Josef Penninger]] started  as the Scientific Director of IMBA who would recruit [[Barry Dickson]] as the first group leader; Dickson became managing director of the neighbouring institute [[Research Institute of Molecular Pathology]] (IMP) in 2006.

The construction of the institute started in 2003 and completed in 2006. The institute lies wall-to-wall with the IMP, to enhance collaborations and with whom they share the scientific facilities.

IMBA went on expanding and in 2007 the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC) in collaboration with the IMP is opened.

Since 2007 IMBA has a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) for decision making chaired by Nobel prize winner [[Eric Kandel]].

==Awards==
Being a newcomer in the Molecular Biology community, the IMBA has soon received recognition in the form of awards to its researchers and grants for projects. Josef Penninger, the scientific director, has been elected as a full member of The Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW). He has been awarded the [[Ernst Jung Prize]] for Medicine by the Jung-Stiftung for Science and Research, the [[Descartes Prize]] for Research by the [[European Commission]] and has received the Carus-Medal of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]]. In 2012, Josef Penninger was awarded with the Innovator Award for his project "Novel Approaches to Breast Cancer Prevention and Inhibition of Metastases" through the [[US Department of Defense]].

In 2013 Josef Penninger received his second [[European Research Council]]’s (ERC) Advanced Investigator Grant for his research in the field of [[haploid]] [[stem cells]].

Jürgen Knoblich, deputy scientific director at IMBA, was recognized with the [[Wittgenstein Award]], awarded by the Austrian [[Ministry of Education (Austria)|Ministry of Science]].

The institute has also received support by the European Research Council and Kazufumi Mochizuki has received one of the [[European Research Council]]'s first "ERC Starting grants".

==Science Communication==
In collaboration with the incorporated society Dialog Gentechnik, in 2006 IMBA opened the Vienna Open Lab, a hands-on biomolecular laboratory open to the public.&lt;ref name="Open Science"&gt;{{cite web | title=Open Science | website=Open Science | url=http://www.viennaopenlab.at/ | language=de | access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaac Fanous''' ({{Lang-cop|ⲓⲥⲁⲁⲕ ⲫⲁⲛⲟⲩⲥ}}; December 19, 1919 &amp;ndash; January 14, 2007) was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] artist and scholar, who specialized in [[Coptic art]] and founded its contemporary school.

==Early life and teaching==
Fanous was born in [[Minya, Egypt|Al-Minya]] and moved to [[Cairo]] to gain his degree from The Faculty of [[Applied arts]] now part of [[Helwan University]] in Egypt in 1941 and got a diploma in teaching in 1943.
Fanous was one of the first students of the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] founded in 1954 and he obtained his doctorate in 1958 . His two-year study grant in the [[Louvre]] in the mid- 1960s was a turning point in his career. He took the opportunity, while in France, to study icon painting under [[Léonid Ouspensky]], under whose patronage he developed a passion both as artist and theologian. This would lead, eventually, to his developing a style that was to become the new face of [[Copts|Coptic]] [[iconography]] in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="weekly.ahram.org.eg"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/829/cu2.htm AlAhram weekly article on Isaac Fanous] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216041300/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/829/cu2.htm |date=2007-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elahram.com/Index.asp?CurFN=writ4.htm&amp;DID=9099|title=Elahram.com|website=elahram.com|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanous chaired the Coptic Art department at the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] in [[Cairo]], and he has trained a number of other [[Copt]]ic artists from outside Egypt.

==Political changes==
As wealthy patrons of the arts disappeared from Egypt's hitherto cosmopolitan art world following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 revolution]], they were replaced by the state, and the career of Fanous took off from the struggles and experiences of his time. That is to say, he became more keenly aware of his Egyptian heritage. He was proud of everything that comes from [[Minya, Egypt|Al-Minya]] since the time of [[Akhnaten]], who built his city in this area.&lt;ref name="copts-united.com"&gt;[http://www.copts-united.com/wrr/go1.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1169064300&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=79&amp; Copts United article in Arabic by Shafik Botrous]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Coptic iconography==
For centuries before painters like Isaac Fanous the [[Coptic Orthodox]] church had its own style which is recognised as The Coptic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/Copticar.html|title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online -- Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more|website=www.bartleby.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202192654/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/Copticar.html|archivedate=2007-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of the European art spread to Egypt in the nineteenth Century there are a lot of the Churches in [[Egypt]] which have [[Icon]]s that are similar to a lot of the European (Western) Christianity Iconography style.

Fanous's contemporary school of icon painting came about as part of a general renaissance of Coptic culture which began during the patriarchate of [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Pope Cyril VI]] (1959–1971).&lt;ref name="copts-united.com"/&gt;

He capitalised on the already established Coptic style which could be seen in historic Coptic  Churches, but in his own style which he developed over the years. 

The style of his painting is called Modern Coptic style and as he was a pioneer in this field Fanous is considered the father of modern Coptic icon painting and the initiator of the modern renaissance in [[Coptic art]].&lt;ref name="weekly.ahram.org.eg"/&gt;

Fanous drew all the pictures and icons in [[St. Takla Haymanot's Church (Alexandria)|St. Takla Haymanot's Church]] in [[Alexandria]], which was consecrated in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://st-takla.org/Church-history-1.html |title=History of Saint Takla Himanout's Church |publisher=Official website of St. Takla Haymanot's Church |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1977 and 1978, he spent six months in the UK to paint icons in [http://www.stmark.org.uk St Mark's Coptic Orthodox church] in  Allen Street, [[Kensington]], London.

'''Joint Forest Management''' often abbreviated as '''JFM''' is the official and popular term in [[India]] for partnerships in [[forest]] [[Social movement|movement]] involving both the state forest departments and local communities. The policies and objectives of Joint Forest Movement are detailed in the Indian comprehensive National Forest Policy of 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moef.nic.in/downloads/about-the-ministry/introduction-nfp.pdf|title=National Forest Policy, 1988|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Environment, Forests and climate change|access-date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.manage.gov.in/managelib/extdig/Untitled-1.pdf#search=%22%22joint%20forest%20management%22%22&lt;/ref&gt; and the Joint Forest Management Guidelines of 1990 of the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fire.uni-freiburg.de/iffn/country/in/in_6.htm Lessons from Joint Forest Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although schemes vary from state to state and are known by different names in different [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], usually a village committee known as the Forest Protection Committee (FPC) and the Forest Department enter into a JFM agreement. Villagers agree to assist in the safeguarding of forest resources through protection from fire, grazing, and illegal harvesting in exchange for which they receive [[non-timber forest product]]s and a share of the revenue from the sale of [[timber]] products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envfor.nic.in/divisions/forprt/terijfm.html Study on Joint Forest Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111095120/http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/forprt/terijfm.html |date=2007-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Joint Forest Management originated in [[West Bengal]] in 1980's in Asia and Africa  . The major hardwood of Arabari is [[Sal tree|sal]], a commercially profitable forest crop. Ajit Kumar Banerjee, a [[Silviculture|silviculturalist]], working for the Forest Department as the Divisional Forest Officer, was conducting trials which were constantly being disturbed by grazing and illegal harvesting by the local populace. At the time there were no initiatives for sharing of forest resources between the government and the locals, with the government considering many of the locals no more than "thieves".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/sourcebook/sb0207.pdf#search=%22arabari%20banerjee%22&lt;/ref&gt; The forest official, against the suggestions of his co-workers, sought out representatives of eleven local villages and negotiated the terms of a contract with an ''ad hoc'' Forest Protection Committee. The initial program involved 612 families managing 12.7 square kilometres of forests classified as "degraded". 25% of profits from the forests were shared with the villagers. The experiment was successful and was expanded to other parts of the state in 1987. JFM is still in force at Arabari.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A few years later, Joint Forest Management was employed in the state of [[Haryana]] to prevent [[soil erosion]] and [[deforestation]]. In 1977, villagers were persuaded that instead of grazing on erosion-prone hills, building small dams would help agricultural output on areas currently under cultivation. The program led to reforestation of many hills in the state.However,officially the state of Odisha remains the first to pass the first resolution for JFM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98sep27/haryana.htm#3 tribuneindia... Haryana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
After the initial successes in West Bengal and Haryana, the JFM schemes received national importance in the legislation of 1988 and thrust in the Guidelines of 1998. As of 2000 27 states of the Indian Union had various JFM schemes with over 63,000 FPCs involved in the joint management of over 140,000&amp;nbsp;km² of forested land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rupfor.org/jfm.asp Resource Unit for Participatory Forestry (RUPFOR) - Joint Forest Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordania is known for his model of the origins of human [[choral singing]] in the wide context of [[human evolution]] and was one of founders of the [[International Research Centre for Traditional Polyphony]] in Georgia.

Jordania’s academic interests include study of worldwide distribution of choral [[polyphonic]] traditions, origins of [[choral singing]], origins of [[rhythm]], origins of human [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[behaviour]], cross-cultural prevalence of [[stuttering]], [[dyslexia]] and acquisition of [[phonological]] system in children, study of the [[cognitive]] threshold between animal and human cognitive abilities. His primary expertise is Georgian and Caucasian traditional music and vocal polyphony.

==Career==
Jordania was born in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (former [[Soviet Union]]). He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[ethnomusicology]] from [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]] in 1978. During 1979–1983 he was elected as the President of the Board of Creative Youth of Tbilisi. In 1982 he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in [[musicology]]–[[ethnomusicology]] from Tbilisi Theatrical Institute, and served as lecturer, senior lecturer, assistant professor, and professor at the Department of Georgian Traditional Music at [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]]. For one year (in 1984) he served as a dean of the Faculty of Musicology. In 1991 he received the title [[D.Mus]] from [[Kiev Conservatory]]. From 1988 until 1995 Jordania was the head of the Musical Sector of the Centre of the Mediterranean Studies at the Tbilisi State University. He published his first monograph on choral polyphony in 1989. In 1984 he was instrumental in organizing the conference "Problems of Folk Polyphony". This conference became the beginning of the series of biannual international conferences (1984, 1986, 1988, 1998, 2000) and symposia (2002, 2004, 2006, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016) on traditional polyphony, and led to establishing the [[International Research Centre for Traditional Polyphony]] at Tbilisi State Conservatory in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doijašvili|first=Manana|title=The Vano Saradjishvili Tbilisi State Conservatoire, 1917-2007|year=2008|publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]|isbn=1600219101|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWOM8ia2-2wC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Joseph+Jordania%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-sUhUs-hFfLh4AP8wYHoDQ&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Joseph%20Jordania%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, in recognition of "his contribution to systematic analysis of folk polyphonies of the world, proposing a new model for the origins of traditional choral singing in a broad context of human evolution" Jordania was awarded the [[Fumio Koizumi Prize for ethnomusicology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geidai.ac.jp/labs/koizumi/awarde/21jj1e.html|title=21st Annual (2009) Koizumi Fumio Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Koizumi Fumio Prize|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Born in 1950&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament (2007). ''[https://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0730/2007019485-b.html Spiritually integrated psychotherapy: Understanding and addressing the sacred]''. New York: Guilford Press. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-844-2}} (birth year 1950 in LOC pub data)&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name=VITA/&gt; Pargament received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/psych/page33121.html BGSU/Psychology faculty page - Kenneth I. Pargament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218203937/http://bgsu.edu/departments/psych/page33121.html |date=2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently studies various relationships between [[religion]], psychological well-being and stress, as well as other closely related subjects.  He is also licensed in [[Clinical psychology|Clinical Psychology]] and has a private practice.

Pargament has published over 200 papers on the subject of religion and spirituality in psychology.  He is world-renowned for his scholarly contributions to the [[psychology of religion]], and for providing clinically relevant scientific analyses of religion's role in mental health.  Pargament has also written two books: ''[[Psychology of Religion and Coping (book)|The Psychology of Religion and Coping: Theory, Research, Practice]]'' (1997; see [[Psychology of Religion and Coping (book)|article]]),&lt;ref name=p97&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament (1997). ''[[Psychology of Religion and Coping (book)|The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice]]''. New York: Guilford. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-664-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Spiritually Integrated Psychotherapy: Understanding and Addressing the Sacred'' (2007).  Both of these seminal works provide a systematic program of empirical research, guided by theory, that is of practical relevance to helping professionals.

== Research ==

One of Pargament's best known areas of research has pertained to Religious Coping, which involves drawing on religious beliefs and practices to understand and deal with life stressors.&lt;ref name=p97/&gt; Pargament has also helped to design a [[questionnaire]] called the "RCOPE" to measure Religious Coping strategies.&lt;ref name=rcope&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament, Harold G. Koenig &amp; Lisa M. Perez (2000). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4%3C519::AID-JCLP6%3E3.0.CO;2-1 The many methods of religious coping: Development and initial validation of the RCOPE]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology'', v56 n4, pp519-543. {{doi|10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4&lt;519::AID-JCLP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The three methods of coping that are identified by the RCOPE are the deferring style, self-directing style, and collaborative style. The deferring style involves delegating all problem solving to God; the self-directing style is when the individual chooses to utilize the power God has given them to solve the problem on their own; and the collaborative style is implemented when the individual treats God as a teammate in the problem solving process. The collaborative style of religious coping has been found to have the greatest psychological benefits, correlating with increased self-esteem and lower levels of depression.&lt;ref name=copingstyles&gt;Phillips III, R. E., Lynn, Q. K., Crossley, C. D., &amp; Pargament, K. I. (2004). Self-Directing 	Religious Coping: A Deistic God, Abandoning God, or No God at All?. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 43(3), 409-418.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, Pargament's work has helped set the stage for a large scale program of research on this subject: currently there have been over 250 published studies on religious coping.

Pargament's research also has helped psychologists learn how religious belief influences mental and physical health. For instance, he found that religious activity increased for Muslim-Americans after 9/11, and that in comparison with those who remained isolated and rejected by their religion, they experienced fewer symptoms of depression &lt;ref name=muslims&gt;Abu-Raiya, H., Pargament, K. I., &amp; Mahoney, A. (2011). Examining coping methods with stressful interpersonal events experienced by Muslims living in the United States following the 9/11 attacks. Psychology Of Religion And Spirituality, 3(1), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, he found that negative religious coping among AIDS patients was associated with an increase in HIV-related symptoms &lt;ref name=HIV&gt;Cotton, S., Puchalski, C. M., Sherman, S. N., Mrus, J. M., Peterman, A. H., Feinberg, J., Kenneth 	I. Pargament, Amy C. Justice, Anthony C. Leonard, Tsevat, J. (2006). Spirituality and Religion in Patients with HIV/AIDS. Journal of General Internal Medicine, 21S5-S13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pargament has described four major stances toward religion that have been adopted by psychotherapists in their work with clients. He called them the religiously ''rejectionist'', ''exclusivist'', ''constructivist'', and ''[[religious pluralism|pluralist]]'' stances.&lt;ref name=p97/&gt;&lt;ref name=zp&gt;Brian J. Zinnbauer &amp; Kenneth I. Pargament (2000). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=2995869&amp;site=ehost-live Working with the sacred: Four approaches to religious and spiritual issues in counseling]. ''Journal of Counseling &amp; Development'', v78 n2, pp162-171. ISSN 0748-9633&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the pluralistic approach is the best for clinicians because it recognizes the existence of a Supreme Being but allows for many interpretations of that reality.&lt;ref name=puralistic&gt;Zinnbauer, B. J., &amp; Pargament, K. I. (2000). Working With the Sacred: Four Approaches to Religious and Spiritual Issues in Counseling. Journal of Counseling &amp; Development, 78(2), 162-171.&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Pargament believes that religious discussions should become a greater part of the therapeutic process. He has advocated for religious guidebooks to be created for psychotherapists and that religious training be mandated.&lt;ref name="puralistic"/&gt;

Pargament has also linked [[attribution theory]] to the [[psychology of religion]], doing empirical research distinguishing between different forms of religious attribution.

== The French School of Anthropology ==

The center was founded in 1967 at [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense|Paris X University]] by Eric de Dampierre, and associated with the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|National Scientific Research Council]] ([[CNRS]]) from 1968. In 1989 it became a Mixed Research Unit (UMR). Today it is the UMR 7186.

== Activities ==
The spectrum of research activities covered by the LESC is quite vast, reaching from traditional fieldwork based ethnography to visual anthropology. 
These activities are conducted mainly within the three scientific research departments:
* [[Technology]]
* [[Americas|Americanism]]
* [[Ethnomusicology]]

== Learned societies ==
They are two [[Learned society|learned societies]] housed in the LESC.
* The '''Société d'ethnologie''', created in 1986 by Eric de Dampierre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mae.u-paris10.fr/socethno/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130234331/http://www.mae.u-paris10.fr/socethno/index.htm |archivedate=2011-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1839">The '''Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus''' (often abbreviated as '''LOB Corpus''') is a million-word collection of British English texts which was compiled in the 1970s in collaboration between the [[University of Lancaster]], the [[University of Oslo]], and the [[Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities]], [[Bergen]], to provide a British counterpart to the [[Brown Corpus]] compiled by [[Henry Kučera]] and [[W. Nelson Francis]] for American English in the 1960s.

Its composition was designed to match the original Brown corpus in terms of its size and genres as closely as possible using documents published in the UK by British authors. Both corpora consist of 500 samples each comprising about 2000 words in the following genres:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3520">[[Image:Wiki-lcp.png|thumb|right|An Illustration of a couple demonstrating the lateral coital position.]]
The '''lateral coital position''' is a [[list of sex positions|sex position]] described by [[Masters and Johnson]] in their ''Human Sexual Response''. The position was preferred by 75% of their [[heterosexual]] respondents once they had tried it.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

==Technique==
Moving into this position requires that the partners begin with [[Woman on top (sex position)|woman on top sexual position]] with penis penetrating the woman and then:

# The man lifts the woman's right leg up slightly with his left hand.
# The man begins to bend his left knee without lifting his knee from the bed.  Instead, he slides his left knee outwards as it bends, opening his left inner thigh towards the ceiling. He slides his left leg upward and outward until it has passed underneath her lifted right knee.
# Meanwhile, the woman leans to ''her'' left, and places her weight on her left knee. This allows her to straighten out her lifted right leg behind her, placing it inside her partner's bent left leg.  Care must be taken at this point that the penis does not slip out.
# Once the legs are switched, the woman leans forward to the man's chest.  He holds her body firmly against his body with both arms.
# Together, they roll to her right (his left), where her upper body remains.  She may prop herself up on her right elbow or lie flat against a pillow.  The man rolls back flat upon his back, while they keep their pelvises pressed together. At this point the man is lying flat on his back on the bed and the plane of the woman's torso is almost perpendicular to that of the man's. Her shoulders are almost vertical, with her left shoulder above her right shoulder. Her torso is twisted so that her pelvis is horizontal, resting on his pelvis. The woman's weight is entirely on the right side of her body and her right elbow.
# They resume intercourse.

==Advantages==
This position leaves the partners both fully supported by the bed (the man on his back, the woman on her right shoulder and torso) except for the woman's left leg which is resting on the man's right hip. The man is flat on his back, while the woman is rolled slightly to her right. Their bodies form an angle of roughly 30°, leaving the partners face to face with the woman's weight on her right shoulder. Pillows are used under both partners' heads. Should her size require it, more pillows may be needed to support the woman's upper body.

According to Masters and Johnson, "when facility in lateral coital positioning has been obtained, there is no pinning of either the male or female partner. There is mutual freedom of pelvic movement in any direction, and there will be no cramping of muscles or necessity for tiring support of body weight. The lateral coital position provides both sexes flexibility for free sexual expression. This position particularly is effective for the woman, as she can move with full freedom to enjoy either slow or rapid pelvic thrusting, depending upon current levels of sexual tensions."

The position was recommended by them for all couples, and also particularly in cases of [[premature ejaculation]] due to reduced pressure on the man.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1591">"'''The law of the suppression of radical potential'''" is an idea first described by [[Brian Winston]] in his book, ''Misunderstanding Media''. According to the law, when a communications technology is realized, its growth is suppressed through the constraining influence of already prevailing institutions and other mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=McQuail's Mass Communication Theory |authorlink=Denis McQuail |last=McQuail |first=Denis |page=156 |year=2010 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=978-1-84920-292-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winston shows how the law can be used as a model for describing the life cycle of many communications technologies. His approach is in particular directed against [[technological determinism]] and instead proposes that the [[emergence]] of new media and new technologies is mediated and controlled by society. According to Winston, a supervening social necessity creates a need for a particular technology, but the Law of the suppression of radical potential means that new technology will be integrated into the status quo as opposed to radically disrupting it. 

Winston has elaborated his model of technological change in particular in the books ''Technologies of Seeing: Photography, Cinematography and Television'' (1997) and ''Media Technology and Society: A History: From the Telegraph to the Internet'' (1998; Kindle publication in 2007 )

[[File:Ligatures.jpg|thumb|Box and oblique '''ligatures''' (13th to 16th century); see [[#Usage|usage]], below]]
In [[music notation]], a '''ligature''' is a graphic symbol that tells a musician to perform two or more notes in a single gesture, and on a single syllable. It was primarily used from around 800 to 1650 AD. Ligatures are characteristic of [[neumatic]] (chant) and [[mensural notation|mensural]] notation. The notation and meaning of ligatures has changed significantly throughout Western music history, and their precise interpretation is a continuing subject of debate among [[List of musicologists|musicologists]].

==History==
===Plainchant===
{{main|Plainsong}}
{{main|Gregorian chant}}
The early notation of [[plainsong|plainchant]], particularly [[Gregorian chant]], used a series of shapes called [[neumes]], which served as reminders of music that was taught [[rote learning|by rote]] rather than as an exact record of which notes to sing.  Neumes were in use from the 9th through the 11th centuries AD for most plainsong, and differed by region.&lt;ref name="Apel"&gt;{{Citation|last = Apel | first = Willi | author-link = Willi Apel | publication-date = 1953 | title = The Notation of Polyphonic Music, 900–1600 | publication-place = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Medieval Academy of America | pages = 87–94 | isbn = 978-0-8400-0526-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2015}}&lt;!--In the passage in question, Apel is primarily discussing ligatures, which he says "developed from certain neumes ... such as were in use during the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries", but also says, "When (around 1150 [i.e., the middle of the twelfth century] ther neumes changed to the more definite forms of the so-called Roman chorale notation, these four signs took on the following shapes: [illustration]. These forms are still used today...". He says nothing about different regional styles, and the discussion of neumes is confined to p. 88.--&gt;  Due to their malleable nature, there were no hard and fast rules for the lengths each note was supposed to last, or even how high or low the intervals between notes were to be.

===''De mensurabili musica''===
{{main|Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)}}
A treatise on notation named ''De mensurabili musica'' was copied around 1260.  In this treatise, the anonymous author proposed that, much in the same way that poetry of the time was based on a series of [[Rhythmic_mode|modal rhythms]], music should also be set up in this way.  The notation of these [[rhythmic mode|modes]] was accomplished primarily through using ligatures in varying lengths and with varying degrees of complexity, where the rhythms would be derived from context.  For most of their notated history, this was the purpose of ligatures: to indicate the rhythmic mode.&lt;ref name="Apel"/&gt;

===Franco of Cologne===
{{main|Franco of Cologne}}
Around 1250, a music theorist named [[Franco of Cologne]] published a treatise on music entitled ''Ars cantus mensurabilis''.  In this treatise, Franco proposed that note values should be set up objectively, so that when looking at the notated music, a musician would be able to tell what notes were being sung or played, and the duration of those notes, with some degree of certainty.  Ligatures were used for this as well, as they had become more or less standardized through the practice of the rhythmic modes.

===Polyphonic music from c1300-c1600===
See [[mensural notation#Ligatures|mensural notation]] (ligatures).

==Usage==
[[image:Ligatures.jpg|thumb|right|Ligature values vary based on the shape of the ligature and whether it has a tail.]]
Ligatures have two basic shapes: ''box'' (rectangular) and ''oblique'' (angled).  Additionally, some ligatures have tails that either point up or down; the direction of the ligature's tail affects its meaning, unlike the direction of a tail on a modern note head.  While primarily contextual, the system of ligatures in use from the 13th to the 16th century is fairly standardized.  All ligatures of this period have the following principles in common:
*All ligature notes are either the length of a ''[[longa (music)|longa]]'' ("''L''"), a ''[[double whole note|breve]]'' ("''B''"), or a ''[[whole note|semibreve]]'' ("''S''").
*All ligatures have at least two notes.
*For ease of discussion, ligatures of different lengths have different names.  A ligature with two notes is called a ''binaria''; one with three notes, a ''ternaria''; one with four notes, a ''quaternaria''; and one with five notes, a ''quinaria''.  Larger ones are possible, but rare.
*If a ligature has three or more notes, all notes in the middle (the ''mediae'') are ''B''.
*A downward tail changes the value of the note where the tail occurs, either from ''L'' to ''B'' or, less commonly, from ''B'' to ''L''.
*An upward tail indicates that the next ''two'' notes are a series of ''S''.
*A tail at the end of a ligature indicates an additional note be sung or played, called a ''plica'', that is not part of the ligature.  Plicas were especially common with the rhythmic modes, to accommodate in practice what could not be accomplished within the very strict theoretical basis for modal music.&lt;ref name="Apel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godt"&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1093/earlyj/4.1.44 | last = Godt | first = Irving | publication-date = January 1976 | title = Reading Ligatures from Their Ground State | periodical = Early Music | publisher = Oxford University Press | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–45 | year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternate interpretations===

Most scholarship on ligatures is focused on period from the 13th to the 16th centuries.  Prior to this period, ligatures were far less standardized; a ''quaternaria'' ligature that, under the above rules, would mean a series like ''SSLB'' would simply mean ''BBBB''.&lt;ref name="Parrish"&gt;{{Citation | last = Parrish | first = Carl | publication-date = 1978 | title = The Notation of Medieval Music | publication-place = Hillsdale, NY | publisher = Pendragon Press | page = 70 | isbn = 978-0-918728-08-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcription==

In transcribing old works to modern notation, where no compound graphs as ligatures exist, editors usually indicate by a hook, a bracket (brace), or (less often in polyphonic music) a [[slur (music)|slur]]/[[phrase mark]] those notes that the original combined into a ligature.  To avoid confusion, many scores transcribed purely for performance do not include additional notation to indicate that a particular note originally belonged to a ligature, as most methods to show this have separate meanings in a performance capacity.

See talk page for more information. --&gt; is a Peruvian woman who became the [[list of youngest birth mothers|youngest confirmed mother]] in [[history of medicine|medical history]], giving birth at the age of five years, seven months, and 21 days.&lt;ref name=Snopes/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; 

==Early life and development==
Born in [[Castrovirreyna Province|Ticrapo, Castrovirreyna Province, Peru]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Six decades later, world's youngest mother awaits aid |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp |work=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]] |date=27 August 2002 |accessdate=14 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ65vfQ8?url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp |archivedate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[silversmith]] Tiburelo Medina and Victoria Losea,&lt;ref name="await"&gt;Elgar Brown (for ''Chicago Evening American''). "American scientists await U.S. visit of youngest mother: Peruvian girl and baby will be exhibited", ''San Antonio Light'', 11 July 1939, page 2A.&lt;/ref&gt; she was brought to a hospital by her parents at the age of five years due to increasing abdominal size. She was originally thought to have a [[tumor]], but doctors determined she was in her seventh month of [[pregnancy]]. Dr Gerardo Lozada took Medina to [[Lima]] to have other specialists confirm that she was pregnant.&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Mikkleson |title=Youngest Mother|publisher=Snopes.com|accessdate=25 January 2017 |url=http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/medina.asp |date=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary newspaper accounts indicate that interest in the case developed on many fronts. The ''San Antonio Light'' newspaper reported in its 16 July, 1939, edition&amp;mdash;in anticipation of the girl's expected visit to U.S. university scientific facilities&amp;mdash;that a national Peruvian obstetrician/midwife association had demanded that the girl be transported to a national maternity hospital; the paper quoted 18 April reports in the Peruvian paper ''La Crónica'' stating that a North American film making concern had sent a representative "with authority to offer the sum of $5,000 to benefit the minor [in exchange for filming rights] ... we know that the offer was rejected."&lt;ref name="sympathy"&gt;Elgar Brown (for ''Chicago Evening American''). "Wide sympathy aroused by plight of child-mother: opportunity seen to make Lina independent," ''San Antonio Light'', 16 July 1939, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The same article, reprinted from a Chicago paper, noted that Lozada had made films of Medina for scientific documentation and had shown them around 21 April while addressing Peru's National Academy of Medicine; on a subsequent visit to Lina's remote hometown, some of the baggage carrying the films had fallen into the river while crossing "a very primitive bridge ... Enough of his pictorial record remained, however, to intrigue the learned savants."&lt;ref name="sympathy"/&gt;

A month and a half after the original diagnosis, Medina gave birth by [[caesarean section]] to a boy. She was 5 years, 7 months, and 21 days,&lt;ref name=Snopes/&gt; [[List of youngest birth mothers|the youngest known person in history to give birth]]. The caesarean birth was necessitated by her small [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. The surgery was performed by Lozada and Dr Busalleu, with Dr Colareta providing [[anaesthesia]]. When doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs from [[precocious puberty]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Her case was reported in detail by Dr. Edmundo Escomel in the medical journal ''La Presse Médicale'', including the additional details that her [[menarche]] had occurred at eight months of age, in contrast to a past report stating that she had been having regular periods since she was three years old&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation|year=1988|author1=Janice Delaney|author2=Mary Jane Lupton|author3=Emily Toth|isbn=0252014529|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njfQfrMr31EC&amp;q=Lina+Medina#v=snippet&amp;q=Lina%20Medina&amp;f=false|edition=2nd (revised)|publisher=University of Illinois Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shearman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rodney P.

Medina's son weighed {{convert|2.7|kg|lb st|abbr=on}} at birth and was named Gerardo after her doctor. Gerardo was raised believing that Medina was his sister, but found out at the age of 10 that she was, in fact, his mother.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;

==Identity of the father and later life==
Medina has never revealed the father of the child nor the circumstances of her impregnation. Escomel suggested she might not actually know herself by writing that Medina "couldn't give precise responses".&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt; Although Lina's father was arrested on suspicion of [[child sexual abuse]], he was later released due to lack of evidence, and the biological father was never identified.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="littlemother"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893791,00.html |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |title=Little Mother |date=16 December 1957 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ7D1EHq?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C893791%2C00.html |archivedate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son grew up healthy. He died in 1979 at the age of 40.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;

In young adulthood, Medina worked as a secretary in the Lima clinic of Lozada, who gave her an education and helped put her son through high school.&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt; Medina later married Raúl Jurado, who fathered her second son in 1972. {{As of|2002}}, they lived in a poor district of Lima known as "Chicago Chico".&lt;ref name="Dietz1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Dietz|title=Urban Poverty, Political Participation, and the State: Lima, 1970–1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qf0NQ3Eut2IC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=lima+chicago+chico|date=15 July 1998|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-7193-1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; She refused an interview with [[Reuters]] that year,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; just as she had turned away many reporters in years past.&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt;

==Documentation==
Although it was speculated that the case was a [[hoax]], a number of doctors over the years have verified it based on [[biopsies]], [[X rays]] of the fetal skeleton ''[[in utero]]'', and photographs taken by the doctors caring for her.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Medico-Physical"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Journal of Medical-physical Research: A Journal of Progressive Medicine and Physical Therapies, Volumes 15-16|year=1941|publisher=American Association for Medico-Physical Research|page=188|quote=Lina Medina...

There are two published photographs documenting the case. The first was taken around the beginning of April 1939, when Medina was seven-and-a-half months into pregnancy. Taken from Medina's left side, it shows her standing naked in front of a neutral backdrop. This is the only published photograph of Lina taken during her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/histoire/medica/resultats/?cote=100000x1939xartorig&amp;p=878&amp;do=page "La Presse médicale",  47(43): 875, 1939] "La Plus Jeune Mère du Monde".  (31 May 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Max-Planck-Institut für Biophysik.jpg|thumb|300px|Max Planck Institute for Biophysics]]
The '''Max Planck Institute of Biophysics''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für Biophysik}}) is located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. It was founded as [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biophysics]] in 1937, and moved into a new building in 2003. It is one of 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (Max Planck Gesellschaft).

{{coord|50|10|25|N|8|37|49|E|type:landmark|display=title}}

A prerequisite for the understanding of the fundamental processes of life is the knowledge of the structure of the participating macromolecules. Two of the four departments are devoted to the challenging task of determining the structure of [[membrane protein]]s. Under the direction of [[Hartmut Michel]] ([[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] of 1988 for the first structure determination of a membrane protein), the Department of Molecular Membrane Biology approaches this problem primarily by [[x-ray crystallography]], whereas the Department of Structural Biology, headed by [[Werner Kühlbrandt]], uses the complementary technique of [[electron microscopy]]. The Department of Biophysical Chemistry, directed by [[Ernst Bamberg]], studies the function of these [[protein]]s in native or reconstituted membranes by electrophysiological and spectroscopic methods. The fourth department "Molecular Neurogenetics" under the direction of [[Peter Mombaerts]] has started its work in 2007. Since 2013, the institute hosts a new department "Theoretical Biophysics", directed by Gerhard Hummer focusing on development and implementation of broad range of computational and theoretical methods to bridge fundamental physics, chemistry and biology of molecular systems.

Since April 2003, the institute's four departments are housed in the same building, resulting in improved scientific interaction between the research groups. Scientific links to fellow researchers at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]] have been strengthened further as the institute is now situated next to the University's biology, chemistry and physics laboratories.

Together with the [[Max Planck Institute for Brain Research]] and the [[Goethe University]] of Frankfurt am Main the institute runs the International Max Planck Research School (IMPReS) on the Structure and Function of Biological Membranes, a graduate program offering a Ph.D.

==Note on the Institute's history==
The institute was founded in [[Frankfurt]] as the "[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biophysics]]" in 1937. However, it had a predecessor, the "[[Institut für Physikalische Grundlagen der Medizin]]" which had been established in 1921 by [[Friedrich Dessauer]], an admirer of Wilhelm Roentgen, who endeavored to apply radiation physics to medicine and biology. Being a conservative member of parliament for the democratic "Zentrumspartei", Dessauer opposed the National Socialists' rise to power and was then forced to emigrate in 1934. His successor, Dessauer's colleague and long-standing collaborator, [[Boris Rajewsky]] was the first director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biophysics. Rajewsky firstly coined the term "Biophysics" and consequently the institute became one of the first to be known by this name.

'''Mikhail P. Kulakov''' (March 29, 1927 in [[St. Petersburg|Leningrad]] – February 10, 2010 in [[Highland]], [[California]], United States) was a Russian [[pastor]], social and religious activist, and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Bible scholar and translator.  He was co-founder of the Russian Branch of the [[International Association for Religious Freedom]] [http://irla.org] (1992), founder of the Institute for Bible Translation in Zaoksky (Tula Region, Russia), an honorary board member of the [[Russian Bible Society]]  [http://www.biblia.ru/about/direction/kylakov], and the head of the Church of [[Seventh-day Adventist]]s in the [[Soviet Union]] (1990—1992). Kulakov's work on translating the Bible into modern Russian language has been lauded by biblical scholars, philologists, theologians and various representatives of [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://predanie.ru/lib/book/67500|title=Новый Завет (перевод под ред. Кулакова М. П.)|work=Предание.Ру - православный mp3 архив - скачать}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Mikhail Petrovich Kulakov was born on March 29, 1927 in [[Leningrad]] ([[St. Petersburg]])  to the family of a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] pastor. In 1928, his family moved to the city of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] (in Central Russia) when his father, Peter Stepanovich Kulakov, was sent there for pastoral ministry.  During the [[Atheism|atheist]] and authoritarian rule of the Soviet government, the Kulakov family was under the scrutiny of state security bodies. In 1935, his father was arrested for religious activity and the court sentenced him to imprisonment in the camps of Vorkuta, followed by an exile in [[Siberia]].  Following the exile, the Kulakov family moved to the village Krasnyi Klyuch in the [[Krasnoyarsk]] Region, where they lived until 1939. After the end of the exile the family moved to Samara and then to Maykop (Adygea, Russia) where they lived until the eve of the [[World War II|Second World War]] when they relocated to Ivanovo. Here Mikhail Kulakov enrolled in the Ivanovo Art School, from which he graduated in 1947.

In August 1945, Kulakov became a baptized member of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. (As he recalled in his book,&lt;ref&gt;Though the Heavens Fall, R &amp; H, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-8280-2366-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; “...late at night, far away from the city lights, my father secretly baptised eight people, including me. I was 18 years old...”). Following his baptism, he began to actively assist his father in conducting clandestine worship services and the missionary work. In 1947, his father was arrested again and was given a ten-year sentence. It was then that Kulakov's mother moved him and his siblings to Daugavpils, [[Latvia]]. Here, Kulakov continued to work in the church and also taught drawing and painting in the city schools. The peaceful existence was short-lived, and nine months later in March 1948, he was arrested by the [[KGB]] along with his elder brother Stephen. After serving six months in prison in [[Ivanovo]], Kulakov was sentenced to five years in the corrective hard [[Gulag|labor camps of the U.S.S.R.]] The first 18 months of his five-year term (1948–1953) he was held in the corrective labor camp in Mordovia (about 400 miles east of [[Moscow]]).
Kulakov's brother Stephen was one of the thousands who died in the labor camps near the Far North city of [[Vorkuta]]. Despite the many hardships he faced, Kulakov remembered his experiences in the camps as a “life university” and he was grateful that he survived. He also recalled that these years were brightened for him because he had the opportunity to share his faith with the other captives in the camps.

In 1953, his sentence expired and Kulakov was sent into permanent exile in the Kazakh village Myrzykul (Kustanai region). After marrying his wife Anna (née Velgosha) in 1954, he was released from exile under amnesty. In 1955, he and his young family moved to [[Alma-Ata]] the former capital of [[Kazakhstan]]. It was here that the Kulakov family became actively involved in the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] ministry despite severe persecution.

== Role in the unification and development of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the Soviet Union ==

In 1958, Kulakov was ordained as a minister and was elected head of the [[Seventh-day Adventist church]] organization that at the time existed unofficially in the republics of Central Asia, [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Caucasus]].
In the 1960s, the Soviet government continued its persecution of religious organizations despite the external liberalization of some aspects of religious life in the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]]. Because of this, Kulakov and his family were forced to repeatedly change their place of residence to avoid arrests. In 1960, he moved his family from [[Almaty]] to the village of Akkul’ ([[Dzhambul]] region), then in 1962 to [[Kokand]] and in 1966 to [[Chimkent]] (in southern [[Kazakhstan]]).

In the late 1960s the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church]] [http://www.adventist.org] (the supreme governing body of Adventists, located in the U.S.) tried unsuccessfully to establish contacts with the Adventists in the Soviet Union – the activity of the church was then strictly controlled by state authorities. For many decades Seventh-day Adventist living in the Soviet Union could not attend the international meetings of the world church. In 1970 yet another attempt was made to invite a delegation from the Soviet Union to the Adventist World Congress in Detroit but neither Kulakov nor other pastors who had received an invitation were allowed release from the country.

In the fall of 1970, Kulakov was able to visit the U.S. on a private invitation of his aunt, Valentina Popova, then living in [[California]]. His trip to the U.S. coincided with the annual meeting of the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]], to which, Kulakov was invited. This conference was a notable event, because since 1909, none of the Russian Adventist leaders had ever been to the headquarters of the General Conference. The president of the General Conference at the time, Robert Pearson, and other church leaders expressed great interest in the happenings of the Adventists in the Soviet Union. Aware of internal discord and organizational difficulties that prevailed in the church in the area, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] leaders requested and authorized Kulakov to take responsibility for the reconciliation and unification of disparate groups of Seventh-day Adventist communities in the Soviet Union.

In the years following the visit to the General Conference World Headquarters, Kulakov, driven by his passionate desire to see his beloved church united and vibrant, together with his colleagues in the Central Asian republics and in the Baltic republics, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, worked tirelessly to bring about the consolidation of the Seventh-day Adventist communities into one united family. Kulakov devoted over twenty years of his life to the cause of reconciliation and re-unification of the isolated groups of Adventists in the U.S.S.R.

In 1975, along with six other leaders of the church, Kulakov was able to attend the next congress of the General Conference in Vienna, Austria. For the first time, after six decades of isolation and repression, the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the Soviet Union was represented at the World Congress . Kulakov was elected as the member of the Executive Committee of the General Conference  and became a member of the Academy of Adventist Ministers.

Also in 1975, the Seventh-day Adventist Church leaders in [[Moscow]], [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Leningrad]] and other Russian cities asked Mikhail P. Kulakov to move from [[Kazakhstan]] to the Russian Federation in order to create a single church organization on the territory of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]].  In response to this request and on the recommendation of the President of the General Conference, Kulakov moved to Russia at the end of 1975 and settled in Tula.

In March 1977, after a 50-year interval, the first official Congress of the Adventists took place in Russia. The aim was to unite disparate groups into one Adventist church organization. At this time M.P. Kulakov was elected as head of the association of Adventist Churches in the Russian Federation. However, the government authorities were slow to permit the establishment of the church organization which would be in full accord with the denominational Working Policy.

The complete re-unification of the splintered groups of Adventists in the Soviet Union was only achieved by the end of 1980, when Kulakov was able to negotiate permission for the official visit to the [[U.S.S.R.]] of the General Conference president [[Neal C. Wilson]].&lt;ref name=" GCC1981-10"&gt;[http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/GCC/GCC1981-10/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=15&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On behalf of the Adventist World Church, Wilson communicated to the Adventists in the U.S.S.R. that the General Conference recognized the official leadership of the church in the U.S.S.R. and appealed to the leaders of all factions to join the officially recognized group of Adventists in the U.S.S.R., forming one organization with them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/GCC/GCC1981-10/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, an advisory board was formed at the semi-official meeting of church leaders from all republics of the former Soviet Union. It was a step to unite scattered groups of Adventist believers of the Soviet Union into one organization. Mikhail P. Kulakov (from the Russian Federation) and Nikolai A. Zhukalyuk (from the [[Ukraine]]) were elected as the coordinators of this advisory board.  Working closely with the leaders of the church in the various other republics of the U.S.S.R., they worked to re-unite and organize national and local associations of Adventists throughout the Soviet Union as close to the Working Policy of the world church organization as the circumstances at the time would allow.

To recognize Kulakov's role in the unification and organization of the Adventist Church, the [[Southwestern Adventist University|Southwestern Adventist College]] in [[Texas]], USA awarded M.P. Kulakov an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctoral Degree]] in Theology in 1987.

== Founding of an educational institution and publishing house ==

Mikhail Kulakov, along with his son Mikhail Mikhailovich Kulakov, led in the establishment and development of a theological seminary for the training of pastors in the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the [[U.S.S.R.]]  After much effort and intense dialogue with the authorities and government officials, they were able to receive the necessary authorizations. The Kulakov family moved to the village of Zaoksky in 1988, where the first Protestant theological seminary in the country was thus established (currently Zaoksky Theological Seminary) [http://www.zau.ru]. A few years later under Kulakov leadership, "Source of Life", the first Seventh-day Adventist publishing house in the [[U.S.S.R.]], was opened as well [http://www.lifesource.ru].

It was not until 1990   that the Adventists were able to receive the permission of the Soviet government to form the Euro-Asia Division of the world Adventist Church at the 1990  World Congress in [[Indianapolis]], IN and Kulakov was elected as its president.&lt;ref name=" GCC1990-07"&gt;[http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/GCC/GCC1990-07/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=3&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public activities ==

In the 1970s and 1980s Kulakov, as one of the influential religious leaders in the [[U.S.S.R.]], represented the Seventh-day Adventist Church at various public events in the [[U.S.S.R.]] and abroad at international conferences in defense of peace. In June 1977, he participated in the World Conference "Religious Leaders for Lasting Peace, Disarmament and Just Relations Among Nations" and in 1982 he was invited to take part in the World Conference "Religious Workers for Saving the Sacred Gift of Life from Nuclear Catastrophe" in [[Moscow]]. Kulakov also took part in numerous other Christian Peace conferences, which took place abroad. In 1978 (June 22–27) he traveled to [[Prague]] with a delegation of ministers from various religious bodies in the Soviet Union to attend the conference of the Christian Peace Movement ({{cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/17-1-95.shtml |title=Christian Peace Movement |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67vUoatBc?url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/17-1-95.shtml |archivedate=2012-05-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}). A few years later in 1983 (20–24 April), Kulakov took an active part in the same conference in Sweden in [[Uppsala]] (For Life and Peace) ({{cite web |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=2202148&amp;fileOId=2214687 |title=For Life and Peace |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67vUp9JAW?url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=2202148&amp;fileOId=2214687 |archivedate=2012-05-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}). In the mid-1980s he twice traveled to Japan to participate in the peace conferences organized by the religious organizations of Japan.

In the late 1980s, with the improving relationships between the Soviet Union and the United States, the idea of "[[public diplomacy]]" gained popularity as an effective means of removing tension in the world. As a result, possibilities emerged for meetings with the public figures from the Soviet Union. Kulakov, as one of the religious leaders, was invited to attend the International Chautauqua Conference on US-Soviet Relations, held in [[Chautauqua]], NY., August 24–28, 1987{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/rus/text_files/EastUropeProblems/1987-19-20/1987-19-20%20%28220-226%29.pdf |title=Chautauqua |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67vUpjznm?url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/rus/text_files/EastUropeProblems/1987-19-20/1987-19-20%20%28220-226%29.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.

In October 1987, Kulakov was invited to join the Governing Board of the Soviet Children's Fund, where he had the opportunity to collaborate with the Russian writer and chairman of the Fund, Albert Likhanov, in achieving the goals of the foundation.

On September 26, 1990, Kulakov, along with the head of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] [[Alexy II of Moscow|Patriarch Alexy II]], was invited to the session of the Supreme Soviet of the [[U.S.S.R.]] (highest legislative body). It was there that he was able to outline his views on the new draft of the law for freedom of religion. At the end of 1990, Kulakov had a third meeting with the President of the Soviet Union [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] regarding the religious freedom in the [[U.S.S.R.]]  Gorbachev at the time was seeking the support of religious leaders of the country.

Having personally lived through persecution for his religious beliefs, Kulakov was a constant voice in defense of religious freedom and actively participated in the international conferences on the protection of religious freedom. In 1990, he initiated the establishment of the Russian branch of the [[International Association for Religious Freedom]] [http://irla.org International Religious Liberty Association]. He was then elected Secretary General of the Russian branch of the association and acted as its representative to the Public Chamber of the Russian President from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religiouslibertydinner.com/awardees/mikhail_kulakov.php|title=Religious Liberty Dinner|work=religiouslibertydinner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the priest Alexander Borisov, Kulakov also took part in the establishment of the [[Russian Bible Society]] [http://www.biblia.ru/about/direction/kylakov].

One of Kulakov's favorite biblical passages was: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (II Epistle to Corinthians 3:17). Throughout his lifetime, he worked to create a dialogue between all groups of people and create an atmosphere of spiritual and intellectual freedom toward a common good. In a recent interview, Kulakov stated:

"Today I am greatly concerned about the underestimation of the importance of freedom of the individual. We have come through a very dark time when as if with the asphalt roller they tried to crush all individuality and to stifle the freedom of expression. It is impossible to forget that, and we should never forget it! These lessons should be remembered by those who care about the welfare of their native country, about their own children and the future generations. Each of us should think about the kind of foundations that we are laying today. So that the people of Russia could live a full life, filled with joy, with a sense of peace, and free from the fear that you will be silenced, oppressed and exterminated just because you desired to speak freely. This is crucial. This is what can save us as a nation and as a country from the horrors that we experienced in the twentieth century.

== Establishment of the Institute for Bible Translation ==

In 1992, Kulakov submitted his resignation as head of the Church in order to devote himself to translating the Bible into the modern Russian language.  Kulakov established the [http://bible.zau.ru Institute for Bible Translation] with the goal of completing a translation of the Russian Bible that is free from denominational bias. To achieve this goal, he invited a wide range of specialists from different denominations to work with him on the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://russianbible.ru/staff/]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, Kulakov combined this activity with his responsibility as the Secretary General of the Russian Branch of the [[International Association for Religious Freedom]] as well as teaching courses in homiletics at Zaoksky Theological Seminary. However, he had to give up other activities to complete the translation of the [[New Testament]]. In April 2000, the Institute completed work on the New Testament and published the first edition of the New Testament in Modern Russian Translation. All 12,500 copies in circulation sold out that year and by popular demand it has been republished.

That same year, at the [[General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church]] Session in [[Toronto]], Mikhail P. Kulakov presented the New Testament to the delegates at the World Seventh-day Adventist Congress, and it was decided that he should continue working on the translation of the remainder of the [[Bible]].  Kulakov moved to the United States with his wife in December 2000. Several years later a second edition of the New Testament and Psalms in the modern Russian translation, as well as the Five Books of Moses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://predanie.ru/lib/book/67502/ Five Books of Moses] {{ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the books of Daniel and the Minor Prophets &lt;ref&gt;[http://predanie.ru/lib/aut/67507/— fb2, mobi, epub] {{ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; were published. In August 2001,  [http://www.andrews.edu Andrews University] awarded Mikhail P. Kulakov a second honorary doctorate in theology for his contribution to the translation of the Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zau.ru/about/?ipb=a_hist Index of /about&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826215136/http://www.zau.ru/about/?ipb=a_hist |date=2007-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final years and death ==

Though Kulakov lived the remainder of his life in [[California]], he continued to visit Russia to conduct conferences and business meetings with the staff of his [http://bible.zau.ru Bible Translation Institute] at Zaoksky Theological Seminary. In autumn of 2009, Kulakov was diagnosed with brain cancer and underwent treatment at [[Loma Linda University Medical Center|Loma Linda University Hospital]].

He died on February 10, 2010 at his home in [[Highland]], California. On the day of his death, the new Russian translation of the [[Pentateuch]] to which he devoted the last five years of his life was printed at Zaoksky. In May 2010, at its annual session, the Board of Trustees of the Institute for Bible Translation at Zaoksky agreed to name the Institute after Kulakov.

Mikhail P. Kulakov was buried at  [http://www.glenwoodcemetery.net The Glenwood Cemetery] in Washington, DC.

'''Neoclassicism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] νέος ''nèos'', "new" and [[Latin]] ''classicus'', "of the highest rank")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=neo-classical| title=Etymology of the English word "neo-classical"| accessdate=2016-05-09| publisher=myetymology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to Western [[Cultural movement|movements]] in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that draw inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of [[classical antiquity]]. Neoclassicism was born largely thanks to the writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], at the time of the rediscovery of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their [[Grand Tour]] and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1189&amp;dq=neoclassicism+originated+in.Rome&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCl9eT0cLVAhVLDcAKHSy7B1cQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=neoclassicism%20originated%20in.Rome&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/volltexte/2010/978 The road from Rome to Paris. The birth of a modern Neoclassicism]&lt;/ref&gt; The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]], and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with [[Romanticism]]. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.

European Neoclassicism in the [[visual art]]s began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant [[Rococo]] style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century [[Renaissance|Renaissance Classicism]]. Each "neo"-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765–1830 paid homage to an ''idea'' of the generation of [[Phidias]], but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of [[Late Antiquity]]. The "Rococo" art of ancient [[Palmyra]] came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood's ''The Ruins of Palmyra''. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the [[Ottoman Empire]], dangerous to explore, so Neoclassicists' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, "corrected" and "restored" the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.

==History==
Neoclassicism is a revival of the many styles and spirit of classic antiquity inspired directly from the classical period,&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{cite book |title = Neoclassicism A&amp;I (Art and Ideas)| last=Irwin| first=David G.| publisher =  Phaidon Press|year = 1997 | pages = | isbn=978-0-7148-3369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided and reflected the developments in [[philosophy]] and other areas of the Age of  Enlightenment, and was initially a reaction against the excesses of the preceding [[Rococo]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 17-25; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt; While the movement is often described as the opposed counterpart of [[Romanticism]], this is a great over-simplification that tends not to be sustainable when specific artists or works are considered. The case of the supposed main champion of late Neoclassicism, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], demonstrates this especially well.&lt;ref&gt;A recurring theme in Clark: 19-23, 58-62, 69, 97-98 (on Ingres); Honour, 187-190; Novotny, 86-87&lt;/ref&gt; The revival can be traced to the establishment of formal archaeology.&lt;ref name=Lingo&gt;{{cite book |title = François Duquesnoy and the Greek ideal| last=Lingo| first=Estelle Cecile| publisher = Yale University Press; First Edition|year = 2007| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wlq67ikF0OEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Winckelmann+Neoclassicism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zGxFT-GiPMHWiAKY_dypDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Winckelmann%20Neoclassicism&amp;f=false 161]| isbn=978-0-300-12483-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Classical Savannah: fine &amp; decorative arts, 1800-1840| last=Talbott | first=Page| publisher = University of Georgia Press |year = 1995| pages = 6| isbn=978-0-8203-1793-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|left|250|Johann Joachim Winckelmann, often called "the father of archaeology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Culture and values: a survey of the humanities| last=Cunningham, Reich| first= Lawrence S., John J. | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing; 7 edition|year = 2009| pages = 104 | isbn=978-0-495-56877-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] were important in shaping this movement in both architecture and the visual arts. His books ''Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture'' (1750) and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' ("History of Ancient Art", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at "noble simplicity and calm grandeur",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 57-62, 61 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find "not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of [[Plato]] teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone". The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: "The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients".&lt;ref&gt;Both quotes from the first pages of "Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the [[Grand Tour]], a fad of collecting [[antiquities]] began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = In Pursuit of Ancient Pasts: A History of Classical Archaeology in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries| last= Dyson| first=Stephen L.| publisher = Yale University Press |year = 2006| pages = xii | isbn=978-0-300-11097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Neoclassicism" in each art implies a particular canon of a "classical" model.

In English, the term "Neoclassicism" is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in [[English literature]], which began considerably earlier, is called [[Augustan literature]]. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of [[classical music]], and "Neoclassicism" is used of [[Neoclassicism (music)|20th-century developments]]. However, the operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]], increasing the role of the chorus in line with [[Greek tragedy]], and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Anton Raphael Mengs]], ''[[Judgement of Paris]]'', c. 1757, bought by [[Catherine the Great]] from the studio]]

The term "Neoclassical" was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as "the true style", "reformed" and "revival"; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the [[Renaissance]], and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble [[Baroque]] of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France's dominant military and political position started a serious decline.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 11, 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique [[consular diptych]]s and their [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] revival, to the disapproval of critics.

Neoclassicism was strongest in [[architecture]], [[sculpture]] and the [[decorative arts]], where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann's writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and, like most contemporaries except for [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], was unimpressed by them, citing [[Pliny the Younger]]'s comments on the decline of painting in his period.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 44-46; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

As for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of [[Raphael]]'s generation, frescos in Nero's ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and through renewed admiration of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. Much "Neoclassical" painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally the winning side.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 43-62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting and printmaking==
[[File:(20) Flaxman Ilias 1795, Zeichnung 1793, 194 x 338 mm.jpg|thumb|Print of a drawing by [[John Flaxman]] of a scene in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', 1795]]

It is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as "insipid" and "almost entirely uninteresting to us"—some of [[Kenneth Clark]]'s comments on [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]' ambitious ''Parnassus'' at the [[Villa Albani]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 20 (quoted); Honour, 14; [[:File:Mengs Parnasus.jpg|image of the painting]] (in fairness, other works by Mengs are more successful)&lt;/ref&gt; by the artist who his friend Winckelmann described as "the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 31-32 (31 quoted)&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings, subsequently turned into [[old master print|prints]], of [[John Flaxman]] used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;) and figures mostly in profile to depict ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and other subjects, and once "fired the artistic youth of Europe" but are now "neglected",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 14&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[history painting]]s of [[Angelica Kauffman]], mainly a portraitist, are described as having "an unctuous softness and tediousness" by [[Fritz Novotny]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 62&lt;/ref&gt;  Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the [[Ancient Greek pottery|Greek vases]] used by Flaxman, [[Raphael]] tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended. 
[[File:David-Oath of the Horatii-1784.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques-Louis David]], ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1784]]

The work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements.  The German-Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann's prescription of "noble simplicity and calm grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 51-54&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Carstens' unrealized schemes, the [[etching]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the [[Grand Tour]] to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his ''Vedute'' (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' ("Imaginary Prisons") whose "oppressive cyclopean architecture" conveys "dreams of fear and frustration".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 45-58 (47-48 quoted); Honour, 50-57&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss-born [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich Füssli]] spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the "Gothic" strain of [[Romanticism]], and sought to evoke drama and excitement.

Neoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' at the [[Paris Salon|Paris Salon of 1785]]. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a [[frieze]], with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of [[opera]], and the classical colouring of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the [[French Revolution]] became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the [[Napoleon]]ic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the [[Bourbon Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 34-37; Clark, 21-26; Novotny, 19-22&lt;/ref&gt;

David's many students included [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into [[Orientalism]] and the [[Troubadour style]] that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of [[Impressionism]], but his style, once formed, changed little.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 39-47;Clark, 97-145; Honour, 187-190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Canova-Hebe 30 degree view.jpg|thumb|260px|''Hebe'' by [[Canova]] (1800–05), in the appropriately Neoclassical surroundings of the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
If Neoclassical painting suffered from a lack of ancient models, Neoclassical sculpture tended to suffer from an excess of them, although examples of actual Greek sculpture of the "classical period" beginning in about 500 BC were then very few; the most highly regarded works were mostly Roman copies.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378&lt;/ref&gt; The leading Neoclassical sculptors enjoyed huge reputations in their own day, but are now less regarded, with the exception of [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], whose work was mainly portraits, very often as busts, which do not sacrifice a strong impression of the sitter's personality to idealism. His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the great figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a [[George Washington (Houdon)|statue of George Washington]], as well as busts of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] and other luminaries of the new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378–379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinard, Gilbert, ed., Houdon in America'' Arno PressNy, 1979, a reprint of a book published by Johns Hopkins University, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Canova]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the ''Three Graces''.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 379-384&lt;/ref&gt; All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.

An early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 384-385&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Flaxman]] was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for several years. [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] and his son [[Rudolph Schadow|Rudolph]], one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists,&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 388-389&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Franz Anton von Zauner]] in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive "character heads" of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 390-392&lt;/ref&gt; Like Piranesi's ''Carceri'', these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of [[psychoanalysis]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor [[Mathieu Kessels]] studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.

Since prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads,&lt;ref&gt;Gerdts, William H., ''American Neo-Classic Sculpture: The Marble Resurrection'',  Viking Press, New York, 1973 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of  [[Horatio Greenough]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Randolph Rogers]] and [[William Henry Rinehart]].

==Architecture and the decorative arts==

Neoclassicism first gained influence in England and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s lover, [[Grigory Orlov|Count Orlov]], designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian ''[[stucco|stuccadori]]'': only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the [[bas-relief]] overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.

A second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of [[engraving]]s) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic Empire]]. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the "Louis XVI style", and the second in the styles called "Directoire" or [[Empire style|Empire]]. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}}

In the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in [[Biedermeier]] furniture made in Austria; in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s museums in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built "[[United States Capitol|capitol]]" in Washington, D.C.; and in [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]'s [[bas relief]]s and "black basaltes" [[vase]]s. The style was international; Scots architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]], in Russian St. Petersburg.

Indoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s,&lt;ref name="Gontar"&gt;Gontar&lt;/ref&gt; with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichità di Ercolano]]'' (''The Antiquities of Herculaneum''). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the [[Baroque]], or the most "Roman" rooms of [[William Kent]] were based on [[basilica]] and [[temple]] exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appeatrance to modern eyes: [[pediment]]ed window frames turned into [[gilding|gilded]] mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low [[frieze]]-like relief or painted in monotones ''[[Camaïeu|en camaïeu]]'' ("like cameos"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or ''[[bucrania]]'' or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of "Pompeiian red" or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ''[[Goût grec]]'' ("Greek style"), not a court style; when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] acceded to the throne in 1774, [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, brought the "Louis XVI" style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: "Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 110–111, 110 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Château de Malmaison - Appartement de Joséphine 003.jpg|thumb|[[Château de Malmaison]], 1800, room for the [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Joséphine]], on the cusp between [[Directoire style]] and [[Empire style]]]]

From about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the [[Greek Revival]]. At the same time the [[Empire style]] was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of [[Napoleon]] in the [[First French Empire]], where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Gontar"/&gt; the [[Regency style]] in Britain, and the ''Napoleon style'' in Sweden. According to the art historian [[Hugh Honour]] "so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 171–184, 171 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier phase of the style was called the [[Adam style]] in Great Britain and "Louis Seize", or Louis XVI, in France.

Neoclassicism continued to be a major force in [[academic art]] through the 19th century and beyond—a constant antithesis to [[Romanticism]] or [[Gothic revival]]s —, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.{{who|date=March 2013}} The centres of several European cities, notably [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.

Gothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, "romantic" appearance.

==Neoclassical gardens==
In England, Augustan literature had a direct parallel with the Augustan style of landscape design. The links are clearly seen in the work of [[Alexander Pope]]. The best surviving examples of Neoclassical English gardens are [[Chiswick House]], [[Stowe House]] and [[Stourhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Turner|title=British gardens: history, philosophy and design, Chapter 6 Neoclassical gardens and landscapes 1730-1800|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415518789|pages=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoclassicism and fashion==
[[File:Thérésa Cabarrus.JPG|thumb|Revolutionary socialite [[Thérésa Tallien]]]]
[[File:5th Duke of Bedford.png|thumb|[[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] in a [[Bedford Crop]]]]
In fashion, Neoclassicism influenced the much greater simplicity of women's dresses, and the long-lasting fashion for white, from well before the French Revolution, but it was not until after it that thorough-going attempts to imitate ancient styles became fashionable in France, at least for women. Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and [[masquerade ball]]s until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by [[Juliette Récamier]], [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], [[Thérésa Tallien]] and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] quipped that: "''Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!''" ("One could not be more sumptuously undressed"). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.

Very light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the [[Empire silhouette]] although it predates the [[First French Empire]] of Napoleon, but his first Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;  By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.

Neoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter's or, especially, the sculptor's studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or [[trousers|pantaloon]], over the ''cullottes'' or [[knee-breeches]] of the [[Ancien Régime]]. Even when David designed a new French "national costume" at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced cilivian male styles.

The trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary [[history painting]]s; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various strategems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In ''[[James Dawkins (antiquarian)|James Dawkins]] and [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]] Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758) by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in [[toga]]-like Arab robes.  In ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) by [[John Singleton Copley]], the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single [[breeches|breeched]] leg prominently.  However the Americans Copley and [[Benjamin West]] led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West's ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770) and Copley's ''[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781]]'' (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', completed in 1819.

Classically inspired male hair styles included the [[Bedford Crop]], arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] as a protest against a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on hair powder]]; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French "à la Titus" after [[Titus Junius Brutus]] (not in fact the Roman Emperor [[Titus]] as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both [[Napoleon]] and [[George IV of England]]. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor [[François-Joseph Talma]], who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' (about [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who orders the execution of his son Titus).  In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 243&lt;/ref&gt; and the style was also worn by women, the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that "more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''à la Titus''.&lt;ref&gt;Rifelj, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Classicism}}
In American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the [[American Renaissance]] movement, ''ca.'' 1890–1917; its last manifestation was in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and its very last, large public projects were the [[Lincoln Memorial]] (highly criticized at the time), the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' monumental city planning for [[New Delhi]] marks the glorious sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) mythical, heroic times.

Conservative [[modernist]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a [[colonnade]] would have been decried as "reactionary", a building's [[pilaster]]-like [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] panels under a repeating [[frieze]] looked "progressive". [[Pablo Picasso]] experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following [[World War I]], and the [[Art Deco]] style that came to the fore following the 1925 Paris ''Exposition des Arts Décoratifs'', often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky [[commode]]s by [[Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann|É.-J. Ruhlmann]] or [[Louis Süe|Süe]] &amp; [[André Mare|Mare]]; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of [[Isadora Duncan]]; the [[Streamline Moderne]] styling of U.S. post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the [[Dime (United States coin)|Roosevelt dime]].

There was an entire 20th-century movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see [[20th century classical music#Neoclassicism|20th-century classical music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]]. For information on the philosophical aspects, see [[Great Books]].)

This literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) [[Dada]], in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in [[English literature]] were laid by [[T. E. Hulme]], the most famous Neoclassicists were [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]]. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of [[Acmeism]], with [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Osip Mandelshtam]] as the leading representatives.

===In music===
[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]] is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the [[classical music | Classical]] and [[baroque music | Baroque]] musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction  in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of [[Impressionism in music | Impressionism]] in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed "classical" dancing and costume in [[ballet]] and [[physical education]]. 

The 17th-18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before [[World War I]] but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. [[Respighi, Ottorino | Respighi's]] ''Ancient Airs and Dances'' (1917) led the way for the sort of sound the Neoclassicists aspired to. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet for Wind Instruments]] (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. [[Neoclassical ballet]] as innovated by [[George Balanchine]]  de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.

=== Architecture in Russia and the Soviet Union ===
[[File:Ostdv5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ostankino Palace]], designed by [[Francesco Camporesi]] and completed in 1798, in Moscow, Russia]]
In 1905–1914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of [[Russian neoclassical revival|Neoclassical revival]]; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of [[Alexander I of Russia|alexandrine]] period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-[[Renaissance]], [[palladian architecture|palladian]] and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like [[Ivan Fomin]], [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]]. When economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily [[modernism (architecture)|modernist]] environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, [[Ilya Golosov]]) developed their own modernized styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft1g5004bj&amp;brand=eschol |title=The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arkhangelskoe Estate Aug2012 buildings 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Arkhangelskoye estate]].]]

With the crackdown on architects' independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the [[Palace of Soviets]], Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in [[Stalinist architecture]], although not the only one. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of [[Boris Iofan]], bordering with contemporary [[Art Deco]] (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.

Neoclassicism was an easy choice for the USSR since it did not rely on modern construction technologies ([[steel frame]] or [[reinforced concrete]]) and could be reproduced in traditional [[masonry]]. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material [[rationing]]. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including "exported" architecture of [[Palace of Culture and Science]], [[Warsaw]] and the [[Shanghai]] International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.

===Architecture in the 21st century===
{{Main|New Classical Architecture}}
[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]], 2006]]

After a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.

As of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of [[New Classical Architecture]]. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html Neo-classicist Architecture. Traditionalism. Historicism.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a number of pieces of [[postmodern architecture]] draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, [[Antigone District]] and the [[National Theatre of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]] among them. [[Postmodern architecture]] occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.

For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term [[Vernacular architecture|Traditional Architecture]] (or vernacular) is mostly used. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/ Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture at Notre Dame SoA] – ''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''; retained March 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in [[Nashville]] being an example.

In Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: [[Quinlan Terry]]'s Maitland Robinson Library at [[Downing College]] and Robert Adam Architects' [[Sackler Library]].

'''''One Two Three... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science''''' is a popular science book by theoretical physicist [[George Gamow]], first published in 1947, exploring some fundamental concepts in mathematics and science, but written at a level understandable by [[middle school]] students up through "intelligent layman" adults.&lt;ref name=Gamow&gt;''One, Two, Three...Infinity'' (1947, revised 1961), Viking Press (copyright renewed by Barbara Gamow, 1974), reprinted by Dover Publications, {{ISBN|978-0-486-25664-1}}, illustrated by the author; eBook edition, Dover, 2012 {{ISBN|9781306350099}}; other editions and translations&lt;/ref&gt; The book is illustrated by Gamow.

==Overview==
Beginning with an exploration of elementary numbers, the book opens with a description of the "Hottentots" ([[Khoikhoi]]), said to have words only for "one", "two", "three", and "many", and builds quickly to explore [[Georg Cantor]]'s theory of three levels of [[infinity]]—hence the title of the book.  It then describes a simple automatic printing press that can in principle (given enough paper, ink, and time) print all the English works that have ever been, or ever will be, printed (a more-systematic version of the [[infinite monkey theorem]]).  The author notes that if all the atoms in the Universe, as known in Gamow's time, were such printing presses working in parallel "at the speed of atomic vibrations" since the [[Big Bang|beginning of known time]], only an infinitesimal fraction of the job could have yet been completed.&lt;ref name="Gamow" /&gt;

Gamow explores [[number theory]], [[topology]], [[spacetime]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]], [[chemistry|atomic chemistry]], [[nuclear physics]], [[entropy]], [[genetics]], and [[cosmology]].

==Reception==
Science writer [[Willy Ley]] praised Gamow's book, describing it as an "admittedly rare ... book which entertains by way of instruction."&lt;ref&gt;Willy Ley, "Book Review," ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', June 1948, pp.158-61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kirkus Reviews]] declared it "a stimulating and provocative book for the science-minded layman".&lt;ref name=kirkus&gt;{{cite web|title=One Two Three...Infinity by George Gamow|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/george-gamow-2/one-two-threeinfinity/|publisher=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]] credited ''One Two Three... Infinity'' with setting the trajectory of his professional life.&lt;ref name=carroll&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|authorlink1=Sean M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">{{use dmy dates|date=May 2016}} The '''Organ Reform Movement''' or '''''Orgelbewegung''''' (also called the '''Organ Revival Movement)''' was a mid-20th-century trend in [[pipe organ]] building, originating in Germany. The movement was influential in the United States in the 1930s through 1970s, and began to wane in the 1980s. It arose with early interest in [[historical performance]] and was strongly influenced by [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s championing of historical instruments by [[Gottfried Silbermann]] and others, as well as by Schweitzer's declaration that the criterion for judging an organ is its fitness to perform with clarity the polyphonic [[Baroque]] music of [[J. S. Bach]] (1685–1750). Concert organist [[E. Power Biggs]] was a leading popularizer of the movement in the United States, through his many recordings and radio broadcasts. The movement ultimately went beyond the "Neo-Baroque" copying of old instruments to endorse a new philosophy of [[organ building]], "more Neo than Baroque".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZL4IAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PA56 |title=Deutsche und französische Orgelbaukunst und Orgelkunst |year=1906 |first=Albert |last=Schweitzer |publisher=Breitkopf &amp; Härtel |language=German |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phelps&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence I. |last=Phelps |title=A Short History of the Organ Revival |journal=Church Music |publisher=Concordia |url=http://LawrencePhelps.com/Documents/Articles/Phelps/ashorthistory.shtml |date=Spring 1967 |volume=67 |issue=1 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ambrosino&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan |last=Ambrosino |title=Present Imperfect |journal=The Tracker |publisher=Organ Historical Society |url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2384349/ambrosino/words-writings.html |date=Spring 1999 |volume=43 |issue=2 |accessdate=23 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065215/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2384349/ambrosino/words-writings.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosales.com/instruments/op11/ |title=Rosales Opus 11: The Trinity Cathedral Organ |first=Barbara |last=Owen |publisher=Trinity Episcopal Cathedral (Portland, Oregon) |date=1987 |accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement arose in opposition to the excesses of [[symphonic organ]] building, and eventually symphonic organs regained popularity after the reform movement brought excesses of its own.

The Organ Reform Movement sought to turn away from many of the perceived excesses of [[Aristide Cavaillé-Coll|Romantic]] or [[Symphonic organ]] building and repertoire, in favor of organs understood to be more similar to those of the Baroque Era in Northern Germany, especially those built by [[Arp Schnitger]]. This took the form of a "vertical" style of [[registration (organ)|tonal registration]] in which ensembles were ideally built up with no pitch being duplicated in the same octave, and then the ensembles were crowned with high-pitched [[Mixture (music)|mixture stops]]. The movement endorsed the so-called ''Werkprinzip'', in which each division of the instrument's pipework was based on a [[Flue pipe#Diapasons|principal]]-scale rank of a different octave.&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;

Organ voicers strove for an articulate pipe speech characterized by a short burst of "chiff" sound at the start of each note, and avoided "nicking" the pipe edges and other techniques of achieving symphonic-style "smoothness". Low wind pressures were revived. Casework was sometimes eschewed in favor of open standing pipework, and shuttered [[Expression pedal|swell boxes]] became less common.&lt;ref name=Ambrosino/&gt;

In Europe the movement was indelibly connected with [[tracker action]] (mechanical instruments). In North America this was not the case, and many US and Canadian instruments characteristic of the Organ Reform Movement had [[electro-pneumatic]] or [[direct electric action]].&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;

Some of the leading organ-builders of the movement were:&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;
* (in Northern Europe) [[Rudolf von Beckerath]], [[Dirk Andries Flentrop]], [[Frobenius Orgelbyggeri]], [[Marcussen &amp; Søn]];
* (in North America) [[G.

== Reversals ==
A common criticism of the Organ Reform Movement was that its principles were often taken to extremes that became more dogmatic than musical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Charles |last=Hendrickson |title=Nicking |journal=The American Organist |publisher=American Guild of Organists |url=http://www.enchamade.com/hendricksonorgan/wb/pages/articles/nicking.php |date=1976 |volume=10 |issue= |accessdate=9 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828024634/http://www.enchamade.com/hendricksonorgan/wb/pages/articles/nicking.php |archivedate=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ruining many fine symphonic organs and disappointing many listeners.&lt;ref name=Gerber/&gt; Some of the alterations that the movement executed on pre-movement instruments have since been reversed to support a wider range of repertoire, such as on the notable pipe organs of [[Auckland Town Hall#Organ|Auckland Town Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Restored Auckland Town Hall organ ready to sing|date=7 March 2010|journal=City Scene|publisher=[[Auckland City Council]]|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton University Chapel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mander-organs.com/princeton-university-chapel/|title=Princeton University Chapel|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Mander Organs|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chicago's [[Rockefeller Chapel]].&lt;ref name=Gerber&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Gerber |first=James |date=May 2012 |title=Ernest M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4735">'''Philippa Hobbs''' is a published South African art historian, an artist and an art collector. She was born in 1955 and matriculated at St Andrew's School in 1972. She studied art at the Johannesburg College of Art before finishing a post-graduate [[printmaking]] course at the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)]]. She then furthered her studies through [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA) and the [[Technikon Witwatersrand]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durbanet.co.za/exhib/dag/hr/cl08.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbs was a senior Professor of History of Art at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg from 1988 to 1993. She has been noted for her contribution to the practice of art (with national and international exhibitions), art education, research and most recently, community development through art. Hobbs currently works are MTN Art Collection Curator and Arts and Culture Portolio Senior Manager.

==Art==

Hobbs was invited to contribute to the Images of Human Rights project in 1996, which involved artists making visual representation of each clause of South Africa's Bill of Rights. Hobbs' designated clause was Clause 8: Freedom of Expression, where her woodcut - 'Received by the Tongue' - shows the precarious balance between rights of expression and the subsequent consequences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durbanet.co.za/exhib/dag/hr/cl08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works by Hobbs include '''Dracunculus and Cat's Cradle'' - a woodcut produced in 1993 and ''Spiritus Candelabrae'' - a two colour woodcut produced in 1992.

==Teaching==

Hobbs also took classes and workshops from her own printmaking studio, 'Foot Print Studio'. The studio started in order to offer visual training and printmaking guidance to beginners and advanced artists.

==Publications==

Hobbs co-published Printmaking in a Transforming South Africa with Elizabeth Rankin in 1997 (David Philip Publishers), which discusses how printmaking has “traversed the divisions of South African art”&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P., Rankin, E. 1997. Printmaking in a Transforming South Africa. Claremont: David Philip Publishers.{{ISBN|0-86486334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and describes the technical and expressive components of printmaking, while also exploring the role it played as a form of resistance during the liberation struggle.

In 2003 Hobbs and Rankin published Rorke’s Drift Empowering Prints,&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P., Rankin, E., 2003. Rorke’s Drift Empowering Prints. Cape Town: Double Story Books.{{ISBN|1-919930-13-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which looks at the Evangelical Lutheran Church Art and Craft Centre, more popularly known as [[Rorke's Drift Art and Craft Centre]], and the art produced by the black artists who studied there.

Hobbs’ most recent publication, Messages and Meaning, is a catalog for the MTN Art Collection for which she is curator. It is a collection of essays by writers such as Nessa Leibhammer, Elizabeth Rankin, Wilma Cruise and other prominent authors. It explores how the collection is “a tool for social investment, an educational resource, a means of inspiring in-house communication and debate, and a showcase of South African and African art to visitors.”&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P. (ed.) 2006. Messages and Meaning. Johannesburg: David Krut Publishing.{{ISBN|0-9584860-6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbs has also contributed to a well-known South African art publication, Taxi. Along with this involvement, she frequently writes the corresponding TAXI Art Education Supplement for school teachers and learners - allowing the information to be easily accessible. These supplements contain worksheets, information boxes about otherwise challenging art concepts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidkrutpublishing.com/taxi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19790">'''Psychoacoustics''' is the scientific study of [[sound]] [[perception]] and audiology – how humans perceive various sounds. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] responses associated with sound (including [[noise]], [[speech]] and [[music]]). It can be further categorized as a branch of [[psychophysics]]. Psychoacoustics received its name from a field within psychology—i.e., recognition science—which deals with all kinds of human perceptions. It is an interdisciplinary field of many areas, including psychology, acoustics, electronic engineering, physics, biology, physiology, and computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballou|first1=G|title=Handbook for Sound Engineers|date=2008|publisher=Burlington: Focal Press|page=43|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Hearing is not a purely mechanical phenomenon of [[wave propagation]], but is also a sensory and perceptual event; in other words, when a person hears something, that something arrives at the [[ear]] as a mechanical sound wave traveling through the air, but within the ear it is transformed into neural [[action potentials]]. The outer hair cells (OHC) of a mammalian [[cochlea]] give rise to an enhanced sensitivity and better{{clarify|date=May 2018}} frequency resolution of the mechanical response of the cochlear partition. These nerve pulses then travel to the brain where they are perceived. Hence, in many problems in acoustics, such as for [[Auditory system|audio processing]], it is advantageous to take into account not just the mechanics of the environment, but also the fact that both the ear and the brain are involved in a person’s listening experience.

The [[inner ear]], for example, does significant [[signal processing]] in converting sound [[waveform]]s into neural stimuli, so certain differences between waveforms may be imperceptible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Sense of Hearing | author = Christopher J. Plack | publisher = Routledge | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8058-4884-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DoGzm3soUoMC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=ear+hearing+cochlea++inauthor:plack }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Data compression]] techniques, such as [[MP3]], make use of this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Sound Blaster Live! Book |author1=Lars Ahlzen |author2=Clarence Song | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-886411-73-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tKO-truWww8C&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=mp3++imperceptible+ear }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ear has a nonlinear response to sounds of different intensity levels; this nonlinear response is called [[loudness]]. [[Telephone network]]s and audio [[noise reduction]] systems make use of this fact by nonlinearly compressing data samples before transmission, and then expanding them for playback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern dictionary of electronics | author = Rudolf F. Graf | publisher = Newnes | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-7506-9866-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o2I1JWPpdusC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=compression+expansion+noise-reduction+telephone }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Another effect of the ear's nonlinear response is that sounds that are close in frequency produce phantom beat notes, or [[intermodulation]] distortion products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of Clinical Audiology |author1=Jack Katz |author2=Robert F. Burkard |author3=Larry Medwetsky  |last-author-amp=yes | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-683-30765-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Aj6nVIegE6AC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=beat+distortion++ear }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "psychoacoustics" also arises in discussions about cognitive psychology and the effects that personal expectations, prejudices, and predispositions may have on listeners' relative evaluations and comparisons of sonic aesthetics and acuity and on listeners' varying determinations about the relative qualities of various musical instruments and performers. The expression that one "hears what one wants (or expects) to hear" may pertain in such discussions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Limits of perception ==
[[File:Perceived Human Hearing.svg|thumb|An [[equal-loudness contour]]. Note peak sensitivity around {{nowrap|2–4 kHz,}} in the middle of the [[Voice frequency|voice frequency band]].]]

The human ear can nominally hear sounds in the range {{nowrap|20 [[Hertz|Hz]]}} {{nowrap|(0.02 kHz)}} to {{nowrap|20,000 Hz}} {{nowrap|(20 kHz).}}  The upper limit tends to decrease with age; most adults are unable to hear above 16&amp;nbsp;kHz. The lowest frequency that has been identified as a musical tone is 12&amp;nbsp;Hz under ideal laboratory conditions.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book |title=Music, Physics and Engineering |last=Olson |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F. Olson |year= 1967|publisher=Dover Publications |pages=248–251 |isbn=978-0-486-21769-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tones between 4 and 16&amp;nbsp;Hz can be perceived via the body's [[sense of touch]].

Frequency resolution of the ear is 3.6&amp;nbsp;Hz within the octave of {{nowrap|1000 – 2000 Hz.}}  That is, changes in pitch larger than 3.6&amp;nbsp;Hz can be perceived in a clinical setting.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book |title=Music, Physics and Engineering |last=Olson |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F. Olson |year= 1967|publisher=Dover Publications |pages=248–251 |isbn=978-0-486-21769-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even smaller pitch differences can be perceived through other means. For example, the interference of two pitches can often be heard as a repetitive variation in volume of the tone. This amplitude modulation occurs with a frequency equal to the difference in frequencies of the two tones and is known as [[beat (acoustics)|beating]].

The [[semitone]] scale used in Western musical notation is not a linear frequency scale but [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]. Other scales have been derived directly from experiments on human hearing perception, such as the [[mel scale]] and [[Bark scale]] (these are used in studying perception, but not usually in musical composition), and these are approximately logarithmic in frequency at the high-frequency end, but nearly linear at the low-frequency end.

The intensity range of audible sounds is enormous. Human ear drums are sensitive to variations in the sound pressure, and can detect pressure changes from as small as a few [[micropascal]]s (µPa) to greater than {{nowrap|100 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]].}}  For this reason, [[sound pressure|sound pressure level]] is also measured logarithmically, with all pressures referenced to {{nowrap|20 [[Pascal (unit)|µPa]]}} (or 1.97385&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]). The lower limit of audibility is therefore defined as {{nowrap|0 [[decibel|dB]],}} but the upper limit is not as clearly defined. The upper limit is more a question of the limit where the ear will be physically harmed or with the potential to cause [[noise-induced hearing loss]].

A more rigorous exploration of the lower limits of audibility determines that the minimum threshold at which a sound can be heard is frequency dependent.  By measuring this minimum intensity for testing tones of various frequencies, a frequency dependent [[absolute threshold of hearing]] (ATH) curve may be derived.  Typically, the ear shows a peak of sensitivity (i.e., its lowest ATH) between {{nowrap|1–5 kHz,}} though the threshold changes with age, with older ears showing decreased sensitivity above 2&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=Fastl&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychoacoustics: Facts and Models |last=Fastl |first=Hugo | last2=Zwicker| first2=Eberhard |year= 2006 |publisher=Springer |pages=21–22 |isbn=978-3-540-23159-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATH is the lowest of the [[equal-loudness contour]]s. Equal-loudness contours indicate the sound pressure level (dB SPL), over the range of audible frequencies, that are perceived as being of equal loudness.  Equal-loudness contours were first measured by Fletcher and Munson at [[Bell Labs]] in 1933 using pure tones reproduced via headphones, and the data they collected are called [[Fletcher–Munson curves]].  Because subjective loudness was difficult to measure, the Fletcher–Munson curves were averaged over many subjects.

Robinson and Dadson refined the process in 1956 to obtain a new set of equal-loudness curves for a frontal sound source measured in an [[anechoic chamber]]. The Robinson-Dadson curves were standardized as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 226 in 1986. In 2003, {{nowrap|ISO 226}} was revised as [[equal-loudness contour]] using data collected from 12 international studies.

==Sound localization==
{{Main|Sound localization}}

[[Sound localization]] is the process of determining the location of a sound source. The brain utilizes subtle differences in loudness, tone and timing between the two ears to allow us to localize sound sources.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Daniel M. Understanding Audio: Getting the Most out of Your Project or Professional Recording Studio. Boston, MA: Berklee, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Localization can be described in terms of three-dimensional position: the [[azimuth]] or horizontal angle, the [[zenith]] or vertical angle, and the distance (for static sounds) or velocity (for moving sounds).&lt;ref name="Roads"&gt;Roads, Curtis. The Computer Music Tutorial. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans, as most [[tetrapoda|four-legged animals]], are adept at detecting direction in the horizontal, but less so in the vertical due to the ears being placed symmetrically. Some species of [[owls]] have their ears placed asymmetrically, and can detect sound in all three planes, an adaption to hunt small mammals in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, D.P. (2007): Owl ears and hearing. Owl Pages [Online]. Available: http://www.owlpages.com/articles.php?section=Owl+Physiology&amp;title=Hearing [2011, April 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Masking effects ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
{{Main|Auditory masking}}

[[File:Audio Mask Graph.png|thumb|Audio masking graph]]Suppose a listener cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound is being played (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker does not need to have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.

== Missing fundamental ==
{{Main|Missing fundamental}}

When presented with a [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] of frequencies in the relationship 2''f'', 3''f'', 4''f'', 5''f'', etc. (where ''f'' is a specific frequency), humans tend to perceive that the pitch is ''f''.

== Software ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] --&gt;
[[File:Acustic Block Diagram.svg|thumb|Perceptual audio coding uses psychoacoustics-based algorithms.]]

The psychoacoustic model provides for high quality [[lossy data compression|lossy signal compression]] by describing which parts of a given digital audio signal can be removed (or aggressively compressed) safely—that is, without significant losses in the (consciously) perceived quality of the sound.

It can explain how a sharp clap of the hands might seem painfully loud in a quiet library, but is hardly noticeable after a car backfires on a busy, urban street.  This provides great benefit to the overall compression ratio, and psychoacoustic analysis routinely leads to compressed music files that are 1/10th to 1/12th the size of high quality masters, but with discernibly less proportional quality loss. Such compression is a feature of nearly all modern lossy audio compression formats. Some of these formats include [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3), [[MP3]], [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]], [[Ogg Vorbis]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]], [[MPEG-1 Layer II]] (used for [[digital audio broadcasting]] in several countries) and [[ATRAC]], the compression used in [[MiniDisc]] and some [[Walkman]] models.

Psychoacoustics is based heavily on [[human anatomy]], especially the ear's limitations in perceiving sound as outlined previously.  To summarize, these limitations are:

*[[High frequency limit]]
*[[Absolute threshold of hearing]]
*[[Temporal masking]]
*[[Simultaneous masking]]

Given that the ear will not be at peak perceptive capacity when dealing with these limitations, a compression algorithm can assign a lower priority to sounds outside the range of human hearing.  By carefully shifting bits away from the unimportant components and toward the important ones, the algorithm ensures that the sounds a listener is most likely to perceive are of the highest quality.

== Music ==
Psychoacoustics includes topics and studies that are relevant to [[music psychology]] and [[music therapy]]. Theorists such as [[Benjamin Boretz]] consider some of the results of psychoacoustics to be meaningful only in a musical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterne|first=Jonathan|title=The Audible Past: Cultural Origins of Sound Reproduction|year=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irv Teibel]]'s ''[[Environments (album series)|Environments series]]'' LPs (1969–79) are an early example of commercially available sounds released expressly for enhancing psychological abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cummings|first1=Jim|title=Irv Teibel died this week: Creator of 1970s "Environments" LPs|url=http://earthear.com/blog/archives/198|website=Earth Ear|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applied psychoacoustics ==
[[File:Psychoacoustic Model.svg|thumb|Psychoacoustics Model]]

Psychoacoustics has long enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with [[computer science]], [[computer engineering]], and [[computer network]]ing. Internet pioneers [[J. C. R. Licklider]] and [[Robert Taylor (computer scientist)|Bob Taylor]] both completed graduate-level work in psychoacoustics, while [[BBN Technologies]] originally specialized in consulting on acoustics issues before it began building the first [[Packet-switching|packet-switched]] computer networks.

Licklider wrote a paper entitled "A duplex theory of pitch perception".&lt;ref name="Raychel Rappold"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cs.rit.edu/~rpretc/imm/project1/biography.html|first = Raychel |last=Rappold|title=Biography|publisher=Rochester University|accessdate=2015-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoacoustics is applied within many fields from software development, where developers map proven and experimental mathematical patterns; in digital signal processing, where many audio compression codecs such as [[MP3]] and [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] use a psychoacoustic model to increase compression ratios; in the design of (high end) audio systems for accurate reproduction of music in theatres and homes; as well as defense systems where scientists have experimented with limited success in creating new acoustic weapons, which emit frequencies that may impair, harm, or kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2002/March/Pages/Acoustic-Energy4112.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719122933/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2002/March/Pages/Acoustic-Energy4112.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also applied today within music, where musicians and artists continue to create new auditory experiences by masking unwanted frequencies of instruments, causing other frequencies to be enhanced. Yet another application is in the design of small or lower-quality loudspeakers, which can use the phenomenon of [[missing fundamental]]s to give the effect of bass notes at lower frequencies than the loudspeakers are physically able to produce (see references).

{{Fiqh|etiquette}}
'''''Raḍāʿ''''' or '''''riḍāʿa''''' ({{lang-ar|رضاع, رضاعة}} &amp;nbsp;{{IPA-ar|rɪˈdˤɑːʕ(æ)|pron}}, "breastfeeding") is a [[List of Islamic terms in Arabic|technical term]] from [[Sunni]] [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] meaning "the suckling which produces the legal impediment to marriage of foster-kinship".&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses: Medieval Islamic Views on Breastfeeding and Their Social Implications'', {{ISBN|90-04-11223-5}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  The term derives from the [[infinitive]] noun of the [[Arabic language|Arabic word]] ''radiʿa'' or ''radaʿa'' ("he sucked the breast of his mother").  Often it is translated as "[[fosterage]]" or "[[milk kinship]]".&lt;ref&gt;G. J. H. van Gelder, ''Close Relationships: Incest and Inbreeding in Classical Arabic Literature'', {{ISBN|1-85043-855-2}}, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''radāʿ'' derives from Islamic and [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] [[Islam and children#Breast-feeding|notions]] concerning the state of [[consanguinity]] created between [[wet nurse]] and unrelated nursling—that is, a woman and a baby other than her own—through the act of [[breastfeeding]].  ''Radāʿ'' also defines the links between various relations and family members of both wet nurse and baby, such that not only are the two [[Mahram|forbidden in marriage]] to one another, but so are their relations in various combination (e.g. the nursling's biological brother with the milk-mother's biological daughter).  Conversely, the milk-relationship allows usually forbidden familiarities between the two, particularly if the nursling is male and of adult stature, such as viewing the milk-mother [[Hijab|unveiled]] or [[Sex segregation in Islam|in private]], exactly as if he were a relation.{{Original research inline|date=April 2008}}

== In Islamic law ==
=== Sunni ===
''Radāʿ'' receives extensive treatment in the Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') of the classical jurists (''[[Faqīh|faqih]]'').  A primary feature of such works is the delineation of which relationships are [[Harām|subject to prohibition]] once the milk relationship is established.  The following are the sorts of questions directed to the founder of the [[Hanbali]] [[Madhhab|school of jurisprudence]] by his son:

{{cquote|
I asked [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|my father]] about a man who has two wives, each of whom has a daughter.  Then one of the wives nurses a certain man.  'Is it [[Halal|lawful]] for this man's son to marry the daughter of the wife who did not nurse him?'  (...) I asked my father about a man who has a wife who nurses both a youth and a girl, and the youth has a brother.  'Is it lawful for the brother to marry the girl?' (...)  I hear my father asked about a woman who nurses a young female slave belonging to someone else.   Then a certain man marries the woman who has nursed the young female slave.  'Is it lawful for the man to have intercourse with the [[Islamic views on slavery|female slave]] his wife has nursed if he buys and takes [[Ma malakat aymanukum|possession of her]]?'&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Other common topics included the following:

* ''laban al-fahl'', "milk of the sire", as under Islam the wet nurse's husband is considered the actual owner of her milk (it is his semen which caused the pregnancy that stimulated her lactation), which ties of consanguinity exist between his relations and the nursling?
* ''sifat al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', "quality of the milk", which ways of transmission create consanguinity?
* '' ʿadad al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', minimal number of sucklings necessary to establish fosterage;
* ''radāʿ al-kabīr'', suckling of a grown-up person, the maximum age at which the milk-relationship may be established;
* ''al-radāʿ min mayyita'', whether or not the absorption of milk from a dead woman creates the impediment.

''ʿAdad al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', or minimal number of sucklings necessary to establish the milk-kinship, was the subject of extensive debate and ever more elaborate [[Tafsīr|exegetical theorizing]].  For the adherents of older [[Madhhab|schools of law]], such as the [[Maliki]]s and [[Hanafi]]s, one suckling was enough.  Others, such as the [[Shafiʿi|Shāfi'ī]]s, maintained that the minimum number was five or ten, and that in fact a [[Qur'ān|Qur'ainic]] verse had once stipulated this exact number until [[Naskh (tafsir)#Modes|its wording]] had been [[Naskh (tafsir)|expurgated]] from the [[mushaf|Qur'ānic text]]&lt;ref&gt;John Burton, ''The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation'', {{ISBN|0-7486-0108-2}}, pp. 156-158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton, ''[[Naskh (tafsir)|Naskh]]'', [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]²&lt;/ref&gt;  The following tradition (''[[Hadīth|hadith]]'') treats both this topic as well as that of ''radāʿ al-kabīr'', or suckling of an adult:

{{cquote|
She [Aisha] [[Isnad|reported]] that 'in what was revealed of the Qur'ān, ten attested breast-feedings were mentioned as required to establish the marriage-ban.  The ten were replaced by mention of five attested breast-feeds.  The [[Muhammad|Prophet]] died and the five were still being recited in the Qur'ān.  No man ever called upon [[Aisha|'Ā'isha]] who had not completed the minimum number of five sucklings'...

[[Urwah ibn Zubayr|Urwa b. al-Zubayr]] reports that the Prophet commanded the wife of Abū Hudhayfa to feed her husband's [[mawla|mawlā]] [i.e. servant], Sālim, so that he could go on living with them [upon attaining manhood]. Sāalim b. 'Abdullāh reports that he was never able to visit 'Ā'isha.  She had sent him to be suckled by her sister [[Umm Kulthum (name)|Umm Kulthum]] who, however, suckled him only three times, then fell sick.  Sālim added, 'Thus I never did complete the course of ten sucklings.'&lt;ref&gt;John Burton, ''The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation'', pp. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

For most jurists ([[Ibn Hazm]] being one prominent exception), the bar to marriage was effective only if the nursling was an infant.  Yet even these allowed that a new relationship resulted between the two; [[Ibn Rushd]], for example, ruled that the woman could now comport herself more freely in front of the nursed adult male, such as appearing before him [[hijab|unveiled]].&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Muhaddith|traditionist]] [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] was forced to resign his position of ''[[mufti]]'' and leave the city of [[Bukhara]] after ruling that two nurslings who suckled from the same farm animal became milk-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shia ===
As per Quranic guidelines, non-mahram (not related) people are forbidden for each other as long as they are not legally married. Shi'ite Islam prohibits marriage to the consanguineous kin of a milk-parent. In Shi'ite societies, the wet nurse was always from a subordinate group, so that marriage to her kin would not have been likely.

== Examples ==
=== Egypt ===
In May 2007 Dr. Izzat Atiyya, lecturer at [[Cairo]]'s [[Al-Azhar University]], issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' that suggested that male and female colleagues could use breastfeeding to get around a religious ban on being alone together.  The ''fatwa'' said that if a woman fed a male colleague "directly from her breast" at least five times they would establish a family bond and thus be allowed to be alone together at work. "Breast feeding an adult puts an end to the problem of the private meeting, and does not ban marriage," he ruled. "A woman at work can take off the veil or reveal her hair in front of someone whom she breastfed."&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6681511.stm Breastfeeding fatwa causes stir]''. BBC. May 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''fatwa'' sparked outrage and embarrassment, with critics deriding the author on [[Egyptian television]]. The university suspended the lecturer, who headed the university's ''[[hadith]]'' department.  The ''fatwa'' was widely publicized by Arabic-language [[satellite television]] channels and was discussed in the [[Parliament of Egypt|Egyptian parliament]].&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;''[http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL2173061220070521 Lecturer suspended after breastfeeding fatwa]''. Reuters. May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  After being threatened with disciplinary action by the university, Atiyya issued a retraction, saying the ''fatwa'' was "a bad interpretation of a particular case" during the time of Muhammad&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; and that it was based on the opinions of only a minority of scholars.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;  Egypt's minister of religious affairs, [[Mahmoud Zaqzouq]], has called for future ''fatwas'' to "be compatible with logic and human nature".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

=== Saudi Arabia ===
In 2010, a clerical adviser to the Royal court and Ministry of Justice issued a [[fatwa]] suggesting that women should provide breast milk to their employed drivers thereby making them relatives (a concept known as ''Rada'').&lt;ref name=Shaheen&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shaheen|first=Abdul Rahman|title=Saudi women use fatwa in driving bid|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-women-use-fatwa-in-driving-bid-1.643431|accessdate=19 September 2010|newspaper=gulfnews.com|date=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver could then be trusted to be alone with the woman. The fatwa was ridiculed by women campaigners.

A '''recommender system''' or a '''recommendation system''' (sometimes replacing "system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of [[information filtering system]] that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference"  a user would give to an item.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1992403,00.html|title=Facebook, Pandora Lead Rise of Recommendation Engines - TIME|date=27 May 2010|work=TIME.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. There are also recommender systems for experts,&lt;ref name="expertseer"&gt;H. Chen, A. G. Ororbia II, C. L.

== Overview ==

Recommender systems typically produce a list of recommendations in one of two ways – through [[collaborative filtering]] or through [[content-based filtering]] (also known as the personality-based approach).&lt;ref&gt;Hosein Jafarkarimi; A.T.H. Sim and R. Saadatdoost [http://www.ijiet.org/show-31-222-1.html A Naïve Recommendation Model for Large Databases], International Journal of Information and Education Technology, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collaborative filtering]] approaches build a model from a user's past behaviour (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in.&lt;ref name="Recommender2010"&gt;Prem Melville and Vikas Sindhwani, [http://www.prem-melville.com/publications/recommender-systems-eml2010.pdf Recommender Systems], Encyclopedia of Machine Learning, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Content-based filtering]] approaches utilize a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.&lt;ref name="mooney99"&gt;
{{cite conference |author1=R. J. Mooney  |author2=L. Roy  |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 1999 |title = Content-based book recommendation using learning for text categorization |conference = In Workshop Recom. Sys.: Algo. and Evaluation }}
&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches are often combined (see [[Recommender system#Hybrid recommender systems|Hybrid Recommender Systems]]).

The differences between collaborative and content-based filtering can be demonstrated by comparing two popular music recommender systems – [[Last.fm]] and [[Pandora Radio]].
* Last.fm creates a "station" of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user's library, but are often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique.
* Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the [[Music Genome Project]]) to seed a "station" that plays music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station's results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user "dislikes" a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user "likes" a song. This is an example of a content-based approach.

Each type of system has its strengths and weaknesses. In the above example, Last.fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations. This is an example of the [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]] problem, and is common in collaborative filtering systems.&lt;ref name="rubens2016"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Pandora needs very little information to start, it is far more limited in scope (for example, it can only make recommendations that are similar to the original seed).

Recommender systems are a useful alternative to [[search algorithm]]s since they help users discover items they might not have found otherwise. Of note, recommender systems are often implemented using search engines indexing non-traditional data.

Recommender systems were first mentioned in a technical report as a "digital bookshelf" in 1990 by [[Jussi Karlgren]] at Columbia University,&lt;ref&gt;Karlgren, Jussi. 1990. "An Algebra for Recommendations." Syslab Working Paper 179 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented at scale and worked through in technical reports and publications from 1994 onwards by Jussi Karlgren, then at SICS,&lt;ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

=== Collaborative filtering ===
{{Main article|Collaborative filtering}}

One approach to the design of recommender systems that has  wide use is [[collaborative filtering]].&lt;ref name="Breese98"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=John S. Breese |author2=David Heckerman |author3=Carl Kadie  |last-author-amp=yes |year = 1998 |title = Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering |conference =  In Proceedings of the Fourteenth conference on Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI'98) }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative filtering methods are based on collecting and analyzing a large amount of information on users’ behaviors, activities or preferences and predicting what users will like based on their similarity to other users. A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an "understanding" of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|k-nearest neighbor]] (k-NN) approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Sarwar |first = B. |last2 = Karypis |first2 = G. |last3 = Konstan |first3 = J. |last4 = Riedl |first4 = J. |year = 2000 |url = http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/node/122 |title = Application of Dimensionality Reduction in Recommender System A Case Study |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }},&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pearson correlation|Pearson Correlation]] as first implemented by Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Allen | first = R.B. | date=1990 | title=User Models: Theory, Method, Practice| publisher = International J. Man-Machine Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past.

When building a model from a user's behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and [[implicit data collection|implicit]] forms of [[data collection]].

Examples of explicit data collection include the following:
* Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.
* Asking a user to search.
* Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.
* Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.
* Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes.

Examples of [[implicit data collection]] include the following:
* Observing the items that a user views in an online store.
* Analyzing item/user viewing times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Parsons |first = J. |last2 = Ralph |first2 = P. |last3 = Gallagher |first3 = K. |date = July 2004 |title = Using viewing time to infer user preference in recommender systems |publisher = AAAI Workshop in Semantic Web Personalization, San Jose, California |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.
* Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.
* Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.

The recommender system compares the collected data to similar and dissimilar data collected from others and calculates a list of recommended items for the user. Several commercial and non-commercial examples are listed in the article on [[collaborative filtering|collaborative filtering systems]].

One of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by [[Amazon.com]]'s recommender system.&lt;ref name="patft.uspto.gov"&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=6,266,649.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6,266,649&amp;RS=PN/6,266,649 Collaborative Recommendations Using Item-to-Item Similarity Mappings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316185024/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=6%2C266%2C649.PN.&amp;OS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649&amp;RS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649 |date=2015-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include:
* As previously detailed, [[Last.fm]] recommends music based on a comparison of the listening habits of similar users, while [[Readgeek]] compares books ratings for recommendations.
* [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[LinkedIn]], and other social networks use collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections (by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends).&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;Francesco Ricci and Lior Rokach and Bracha Shapira, [http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/papers/intro-rec-sys-handbook.pdf Introduction to Recommender Systems Handbook], Recommender Systems Handbook, Springer, 2011, pp. 1-35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]] uses many signals and in-memory computations for recommending to its users whom they should "follow."&lt;ref name="twitterwtf" /&gt;
Collaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems: [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]], scalability, and sparsity.&lt;ref name="Lee2007"&gt;Sanghack Lee and Jihoon Yang and Sung-Yong Park, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u4qzlZAEjegC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=sparsity+problem+content-based&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZEI50fmXTh&amp;sig=jcwEba0LykRiLnYVbLYUwdrHYEo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-W7CTvboCIeHsgKf9NHDBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sparsity%20problem%20content-based&amp;f=false Discovery of Hidden Similarity on Collaborative Filtering to Overcome Sparsity Problem], Discovery Science, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cold start: These systems often require a large amount of existing data on a user in order to make accurate recommendations.&lt;ref name="rubens2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elahi2016"/&gt;
* Scalability: In many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations, there are millions of users and products. Thus, a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations.
* Sparsity: The number of items sold on major e-commerce sites is extremely large. The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.

A particular type of collaborative filtering algorithm uses [[matrix factorization (recommender systems)|matrix factorization]], a [[low rank approximation|low-rank matrix approximation]] technique.&lt;ref&gt;I.

Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model based collaborative filtering. A well-known example of memory-based approaches is user-based algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author1=Breese, John S.|author2=Heckerman, David|author3=Kadie, Carl|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69656/tr-98-12.pdf|title=Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering|year=1998|publisher=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of model-based approaches is Kernel-Mapping Recommender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025512002587|title=Kernel-Mapping Recommender system algorithms|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2012.04.012|volume=208|journal=Information Sciences|pages=81–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Content-based filtering ===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}

Another common approach when designing recommender systems is '''content-based filtering'''. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user’s preferences.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal16Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=Charu C.|title=Recommender Systems: The Textbook|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319296579}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Peter Brusilovsky]]|title=The Adaptive Web|year=2007|isbn=978-3-540-72078-2|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a content-based recommender system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in [[information retrieval]] and [[information filtering]] research.

To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied. A widely used algorithm is the 
[[tf–idf]] representation (also called vector space representation).

To create a user profile, the system mostly focuses on two types of information:

1. A model of the user's preference.

2. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system.

Basically, these methods use an item profile (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system. The system creates a content-based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features. The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques. Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian Classifiers]], [[cluster analysis]], [[decision trees]], and [[artificial neural networks]] in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Online Recommender Systems – How Does a Website Know What I Want?|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2015/05/25/online-recommender-systems-website-want/|last=Blanda, Stephanie|work=American Mathematical Society|date=May 25, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct feedback from a user, usually in the form of a [[like button|like or dislike button]], can be used to assign higher or lower weights on the importance of certain attributes (using [[Rocchio algorithm|Rocchio classification]] or other similar techniques).

A key issue with content-based filtering is whether the system is able to learn user preferences from users' actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended. For example, recommending news articles based on browsing of news is useful, but would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions etc. from different services can be recommended based on news browsing.

Pandora Radio is an example of a content-based recommender system that plays music with similar characteristics to that of a song provided by the user as an initial seed. There are also a large number of content-based recommender systems aimed at providing movie recommendations, a few such examples include [[Rotten Tomatoes]], [[Internet Movie Database]], [[Jinni (search engine)|Jinni]], [[Rovi Corporation]], and [[Jaman]]. Document related recommender systems aim at providing document recommendations to knowledge workers. Public health professionals have been studying recommender systems to personalize health education and preventative strategies.&lt;ref name="pmid27318270"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Macedo AA, Pollettini JT, Baranauskas JA, Chaves JC| title=A Health Surveillance Software Framework to deliver information on preventive healthcare strategies. | journal=J Biomed Inform | year= 2016 | volume= 62 | issue=  | pages= 159–70 | pmid=27318270 | doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2016.06.002 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=27318270  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19745443"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Fernandez-Luque L, Karlsen R, Vognild LK| title=Challenges and opportunities of using recommender systems for personalized health education. | journal=Stud Health Technol Inform | year= 2009 | volume= 150 | issue=  | pages= 903–7 | pmid=19745443 | doi= | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19745443  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrid recommender systems ===

Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining [[collaborative filtering]] and content-based filtering could be more effective in some cases. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or by unifying the approaches into one model (see&lt;ref name="Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems" /&gt; for a complete review of recommender systems). Several studies empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrate that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate
recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem.

[[Netflix]] is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomez-Uribe|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Hunt|first2=Neil|title=The Netflix Recommender System|journal=ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems|date=28 December 2015|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1–19|doi=10.1145/2843948}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).

A variety of techniques have been proposed as the basis for recommender systems: collaborative, content-based, knowledge-based, and demographic techniques. Each of these techniques has known shortcomings, such as the well known [[Cold start (computing)|cold-start]] problem for collaborative and content-based systems (what to do with new users with few ratings) and the knowledge engineering bottleneck&lt;ref&gt;Rinke Hoekstra, [http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj32.pdf The Knowledge Reengineering Bottleneck], Semantic Web – Interoperability, Usability, Applicability 1 (2010) 1, IOS Press&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] approaches. A hybrid recommender system is one that combines multiple techniques together to achieve some synergy between them.

*[[Collaborative filtering|Collaborative]]: The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. Collaborative systems locate peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item and generate recommendations using this neighborhood. The user-based and the item based nearest neighbor algorithms can be combined to deal with the cold start problem and improve recommendation results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Recommender Systems:An Introduction |author1 = Dietmar Jannach |author2 = Markus Zanker |author3 = Alexander Felfernig |author4 = Gerhard Friedrich |year = 2010 |url = http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521493369 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150831032309/http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521493369 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2015-08-31 |publisher = CUP |isbn = 978-0-521-49336-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Content-based: The system generates recommendations from two sources: the features associated with products and the ratings that a user has given them. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on product features.
*Demographic: A demographic recommender provides recommendations based on a demographic profile of the user. Recommended products can be produced for different demographic niches, by combining the ratings of users in those niches.
*[[Knowledge base|Knowledge-based]]: A [[knowledge-based recommender system|knowledge-based recommender]] suggests products based on inferences about a user’s needs and preferences. This knowledge will sometimes contain explicit functional knowledge about how certain product features meet user needs.&lt;ref name=hybrids&gt;Robin Burke, [http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf Hybrid Web Recommender Systems], pp. 377-408, The Adaptive Web, Peter Brusilovsky, Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Nejdl (Ed.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 4321, May 2007, 978-3-540-72078-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="constraintbased"&gt;Alexander Felfernig and Robin Burke. [http://www.ist.tugraz.at/felfernig/images/constraint_based_recommendation.pdf Constraint-based Recommender Systems: Technologies and Research Issues], Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Electronic Commerce (ICEC'08), Innsbruck, Austria, Aug. 19-22, pp. 17-26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term hybrid recommender system is used here to describe any recommender system that combines multiple recommendation techniques together to produce its output. There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized, for example, two different content-based recommenders could work together, and a number of projects have investigated this type of hybrid: NewsDude,
which uses both naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbors classifiers in its news recommendations is just one example.&lt;ref name=hybrids /&gt;

Seven hybridization techniques:
*Weighted: The score of different recommendation components are combined numerically.
*Switching: The system chooses among recommendation components and applies the selected one.
*Mixed: Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.
*Feature Combination: Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.
*Feature Augmentation: One recommendation technique is used to compute a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique.
*Cascade: Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.
*Meta-level: One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.&lt;ref name=hybrids /&gt;

== Beyond accuracy ==
Typically, research on recommender systems is concerned about finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms. However, there are a number of factors that are also important.

*'''Diversity''' – Users tend to be more satisfied with recommendations when there is a higher intra-list diversity, e.g. items from different artists.&lt;ref name="Ziegler2005"&gt;{{cite book| author=Ziegler, C.N., McNee, S.M., Konstan, J.A. and Lausen, G.| chapter=Improving recommendation lists through topic diversification| title=Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web| year=2005| pages=22–32|  accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Recommender persistence''' – In some situations, it is more effective to re-show recommendations,&lt;ref name="Beel2013e"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joeran Beel |author2=Stefan Langer |author3=Marcel Genzmehr |author4=Andreas Nürnberger | chapter=Persistence in Recommender Systems: Giving the Same Recommendations to the Same Users Multiple Times| title=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2013)|date=September 2013| volume=8092| pages=390–394| publisher=Springer|editor1=Trond Aalberg |editor2=Milena Dobreva |editor3=Christos Papatheodorou |editor4=Giannis Tsakonas |editor5=Charles Farrugia | series=Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS)| url=http://docear.org/papers/persistence_in_recommender_systems_--_giving_the_same_recommendations_to_the_same_users_multiple_times.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or let users re-rate items,&lt;ref name="Cosley2003"&gt;{{cite book| author=Cosley, D., Lam, S.K., Albert, I., Konstan, J.A., Riedl, {J}.| chapter=Is seeing believing?: how recommender system interfaces affect users' opinions| title=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems| year=2003| pages=585–592| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; than showing new items. There are several reasons for this. Users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time, for instance, because they had no time to inspect the recommendations carefully.
*'''Privacy''' – Recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns&lt;ref name="Pu2012"&gt;{{cite journal| author={P}u, {P}., {C}hen, {L}., {H}u, {R}.| title=Evaluating recommender systems from the user's perspective: survey of the state of the art| journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction| year=2012| pages=1–39| publisher=Springer| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; because users have to reveal sensitive information. Building user profiles using collaborative filtering can be problematic from a privacy point of view. Many European countries have a strong culture of [[information privacy|data privacy]], and every attempt to introduce any level of user [[Profiling (information science)|profiling]] can result in a negative customer response. A number of privacy issues arose around the dataset offered by Netflix for the [[Netflix Prize]] competition. Although the data sets were anonymized in order to preserve customer privacy, in 2007 two researchers from the University of Texas were able to identify individual users by matching the data sets with film ratings on the Internet Movie Database.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72963 Rise of the Netflix Hackers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124011808/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72963 |date=January 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in December 2009, an anonymous Netflix user sued Netflix in Doe v. Netflix, alleging that Netflix had violated United States fair trade laws and the Video Privacy Protection Act by releasing the datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/netflix-privacy-lawsuit/|title=Netflix Spilled Your Brokeback Mountain Secret, Lawsuit Claims|date=17 December 2009|work=WIRED|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led in part to the cancellation of a second Netflix Prize competition in 2010.&lt;ref name="nfcancel"/&gt; Much research has been conducted on ongoing privacy issues in this space. Ramakrishnan et al. have conducted an extensive overview of the trade-offs between personalization and privacy and found that the combination of weak ties (an unexpected connection that provides serendipitous recommendations) and other data sources can be used to uncover identities of users in an anonymized dataset.&lt;ref name="privacyoverview"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Naren Ramakrishnan |author2=Benjamin J.

&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''User demographics''' – Beel et al. found that user demographics may influence how satisfied users are with recommendations.&lt;ref name="Beel2013f"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joeran Beel |author2=Stefan Langer |author3=Andreas Nürnberger |author4=Marcel Genzmehr | chapter=The Impact of Demographics (Age and Gender) and Other User Characteristics on Evaluating Recommender Systems| title=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2013)|date=September 2013| pages=400–404| publisher=Springer|editor1=Trond Aalberg |editor2=Milena Dobreva |editor3=Christos Papatheodorou |editor4=Giannis Tsakonas |editor5=Charles Farrugia | url=http://docear.org/papers/the_impact_of_users'_demographics_(age_and_gender)_and_other_characteristics_on_evaluating_recommender_systems.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their paper they show that elderly users tend to be more interested in recommendations than younger users.
*'''Robustness''' – When users can participate in the recommender system, the issue of fraud must be addressed.&lt;ref name="Konstan2012"&gt;{{cite journal| author={K}onstan, {J}.{A}., {R}iedl, {J}.| title=Recommender systems: from algorithms to user experience| journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction| year=2012| pages=1–23| publisher=Springer| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Serendipity''' – [[Serendipity]] is a measure of "how surprising the recommendations are".&lt;ref name="Ricci2011"&gt;{{cite journal| author={R}icci, {F}., {R}okach, {L}., {S}hapira, {B}., {K}antor {B}. {P}.| title=Recommender systems handbook| journal=Recommender Systems Handbook| year=2011| pages=1–35| publisher=Springer| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate, but it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy. However, high scores of serendipity may have a negative impact on accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonçalves|first=Diogo|last2=Costa|first2=Miguel|last3=Couto|first3=Francisco M.|date=2016-09-15|title=A Flexible Recommendation System for Cable TV|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307907905_A_Flexible_Recommendation_System_for_Cable_TV|journal=3rd Workshop on Recommendation Systems for Television and online Video (RecSysTV), At Boston, MA, USA|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Labelling''' – User satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labeling of the recommendations.&lt;ref name="Beel2013a"&gt;{{cite book| author=Beel, Joeran, Langer, Stefan, Genzmehr, Marcel| chapter=Sponsored vs. Organic (Research Paper) Recommendations and the Impact of Labeling| title=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2013)|date=September 2013| pages=395–399| url=http://docear.org/papers/sponsored_vs._organic_(research_paper)_recommendations_and_the_impact_of_labeling.pdf|editor1=Trond Aalberg |editor2=Milena Dobreva |editor3=Christos Papatheodorou |editor4=Giannis Tsakonas |editor5=Charles Farrugia | accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the cited study [[click-through rate]] (CTR) for recommendations labeled as "Sponsored" were lower (CTR=5.93%) than CTR for identical recommendations labeled as "Organic" (CTR=8.86%). Recommendations with no label performed best (CTR=9.87%) in that study.

== Mobile recommender systems ==
{{see|Location based recommendation}}
One growing area of research in the area of recommender systems is mobile recommender systems. With the increasing ubiquity of internet-accessing [[smart phones]], it is now possible to offer personalized, context-sensitive recommendations. This is a particularly difficult area of research as mobile data is more complex than data that recommender systems often have to deal with (it is heterogeneous, noisy, requires spatial and temporal auto-correlation, and has validation and generality problems&lt;ref name="taxirecommender"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Yong Ge |author2=Hui Xiong |author3=Alexander Tuzhilin |author4=Keli Xiao |author5=Marco Gruteser |author6=Michael J. Pazzani |year = 2010 |title = An Energy-Efficient Mobile Recommender System |conference = Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD Int'l Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining |url = http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~gruteser/papers/KDD10.pdf |publisher = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] |location = [[New York City|New York City, New York]] |pages = 899–908 |accessdate = 2011-11-17 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;). Additionally, mobile recommender systems suffer from a transplantation problem – recommendations may not apply in all regions (for instance, it would be unwise to recommend a recipe in an area where all of the ingredients may not be available).

One example of a mobile recommender system is one that offers potentially profitable driving routes for taxi drivers in a city.&lt;ref name="taxirecommender"/&gt; This system takes input data in the form of GPS traces of the routes that taxi drivers took while working, which include location (latitude and longitude), time stamps, and operational status (with or without passengers). It uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route, with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits. This type of system is obviously location-dependent, and since it must operate on a handheld or embedded device, the computation and energy requirements must remain low.

Another example of mobile recommendation is what (Bouneffouf et al., 2012) developed for professional users. Using GPS traces of the user and his agenda, it suggests suitable information depending on his situation and interests. The system uses machine learning
techniques and reasoning processes in order to dynamically adapt the mobile recommender system to the evolution of the user’s interest. The author called his algorithm hybrid-ε-greedy.&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2012"&gt;{{citation|last=Bouneffouf |first=Djallel |contribution=Following the User's Interests in Mobile Context-Aware Recommender Systems: The Hybrid-e-greedy Algorithm |pages=657–662 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |title=Proceedings of the 2012 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops |year=2012 |url=http://www-inf.int-evry.fr/~bounef_d/index_fichiers/Hybrid-e-greedy%20for%20Mobile%20Context-aware%20Recommender%20System.pdf |isbn=978-0-7695-4652-0 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile recommendation systems have also been successfully built using the "Web of Data" as a source for structured information. A good example of such system is SMARTMUSEUM&lt;ref name="Ruotsalo2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tuukka Ruotsalo |author2=Krister Haav |author3=Antony Stoyanov |author4=Sylvain Roche |author5=Elena Fani |author6=Romina Deliai |author7=Eetu Mäkelä |author8=Tomi Kauppinen |author9=Eero Hyvönen | title = SMARTMUSEUM: A Mobile Recommender System for the Web of Data | pages = 657–662 | publisher = Elsevier| year = 2013 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826813000061 | doi = 10.1016/j.websem.2013.03.001 | volume=20 | journal=Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses semantic modelling, information retrieval, and machine learning
techniques in order to recommend content matching user interests, even when presented with sparse or minimal user data.

There are three factors that could affect the mobile recommender systems and the accuracy of prediction results: the context, the recommendation method and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pimenidis |first1=Elias |last2=Polatidis |first2=Nikolaos |last3=Mouratidis |first3=Haralambos |title=Mobile recommender systems: Identifying the major concepts |journal=Journal of Information Science |date=3 August 2018 |pages=016555151879221 |doi=10.1177/0165551518792213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk-aware recommender systems ==
The majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information and do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user in specific situation. However, in many applications, such as recommending personalized content, it is also important to consider the risk of upsetting the user so as not to push recommendations in certain circumstances, for instance, during a professional meeting, early morning, or late at night. Therefore, the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process.

===Risk definition===
"The risk in recommender systems is the possibility to disturb or to upset the user
which leads to a bad answer of the user".&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2013"&gt;{{citation | type=Ph.D.
 | last = Bouneffouf  | first = Djallel | title= DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System
 | publisher = Institut National des Télécommunications | year = 2013 | url = http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01026136/fr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these challenges, the authors in ''DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System''&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2013"/&gt; have developed a dynamic risk sensitive recommendation system called DRARS (Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System), which models the context-aware recommendation as a [[Multi-armed bandit|bandit problem]]. This system combines a content-based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm. They have shown that DRARS improves the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policy, the currently available best algorithm, by calculating the most optimal exploration value to maintain a trade-off between exploration and exploitation based on the risk level of the current user's situation. The authors conducted experiments in an industrial context with real data and real users and have shown that taking into account the risk level of users' situations significantly increased the performance of the recommender systems.

== The Netflix Prize ==
{{Main article|Netflix Prize}}

One of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the [[Netflix Prize]]. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10% more accurate than those offered by the company's existing recommender system. This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms. On 21 September 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team using tiebreaking rules.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|title=A $1 Million Research Bargain for Netflix, and Maybe a Model for Others|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/22/technology/internet/22netflix.html|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most accurate algorithm in 2007 used an ensemble method of 107 different algorithmic approaches, blended into a single prediction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/ProgressPrize2007_KorBell.pdf |author1=R. Bell |author2=Y. Koren |author3=C. Volinsky |title = The BellKor solution to the Netflix Prize |year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Predictive accuracy is substantially improved when blending multiple predictors. ''Our experience is that most efforts should be concentrated in deriving substantially different approaches, rather than refining a single technique.''  Consequently, our solution is an ensemble of many methods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many benefits accrued to the web due to the Netflix project. Some teams have taken their technology and applied it to other markets. Some members from the team that finished second place founded [[Gravity R&amp;D]], a recommendation engine that's active in the RecSys community.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bodoky|first1=Thomas|title=Mátrixfaktorizáció one million dollars|url=http://index.hu/tech/net/2009/08/07/matrixfaktorizacio_egymillio_dollarert/|website=Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4-Tell, Inc. created a Netflix project–derived solution for ecommerce websites.

A second contest was planned, but was ultimately canceled in response to an ongoing lawsuit and concerns from the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref name="nfcancel"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/this-is-neil-hunt-chief-product-officer.html | title = Netflix Prize Update | date = 2010-03-12 | publisher = Netflix Prize Forum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance measures ==
Evaluation is important in assessing the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms. The commonly used metrics are the [[mean squared error]] and [[root mean squared error]], the latter having been used in the Netflix Prize. The information retrieval metrics such as [[precision and recall]] or [[Discounted Cumulative Gain|DCG]] are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method. Recently, diversity, novelty, and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Lathia, N., Hailes, S., Capra, L., Amatriain, X.: Temporal diversity in recommender systems. In: Proceedings of the 33rd International ACMSIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2010, pp. 210–217. ACM, New York&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized.&lt;ref name="Turpin2001"&gt;{{cite book| author=Turpin, Andrew H, Hersh, William| chapter=Why batch and user evaluations do not give the same results| title=Proceedings of the 24th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval| year=2001| pages=225–231|  accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, results of so-called offline evaluations do not correlate with actually assessed user-satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beel|first=Joeran|last2=Genzmehr|first2=Marcel|last3=Langer|first3=Stefan|last4=Nürnberger|first4=Andreas|last5=Gipp|first5=Bela|date=2013-01-01|title=A Comparative Analysis of Offline and Online Evaluations and Discussion of Research Paper Recommender System Evaluation|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2532508.2532511|journal=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation|series=RepSys '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=7–14|doi=10.1145/2532508.2532511|isbn=9781450324656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conclude "we would suggest treating results of offline evaluations [i.e. classic performance measures] with skepticism".

== Multi-criteria recommender systems ==
Multi-criteria recommender systems (MCRS) can be defined as recommender systems that incorporate preference information upon multiple criteria. Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion values, the overall preference of user u for the item i, these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value. Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Lakiotaki |first = K. |last2 = Matsatsinis |last3 = Tsoukias |first3 = A |url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5751215&amp;tag=1 |title = Multicriteria User Modeling in Recommender Systems |journal = IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume = 26 |issue = 2 |pages = 64–76 |doi=10.1109/mis.2011.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; See this chapter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |title=Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems |authors=Gediminas Adomavicius, Nikos Manouselis, YoungOk Kwon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630021251/http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for an extended introduction.

== Opinion-based recommender systems ==
In some cases, users are allowed to leave text review or feedback on the items. These user-generated text are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resource of both feature/aspects of the item, and the user’s evaluation/sentiment to the item. Features extracted from the user-generated reviews are improved [[Metadata|meta-data]] of items, because as they also reflect aspects of the item like [[Metadata|meta-data]], extracted features are widely concerned by the users. Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as user’s rating scores on the corresponding features. Popular approaches of opinion-based recommender system utilize various techniques including [[text mining]], [[information retrieval]] and [[sentiment analysis]] (see also [[Multimodal sentiment analysis]]).

== Recommender system evaluation ==
To measure the [[effectiveness]] of recommender systems, and compare different approaches, three types of [[evaluation]]s are available: user studies, [[A/B testing|online evaluations (A/B tests)]], and offline evaluations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; User studies are rather small scale. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users judge, which recommendations are best. In A/B tests, recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as [[conversion rate]] or [[click-through rate]]. Offline evaluations are based on historic data, e.g. a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/|title=MovieLens dataset|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users' ratings in the dataset. While a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie, such information is not available in all domains. For instance, in the domain of citation recommender systems, users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article. In such cases, offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness. For instance, it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article's reference list. However, this kind of offline evaluations is seen critical by many researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_3|title=User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization|last=Jannach|first=Dietmar|last2=Lerche|first2=Lukas|last3=Gedikli|first3=Fatih|last4=Bonnin|first4=Geoffray|date=2013-06-10|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642388439|editor-last=Carberry|editor-first=Sandra|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=25–37|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_3|editor-last2=Weibelzahl|editor-first2=Stephan|editor-last3=Micarelli|editor-first3=Alessandro|editor-last4=Semeraro|editor-first4=Giovanni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turpin|first=Andrew H.|last2=Hersh|first2=William|date=2001-01-01|title=Why Batch and User Evaluations Do Not Give the Same Results|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/383952.383992|journal=Proceedings of the 24th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval|series=SIGIR '01|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=225–231|doi=10.1145/383952.383992|isbn=1581133316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, it has been shown that results of offline evaluations have low correlation with results from user studies or A/B tests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24592-8_12|title=Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries|last1=Langer|first1=Stefan|date=2015-09-14|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319245911|editor-last=Kapidakis|editor-first=Sarantos|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=153–168|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24592-8_12|editor-last2=Mazurek|editor-first2=Cezary|editor-last3=Werla|editor-first3=Marcin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dataset popular for offline evaluation has been shown to contain duplicate data and thus to lead to wrong conclusions in the evaluation of algorithms.&lt;ref name="BasaranNtoutsi2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basaran|first1=Daniel|last2=Ntoutsi|first2=Eirini|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|title=Redundancies in Data and their Effect on the Evaluation of Recommendation Systems: A Case Study on the Amazon Reviews Datasets|year=2017|pages=390–398|doi=10.1137/1.9781611974973.44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproducibility in recommender system research ==
In recent years there was a growing understanding in the community that  lots of previous research had little impact on the practical application of recommender systems. Ekstrand, Konstan, et al. criticize that "it is currently difficult to reproduce and extend recommender systems research results,” and that evaluations are “not handled consistently".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekstrand|first=Michael D.|last2=Ludwig|first2=Michael|last3=Konstan|first3=Joseph A.|last4=Riedl|first4=John T.|date=2011-01-01|title=Rethinking the Recommender Research Ecosystem: Reproducibility, Openness, and LensKit|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2043932.2043958|journal=Proceedings of the Fifth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems|series=RecSys '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=133–140|doi=10.1145/2043932.2043958|isbn=9781450306836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konstan and Adomavicius conclude that "the Recommender Systems research community is facing a crisis where a significant number of papers present results that contribute little to collective knowledge […] often because the research lacks the […] evaluation to be properly judged and, hence, to provide meaningful contributions.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konstan|first=Joseph A.|last2=Adomavicius|first2=Gediminas|date=2013-01-01|title=Toward Identification and Adoption of Best Practices in Algorithmic Recommender Systems Research|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2532508.2532513|journal=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation|series=RepSys '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=23–28|doi=10.1145/2532508.2532513|isbn=9781450324656}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, lots of research about recommender systems can be considered as not reproducible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Breitinger|first1=Corinna|last2=Langer|first2=Stefan|last3=Lommatzsch|first3=Andreas|last4=Gipp|first4=Bela|date=2016-03-12|title=Towards reproducibility in recommender-systems research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-016-9174-x|journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=69–101|doi=10.1007/s11257-016-9174-x|issn=0924-1868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, operators of recommender systems find little guidance in the current research for answering the question, which recommendation approaches to use in a recommender systems.

While reproducibility has not been considered for a long time in the recommender-system community, this aspects is much more considered recently, with several workshops and conferences focusing on reproducibility in recommender system research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamopoulos|first=Panagiotis|last2=Bellogín|first2=Alejandro|last3=Castells|first3=Pablo|last4=Cremonesi|first4=Paolo|last5=Steck|first5=Harald|date=2014-01-01|title=REDD 2014 – International Workshop on Recommender Systems Evaluation: Dimensions and Design|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2645710.2645780|journal=Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems|series=RecSys '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=393–394|doi=10.1145/2645710.2645780|isbn=9781450326681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anticipatory design ==
Anticipatory design is the combination of Internet of Things, User experience design and machine learning. Anticipatory design differs from conventional design, in that within anticipatory design the goal is to simplify the process and minimize difficulty by making decisions on behalf of the users. Examples of services that use various levels of anticipatory designs are: Amazon and Netflix production recommendation which recommend products based on previous behavior, the mobile application Peapod which uses a recommendation engine to allow users to fill their shopping basket based on previous orders, and the Nest thermostat which predicts the perfect room temperature based on user input and time of day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/09/anticipatory-design/|title=What You Need To Know About Anticipatory Design|date=2015-09-10|work=Smashing Magazine|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14302">'''Reinforcement theory''' is a limited effects media model applicable within the realm of communication. The theory generally states that people seek out and remember information that provides cognitive support for their pre-existing attitudes and beliefs. The main assumption that guides this theory is that people do not like to be wrong and often feel uncomfortable when their beliefs are challenged.

Additionally, this theory focuses on the behavior to consequence connection within the ABC model.  This theory, in management, can also be referred to as [[operant conditioning]] or the [[law of effect]].  Quite simply, this theory notes that a behavior will continue with a certain level of frequency based on pleasant or unpleasant results.

==Politics==
Politics provides an excellent setting for the study of reinforcement theory. The statistics on [[Swing vote|undecided voters]] indicate that most people have pre-existing beliefs when it comes to politics. Relatively few people remain undecided late into high-profile elections. For example, about a month prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], less than one-fifth of likely voters claimed to be undecided (Sidoti, 2008). Much [[Political campaign|political advertising]] is targeted at these individuals not only because of their importance in the overall result, but also because they are the most susceptible to political persuasion (Johnson-Cartee &amp; Copeland, 1997).

Part of the reason why undecided voters are frequent message targets can be found in reinforcement theory. Reinforcement theory predicts that people with already developed opinions will selectively attend to and cognitively incorporate information that supports their own views. Reinforcement theory has three primary mechanisms behind it: [[selective exposure theory|selective exposure]], [[selective perception]], and selective retention.

== Selective exposure ==

The primary basis for the [[selective exposure theory|selective exposure]] assumption can be located within [[cognitive dissonance]] theory, although contemporary work (Knobloch-Westerwick, 2014) draws on numerous theories. Basically, this theory states that people do not like to have previously-held beliefs challenged. When individuals encounter information that is discrepant from their own opinions, they seek to resolve the resultant disharmony somehow. People in general do not like to be wrong. A change or shift in attitude is sometimes interpreted as an admission that the original belief was inaccurate or inadequate. To avoid having their opinions challenged, research indicates that people tend to simply avoid information that might be discrepant in nature (Johnson-Cartee and Copeland, 1997). Support for this tendency to avoid dissonant messages can also be found in mood management theory. Basically, this theory states that people expose themselves to stimuli that are pleasurable and avoid stimuli that might induce a negative reaction (Zillman &amp; Bryant, 1985).

The selective exposure phenomenon focuses on how people manage to avoid incongruent information and primarily encounter information that supports predispositions. Obviously, most are not able to completely avoid all potentially challenging information. In these cases, message receivers may outright reject dissonant messages (Wheeless, 1974). The reasons for rejection are varied and plentiful. For example, the person might justify message rejection by attacking the source's credibility.

A topic as emotional and involving as political preference is especially subject to the selective exposure phenomenon. In fact, Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet (1948) found selective exposure early on to be a necessary link in their theory that campaigns primarily reinforce and activate preexisting political notions. The ever-increasing number of media options further facilitates the public's ability to selectively expose themselves to desired media messages. The explosion of the Internet has put the individual in the driver's seat with regard to what kind of information s/he will encounter. McLeod, Kosicki, and McLeod (2002) stated that information selection and "exposure is much more specialized and individualized" (p.&amp;nbsp;221) in the era of the World Wide Web. Furthermore, [[Cable television|cable channel]] options continue to multiply with specific, niche target audiences in mind. Some researchers worry that this increased level of fragmentation makes it possible for people to effectively avoid diverse viewpoints and perspectives (McLeod, Kosicki, &amp; McLeod, 2002). If a person limits his/her information acquisition to that which is only consistent with a personal point of view, s/he will surely not contribute to a fully informed electorate.

== Selective perception ==
It is not possible to completely avoid all discrepant messages. When exposure to a dissonant message has occurred, the phenomenon of selective perception often follows. This process simply means that people skew their perceptions to coincide with what they desire (Johnson-Cartee &amp; Copeland, 1997). Perception is subjective and dependent on several factors; one factor, for example, is [[MIME|media type]]. Prior research indicates that people who actively process television news tend to engage in more individualized explanations of an event as opposed to those active processors of newspapers (McLeod, Kosicki, &amp; McLeod, 2002). The selective perception discussed here, however, is done in order to reduce dissonance with previously held beliefs (Wheeless, 1974). Several communication theories use this assumption of skewed perception as their basis (i.e., [[Hostile media effect|hostile media phenomenon]], third-person effect).

In the political realm, selective perception often occurs when a voter is presented with a candidate position that he or she does not agree with but supports the candidate otherwise. Sherrod (1971) found that "voters preferring a particular candidate do selectively perceive that candidate's position on an issue in such a way as to make it consistent with their own" (p.&amp;nbsp;554). He pinpointed three primary reasons why the initial disagreement happens. First, the candidate and voter may share political party affiliation, but may not agree on all of the issues. Second, the voter may simply be unaware of the candidate's actual position. Third, [[Peer pressure|social pressure]] to take a particular stand on an issue may exist that causes the voter to be incongruent with his or her preferred candidate (Sherrod, 1971). Selective Perception is not only associated with the voter and the candidate they affiliate with. Selective perception is also seen when someone attacks a political opponent by focusing on a particular issue they disagree with. Voters will ignore any common stances on issues with the opposition, and thus scorch the opponent on one main idea (Falcon, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poliscinewsreview.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/selective-perception-among-voters/|title=Selective Perception Among Voters|date=March 2, 2012|work=PoliSci News Review|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of political selective perception can be seen in Barry Ritholtz's Politics and Selective Perception chart. In this chart, we are given the unemployment numbers at specific points in time under different House Majorities. Selective perception allows the user to view this chart in any way they feel is deemed correct, though the chart doesn't reveal really anything about politics or unemployment (Ritholtz, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/11/politics-and-selective-perception/|title=Politics and Selective Perception|date=November 6, 2010|author=Barry Ritholtz|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sherrod (1971), there are three potential actions the voter may take to reduce dissonance in this situation. First, the voter may learn about the candidate's stand on the issue and then change either his or her opinion of the candidate or alter his or her own position on the issue in question to bring them in line. Second, the voter may still choose to disagree with the preferred candidate's position and instead will lessen the issue's personal importance. Last, the voter may engage in selective perception and actually misperceive the candidate's position to align better with the voter's own stand than it actually does. This does not require any change in attitude regarding either the candidate or the issue on the part of the voter. Sherrod's (1971) research found the third option to occur with the greatest frequency: he found that voters most often selectively misperceive a candidate's position on an issue rather than either change one's own view or relegate the issue to a status of lesser importance.

== Selective retention ==

The final mechanism behind reinforcement theory has to do with selective retention and recall. This phenomenon occurs when "people remember only those items that are in agreement with their predispositions" (Johnson-Cartee &amp; Copeland, 1997, 94). The ease with which a person can recall information impacts the level and intensity of judgment related to the topic. For example, people who can easily recall an example related to the message are more likely to make an intense judgment about it (Shrum, 2002).

In general, most people are unable to accurately recall current event information presented on the news. Gunter (1991) found that only about 5% of television news viewers could accurately recall details of what they saw a short time after the newscast. Audience factors such as education and [[Social status|socio-economic status]] also affect recall ability (Surlin &amp; Gordon, 1976). Although additional variables such as news presentation and format affect information retention, people generally can better remember messages that are consistent with their own attitudes and beliefs (Wheeless, 1974). Surlin and Gordon (1976) found that political information in particular is more readily retained and summoned up when it supports preexisting beliefs and political opinions. Information that threatens such beliefs is more easily forgotten or lost. This phenomenon also extends to political advertising. Prior research found that a candidate's supporters could more easily bring to mind his/her [[Campaign advertising|political ad]] than the opponent's.

== Organizational Behavior ==
Moving away from politics and toward business organizational management, Stajkovic and Luthans (1997) ''"A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Organizational Behavior Modification on Task Performance 1975-1995".
illustrates that the classical behaviors that Watson(1913) and Pavlov (1927) and reinforcement theory (Ferster &amp; Skinner (1957), Skinner (1938,1966, 1969) and how behavior modification techniques can be applied to the human resources management within corporate organizational settings.  The below model provides a five-step application framework identifying, measuring, analyzing, contingently intervening in, and evaluating employee's task-related behaviors aimed at performance improvement.(Luthens &amp; Krietner (1975, 1985)

'''Savage Love''' is a syndicated sex-[[advice column]] by [[Dan Savage]]. The column appears weekly in several dozen newspapers, mainly free newspapers in the US and Canada, but also newspapers in Europe and Asia. It started in 1991 with the first issue of the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] weekly newspaper ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''.

Since October 2006, Savage has also recorded the ''Savage Lovecast'', a weekly [[podcast]] version of the column, featuring telephone advice sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/archives.php#a029910 |title=Dan Savage |publisher=Podcasts.thestranger.com |accessdate=March 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206090407/http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/archives.php#a029910 |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Podcasts are released every Tuesday.

Since 2002, he has written the column at [[Eppie Lederer]]'s desk, which he, a "lifelong fan" of her [[Ann Landers]] column, bought at auction after the noted advice columnist died.&lt;ref name="savage desk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=12738 |title=Ann Advises On |date=December 5, 2002 |first=Dan |last=Savage |newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Savage was living in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and working as a manager at a local video store that specialized in independent film titles.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/savage_d.html |title=GLBTQ Literature: Dan Savage |publisher=GLBTQ.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604104320/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/savage_d.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of ''[[The Onion]]'', who announced that he was moving to [[Seattle]] to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Bio" /&gt; Savage "made the offhand comment that forever altered [his] life: 'Make sure your paper has an advice column – everybody claims to hate 'em, but everybody seems to read 'em'."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, Introduction, ''Savage Love: Straight Answers from America's Most Popular Sex Columnist'' (New York: Plume, 1998), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He typed up a sample column, and to his surprise Keck offered him the job.&lt;ref name=AV-club&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/45150 Dan Savage interviewed by Tasha Robinson], ''The A.V. Club'', February 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, Introduction, ''Savage Love: Straight Answers from America's Most Popular Sex Columnist'', op. cit., pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage stated in a February 2006 interview in ''The Onion''{{'}}s ''[[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]]'' (which publishes his column) that he began the column with the express purpose of providing mocking advice to heterosexuals, since most straight advice columnists were "clueless" when responding to letters from gay people.&lt;ref name=AV-club /&gt;

== Language ==
=== Recapture of offensive words ===
For the first six years of the column, Savage had his readers address him with "Hey, [[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]", as a comment on previous efforts to [[Reclaimed word|recapture offensive words]]. He was criticized for this by some gay activists.

=== Neologisms ===
During the run of Savage Love, Savage has popularized several [[neologism]]s. He has also debunked several sexual neologisms for violent sex acts, including the "[[donkey punch]]", the "[[Pirate (sexual slang)|pirate]]" and the "[[Hot Karl (slang)|hot Karl]]", concluding "They're all fictions."&lt;ref name="savage2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=No Shit? |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=20179&amp;mode=print |newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |date=December 23–29, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Campsite rule ====
In any relationship, but particularly those with a large difference of age or experience between the partners, the older or more experienced partner has the responsibility to leave the younger or less experienced partner in at least as good a state (emotionally and physically) as before the relationship. The "campsite rule" includes things like leaving the younger or less experienced partner with no [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], no unwanted pregnancies, and not overburdening them with emotional and sexual baggage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Q |first=Dan |title=Savage Love Readers Talk About the Campsite Rule |pages= |newspaper=Scatmania |location= |date=May 14, 2008 |url=http://www.scatmania.org/2008/05/14/campsite/ |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tea and Sympathy rule ====
Shortly after a 2009 scandal in [[Portland, Oregon]], involving openly gay mayor [[Sam Adams (Oregon politician)|Sam Adams]] and Beau Breedlove, who had allegedly turned 18 almost immediately before the two began a sexual relationship, Savage created a companion rule to the "campsite rule", now known as the "Tea and Sympathy rule". The rule is a reference to a line in the [[Tea and Sympathy (play)|play of the same name]], in which a much older woman asks of a high-school-age boy, right before having sex with him: "Years from now, when you talk about this – and you will – be kind."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/movies/19kerr.html?pagewanted=print Deborah Kerr, Actress Known for Genteel Grace and a Sexy Beach Kiss, Dies at 86] – ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Savage claimed in an article in ''[[The Portland Mercury]]'' that, while Adams followed the "campsite rule" – Breedlove did not claim that Adams had given him any diseases or caused him emotional trauma, and in fact still refers to Adams as a friend – Breedlove violated the "Tea and Sympathy" rule by making public statements that he knew could ruin Adams's career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/the-tea-and-sympathy-rule/Content?oid=1089470 The Tea and Sympathy Rule] ''Portland Mercury''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monogamish ====
In a July 20, 2011 column, Savage coined the term "monogamish". The term describes couples who are perceived to be [[monogamy|monogamous]], who are "mostly" monogamous, but who are not 100% monogamous. Such couples have an understanding that allows for some amount of sexual contact outside the relationship.&lt;ref name=monogamish&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=9125045 |title=Savage Love: Monogamish |last=Savage |first=Dan |date= July 20, 2011 |work=The Stranger |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage believes that of all the couples people think are 100% monogamous, a lot of them are more "monogamish" than people realize. The term has since seen mainstream use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/2998792/satisfaction-monogamish-infidelity-married/ |title=Are You 'Monogamish'? A New Survey Says Lots of Couples Are |last=Luscombe |first=Belinda |date= July 17, 2014 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/magazine/infidelity-will-keep-us-together.html |title=Married, with Infidelities |last=Oppenheimer |first=Mark |date= June 3, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pegging ====
{{Main|Pegging (sexual practice)}}
In 2001, Savage challenged readers of his column to coin a name for the sex act in which a woman uses a strap-on [[dildo]] to perform [[anal sex]] on her male partner. After multiple nominations and a reader vote, the verb "[[pegging (sexual practice)|peg]]" was chosen, with a 43% [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] over runners-up "bob" and "punt".&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=7730 We Have a Winner!]. ''The Stranger'', June 21, 2001. Accessed April 7, 2013.&lt;!--See talk page for any thoughts.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Santorum ====
{{Main|Campaign for the neologism "santorum"|Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality}}
Savage reacted strongly to statements made about homosexuality by former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Rick Santorum]] in an April 2003 interview with the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name=USATodayApril232003&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm |title=Excerpt from Santorum interview |newspaper=USA Today |issn=0734-7456 |date=April 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum included gay sex as a form of deviant sexual behavior, along with incest, [[polygamy]], and bestiality, that he said threatens society and the family; he said he believed consenting adults do not have a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] [[right to privacy]] with respect to sexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm Excerpt from Santorum in an interview]: "...if the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, ... [y]ou have the right to anything. Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does.", ''[[USA Today]]'', April 23, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Savage invited his readers to create a sex-related definition for "santorum" to "memorialize the Santorum scandal [...] by attaching his name to a sex act that would make his big, white teeth fall out of his big, empty head."&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan. [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14267 "Bill, Ashton, Rick"], ''The Stranger'', May 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The winning definition was "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex."&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan. [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14566 "Gas Huffer"], ''The Stranger'', June 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Savage set up a website to spread the term, inviting bloggers and others to link to it, which caused it to rise to the top of a Google search for Santorum's name.&lt;ref&gt;Mencimer, Stephanie. [http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/08/rick-santorum-google-problem-dan-savage "Rick Santorum's Anal Sex Problem"], ''Mother Jones'', September/October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lifting luggage ====
{{anchor|Lifing Luggage|reason=Old, over-capitalized heading name, may be linked to.}}
Following the [[George Rekers#"Rent boy" allegations|"rent boy" allegations]] regarding [[George Rekers]], who has widely promoted [[aversion therapy]], Dan Savage, along with others including [[Stephen Colbert]],&lt;ref&gt;"Colbert Rips Anti-Gay Activist, Throws 'Rentboy' Dance Party" {{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/06/colbert-rips-anti-gay-act_n_565763.html| title =
Colbert Rips Anti-Gay Activist, Throws 'Rentboy' Dance Party |publisher=The Huffington Post | first=Dan| last=Abramson| date=May 6, 2010 |accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoted the use of the idiom "to lift [some]one's luggage", meaning to supply sexual pleasure to, or derive it from, one's partner. This originated from Rekers who, when outed, insisted he had hired the escort only to assist him with lifting his luggage.&lt;ref name="timesonline"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7117037.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first1=Giles | last1=Whittell |title=Baptist minister 'took ten-day holiday with male prostitute' |date=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rekers also claimed he "spent a great deal of time sharing scientific information on the desirability of abandoning homosexual intercourse" and "shared the gospel of Jesus Christ with him in great detail".&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;

Originally Savage suggested that "lifting my luggage" refer to listening to the speaker expound on the "desirability" of converting oneself from homosexual to heterosexual. Later, after several political humorists started employing "lifting your luggage" as an implicit or explicit reference to various sexual acts,&lt;ref&gt;"'Lift My Luggage' Is the New 'Hiking the Appalachian Trail'" by Daniel Kurtzman {{cite web|url=http://politicalhumor.about.com/b/2010/05/06/lift-my-luggage-is-the-new-hiking-the-appalachian-trail.htm| title=About.com --Daniel Kurtzman's Political Humor Blog|accessdate=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage suggested that "whatever lifts your luggage" supplant "whatever floats your boat" in common parlance.

==== Saddlebacking ====
In 2009, after a controversy involving the [[Saddleback Church]], the column defined "saddlebacking" as "the phenomenon of Christian teens engaging in unprotected anal sex in order to preserve their virginities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=1031968|title=Savage Love|work=The Stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Leotarded ====
After receiving criticism for use of the word "retarded"—considered by many to be an offensive slur against those with intellectual disabilities—Savage suggested "leotarded" as an alternative, because "leotard" rhymes with "retard".

=== Initialisations ===
==== GGG ====
Dan Savage coined the abbreviation "GGG".&lt;ref name="walczak"&gt;Ken Walczak, [http://www.good.is/posts/the-ggg-cocktail-a-non-vanilla-drink-inspired-by-dan-savage "The GGG Cocktail"], www.good.is, May 9, 2012 (accessed December 26, 2012) ("Dan is best known for two things: his advice that partners in any relationship strive to be Good, Giving, and Game (GGG) and ...").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/09/12/science_proves_it_dan_savage_is_right/|title=Science proves it: Dan Savage is right|author=DebHerbenick|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands for "good, giving, and game", and it means one should strive to be ''good'' in bed, ''giving'' "equal time and equal pleasure" to one's partner, and ''game'' "for anything – within reason".&lt;ref name="Salon1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=167448 Wrong &amp; Right], ''The Stranger'' March 1, 2007 (accessed December 26, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The term has inspired the "How GGG Are You? Test" on the popular Internet dating site [[OkCupid]], and the invention of a [[cocktail]].&lt;ref name="walczak" /&gt;

==== DTMFA ====
"Dump the mother-fucker already", used at a closing of a response to indicate that acting immediately to end the writer's abusive or worthless relationship is advised.

==== ITMFA ====
A reader of Savage Love suggested the initialisation ITMFA, a take on DTMFA, meaning "Impeach the Motherfucker Already!" The initialisation was coined in reference to the [[presidency of George W. Bush]] in 2006, but was reintroduced in 2017 in reaction to the [[presidency of Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/01/25/24822658/impeach-the-motherfucker-already|title=Impeach the Motherfucker Already!|work=The Stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CPOS ====
"Cheating piece of shit", said of a cheater, but usually reserved for one who is chronic or abusive/passive-aggressive about it.

==== HTH ====
"How'd that happen?", a mock-incredulous reply to those to who write in and say they had certain (often sexual) things "happen to" them, as if they had no part or say in the incident, when they clearly did.

=== Usage ===
Savage objected to use of the term "pussy" as an insult, saying that vaginas were wonderful, popping out babies, and proposed "[[scrotum]]", plural "scrota", as an insult.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8780">'''Somaesthetics''' is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry aimed at promoting and integrating the theoretical, empirical and practical disciplines related to bodily perception, performance and presentation.

== Etymology ==
The term ‘somaesthetics’ was coined by the American pragmatist philosopher [[Richard Shusterman]] in 1996 through the compounding of “soma”, an expression derived from the Greek word for body, and “[[aesthetics]]”, a word derived from the Greek ''aesthesis'', meaning ‘sensory perception’.&lt;ref&gt;While Shusterman was the first to use 'somaesthetics' in reference to a philosophical discipline, a form of the term had been in use within the neurological sciences as an alternate label for the somatosensory cortex, i.e. the somaesthetic cortex. In American English, this alternate label is usually rendered with a different spelling: somesthetic.&lt;/ref&gt; Shusterman has reported in a number of his works that he chose ‘soma’ over more familiar terms “to avoid problematic associations of body (which can be a lifeless, mindless thing) and flesh (which designates only the fleshly parts of the body and is strongly associated with Christian notions of sin)” and to emphasize that the project “concerns the lived, sentient, purposive body rather than merely a physical body”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an amalgamation, ‘somaesthetics’ “implies a project of appreciating and cultivating the body not only as an object that externally displays beauty, sublimity, grace, and other aesthetic qualities, but also as a subjectivity that perceives these qualities and that experiences attendant aesthetic pleasures somatically”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Origin and development ==
Somaesthetics as a research project initially arose from the work of Richard Shusterman during the mid-1990s in response to what he perceived as needed developments within his two principal modes of inquiry: pragmatist aesthetics and philosophy as an embodied art of living. While pragmatist aesthetics, according to Shusterman, advocates for more active and creative engagement than traditional aesthetics, he believed it should also recognize that artistic, practical and political action requires humanity’s primary tool, the body, and that such action could be improved partly by improving this instrument.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the philosophical life could be improved through greater mastery of the soma -- our medium of living. He moreover lamented the reduction of aesthetics (as well as philosophy itself) from “a noble art of living into a minor, specialized university discipline” narrowly concerned with beauty and fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=301|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shusterman thus argued for the revival of “[[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]]’s idea of aesthetics as a life-improving cognitive discipline that extends far beyond questions of beauty and fine arts and that involves both theory and practical exercise” and for an end to “the neglect of the body that Baumgarten disastrously introduced into aesthetics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ibid.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As proposed, Shusterman’s project of somaesthetics would restore “the soma — the living, sentient, purposive body — as the indispensable medium for all perception".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Such heightening of somatic consciousness would not only enhance artistic appreciation and creation, but increase the perceptual awareness of meanings and feelings that have the potential to elevate everyday experience into an art of living.

Shusterman proposed three fundamental dimensions of his emerging field:
&lt;br /&gt;
• Analytic somaesthetics, as the most theoretically-oriented of the three, “describes the basic nature of bodily perceptions and practices and also of their function in our knowledge and construction of reality”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=304|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
• Pragmatic somaesthetics presupposes the analytic dimension and “has a distinctly normative, prescriptive character – by proposing specific methods of somatic improvement and engaging in their comparative critique”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|pages=304–305|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
• Practical somaesthetics focuses on practicing somatic care “through intelligently disciplined body work aimed at somatic self-improvement (whether in a representational, experiential, or performative mode)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=307|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past two decades, somaesthetics has become a truly interdisciplinary endeavor. Originally conceived by Shusterman as being under the umbrella of [[philosophy]], or perhaps even a branch of [[aesthetics]], somaesthetics has evolved into an “open field for collaborative, interdisciplinary, and transcultural inquiry” with applications “ranging from the arts, product design, and politics to fashion, health, sports, martial arts, and the use of hallucinogenic drugs in education”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html#heading_Genealogy_and_Emergence_page_107797|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Strathcona Science Park.JPG|thumbnail|Park welcome sign]]

'''Strathcona Science Provincial Park ''' is a [[provincial park]] in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], located between [[Edmonton]] and [[Sherwood Park]], south of the [[Yellowhead Highway]] and west of [[Anthony Henday Drive]].

The park is situated in the [[North Saskatchewan River]] valley, on both banks of the river, at an elevation of {{cvt|625|m}} and has a surface of {{cvt|2.9|km2|sqmi}}. It was established on December&amp;nbsp;12, 1979 and is maintained by [[Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation]].

This site was for thousands of years the site of an annual aboriginal camp, as it was located close enough to the river for transportation and trade and the bluffs of the river valley provided excellent bison-hunting opportunities.  The park was established to preserve the site from encroaching industrial development.  It was the site of archeological excavations in 1978 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;https://openlibrary.org/b/OL2751267M/Strathcona_site_(FjPi-29)_excavations_1978_1979_and_1980&lt;/ref&gt;

The park contains several abandoned [[Interpretation centre|interpretive buildings]] opened by the Alberta government in 1980 but now shuttered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/once-celebrated-science-park-becomes-shuttered-casualty-in-alberta/article26866498/ "Once celebrated science park becomes shuttered casualty in Alberta"], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Oct. 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Remnants of the park's history as a public science center include tiled triangular [[obelisk]]s, a [[boardwalk]] through the archaeological area, and a few interpretive plaques.  The area is safe but overgrown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=River Valley Alliance| url=http://rivervalleypark.blogspot.com/2011/06/getting-out-in-river-valley.html| title= Getting Out in the River Valley |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Goyette |first= Linda  |author2=Carolina Jakeway Roemmich  |title= Edmonton in Our Own Words |publisher= [[University of Alberta Press]] |page= 10 |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-88864-428-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine Theoretical Physics Institute Misel]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visitor Program'''

FTPI has a worldwide reach. The Institute has hosted over 800 individual researchers, from institutions in more than 18 different countries, for working visits of one day to six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/inventingtomorrow/docs/v32_n2_spring_2008_inventing_tomorrow UMN, CSE Inventing Tomorrow, Spring/Summer 2008, Vol. 32, 2., P.32-33]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workshops'''

FTPI hosts up to three workshops per year for physicists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftpi.umn.edu/workshops/ William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute Workshops]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the 2013 CAQCD meeting which was special because it was the tenth meeting in the series. The proceedings of the previous conferences – they are held biannually – reveal the developments of QCD and related theories from the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/54389/2 CERN Courier, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as a workshop in October 2000 celebrating 30 years of supersymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28388 CERN Courier, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

Current and former faculty members of FTPI have been honored with a number of prizes and awards. Keith Olive is a current Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Physics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarswalk.umn.edu/awards/mcknight/mcknight_distinguished.html UMN Distinguished McKnight University Professor]&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the 2018 [[Hans Bethe Prize]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?last_nm=Olive&amp;first_nm=Keith&amp;year=2018 APS Prizes and Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Former faculty, Leonid Glazman was a McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftpi.umn.edu/about/ About FTPI]&lt;/ref&gt; Boris Shklovskii is the recipient of the 1986 Landau Award &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.umn.edu/about/awards.html UMN Physics Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arkady Vainshtein]] and [[Mikhail Shifman]] were awarded the 2016 [[Dirac Medal and Prize]]. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.ictp.it/about-ictp/prizes-awards/the-dirac-medal/the-medallists/dirac-medallists-2016.aspx Dirac Medallists 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three faculty members have been awarded the [[Sakurai Prize]]: [[Arkady Vainshtein]] (1999), [[Mikhail Shifman]] (1999), and [[Mikhail Voloshin]] (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/sakurai.cfm APS Sakurai Prize ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arkady Vainshtein]] (2005) and [[Mikhail Shifman]] (2013) received the [[Pomeranchuk Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itep.ru/eng/?pprize.html ITEP Pomeranchuk Prize ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Shifman]] was honored with the [[Lilienfeld Prize]] (2006),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/lilienfeld.cfm APS Lilienfeld Prize ]&lt;/ref&gt; and elected as Laureate of Les Chaires Internacionales de Recherche Blaise Pascal(2007)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.umn.edu/about/awards.html UMN Physics Awards ]&lt;/ref&gt; Former member Anatoly Larkin was awarded the [[Fritz London Memorial Prize]] in Low Temperature Physics (1990),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phy.duke.edu/~hm/flondonprizeawards.html Duke Physics Fritz London Memorial Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; the Hewlett Packard Europhysics Prize (1993),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?first_nm=Anatoly&amp;last_nm=Larkin&amp;year=2002 APS Physics]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lars Onsager Prize]] in Theoretical Statistical Physics (2002)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/onsager.cfm APS Lars Onsager Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Bardeen Prize for Superconductivity (2004).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m2s-2012.org/john-bardeen-prize/ Bardeen Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
The William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute is financed from a combination of private and University funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/40/2/10.1063/1.2819908 Physics Today February 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of fundamental-science research institutes, FTPI is, for its part, something of an oddity. While most such organizations are large, National Science Foundation-funded enterprises, Minnesota's FTPI was created in large part out of the generosity of a single private donor, and it is dedicated to the research efforts of its members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/137256/article-1G1-55128657/worlds-apart Mpls-St. Paul Magazine 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Energy]] ER40823 grant is mutually submitted between the Department of Physics at the [[University of Minnesota]] and FTPI. This grant is entitled "Experimental and Theoretical High Energy Physics" and helps to support faculty and postdoctoral salaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.energy.gov/funding-opportunities/award-search/ DOE Grant Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zeppelin University''' (German: ''Zeppelin Universität'', '''ZU''') is a small and highly selective&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/zeppelin-universitaet-ist-bekannt-fuer-ihr-hartes-auswahlverfahren-a-875602.html|title=Zeppelin Universität ist bekannt für ihr hartes Auswahlverfahren|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=17 April 2013|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zu.de/mediathek/video/2014/imagefilm-pioneers-wanted-auswahltag.php|title=Mediathek|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; private [[research university]] located at [[Lake Constance]] in [[Friedrichshafen]], [[Germany]]. It is named after the German general and airship constructor [[Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin]], whose foundation is the main financier of Zeppelin University.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the official status, see [http://www.hochschulkompass.de/kompass/xml/download/hs_liste.txt ''Hochschulrektorenkonferenz, Hochschulkompass''] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established in 2003 and is known for its [[avant-garde]] character as well as for a sophisticated selection. On 10. September 2011, ZU was being bestowed the right to award [[doctorate]] and [[habilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs-kompass2.de/kompass/xml/akkr/80540_17594_de.htm|title=Akkreditierte Studiengänge - Zentrale Datenbank|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes along with the right to use the title "university" (German: ''Universität'').

== Overview ==
Zeppelin University has the legal form of a non-profit, limited liability organization and calls itself "university bridging business, culture and politics". Thus it stresses the multi-disciplinary character of research and teaching that is an integral part of its self-image. The university is accredited nationally by the Academic Council of the Federal Republic of Germany ([[Wissenschaftsrat]]). The undergraduate major courses are accredited by ACQUIN, a German higher education accreditation agency.

Zeppelin University has two main campuses in [[Friedrichshafen]]: One right on the banks of [[Lake Constance]] (the ''LakeCampus'' or ''SMH'') and the nearby ''ZFCampus'' (or ''FAB3''), which was built from 2013 to 2015 to create more space for the quickly growing university. Both campuses are modern, designed by well-known architects, and contain [[classroom]]s, [[lecture hall]]s, offices, [[cafeteria]]s, a [[library]] and a wing free to use solely by students. From 2007 to 2008 (until the closure of the airport), Zeppelin University had an additional location in the foyer of [[Tempelhof International Airport]] in Berlin, the so-called “Institute for the Art of Swimming on Air”. Since 2011, there is a campus in Berlin again (''CapitalCampus'').

There are several [[student group]]s and projects, such as groups affiliated with political parties (''LHG, Jusos, RCDS''), a debating club (''Soapbox''), the Club of International Politics (''CIP''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international-politics.org/|title=CIP|website=CIP|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Model United Nations group (MUN), which also organizes ''LakeMun'', entrepreneurial groups, a cultural club which also organizes a music festival at the university (''SeeKult''), a student medical service, a filming group, several bands and many more - some of them are even known nationwide (e.g. ''RockYourLife''). In 2008, the student radio station ''Welle20'' went on air.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/das-studium/studentische-projekte.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection==
Applicants are selected by the university in an arduous two-step selection process: after a detailed written application, in which the first selection is made, the most auspicious candidates will be invited to an [[assessment centre|assessment day]] (''Pioneers Wanted''). Thereby, the candidates undergo a program consisting of several interviews with professors, students, [[alumni]], and external reviewers, as well as written tests. Furthermore, they have to accomplish a realistic project which is introduced by an associated organisation, whereby a problem has to be solved as a group and must be presented afterwards in front of the assessment committee.&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/bewerbung-bachelor/bewerbung.php Application]&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection procedure of ZU is being considered as outstandingly sophisticated, also because of its deviating modalities compared to other universities: ZU deliberately refrain from the solely use of a [[numerus clausus]] (which is widely prevalent in German educational landscape), but instead tries to find personalities which - besides accomplishing the required performance - also fit to the university's character.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; Therefore, the university currently has an undergraduate acceptance rate, which is lower than 10% and a graduate acceptance rate of about 16%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeppelin-university.de/deutsch/zeppelinuniversity/facts_figures.php?navid=8|title=zu in zahlen|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tuition]] for the bachelor program amounts to 3,950.00 euro per semester or 675.00 euro per month, for the master programs from 4,000.00 euro to 4,900.00 euro per semester.&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [http://www.zu.de/deutsch/bewerberportal/bachelor/2010/gebuehren_BA_CME.php Tuition]&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous merit-based [[scholarship]]s by foundations and patrons as well as a student loan of ''[[Sparkasse]] Bodensee'' that is offered at a relatively low interest rate and is used by more than half of the students.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.brandeins.de/archiv/2005/freiheit/am-strand-der-guten-hoffnung.html Am Strand der guten Hoffnung]'', in: [[brand eins]], January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from Fall Semester 2011, Zeppelin University reorganized all of their undergraduate degree programmes, converting them into 4-year programs. The additional year is intended to be used as "Humboldt-year", a one-year research project at one of the partner universities. Accordingly, it has cooperation agreements for example with [[University of California]], Berkeley, with [[Sciences Po]] in Paris, with [[Copenhagen Business School]] as well as with [[Goldsmiths College]], London.&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [http://www.zu.de/deutsch/bewerberportal/bachelor/ZU_Bachelorbroschuere_05_2011.pdf Info-brochure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217023856/http://www.zu.de/deutsch/bewerberportal/bachelor/ZU_Bachelorbroschuere_05_2011.pdf |date=February 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rankings==
Zeppelin University is a small and exclusive&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; private university and offers fewer programs than traditional universities in Germany. Due to its young age and small size, it typically goes unranked in international comparisons. Nevertheless, it has reached remarkable results in German Rankings: In the magazine ''Handelsblatt Karriere'', edition 07/08 dated April 27, 2007, Zeppelin University has appeared in a university ranking for the first time. It has instantly reached eighth place with its economic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idw-online.de/pages/en/news?id=206668|title=Zeppelin University unter den Top 10 der deutschen Unis|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most reputable German Ranking, the ''CHE University Ranking'', which was published by ''ZEIT Studienführer'' 2014/15, the university was able to reach the first place with “Corporate Management &amp; Economics” (CME), while [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/pair/index.php?navid=538739538739 Politics, Administration &amp; International Relations (PAIR)] was ranked among the three best Political Science programs. In 2011/12 the Communication &amp; Cultural Management program was ranked first place by ''CHE''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zu.de/universitaet/rankings.php|title=Rankings|website=www.zu.de|language=de|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sociology, Politics, and Economics degree is not ranked, due to its multidisciplinarity.

In 2014, the university was listed in an international ranking for the first time: in the ''U-Multirank'' it gained the best grade "excellent".
