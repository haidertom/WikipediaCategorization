      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15732">In [[behavioral ecology]], '''adaptive behavior''' is any [[behavior]] that contributes directly or indirectly to an individual's [[reproductive success]], and is thus subject to the forces of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;Ecology and Behavior ''from'' Biology: The Unity and Diversity of Life 10th edition. Starr and Taggart 2004. Thompson publishers {{ISBN|0-534-39746-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include favoring [[Kinship|kin]] in [[altruistic behavior]]s, [[sexual selection|female selection]] of the most fit male, and defending a [[Territory (animal)|territory]] or [[Polygyny#In nature|harem]] from rivals. 

Conversely, '''non-adaptive behavior''' is any behavior that is counterproductive to an individual's survival or reproductive success. Examples might include altruistic behaviors which do not favor kin, [[adoption]] of unrelated young, and being a subordinate in a [[dominance hierarchy]].

Adaptations are commonly defined as evolved solutions to recurrent environmental problems of survival and reproduction.&lt;ref name=Buss&gt;Buss, D.M. and Greiling, H. 1999. Adaptive individual differences. Journal of Personality, 67: 209-243.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual differences commonly arise through both [[heritable]] and [[Non-heritable variations|non-heritable]] adaptive behavior. Both have been proven to be influential in the [[evolution]] of species' adaptive behaviors, although non-heritable adaptation remains a controversial subject.&lt;ref name = Buss/&gt;

==Non-heritable==
[[Population]]s change through the process of [[evolution]]. Each individual in a population has a unique role in their particular environment. This role, commonly known as an [[ecological niche]], is simply how an organism lives in an environment in relation to others.&lt;ref name=Staddon&gt;Staddon, J. E. R. (1983). ''Adaptive Behavior and Learning''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Over successive generations, the organism must adapt to their surrounding conditions in order to develop their niche. An organism's niche will evolve as changes in the external environment occur. The most successful species in nature are those that are able to use adaptive behaviors to build on prior knowledge, thereby increasing their overall knowledge bank. In turn, this will improve their overall survival and reproductive success.

===Learning===
{{Main|Learning}}
Many species have the ability to adapt through [[learning]].&lt;ref name = Staddon/&gt; [[Organisms]] will often learn through various psychological and cognitive processes, such as [[operant]] and [[classical conditioning]] and discrimination memory.&lt;ref name = Staddon/&gt; This learning process allows organisms to modify their behavior to survive in unpredictable environments.&lt;ref name = Staddon/&gt; Organisms begin as naive individuals and learning allows them to obtain the knowledge they need to adapt and survive. It is important to remember that a learned adaptive behavior must have a [[psychological]], as well as a [[biological]], component; without the integration of these two disciplines, behavioral adaptation cannot occur.

====Kin selection====
{{Main|Kin selection}}
[[Kin selection]] (commonly referred to as [[altruism]]) is an example of an adaptive behavior that directly influences the genetic composition of a population. It involves evolutionary strategies that favor the persistence of an organism's relatives, often at the cost of the organism's own survival and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref name=Eberhard&gt;Eberhard, M.J.W. 1975. The evolution of social behavior by kin selection. The Quarterly Review of Biology, 50: 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt; This will result in population gene [[frequency]] variation over successive generations, based on the interactions between related individuals. The probability of altruism increases when the [[cost]] is low for the donor, or when there is a high level of gain for the beneficiary. In addition, individuals often display altruistic behaviors when the relative is genetically similar to them.&lt;ref name = Eberhard/&gt; This means offspring or siblings are more likely to benefit from altruism than someone more distantly related, such as a cousin, aunt, or uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J.M. 1964. Group selection and kin selection. Nature, 201: 1145-1147.&lt;/ref&gt;
Kin selection has played a large role in the evolution of social and adaptive behaviors in chimpanzees. Closely related chimpanzees will form a kin group that cooperates to protect a territory, thereby increasing their access to females and resources.&lt;ref name=Morin&gt;Morin, P.A., Moore, J.J., Chakraborty, R., Jin, L., Goodall, J. and Woodruff, D.S. Kin selection, social structure, gene flow, and the evolution of chimpanzees. Science, 265: 1193-1201.&lt;/ref&gt; By working together with close relatives, they can ensure that their genes will persist in the next generation, even if circumstances make them unable to reproduce themselves.&lt;ref name = Morin/&gt; This behavioral adaptation coincides with chimpanzee's ability to distinguish kin from non-kin (referred to as visual kin selection) allowing chimps to formulate large, complex societies, where they use altruistic methods to ensure their genes persist in future generations&lt;ref&gt;Parr, L.A. and de Waal, F.B.M. Visual kin recognition in chimpanzees.  Nature, 399: 647-648.&lt;/ref&gt;. A wide variety of species, including lions, honeybees, and insects have displayed kin selection as an adaptive behavior &lt;ref&gt;Bertram, B.C.R. (1976). ''Growing Points in Ethology. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peters, J.M., Queller, D.C., Imperatriz-Fonseca, V.L., Roubik, D.W. and Strassmann, J.E. 1999. Mate number, kin selection and social conflicts in stingless bees and honeybees. Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 266: 379-384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Queller, D.C. and Strassmann, J.E. 1998. Kin selection and social insects. Bioscience, 48: 165-175.&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Territorial defense====
As mentioned above, chimpanzees work together with closely related kin to protect their [[Territory (animal)|territory]].&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, J.R. 1980. Optimal foraging, predation risk and territory defence. Ardea, 68: 83-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Defending territory from rivals (known as territoriality) is a learnt adaptive behavior performed by several ecological species. The advantage of being territorial varies depending on the species of interest, but the underlying principle is always to increase overall fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Gese, E.M. 2001. Territorial defense by coyotes (Canis latrans) in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming: who, how, where, when, and why. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 79: 980-987.&lt;/ref&gt; Many species will display territoriality in order to acquire food, compete for mates, or have the safest lair. Bird song is an example of learned territorial defense. Studies show that birds with high-quality songs will use them as a stimulus to deter predators from their territorial range.&lt;ref&gt;De Kort, S.R., Eldermire, E.L.B., Cramer, E.R.A. and Vehrencamp, S.L. (2009). The deterrent effect of birdsong in territory defense. Behavioral Ecology, 20: 200-206.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher quality songs have been proven to act as the best defense mechanism in a variety of bird species, such as the red-winged blackbird (''Agelaius phoeniceus'').&lt;ref&gt;Yasukawa, K. 1981. Song and territory defense in the red-winged blackbird. The Auk, 98: 185-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, correct learning of the birdsong early in life is necessary for territory defense in birds. 
European beavers (''Castor fiber'') are another species that use territory defense. They are very protective of their territory because they spend a great deal of time and energy familiarizing themselves with the location and building a habitat. Beavers are unique because they have developed the technique of scent-marking as a way to intimidate intruders.&lt;ref&gt;Rosell, F. and Nolet, B.A. 1997. Factors affecting scent-marking behavior in Eurasian beaver ('''Castor fiber'''). Journal of Chemical Ecology, 3: 673-689.&lt;/ref&gt; This scent acts as a "psychological fence", thereby decreasing the possibility of injury or death by predation. 

===Controversy===
There is debate on whether or not there exists a biological component associated with the learning process in ecological adaptive behavior. Many researchers suggest that the biological and psychological disciplines are integrated, while others believe that the non-heritable component is strictly psychological. They argue that non-heritable traits cannot evolve over successive generations.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, D. 1976. Two concepts of adaption: Darwin's and psychology's. Journal of History of the Behavioral Sciences, 12: 367-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritable==
[[File:Northern Elephant Seal, San Simeon.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Male [[northern elephant seal]]s will fight to defend their [[Polygyny#In nature|harem]]s from rival males, note the pink scarring on the neck of the dominant male.]]
Organisms can also express [[heritable]] adaptive behaviors. These behaviors are encoded in their [[genes]] and inherited from their parents. This gives the organisms the ability to respond to situations with their innate response mechanisms. Using these mechanisms, they can respond appropriately to their internal and external environment without having to learn.&lt;ref name = Staddon/&gt;

===Natural selection===
{{main|Natural selection}}
Heritable adaptive behavior evolves through [[natural selection]]. In this case, some genes better equip individuals to respond to environmental or physiological cues, thereby increasing reproductive success and causing these genes to persist in future generations. Non-adaptive behaviors cause a decrease in reproductive success so the genes are lost from future generations.&lt;ref name = Staddon/&gt;  These adaptive and non-adaptive characteristics arise through [[random mutation]], [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], and/or [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name = Buss/&gt; Essentially, natural selection is a mechanism that contributes to directional gene selection in individuals that reproduce. Traits that cause greater reproductive success of an organism are favored, whereas those that reduce reproductive success are selected against.&lt;ref&gt;Lande, R. and Arnold, S.J. 1983. The measurement of selection on correlated characters. Evolution, 37: 1210-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haldane, J.B.S. 1953. The measurement of natural selection. Genetics, 1: 480-487.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to learning, natural selection is solely a biological concept. It is the biological and genetic component that allows an adaptive behavior to be inherited with no connection to the environment. This form of adaptive behavior is most commonly considered in [[ecological studies]], and therefore natural selection is often used to explain ecological adaptive behavior in organisms.

====Sexual selection====
While kin selection is non-heritable and a direct result of the environment, sexual selection is a heritable adaptive behavior, and can therefore can be acted upon by natural selection. Sexual selection refers specifically to competition for mates.&lt;ref name = Andersson&gt;Andersson, M. (1995). Sexual Selection. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many traits or features that are characteristic of a certain species can be explained by sexual selection as an adaptive behavior; this is because competition for mates results in specific traits being inherited.&lt;ref name = Andersson/&gt; Only the species that are able to successfully compete and obtain a mate will reproduce and pass their genes on to the next generation. Therefore, species-specific genetic traits must be inherited, allowing individuals to be successful in their designated environments. There are many environmental examples of sexual selection as an adaptive behavior; one popular example is [[Sexual dimorphism in non-human primates|sexual dimorphism]]. Sexual dimorphism is a morphological, phenotypic difference between males and females same species.&lt;ref name = Barlow&gt;Barlow, G.W. 2005. How do we decide that a species is sex-role reversed?. The Quarterly Review of Biology, 80: 28-35.&lt;/ref&gt;  A common example of sexual dimorphism is difference in body size.&lt;ref name = Barlow/&gt; Sexual dimorphism can specifically be seen in the fish species, [[Lamprologus callipterus]].&lt;ref name = Kazutaka&gt;Kazutaka, O., Masanori, K. and Tetsu, S. 2010. Unusual allometry for sexual size dimorphism in a cichlid where males are extremely larger than females. Journal of Biosciences, 35: 257-265.&lt;/ref&gt; These male fish are substantially larger (sometimes up to 60 times) than their female counterparts.&lt;ref name = Kazutaka/&gt; The male's increased size is advantageous because the larger individual's are able to compete for females, and subsequently defend their offspring, which grow inside empty snail shells until birth.&lt;ref name = Kazutaka/&gt; Basically, the larger the male fish, the greater the adaptive benefit. The advantage of being larger and more powerful is demonstrated in the male's ability to compete and protect. In contrast to the males, the female fish must remain small in order to lay eggs inside the snail shells.&lt;ref name = Kazutaka/&gt; It is evident that size plays a significant role in the reproductive success of this particular fish species.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, M.I., Ryen, C.A., Munday, P.L., and Walker, S.P.W. 2010. Differing mechanisms underlie sexual size-dimorphism in two populations of a sex-changing fish. PLoS One, 5: e10616.&lt;/ref&gt; Large size is a common adaptive behavioral trait that is inherited through sexual selection and reproduction, as demonstrated in Lamprologus callipterus and other sexually dimorphic species.

==Importance==
It has been proven that adaptive behavior is crucial in the process of [[natural selection]], and thus is important in the [[evolutionary process]]. Species that possess positive adaptive behaviors will inherently acquire evolutionary advantages. For example, adaptive behavior is a mechanism of [[population stabilization]].&lt;ref name = Val&gt;Valdovinos, F.S., Ramos-Jiliberto, R., Garay-Narvaez, L., Urbani, P. and Dunne, J.A. 2010. Consequences of adaptive behavior for the structure and dynamic of food webs. Ecology Letters, 13: 1546-1559.&lt;/ref&gt; In natural communities, organisms are able to interact with each other creating complex [[food webs]] and [[predator-prey dynamics]]. Adaptive behavior helps modulate the dynamics of feeding relationships by having a direct effect on their feeding [[Phenotypic trait|trait]]s and strategies.&lt;ref name = Val/&gt; These adaptive behaviors allow for resilience and resistance in the face of [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]s and a changing environment.&lt;ref name = Val/&gt; In [[ecology]], the coexistence of [[organisms]] in natural ecosystems and the stability of populations are central topics. Currently, we live in a world experiencing great changes at a fast rate, mostly due to [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] impacts on organisms and the environment.&lt;ref name = Val/&gt; By studying adaptive behavior one can understand [[ecosystem]] complexity – how it emerges, how it evolves, and how it can be maintained.

==Measurement==
An organism's behavioral strategies and ability to [[Adaptation|adapt]] will determine how they respond under different environmental conditions. Fitness is a common measure of adaptive success, and can be defined as the number of [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s left over after a group exhibits a particular behavioral strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, A. and McNamara, J.M. (1999) Models of Adaptive Behavior. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Successful strategies will result in increased survival and [[reproduction]], which in turn can be characterized as a profitable behavioral adaption.

The '''Ancient Monuments Society''' (AMS) is a [[learned society]] and [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]] in England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|209605}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1924 "for the study and conservation of ancient monuments, historic buildings and fine old craftsmanship".

==National Amenity Societies==
The Ancient Monuments Society is recognised as one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], and as such is informed of any application for listed building consent in England and Wales involving any element of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such it plays an important part in shaping the historic environment in England and Wales.

==Partnership with Friends of Friendless Churches==
The Ancient Monuments Society works in partnership with the [[Friends of Friendless Churches]], sharing an office and staff and operating a joint membership scheme. The co-operation came about because Friends of Friendless Churches was set up by [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], who was also Secretary and later Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Society.

==Publications==
The AMS publishes three newsletters and a volume of ''Transactions'' (scholarly articles on a range of architectural historic topics) annually for its 2,100 members.

History 4|website=cvaa.com.ar|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists from the AACI proposed, for the first time in the history of Argentina, the necessity for an art that was different from symbolic, representational, and expressionistic art. They believed that their artwork, or "inventions" could harbor social change in their current Argentinian political climate. The founders of the AACI showed similar themes throughout their artworks, such as a desire to appear with universality, objectivity, and lack any sort of representativeness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=MARGINAL DISRUPTIONS: CONCRETE AND MADÍ ART IN ARGENTINA, 1940-1955|last=Jorgelina Pozzi-Harris|first=Ana|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|year=2007|isbn=|location=Austin, Texas|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
The formation of the Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención officially happened in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artandartcollection.com/en/artists/maldonado-tomas/|title=Art &amp; Art  MALDONADO Tomás|website=www.artandartcollection.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of this organization were primarily [[Tomás Maldonado|Tómas Maldonado]], [[Lidy Prati]], [[Alfredo Hlito]], [[Raúl Lozza]], [[Enio Iommi|Enio Lommi]], [[Manuel Espinosa|Manuel Espinoza]], and [[Juan Melé]]. The creation of the AACI happened because of a difference in artistic beliefs. Maldonado and Prati were married during this time period, despite being in the same artistic group and movement. In 1944, Maldonado, [[Rhod Rothfuss]], [[Gyula Kosice]], Lidy Prati, and [[Carmelo Arden Quin]] produced the first and only issue of the illustrated magazine ''Arturo''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Concrete-Invention|title=Concrete Invention {{!}} art group|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of ''Arturo'' was the beginning of a distinct revolutionary period in Argentinian art. The magazine expressed the founders' shared opposition of representational and symbolic art. However, from the magazine, two artistic groups emerged. [[Grupo Madí|Grupo Madi]], led by [[Arden Quin]], Kosice, and Rothfuss. And Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención led by Maldonado and Prati.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Influences ==
The first influence that happened upon the world of Latin American art regarding [[Concrete art|Concrete Art]] came from the works of [[Joaquín Torres-García|Joaquín Torres-Garcia]]. In 1936, Torres-Garcia had already referred to invention, speaking about those movements that put new art styles to use, such as Impressionism or Cubism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cvaa.com.ar/04ingles/02dossiers_en/concretos_en/04_historia_3_en.php|title=Concrete Art in Argentina. History 3|website=cvaa.com.ar|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Torres-Garcia, came the entirety of the Concrete art movement. Maldonado had a noticeable impact on the AACI because of his restraints he put on the artists and artworks. His political views seemed to influence his views on artwork. Maldonado was a [[Marxism|Marxist]] who had certain utopian ambitions for the art created by the AACI in a new revolutionary societal movement in Latin America. The political views demonstrated by AACI members were often communistic and somewhat socialistic as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/asociacion-arte-concreto-invencion-concrete-invention-art-association|title=Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención (Concrete-Invention Art Association) – Art Term {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; While simultaneously following the purist aesthetics of artists such as [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Theo van Doesburg]]. The art group rapidly began making waves among the art world and by 1946, Prati and Maldonado had attracted the interest of one of the original practicing concrete artists in Switzerland, [[Max Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Argentine Abstract Art|last=Battiti|first=Florencia|publisher=Fundacion Proa|year=2002|isbn=|location=Buenos Aires|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arturo Magazine ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;The aforementioned magazine was the first work by the members of the AACI before they were officially together as a group. The concepts “invention” and “trimmed frame” are used to portray the movement of Concrete Art.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These terms originated with the issuing of the Arturo magazine, and are perhaps the most original contributions to the Concrete Art movement. Arden Quin discussed about invention in ''Arturo’s'' first article. He rose against Expressionism, Surrealism, and any form of Realism in his works.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is a common theme among the group and among concrete artists as a whole. Regarding the appearance of Arturo, Ana J. Pozzi-Harris writes, "In the Argentina of the early 1940s, no artist or movement held truly comparable ideas to those exposed in Arturo or in the early exhibitions of the Concrete and Madí artists. Exhibition reviews show that the most successful Argentine artists from this period worked in styles which may be categorized as classical and academic; picturesque and romantic; and expressionist."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For a description of the magazine, the cover was an engraving by Tomás Maldonado and in the inner pages were seen several pieces by this artist and by Lidy Prati as well. There also were essays and poems by Edgard Bailey, Gyula Kosice, Torres-García, [[Vicente Huidobro]] and [[Murilo Mendes]], and projects reproduced by [[Maria Helena Vieira da Silva|Vieira Da Silva]], Torres-García, [[Augusto Torres]], Kandinsky, Mondrian and Rothfuss.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An important influence that can be seen in the magazine is from the Dutch artist Theo Van Doesburg. He formulated in “''Basis of the Concrete painting''”, in Paris, April 1930.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Van Doesburg described concrete art by stating,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"1) Art is universal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2) The work of art must be conceived and entirely shaped by the spirit before its execution. It must not receive anything from the given shapes of nature, neither from sensuality, nor from sentimentality. We want to exclude lyricism, drama, symbolism, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3) The picture must be entirely built with purely plastic elements, that is to say, planes and colors. A pictorial element has no other significance but that of “itself”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;4) The construction of the picture, as well as that of its elements, must be simple and visually controllable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;5) The technique must be mechanical, that is to say, exact, anti-impressionist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;6) Endeavor for absolute clearness.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These guidelines for Concrete Art truly united all of the contributor's when creating their artworks for Arturo. Their similar beliefs led to a criticism of all art that could be interpreted, the AACI wanted to have their works be viewed with simplicity and with no forms of interpretation.

== Madí and the AACI ==
From the publication of ''Arturo'', two similar Argentinian artistic groups emerged. These aforementioned groups both believed in the artistic style of Concrete art, however, their perspectives of this type of artwork differed. The Madí’s members worked in various ways; they often distributed small posters and pamphlets in the streets of Buenos Aires. They also published the magazine ''Arte Madí Universal'' from 1947 to 1954 and organized art showings that mixed types visual art, poetry, music, and performance to create an encapsulating Concrete Art experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their art emphasized materials and the reality of these materials, often changing the conventional frame for strangely shaped canvases and frames to encapsulate their works. In 1946, both groups publicly announced their separations and different agendas through their manifestos. For the AACI, Maldonado read the "Manifiesto Invencionista" (Inventionist Manifesto) in March 1946 at their first exhibition in the Salón Peuser. The Madí read their Manifiesto Madí (Madí Manifesto) altogether at the Instituto Francés de Estudios Superiores in August 1946.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most of the art created by both groups was during the rule of the infamous Argentinian president [[Juan Perón|Juan Domingo Perón]]. Perón was a former Colonel in the Argentine army whom assumed the power of [[President of Argentina]] in February 1946. Perón's extremely authoritarian rule many called "Fascist" used means of mass propaganda, mass appeal, and outright oppressive measures to remain in control of Argentina until 1955. Scholars suggest the political climate of the Peronian era had a direct influence on both the AACI and the Madí.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-02|title=Juan Perón|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Juan_Per%C3%B3n&amp;oldid=813135657|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties attempted to use their Communist influence to combat the Perón agenda.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Selected Artworks ==
'''''Serial Composition'':''' A piece made by [[Lidy Prati]], done in 1948, and held in the Latin American Art Museum of Buenos Aires. The Dutch artist [[Piet Mondrian]] is historically found to be a crucial influence on the art of Prati and connections are often made about this piece and his works. This artwork shows a theme of systematic geometric abstraction which can be interpreted through the various red, white, and black rectangles or squares spaced equally far apart from one another in a grid format. This style of equidistant geometric shapes was often seen from various artists in the AACI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/lidy-prati-made-1970s-art-1948-472988|title=Lidy Prati Made 1970s Art ... in 1948 {{!}} artnet News|date=2016-04-14|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Coplanar Nº13'':''' An artwork made by [[Juan Melé]] in 1946 that consists of three different shapes made of wood, colored with oil paint and connected by a metal rod behind each of the shapes. The style used makes an appearance to the viewer that the geometric objects float in front of the wall behind them. Melé often experimented with various frames, backgrounds, and colors. His distinct artistic format is easily recognizable in this piece. ''Coplanar Nº13'' simultaneously shows the core values of the AACI in its universality and lacking of any symbolism or representational effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artandartcollection.com/en/artists/mele-juan/|title=Art &amp; Art  MELÉ Juan|website=www.artandartcollection.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Composition'':''' This oil on canvas painting by [[Tomás Maldonado|Tómas Maldonado]] depicts multiple colored and black lines of different width meeting near the center of the piece to form a rectangular shape. This piece was created in 1950 and is currently being held in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Argentina. Regarding the painting, author María Amalia Garcia describes, "''Composición'' is based on neo-plastic postulates that seek to exalt the white surface by way of tension generated between different elements inscribed on that support."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellasartes.gob.ar/en/the-collection-highlights/7165|title=Composition (Composición) - Maldonado, Tomás|last=NSNC|first=grupo|website=www.bellasartes.gob.ar|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Development of a Triangle'':''' Another oil on canvas painting by Maldonado that exhibits different sized triangles along with several intersecting black lines coming down the canvas. It is currently being held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The piece demonstrates geometric abstraction and follows the strict regiments of any artwork that is considered to be related to the AACI.

{{aquatic layer topics}}
A '''chemocline''' is a [[Cline (hydrology)|cline]] caused by a strong, vertical [[chemistry]] gradient within a body of [[water]]. A chemocline is analogous to a [[thermocline]], the border at which warmer and cooler waters meet in an ocean, sea, lake, or other body of water. (In some cases, the thermocline and chemocline coincide.)

Chemoclines most commonly occur where local conditions favor the formations of anoxic bottom water &amp;mdash; deep water deficient in [[oxygen]], where only [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] forms of life can exist. The [[Black Sea]] is the classic example of such a body, though similar bodies of water (classified as [[meromictic]] lakes) exist across the globe. [[Aerobic organism|Aerobic]] life is restricted to the region above the chemocline, anaerobic below. Photosynthetic forms of anaerobic [[bacteria]], like green phototrophic and [[purple sulfur bacteria]], cluster at the chemocline, taking advantage of both the sunlight from above and the [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) produced by the anaerobic bacteria below.

In any body of water in which oxygen-rich surface waters are well-mixed ([[holomictic]]), no chemocline will exist. To cite the most obvious example, the Earth's global ocean has no chemocline.

==Types of clines==
* [[Thermocline]] - A cline based on difference in water [[temperature]]
* [[Halocline]]  - A cline based on difference in water [[salinity]]
* [[Pycnocline]] - A cline based on difference in water [[density]]

[[File:P. Chester Beatty I, folio 13-14, recto.jpg|thumb|300px|P. Chester Beatty I, (P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;) folio 13-14, containing portion of the Gospel of Luke]]

The '''Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri''' or simply the '''Chester Beatty Papyri''' are a group of early [[papyrus]] [[Biblical manuscript|manuscripts of biblical texts]]. The manuscripts are in Greek and are of Christian origin. There are eleven manuscripts in the group, seven consisting of portions of Old Testament books, three consisting of portions of the New Testament (Gregory-Aland no. [[Papyrus 45|P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Papyrus 46|P&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;]], and [[Papyrus 47|P&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;]]), and one consisting of portions of the [[Book of Enoch]] and an unidentified Christian homily. Most are dated to the 3rd century. They are housed in part at the [[Chester Beatty Library]] in Dublin, Ireland, and in part at the [[University of Michigan]], among a few other locations.

The papyri were most likely first obtained by dealers in [[illegal antiquities]]. Because of this, the exact circumstances of the find are not clear. One account is that the manuscripts were in jars in a Coptic graveyard near the ruins of the ancient city of [[Atfih|Aphroditopolis]]. Other theories have proposed that the collection was found near [[Al Fayyum|the Fayum]] instead of Aphroditopolis, or that the location was a Christian church or monastery instead of a graveyard. Most of the papyri were bought from a dealer by [[Alfred Chester Beatty]], after whom the manuscripts are named, although some leaves and fragments were acquired by the [[University of Michigan]] and a few other collectors and institutions.

The papyri were first announced on November 19, 1931, although more leaves were acquired over the next decade. [[Frederic G. Kenyon]] published the manuscripts in ''The Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri: Descriptions and Texts of Twelve Manuscripts on Papyrus of the Greek Bible'', in an 8-volume work that spanned 1933-58. The papyri are usually cataloged as ''P. Chester Beatty'' followed by a corresponding Roman numeral between I-XII, one for each manuscript.

The term '''"Chester Beatty Papyri"''' can also generally refer to the collection of manuscripts that Alfred Chester Beatty acquired over his lifetime, which include non-Biblical papyri such as the [[Chester Beatty Medical Papyrus]].

== Character of the collection ==

All of the manuscripts are [[codex|codices]], which was surprising to the first scholars who examined the texts because it was believed that the papyrus codex was not extensively used by Christians until the 4th century. Most of the manuscripts dated to the 3rd century, with some as early as the 2nd. The manuscripts also helped scholars understand the construction of papyrus codices. There is significant variation between the construction of each manuscript. Page size ranges from about 14 by 24.2&amp;nbsp;cm (P. III) to 18 by 33&amp;nbsp;cm (P. VI). Some of the manuscripts were constructed of a single gathering (quire) of papyrus sheets (Pap. II, VII, IX + X), while in others the gathering varies from a single sheet (I) to five (V) or seven (VII). The largest codex (P. IX/X) is believed to have contained roughly 236 pages.

The manuscripts employ ''[[nomina sacra]]''. One notable example is in P. VI which contains portions of the Old Testament. The name Joshua which relates linguistically to Jesus was considered a sacred name and abbreviated as such.

Since all but two (P. XI, XII) of the eleven manuscripts are dated before the 4th century, they present significant [[textual criticism|textual]] evidence for the Greek Bible as it existed in Egypt prior to the Diocletianic persecutions where Christian books are said to have been destroyed and a century or more earlier than the [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. Although some of the scholars who first studied the collection considered some of the New Testament manuscripts, especially ''P. Chester Beatty'' I (P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;) to be of the [[Caesarean text-type]], this has little support today. The textual character is generally described as being eclectic, mixed, or unaligned. The manuscripts provided many new textual variations, especially because the Old Testament manuscripts predated the revision activity of [[Lucian]] and [[Origen]] and others, and the New Testament manuscripts are some of the earliest yet quite extensive examples of the corresponding books.

== Old Testament manuscripts ==

Originally, there were believed to be eight manuscripts in the Chester Beatty collection that contained portions of the Old Testament. However, what was believed to be two different manuscripts actually belonged to the same codex, resulting in a total of seven Old Testament manuscripts in the collection, all following the text of the [[Septuagint]].

* P. IV and V – Two manuscripts that contain portions of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], one dated to the late 3rd century, and one the early 4th century. These manuscripts are significant because the next oldest Greek Old Testament texts of Vaticanus and Sinaiticus have extensive [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in Genesis.
* P. VI – A manuscript of the [[Book of Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]], consisting of around 50 partial leaves out of 108 and many very small fragments, dated to the first half of the 2nd century. It is the earliest manuscript in the collection, but is predated by two other less extensive Greek papyri manuscripts of these books, [[Papyrus Fouad 266|''P. Fouad'' 266]] and ''[[Papyrus Rylands 458|P. Rylands 458]]''.
* P. VII – A manuscript of the [[Book of Isaiah]], heavily deteriorated, with Coptic (Old Fayumic) marginal notes, dated to the 3rd century. 
* P. VIII – Two fragmentary leaves from the [[Book of Jeremiah]], ''c.'' 200
* P. IX/X – A manuscript of the Books of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], and [[Book of Esther|Esther]], dated to the 3rd century. What remains is 50 out of an original 118 leaves, 29 of which are in the Chester Beatty Library (8 of Ezekiel, 8 of Esther, and 13 of Daniel), and another 21 (of Ezekiel) are in the [[Harvey S. Firestone Memorial Library|Princeton University Library]]. The bottom portions of the leaves are missing. Nonetheless, all parts of the manuscript are the most substantial, early examples of the corresponding books of the Bible. Ezekiel is written in a different handwriting than the other two books. Daniel was originally counted as P. X, because it was mistakenly thought to be a separate manuscript. It was later decided that all three books belong to a single codex. Daniel contains some significant variations regarding the order and omission of certain parts of the text (chapters 7-8 come before 5-6, and parts of chapters 4 and 5 are missing). 
* P. XI – Two fragmentary leaves from [[Ecclesiastes]], dated to the 4th century.

== New Testament manuscripts ==
{{main|Papyrus 45|Papyrus 46}}
[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|A folio from P46 containing 2 Corinthians 11:33-12:9]]

There are three New Testament manuscripts that are part of the Chester Beatty Papyri. The first, P. I, is labeled under the Gregory-Aland numbering system as [[Papyrus 45|P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;]] and was originally a codex of 110 leaves that contained the four canonical gospels and Acts. 30 fragmentary leaves remain, consisting of two small leaves of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] chapters 20/21 and 25/26, portions of the [[Gospel of Mark]] chapters 4-9, 11-12, portions of the [[Gospel of Luke]] 6-7, 9-14, portions of the [[Gospel of John]] 4-5, 10-11, and portion of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 4-17. The ordering of the gospels follows the Western tradition, Matthew, John, Luke, Mark, Acts. These fragments are [[Palaeography|palaeographically]] dated to the first half of the 3rd century.

[[Papyrus 46|P&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;]] is the second New Testament manuscript in the Chester Beatty collection (P. II), and was a codex that contained the [[Pauline Epistles]] dating ''c.'' 200.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} What remains today of the manuscript is roughly 85 out of 104 leaves consisting of Romans chapters 5-6, 8-15, all of Hebrews, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, virtually all of 1–2 Corinthians and 1 Thessalonians 1-2, 5. The leaves have partially deteriorated, resulting in the loss of some lines at the bottom of each folio. The manuscript split up between the [[Chester Beatty Library]] and the [[University of Michigan]]. Scholars do not believe the [[Pastoral epistles]] were included originally in the codex, based on the amount of space required in the missing leaves; they conclude 2 Thessalonians would have occupied the final portion of the codex. The inclusion of Hebrews, a book that was questioned canonically and not considered [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|authored by Paul]], is notable. The placement of it following Romans is unique against most other witnesses, as is the ordering of Galatians following Ephesians.

P. III is the last New Testament manuscript, P&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;, and contains 10 leaves from the [[Book of Revelation]], chapters 9-17. This manuscript also dates to the 3rd century, and Kenyon describes the handwriting as being rough.

== Apocrypha manuscript ==

The last manuscript in the Chester Beatty Papyri, XII, contains chapters 97-107 of the [[Book of Enoch]] and portions of an unknown Christian homily attributed to [[Melito of Sardis]]. The manuscript is placed in the 4th century. The Book of Enoch is listed as "The Epistle of Enoch" in the manuscript. Chapters 105 and 108 are not included, and scholars believe they were later additions. XII is the only Greek witness to certain parts of Enoch. As for the homily, XII was the only known copy of the text at the time of its discovery. Two manuscripts which contain the text, ''[[Bodmer Papyri|P. Bodmer]]'' XIII and ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|P. Oxy.]]'' 1600, have since been found. The manuscript also contains the only manuscript witness to the [[Apocryphon of Ezekiel]], although it is cited by [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Paedagogus'' I. ix. 84.2–4). Overall, the handwriting is rough and most likely from a scribe who did not know Greek well. Campbell Bonner of the University of Michigan published this manuscript in his 1937 ''The Last Chapters of Enoch in Greek'' and 1940 ''The Homily on the Passion by Melito Bishop of Sardis''. {{clear}}

== Land use and greenhouse gases ==

Most of the excess [[greenhouse gas]]es causing [[climate change]] have come from burning [[fossil fuel]]. But a special report from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) estimated that in the last 150 years fossil fuels and [[Cement#CO2 emissions|cement production]] were responsible for only about two-thirds of climate change: the other third has been caused by human [[land use]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report) |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9780521800839 |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=0 |first1=Robert T. |last1=Watson |first2=Ian R. |last2=Noble |first3=Bert |last3=Bolin |first4=N. H. |last4=Ravindranath |first5=David J. |last5=Verardo |first6=David J. |last6=Dokken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main greenhouse gases produced by [[unsustainable]] land use are [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and [[nitrous oxide]].&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitigating Climate Change through Food and Land Use"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mitigating Climate Change through Food and Land Use |date=2009 |publisher=Worldwatch Institute |location=Washington, United States of America |isbn=9781878071910 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/179%20Land%20Use.pdf |first1=Sara J. |last1=Scherr |first2=Sajal |last2=Sthapit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Black carbon]] or [[soot]] can also be caused by unsustainable land use, and, although not a gas, can behave like greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change.&lt;ref name="Ullstein editor 2011"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Ullstein  |editor-first=Bart |title=Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone:  Summary for Decision-Makers |date=2011 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organisation |isbn=978-92-807-3142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bond 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=T.

=== Carbon dioxide ===

[[Carbon dioxide]], {{CO2}}, is a natural part of the [[carbon cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more, especially from [[habitat destruction]] and the [[Tillage|cultivation]] of [[soil]]. When [[woodland]]s, [[wetland]]s, and other natural [[habitat]]s are turned into [[pasture]], [[Arable land|arable fields]], buildings and roads, the [[Soil carbon|carbon held in the soil]] and vegetation becomes extra carbon dioxide and [[methane]] to trap more heat in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report) |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9780521800839 |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=0 |first1=Robert T. |last1=Watson |first2=Ian R. |last2=Noble |first3=Bert |last3=Bolin |first4=N. H. |last4=Ravindranath |first5=David J. |last5=Verardo |first6=David J. |last6=Dokken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gardener]]s may cause extra carbon dioxide to be added to the atmosphere in several ways:

* Using [[peat]] or [[potting compost]] containing peat;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Royal Horticultural Society |title=Peat and the Gardener: Conservation and Environment Guidelines |date=2009 |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society, Wisley, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |title=Towards Sustainable Growing Media: Chairman's Report and Roadmap |date=2013 |publisher=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), London |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/221019/pb13867-towards-sustainable-growing-media.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=John |title=How to Create an Eco Garden: The Practical Guide to Greener, Planet-Friendly Gardening |date=2011 |publisher=Aquamarine |location=Wigston, Leicester |isbn=978-1903141892}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Buying [[garden furniture]] or other [[wood]]en products made from woodland which has been destroyed rather than taken as a [[Renewable resource|renewable crop]] from [[Sustainable land management|sustainably managed]] woodland;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;
* Digging soil and leaving it bare so that the carbon in soil organic matter is [[Oxidation|oxidised]];&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
* Using [[power tool]]s which burn [[fossil fuel]] or [[electricity]] generated by burning fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunningham |first=Sally |title=Ecological Gardening |date=2009 |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Marlborough |isbn=978 1 84797 125 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using [[patio heater]]s;
* Heating [[greenhouse]]s by burning fossil fuel or electricity generated by burning fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
* Burning [[Pruning|garden pruning]]s and [[weed]]s on a [[bonfire]];
* Buying [[tools]], [[pesticide]]s, [[Fertilizer|synthetic nitrogen fertilizers]] (over 2 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent is produced in the manufacture of each kilogram of ammonium nitrate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sam |last1=Wood |first2=Annette  |last2=Cowie |title=A Review of Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors for Fertiliser Production |date=2004 |publisher=IEA Bioenergy}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and other materials which have been manufactured using fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Julian Allwood and Jonathan Cullen 'Sustainable Materials - with both eyes open'"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sustainable Materials - with both eyes open |date=2011 |publisher=UIT |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781906860059 |url=http://www.withbotheyesopen.com/ |first1=Julian |last1=Allwood |first2=Jonathan |last2=Cullen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammond |first=G.

* Heating and treating [[swimming pool]]s by burning fossil fuel or electricity generated by burning fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;
* [[Irrigation|Watering]] their gardens with [[tapwater]], which has been treated and pumped by burning fossil fuel, with a greenhouse gas impact of about 1&amp;nbsp;kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; water.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Livesley 2010 273–293"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Livesley |first=S. |first2=B. |last2=Dougherty |first3=A. |last3=Smith |first4=D. |last4=Navaud |first5=L. |last5=Wylie |first6=S. |last6=Arndt |title=Soil-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in urban garden systems: impact of irrigation, fertilizer and mulch |journal=Urban Ecosystems |date=2010 |volume=13 |pages=273–293 |doi=10.1007/s11252-009-0119-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantifying the energy and carbon effects of water saving full technical report |date=2009 |publisher=Environment Agency and Energy Saving Trust |url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Publications2/Housing-professionals/Heating-systems/Quantifying-the-energy-and-carbon-effects-of-water-saving-full-technical-report |first1=Alan |last1=Clarke |first2=Nick |last2=Grant |first3=Judith |last3=Thornton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardeners will also be responsible for extra carbon dioxide when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by fossil fuel.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;

=== Methane ===
[[Methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is a natural part of the [[carbon cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more, especially from [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] [[soil]], artificial [[wetland]]s such as [[Rice#Environmental impacts|rice fields]], and from the [[Digestion|guts]] of [[livestock|farm animals]], especially [[ruminant]]s such as [[cattle]] and [[sheep]].&lt;ref name="Dave Reay 2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=Methane and Climate Change |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan |location=London |isbn=978-1844078233 |first1=Dave |last1=Reay |first2=Pete |last2=Smith |first3=Andre |last3=van Amstel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gardener]]s may cause extra methane to be added to the atmosphere in several ways:

* [[Soil compaction|Compacting]] soil so that it becomes anaerobic, for example by treading on soil when it is wet;
* Allowing [[compost]] heaps to become compacted and anaerobic;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Kopinska |author2=Jane Griffiths |author3=Heather Jackson |author4=Pauline Pears |title=The Garden Organic Book of Compost|date=2011|publisher=New Holland|location=London|isbn=9781847734372}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Creating homemade liquid feed by putting the leaves of plants such as [[Comfrey#Fertilizer uses|comfrey under water]], with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they [[Decomposition|decay]];
* Killing pernicious [[weed]]s by covering them with water, with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they decay;
* Allowing [[pond]]s to become anaerobic, for example by adding unsuitable [[fish]] species which stir up sediment that then blocks light from and kills [[Water aeration#Natural aeration|submerged oxygenating plants]].&lt;ref name="Creating a Garden Pond for Wildlife"&gt;{{cite book |title=Creating a Garden Pond for Wildlife |date=2011 |publisher=Freshwater Habitats Trust |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-9537971-2-7 |author=Pond Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nitrous oxide ===

[[Nitrous oxide]], N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is a natural part of the [[nitrogen cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith (editor) |first=Keith |title=Nitrous Oxide and Climate Change |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan |location=London |isbn=978-1844077571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The nitrogen cycle and its influence on the European greenhouse gas balance |date=2011 |publisher=Centre for Ecology and Hydrology |isbn=978-1-906698-21-8 |first1=Mark |last1=Sutton |first2=Stefan |last2=Reis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardeners may cause extra nitrous oxide to be added to the atmosphere by:

* Using synthetic nitrogen [[fertilizer]], for example "weed and feed" on [[lawn]]s, especially if it is applied when plants are not actively growing, the soil is compacted, or when other factors are limiting so that the plants cannot make use of the nitrogen;&lt;ref name="Livesley 2010 273–293"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on: soil management (Fact Sheet 20) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS20_REV_Nov09%20%28final%29.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 21"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on: nutrient management (Fact Sheet 21) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS21_REVOCT09WEB.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compacting the soil (for example by working in the garden when the soil is wet) which will increase the conversion of [[Nitrate#Uses|nitrates]] to nitrous oxide by soil bacteria;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"/&gt;
* Burning garden waste on [[bonfire]]s.

=== Black carbon ===

Black carbon is not a gas, but it acts like a greenhouse gas because it can be [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in the atmosphere and absorb [[Thermal energy|heat]].&lt;ref name="Ullstein editor 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bond 2013"/&gt;

Gardeners may cause extra black carbon to be added to the atmosphere by burning garden [[pruning]]s and [[weed]]s on bonfires, especially if the waste is wet and becomes black carbon in the form of soot.&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt; Gardeners will also be responsible for extra black carbon produced when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by [[fossil fuel]] especially the [[Diesel exhaust|diesel]] used in most lorries.

== Gardening to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and absorb carbon dioxide ==

There are many ways in which climate-friendly gardeners may reduce their contribution to climate change and help their gardens absorb [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gardening in the Global Greenhouse: The impacts of climate change on gardens in the UK |date=2002 |publisher=UK Climate Impacts Programme |location=Oxford |citeseerx = 10.1.1.131.6205 |first1=Richard |last1=Bisgrove |first2=Paul |last2=Hadley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners can find good ideas in many other [[Sustainability|sustainable]] approaches:
* [[Agroforestry]];
* [[Forest gardening]];
* [[Orchard]]s;
* [[Organic gardening]];
* [[Permaculture]];
* [[Rain garden]];
* [[Vegan organic gardening]];
* [[Water-wise gardening]];
* [[Wildlife garden]].

== Protecting and enhancing carbon stores ==

=== Protecting carbon stores in land beyond gardens ===

[[File:Waterbutt in kitchen garden at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent.JPG|thumb|Kitchen garden at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent, showing greenhouse, waterbutt, box hedging and vegetable beds.]]
[[File:Alliums in dry garden at Cambridge Botanic Garden.JPG|thumb|Alliums, lavender, box and other water-thrifty plants in the dry garden at Cambridge Botanic Garden]]

Climate-friendly gardening includes actions which protect [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] beyond gardens. The biggest carbon stores in land are in soil; the two habitat types with the biggest carbon stores per hectare are [[Woodland|woods]] and [[wetland]]s; and woods absorb more carbon dioxide per hectare per year than most other habitats. Climate-friendly gardeners therefore aim to ensure that nothing they do will harm these habitats.

According to Morison and Morecroft&amp;nbsp;(eds.)'s ''Plant Growth and Climate Change'',&lt;ref name="Plant Growth and Climate Change"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plant Growth and Climate Change |date=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=978-14051-3192-6 |first1=James I. L. |last1=Morison |first2=Michael D. |last2=Morecroft}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[net primary productivity]] (the net amount of carbon absorbed each year) of various habitats &lt;!--not encyclopedic: (they don't give a figure for wetlands)--&gt; is:

* [[Tropical forest]]s: 12.5 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Temperate forest]]s: 7.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Grassland|Temperate grassland]]s: 3.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Cropland]]s: 3.1 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s Special Report ''[[Land use, land-use change, and forestry]]''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt; lists the carbon contained in different global habitats as:

* Wetlands: 643 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 43 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 686 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Tropical forests: 123 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 120 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 243 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Temperate forests: 96 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 57 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 153 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Temperate grasslands: 164 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 7 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 171 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Croplands: 80 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 2 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 82 tonnes carbon per hectare.

The figures quoted above are global averages. More recent research in 2009 has found that the habitat with the world's highest known total carbon density&amp;nbsp;- 1,867 tonnes of carbon per hectare&amp;nbsp;- is temperate moist forest of [[Eucalyptus regnans]] in the Central Highlands of south-east [[Australia]]; and, in general, that temperate forests contain more carbon than either [[boreal forest]]s or tropical forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keith |first1=Heather |first2=Brendan G. |last2=Mackey |first3=David B. |last3=Lindenmaye |title=Re-evaluation of forest biomass carbon stocks and lessons from the world's most carbon-dense forests |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=2009 |volume=106 |issue=28|doi=
10.1073/pnas.0901970106 |pages=11635–11640 |pmid=19553199 |pmc=2701447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon stores in Britain===
According to Milne and Brown's 1997 paper "Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain",&lt;ref name="Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milne |first1=R. |first2=T. A. |last2=Brown |title=Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |date=1997 |volume=49 |pages=413–433 |doi=10.1006/jema.1995.0118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s [[vegetation]] and soil are estimated to contain 9952 million tonnes of carbon, of which almost all is in the soil, and most in [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[bog|peatland]] soil:

* Soils in Scotland: 6948 million tonnes carbon;
* Soils in [[England]] and [[Wales]]: 2890 million tonnes carbon;
* Vegetation in British [[woodland|woods]] and [[plantation]]s (which cover only 11% of Britain's land area): 91 million tonnes carbon;
* Other vegetation: 23 million tonnes carbon.

A 2005 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change and British Woodland |date=2005 |publisher=Forestry Commission |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-85538-658-4 |first1=Mark |last1=Broadmeadow |first2=Duncan |last2=Ray |url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcin069.pdf/$FILE/fcin069.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that British woodland soil may contain as much as 250 tonnes of carbon per hectare.

Many studies of [[soil carbon]] only study the carbon in the top 30 centimetres, but soil is often much deeper than that, especially below woodland. One 2009 study of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] by Keith Dyson and others gives figures for soil carbon down to 100&amp;nbsp;cm below the [[habitat]]s, including "Forestland", "Cropland" and "Grassland", covered by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] reporting requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dyson |first1=Keith |first2=A.

* Forestland soils: average figures in tonnes carbon per hectare are 160 (England), 428 (Scotland), 203 (Wales), and 366 ([[Northern Ireland]]).
* Grassland soils: average figures in tonnes carbon per hectare are 148 (England), 386 (Scotland), 171 (Wales), and 304 (Northern Ireland).
* Cropland soils: average figures in tonnes carbon per hectare are 110 (England), 159 (Scotland), 108 (Wales), and 222 (Northern Ireland).

Climate-friendly gardeners choose [[peat]]-free [[Potting compost|compost]]s&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; because some of the planet's biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] are in [[soil]], and especially in the [[Bog|peatland]] soil of [[wetland]]s.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s Special Report ''Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry'' gives a figure of 2011 gigatonnes of carbon for global carbon stocks in the top 1 metre of soils, much more than the carbon stores in the vegetation or the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners also avoid using [[tapwater]] not only because of the [[greenhouse gas]]es emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to treat and pump water,&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt; but because if water is taken from wetlands then carbon stores are more likely to be oxidised to [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;

A climate-friendly garden therefore does not contain large [[Irrigation|irrigated]] [[lawn]]s, but instead includes [[water-butt]]s to collect [[rain]]water; water-thrifty plants which survive on rainwater and do not need watering after they are established; [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[hedge]]s to [[Windbreak|shelter]] gardens from the drying effects of [[Sunlight|sun]] and [[wind]]; and [[groundcover]] plants and [[Mulch#Organic mulches|organic mulch]] to protect the soil and keep it moist.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;242&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;80–82&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardening Without Water"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gardening Without Water: Creating beautiful gardens using only rainwater |date=1999 |publisher=Search Press |location=Tunbridge Wells |isbn=0855328851 |first=Charlotte |last=Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners will ensure that any paved surfaces in their gardens (which are kept to a minimum to increase carbon stores) are [[Permeable paving|permeable]],&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and may also make [[rain garden]]s, sunken areas into which rainwater from buildings and paving is directed, so that the rain can then be fed back into [[groundwater]] rather than going into [[storm drain]]s. The plants in rain gardens must be able to grow in both dry and wet soils.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rain Gardens: Managing Water Sustainably in the Garden and Designed Landscape |date=2007 |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon, USA |isbn=978-0881928266 |first1=Nigel |last1=Dunnett |first2=Andy |last2=Clayden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protecting carbon stores in woodland===
Wetlands may store the most carbon in their soils, but woods store more carbon in their living [[biomass]] than any other type of vegetation, and their soils store the most carbon after wetlands.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt; Climate-friendly gardeners therefore ensure that any wooden products they buy, such as [[garden furniture]], have been made of wood from [[Sustainable forest management|sustainably managed]] woodland.

=== Protecting and increasing carbon stores in gardens ===
[[File:Juglans major at Cambridge Botanic Garden.jpg|thumb|Juglans elaeopyren, an American walnut, at Cambridge Botanic Garden]]

After [[Carbonate rocks|rocks containing carbonate compounds]], soil is the biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|store of carbon]] on land.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;
Carbon is found in [[soil organic matter]], including living organisms ([[Root|plant roots]], [[fungi]], [[animal]]s, [[protist]]s, [[bacteria]]), dead organisms, and [[humus]].&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
One study of the environmental benefits of gardens estimates that 86% of carbon stores in gardens is in the soil.&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=Ross W. F. |first2=Tijana |last2=Blanuša |first3=Jane E. |last3=Taylor |first4=Andrew |last4=Salisbury |first5=Andrew J. |last5=Halstead |first6=Béatrice |last6=Henricot |first7=Ken |last7=Thompson |title=The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure |journal=Urban Forestry &amp; Urban Greening |date=2012 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=129–137 |doi=10.1016/j.ufug.2012.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fragaria vesca, wild strawberry.JPG|thumb|Wild strawberries in flower below a British hedge.]]

The first priorities for climate-friendly gardeners are, therefore, to:
* Protect the soil's existing carbon stores;
* Increase the soil's carbon stores.

To protect the soil, climate-friendly gardens:
* Are based on [[plant]]s rather than buildings and paving;&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;
* Have soil that is kept at a relatively stable temperature by [[Windbreak|shelter]] from trees, shrubs and/or hedges;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Matthew |title=New Gardening: How to garden in a changing climate |date=2007 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley and the Royal Horticultural Society |location=London |isbn=9781845333058}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Have soil that is always kept covered and therefore moist and at a relatively stable temperature by [[groundcover]] plants, fast-growing [[green manure]]s (which can be used as an [[Intercropping|intercrop]] in [[kitchen garden]]s of [[Annual plant|annual]] vegetables) and/or [[Mulch#Organic mulches|organic mulches]].&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crawford |first=Martin |title=Creating a Forest Garden: Working with nature to grow edible crops |date=2010 |publisher=Green Books |location=Hartland, Devon |isbn=9781900322621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soil improvement and protection - wood chip mulch at Wisley.JPG|thumb|Mulch of woodchips protecting soil at the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley in Surrey.]]

Climate-friendly gardeners avoid things which may harm soil. They do not tread on the soil when it is wet, because it is then most vulnerable to compaction. They [[Tillage|dig]] as little is possible, and only when the soil is moist rather than wet, because cultivation increases the [[oxidation]] of soil organic matter and produces [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;54–55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2013 12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |title=Protecting our Water, Soil and Air: A Code of Good Agricultural Practice for farmers, growers and land managers |date=2013 |publisher=The Stationery Office |location=London |isbn=978 0 11 243284 5 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase soil carbon stores, climate-friendly gardeners ensure that their gardens create optimal conditions for vigorous healthy growth of plants, and other garden organisms above and below ground, and reduce the impact of any [[limiting factor]]s.

In general, the more [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] that the plants can create each year, the more carbon will be added to the soil.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;54–55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
However, only some biomass each year becomes long-term [[soil carbon]] or humus. In ''Soil Carbon and Organic Farming'', a 2009 report for the [[Soil Association]], Gundula Azeez discusses several [[Environmental factor|factor]]s which increase how much biomass is turned into humus. These include good [[soil structure]], [[Soil biology|soil organisms]] such as fine [[root hair]]s, [[microorganism]]s, [[mycorrhiza]]s and [[earthworm]]s which increase [[Soil#Structure|soil aggregation]], residues from plants (such as trees and shrubs) which have a high content of resistant chemicals such as [[lignin]], and plant residues with a [[carbon to nitrogen ratio]] lower than about 32:1.&lt;ref name="Soil Carbon and Organic Farming"&gt;{{cite book |last=Azeez |first=Gundula |title=Soil Carbon and Organic Farming: A review of the evidence on the relationship between agriculture and soil carbon sequestration, and how organic farming can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation |date=2009 |publisher=The Soil Association |location=Bristol |url=http://www.soilassociation.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=SSnOCMoqrXs%3D&amp;tabid=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soil fertility - nitrogen fixation by root nodules on Wistaria roots, with hazelnut to show size.JPG|thumb|Nitrogen-fixing nodules on Wisteria roots (hazelnut for scale)]]

Climate-friendly gardens therefore include:

* Hedges for shelter from wind;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* A light canopy of late-leafing [[deciduous]] trees to let in enough [[sunlight]] for growth but not so much that the garden becomes too hot and dry&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt; (this is one of the principles behind many [[agroforestry]] systems, such as [[Paulownia]]'s use in China partly because it is late-leafing and its [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] is sparse so that [[crop]]s below it get shelter but also enough light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Temperate Agroforestry Systems |date=1997 |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire |isbn=9780851991474 |author=Yungying Wu |author2=Zhaohua Zhu |pages=170–172 |editor1-first=Andrew M. |editor1-last=Gordon |editor2-first=Steven M. |editor2-last=Newman |chapter=Temperate Agroforestry in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;);
* Groundcover plants and organic mulches (such as [[woodchips]] over [[compost]] made from kitchen and garden "waste") to keep soil moist and at relatively stable temperatures;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|Nitrogen-fixing plants]], because soil nitrogen may be a limiting factor (but climate-friendly gardeners avoid [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|synthetic nitrogen fertilizers]], because these may cause mycorrhizal associations to break down);&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* Many layers&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt; of plants, including [[Lignin|woody]] plants such as trees&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and shrubs, other [[Perennial plant|perennials]], groundcover plants, deep-rooted plants, all chosen according to 'right plant, right place',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Nicola |title=Right Plant, Right Place |date=1986 |publisher=Pan |location=London |isbn=0 330 29656 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lancaster |first=Roy |title=Perfect Plant, Perfect Place |date=2010 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=London |isbn=978-1405348133}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they are suited to their growing conditions and will grow well;
* A wide [[biodiversity|diversity]] of [[Plant disease resistance|disease-resistant]], vigorous plants for [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and to make the most of all available [[ecological niche]]s;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* Plants to [[Wildlife garden|feed and shelter]] wildlife, to increase total biomass, and to ensure [[Biological pest control|biological control]] of pests and diseases.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden 54-55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=John|title=How to Create an Eco Garden: The Practical Guide to Greener, Planet-Friendly Gardening|date=2011|publisher=Anness Publishing|location=Wigston, Leicestershire|isbn=9781903141892|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening" /&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Make a Wildlife Garden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baines|first=Chris|title=How to Make a Wildlife Garden|date=2000|publisher=Frances Lincoln|location=London|isbn=9780711217119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compost made from garden and kitchen "waste".&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;

Lawns, like other grasslands, can build up good levels of [[soil carbon]],&lt;ref name="Soil Carbon and Organic Farming"/&gt; but they will grow more vigorously and store more carbon if besides [[Lawn#Grasses|grasses]] they also contain nitrogen-fixing plants such as [[clover]],&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt; and if they are cut using a [[Lawn mower#Other notable types|mulching mower]] which returns finely-chopped mowings to the lawn. More carbon, however, may be stored by other perennial plants such as trees&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and shrubs. They also do not need to be maintained using [[power tool]]s.

Climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to increase biodiversity not only for the sake of the wildlife itself, but so that the garden ecosystem is resilient and more likely to store as much carbon as possible as long as possible. They will therefore avoid pesticides,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and increase the diversity of the habitats within their gardens.

== Reducing greenhouse gas emissions ==
Climate-friendly gardeners can directly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from their own gardens, but can also use their gardens to indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere.

=== Using gardens to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ===

Climate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce [[greenhouse gas]]es elsewhere, for example by using the [[sunlight|sun]] and [[wind]] to dry [[Laundry|washing]] on [[Clothes line|washing lines]] in the garden instead of using [[electricity]] [[Electricity generation|generated]] by [[fossil fuel]] to dry washing in [[Clothes dryer|tumble dryers]].

====From farmland====
[[File:Juglans regia, walnut, with ripening nuts.JPG|thumb|Walnut, Juglans regia, with ripening walnuts]]
Food is a major contributor to climate change. In the United Kingdom, according to Tara Garnett of the [http://www.fcrn.org.uk/ Food Food Climate Research Network], food contributes 19% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Cooking up a Storm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garnett |first=Tara |title=Cooking up a Storm: Food, greenhouse gas emissions and our changing climate |date=September 2008 |publisher=Food Climate Research Network, Centre for Environmental Strategy, University of Surrey |location=Guildford, Surrey |url=http://www.fcrn.org.uk/sites/default/files/CuaS_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil is the biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|store of carbon]] on [[land]]. It is therefore important to protect the [[soil organic matter]] in [[Agricultural land|farmland]]. Farm animals, however, especially free-range pigs, may cause erosion, and cultivation of the soil increases the [[oxidation]] of soil organic matter into [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2013 12"/&gt; Other sources of greenhouse gases from farmland include: compaction caused by farm machinery or overgrazing by [[Livestock|farm animals]] can make soil [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] and produce [[methane]]; farm animals produce methane; and [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|nitrogen fertilizer]]s can be converted to [[nitrous oxide]].

Most farmland consists of [[Arable land|fields growing annual arable crops]] which are eaten directly by people or fed to farm animals, and [[grassland]] used as [[pasture]], [[hay]] or [[silage]] to feed farm animals. Some [[Perennial crop|perennial food plants]] are also grown, such as [[fruit]]s and [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s in [[orchard]]s, and [[watercress]] grown in water.

Although all cultivation of the soil in arable fields produces carbon dioxide, some arable crops cause more damage to soil than others. [[List of root vegetables|Root crops]] such as [[potato]]es and [[sugar-beet]], and crops which are harvested not just once a year but over a long period such as [[Leaf vegetable|green vegetables and salads]], are considered "high risk" in [[catchment-sensitive farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |title=Soil Protection Review 2010 |date=2009 |publisher=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |location=London |pages=21–22 |url=http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/resources/000/145/513/PB13311.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 10"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Focus on arable crops (Fact Sheet 10) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS_REV_FS10_Arable%20crops.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners therefore grow at least some of their food,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and may choose [[Agriculture|food crops]] which therefore help to keep carbon in farmland [[soil]]s if they grow such high-risk crops in small [[Kitchen garden|vegetable plots]] in their gardens, where it is easier to protect the soil than in large fields under [[Commercial agriculture|commercial]] pressures. Climate-friendly gardeners may grow and eat plants such as sweet [[cicely]] which sweeten food, and so reduce the land area needed for sugar-beet.&lt;ref name="Plants for a Future"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fern |first=Ken |title=Plants for a Future: Edible and useful plants for a healthier world |date=1997 |publisher=Permanent Publications |location=Clanfield, Hampshire |isbn=9781856230117}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They may also choose to grow [[Perennial plant|perennial]] food plants to not only reduce their indirect greenhouse gas emissions from farmland, but also to increase carbon stores in their own gardens.&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plants for a Future"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=Robert |title=Forest Gardening |date=1991 |publisher=Green Books |location=Hartland, Devon |isbn=1870098447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toensmeier |first=E. |title=Perennial Vegetables |date=2007 |publisher=Chelsea Green |location=Vermont, United States of America |isbn=9781931498401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassland contains more carbon per hectare than arable fields, but farm animals, especially [[ruminant]]s such as [[cattle]] or [[sheep]], produce large amounts of [[methane]], directly and from manure heaps and slurry.&lt;ref name="Dave Reay 2010"/&gt; Slurry and manure may also produce nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 4"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change series: General ways to mitigate climate change (Fact Sheet 4) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS4_Mitigation_WEB_Oct%202008.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gardeners who want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions can help themselves to eat less [[meat]] and [[dairy produce]] by growing [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] trees which are a good source of [[Umami|tasty]], [[protein]]-rich [[food]], including [[walnut]]s which are an excellent source of the [[Omega-3|omega-3 fatty acid]] [[alpha-linolenic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyle |first=Susanna |title=Ultimate Fruit &amp; Nuts: A comprehensive guide to the cultivation, uses and health benefits of over 300 food-producing plants |date=2006 |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London |isbn=978-0-7112-2593-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers and farmers are investigating and improving ways of farming which are more sustainable, such as [[agroforestry]], [[forest farming]], [[Conservation agriculture|wildlife-friendly farming]], [[soil management]], [[catchment-sensitive farming]] (or water-friendly farming&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freshwater Habitats Trust |title=Water-Friendly Farming |url=http://www.freshwaterhabitats.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Water-Friendly-Farming-Introduction.pdf |website=Freshwater Habitats Trust |accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, the organisation [http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk Farming Futures] assists farmers in the United Kingdom to reduce their farms' greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 23"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on energy efficiency (Fact Sheet 23) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS23_Energy%20efficiency.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers are aware that consumers are increasingly asking for "green credentials". Gardeners who understand climate-friendly practices can advocate their use by farmers.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;

====From industry====
[[File:Elaeagnus umbellatus at the Agroforestry Research Trust forest garden.JPG|thumb|Nitrogen-fixing and edible - Elaeagnus umbellatus at the Agroforestry Research Trust forest garden in Devon]]
Climate-friendly gardeners aim to reduce their consumption in general.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; In particular, they try to avoid or reduce their consumption of tapwater because of the greenhouse gases emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to supply the energy needed to treat and pump it to them.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt; Instead, gardeners can garden using only rainwater.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardening Without Water"/&gt;

Greenhouse gases are produced in the [[Manufacturing|manufacture]] of many materials and products used by [[gardener]]s. For example, it takes a lot of [[Energy industry|energy]] to produce [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|synthetic fertilizer]]s, especially nitrogen fertilizers. [[Ammonium nitrate]], for example, has an [[embodied energy]] of 67000 kilojoules/kilogramme,&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt; so [[Sustainable living|climate-friendly]] gardeners will choose alternative ways of ensuring the soil in their gardens has optimal levels of nitrogen by alternative means such as [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing plants]].

Climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to follow "[[cradle-to-cradle design]]" and "[[circular economy]]" principles: when they choose to buy or make something, it should be possible to take it apart again and [[Recycling|recycle]] or [[compost]] every part, so that there is no waste, only [[Natural resource|raw materials]] to be made into something else.&lt;ref name="Cradle to Cradle: Re-making the Way We Make Things"&gt;{{cite book |last=Braungart and McDonough |first=Michael and William |title=Cradle to Cradle: Re-making the Way We Make Things |date=2009 |publisher=Vintage, Random House |location=London |isbn=9780099535478}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This will reduce the greenhouse gases otherwise produced when [[Natural resource#Extraction|extracting]] raw materials.

====From transport====
Gardeners can reduce not only their [[food miles]] by growing some of their own food, but also their "gardening miles" by reducing the amount of plants and other materials they import, obtaining them as locally as possible and with as little packaging as possible. This might include ordering plants by [[mail order]] from a specialist nursery if the plants are sent out [[Bare root|bare-root]], reducing transport demand and the use of [[peat]]-based composts; or growing plants from [[seed]], which will also increase [[genetic diversity]] and therefore [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]]; or growing plants [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]] from [[Cutting (plant)|cutting]]s or [[Offset (botany)|offset]]s from other local gardeners; or buying reclaimed materials from salvage firms.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;

====From houses====
[[File:Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Boston ivy, in autumn colours.JPG|thumb|Climbers as insulation - Boston ivy, Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Boston ivy, in autumn]]
Climate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce greenhouse gas emissions from homes by:

* Using sunlight and wind to dry washing on washing lines instead of fossil fuel-generated electricity to run [[Clothes dryer|tumble dryer]]s;
* Planting [[deciduous]] [[Vine|climber]]s on houses and planting deciduous trees at suitable distances from the house to provide shade during the summer, reducing the consumption of electricity for [[HVAC#Air conditioning|air conditioning]], but also such that at cooler times of year, sunlight can reach and warm a house, reducing [[HVAC#Heating|heating]] costs and consumption;&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;
* Planting hedges, trees, shrubs and climbers to shelter houses from wind, reducing heating costs and consumption during the winter (as long as any planting does not create a [[Wind tunnel|wind-tunnel]] effect).&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;243&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners may also choose to reduce their own personal greenhouse gas emissions by growing and eating [[carminative]] plants such as [[fennel]] and [[garlic]] which reduce intestinal gases such as methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Living Gut |date=2008 |publisher=Nottingham University Press |isbn=9781904761570 |first1=W. N. |last1=Ewing |first2=Lucy |last2=Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from gardens ===
[[File:Taxus baccata, yew, as internal hedge at Down House.JPG|thumb|Slow-growing yew, Taxus baccata, as hedge at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent]]
[[File:Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens, red and white clover within meadow.JPG|thumb|Nitrogen-fixing red and white clover (Trifolium) as lawn plants]]
[[File:Soil improvement - leaf cage, compost heap and wormery at Wisley.JPG|thumb|Leaf cage, compost heap and wormery at the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley]]

There are some patent sources of greenhouse gas emissions in gardens and some more latent.

[[Power tool]]s which are powered by [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] or [[petrol]], or [[electricity]] [[Electricity generation|generated]] by burning other [[fossil fuel]]s, emit [[carbon dioxide]]. Climate-friendly gardeners may therefore choose to use [[Garden tool|hand tool]]s rather than power tools, or power tools powered by renewable electricity,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; or [[Garden design|design their gardens]] to reduce or remove a need to use power tools. For example, they may choose dense, slow-growing species for [[hedge]]s so that the hedges only need to be cut once a year.&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"/&gt;

Lawns need[?] to be cut by lawn mowers and, in drier parts of the world, are often irrigated by tapwater. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore do what they can to reduce this consumption by:

* Replacing part of or all lawns with other perennial planting such as trees and shrubs with less ecologically demanding maintenance requirements;
* Cut some or all lawns only once or twice a year, i.e. convert them into [[meadow]]s;
* Make lawn shapes simple so that they may be cut quickly;
* Increase the cutting height of mower blades;
* Use a mulching mower to return organic matter to the soil;
* Sow [[clover]] to increase vigour (without the need for synthetic fertilisers) and resilience in dry periods;
* Cut lawns with [[Lawn mower#Electricity|electric mower]]s using electricity from [[renewable energy]];
* Cut lawns with hand tools such as [[Lawn mower#By hand|push mower]]s or [[scythe]]s.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;

Greenhouses can be used to grow crops which might otherwise be imported from warmer climates, but if they are heated by fossil fuel then they may cause more greenhouse gas emissions than they save. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore use their greenhouses carefully by:

* Choosing only annual plants which will only be in the greenhouse during warmer months, or perennial plants which do not need any extra heat during winter;
* Using water tanks as heat stores and compost heaps as heat sources inside greenhouses so that they stay frost-free in winter.

Climate-friendly gardeners will not put woody prunings on bonfires, which will emit carbon dioxide and black carbon,&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt; but instead burn them indoors in a [[wood-burning stove]] and therefore cut emissions from fossil fuel, or cut them up to use as [[mulch]] and increase soil carbon stores,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; or add the smaller prunings to compost heaps to keep them [[Aeration|aerated]], reducing [[methane emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Kopinska |author2=Jane Griffiths |author3=Heather Jackson |author4=Pauline Pears |title=The Garden Organic Book of Compost|date=2011|publisher=New Holland|location=London|isbn=9781847734372}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of fire, they will also choose fire-resistant plants from habitats which are not prone to [[wildfire]]s and which do not catch fire easily, rather than fire-adapted [[Wildfire#Plant adaptation|plants from fire-prone habitats]] which are flammable and adapted to encourage fires and then gain a competitive advantage over less resistant species.

Climate-friendly gardeners may use deep-rooted plants such as [[comfrey]] to bring nutrients closer to the surface topsoil, but will do so without making the leaves into a liquid feed, because the rotting leaves in the [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia|anaerobic]] conditions under water may emit methane.

[[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|Nitrogen fertilizer]]s may be [[Nitrous oxide#Soil|oxidised]] to [[nitrous oxide]],&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; especially if fertilizer is applied in excess, or when plants are not actively growing. Climate-friendly gardeners may choose instead to use [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing]] plants which will add nitrogen to the soil without increasing nitrous oxide emissions.

'''Computational phylogenetics''' is the application of computational [[algorithm]]s, methods, and programs to [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analyses. The goal is to assemble a [[phylogenetic tree]] representing a hypothesis about the evolutionary ancestry of a set of [[gene]]s, [[species]], or other [[taxa]]. For example, these techniques have been used to explore the family tree of [[hominid]] species&lt;ref name="Strait"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strait | first1 = DS | last2 = Grine | first2 = FE | year = 2004 | title = Inferring hominoid and early hominid phylogeny using craniodental characters: the role of fossil taxa | url = | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 47 | issue = 6| pages = 399–452 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.08.008 | pmid=15566946}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relationships between specific genes shared by many types of organisms.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodge | first1 = T | last2 = Cope | first2 = MJ | year = 2000 | title = A myosin family tree | url = | journal = J Cell Sci | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 3353–3354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional phylogenetics relies on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] data obtained by measuring and quantifying the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] properties of representative organisms, while the more recent field of molecular phylogenetics uses [[nucleotide]] sequences encoding genes or [[amino acid]] sequences encoding [[protein]]s as the basis for classification. Many forms of molecular phylogenetics are closely related to and make extensive use of [[sequence alignment]] in constructing and refining phylogenetic trees, which are used to classify the evolutionary relationships between homologous [[gene]]s represented in the [[genome]]s of divergent species. The phylogenetic trees constructed by computational methods are unlikely to perfectly reproduce the [[evolutionary tree]] that represents the historical relationships between the species being analyzed. The historical species tree may also differ from the historical tree of an individual homologous gene shared by those species.

==Types of phylogenetic trees and networks==
[[Phylogenetic tree]]s generated by computational phylogenetics can be either ''rooted'' or ''unrooted'' depending on the input data and the algorithm used. A rooted tree is a [[directed graph]] that explicitly identifies a [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA), usually an imputed sequence that is not represented in the input. Genetic distance measures can be used to plot a tree with the input sequences as [[leaf node]]s and their distances from the root proportional to their [[genetic distance]] from the hypothesized MRCA. Identification of a root usually requires the inclusion in the input data of at least one "outgroup" known to be only distantly related to the sequences of interest.

By contrast, unrooted trees plot the distances and relationships between input sequences without making assumptions regarding their descent. An unrooted tree can always be produced from a rooted tree, but a root cannot usually be placed on an unrooted tree without additional data on divergence rates, such as the assumption of the [[molecular clock]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name="mount"&gt;Mount DM. (2004). ''Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis'' 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of all possible phylogenetic trees for a given group of input sequences can be conceptualized as a discretely defined multidimensional "tree space" through which search paths can be traced by [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] algorithms. Although counting the total number of trees for a nontrivial number of input sequences can be complicated by variations in the definition of a tree topology, it is always true that there are more rooted than unrooted trees for a given number of inputs and choice of parameters.&lt;ref name="felsenstein"&gt;Felsenstein J. (2004). ''Inferring Phylogenies'' Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can be further generalized to rooted or unrooted [[phylogenetic network]]s, which allow for the modeling of evolutionary phenomena such as [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]].

==Coding characters and defining homology==
===Morphological analysis===
The basic problem in morphological phylogenetics is the assembly of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representing a mapping from each of the taxa being compared to representative measurements for each of the phenotypic characteristics being used as a classifier. The types of phenotypic data used to construct this matrix depend on the taxa being compared; for individual species, they may involve measurements of average body size, lengths or sizes of particular bones or other physical features, or even behavioral manifestations. Of course, since not every possible phenotypic characteristic could be measured and encoded for analysis, the selection of which features to measure is a major inherent obstacle to the method. The decision of which traits to use as a basis for the matrix necessarily represents a hypothesis about which traits of a species or higher taxon are evolutionarily relevant.&lt;ref name="Swiderski"&gt;Swiderski DL, Zelditch ML, Fink WL. (1998). Why morphometrics is not special: coding quantitative data for phylogenetic analysis. 47(3):508-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Morphological studies can be confounded by examples of [[convergent evolution]] of phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Gaubert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaubert | first1 = P | last2 = Wozencraft | first2 = WC | last3 = Cordeiro-Estrela | first3 = P | last4 = Veron | first4 = G | year = 2005 | title = Mosaics of convergences and noise in morphological phylogenies: what's in a viverrid-like carnivoran? | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 54 | issue = 6| pages = 865–894 | doi=10.1080/10635150500232769| pmid = 16282167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major challenge in constructing useful classes is the high likelihood of inter-taxon overlap in the distribution of the phenotype's variation. The inclusion of extinct taxa in morphological analysis is often difficult due to absence of or incomplete [[fossil]] records, but has been shown to have a significant effect on the trees produced; in one study only the inclusion of extinct species of [[ape]]s produced a morphologically derived tree that was consistent with that produced from molecular data.&lt;ref name="Strait" /&gt;

Some phenotypic classifications, particularly those used when analyzing very diverse groups of taxa, are discrete and unambiguous; classifying organisms as possessing or lacking a tail, for example, is straightforward in the majority of cases, as is counting features such as eyes or vertebrae. However, the most appropriate representation of continuously varying phenotypic measurements is a controversial problem without a general solution. A common method is simply to sort the measurements of interest into two or more classes, rendering continuous observed variation as discretely classifiable (e.g., all examples with humerus bones longer than a given cutoff are scored as members of one state, and all members whose humerus bones are shorter than the cutoff are scored as members of a second state). This results in an easily manipulated [[data set]] but has been criticized for poor reporting of the basis for the class definitions and for sacrificing information compared to methods that use a continuous weighted distribution of measurements.&lt;ref name="Wiens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiens | first1 = JJ | year = 2001 | title = Character analysis in morphological phylogenetics: problems and solutions | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 689–699 | doi=10.1080/106351501753328811| pmid = 12116939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because morphological data is extremely labor-intensive to collect, whether from literature sources or from field observations, reuse of previously compiled data matrices is not uncommon, although this may propagate flaws in the original matrix into multiple derivative analyses.&lt;ref name="Jenner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jenner | first1 = RA | year = 2001 | title = Bilaterian phylogeny and uncritical recycling of morphological data sets | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 730–743 | doi=10.1080/106351501753328857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular analysis===
The problem of character coding is very different in molecular analyses, as the characters in biological sequence data are immediate and discretely defined - distinct [[nucleotide]]s in [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] sequences and distinct [[amino acid]]s in [[protein]] sequences. However, defining [[homology (biology)|homology]] can be challenging due to the inherent difficulties of [[multiple sequence alignment]]. For a given gapped MSA, several rooted phylogenetic trees can be constructed that vary in their interpretations of which changes are "[[mutation]]s" versus ancestral characters, and which events are [[insertion (genetics)|insertion mutations]] or [[deletion (genetics)|deletion mutations]]. For example, given only a pairwise alignment with a gap region, it is impossible to determine whether one sequence bears an insertion mutation or the other carries a deletion. The problem is magnified in MSAs with unaligned and nonoverlapping gaps. In practice, sizable regions of a calculated alignment may be discounted in phylogenetic tree construction to avoid integrating noisy data into the tree calculation.
&lt;!-- more here on the effects of mutation rates--&gt;

==Distance-matrix methods==
{{Main|Distance matrices in phylogeny}}
Distance-matrix methods of phylogenetic analysis explicitly rely on a measure of "genetic distance" between the sequences being classified, and therefore they require an MSA as an input. Distance is often defined as the fraction of mismatches at aligned positions, with gaps either ignored or counted as mismatches.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; Distance methods attempt to construct an all-to-all matrix from the sequence query set describing the distance between each sequence pair. From this is constructed a phylogenetic tree that places closely related sequences under the same [[interior node]] and whose branch lengths closely reproduce the observed distances between sequences. Distance-matrix methods may produce either rooted or unrooted trees, depending on the algorithm used to calculate them. They are frequently used as the basis for progressive and iterative types of [[multiple sequence alignment]]s. The main disadvantage of distance-matrix methods is their inability to efficiently use information about local high-variation regions that appear across multiple subtrees.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===UPGMA and WPGMA===
{{Main|UPGMA}}
{{Main|WPGMA}}

The [[UPGMA]] (''Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean'') and [[WPGMA]] (''Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean'') methods produce rooted trees and require a constant-rate assumption - that is, it assumes an [[ultrametric]] tree in which the distances from the root to every branch tip are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sokal R and Michener C |title=A statistical method for evaluating systematic relationships |journal=University of Kansas Science Bulletin |volume=38 |pages=1409–1438 |year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighbor-joining===
{{Main|Neighbor joining}}

Neighbor-joining methods apply general [[cluster analysis]] techniques to sequence analysis using genetic distance as a clustering metric. The simple [[neighbor-joining]] method produces unrooted trees, but it does not assume a constant rate of evolution (i.e., a [[molecular clock]]) across lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saitou|first=N.|last2=Nei|first2=M.|date=1987-07-01|title=The neighbor-joining method: a new method for reconstructing phylogenetic trees.|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/4/406|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=406–425|issn=0737-4038|pmid=3447015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fitch-Margoliash method===
The [[Distance matrices in phylogeny#Fitch-Margoliash method|Fitch-Margoliash method]] uses a weighted [[least squares]] method for clustering based on genetic distance.&lt;ref name="fitch"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WM | authorlink = Walter M. Fitch | authorlink2 = Emanuel Margoliash | last2 = Margoliash | first2 = E. | year = 1967 | title = Construction of phylogenetic trees | url = | journal = Science | volume = 155 | issue = 3760| pages = 279–284 | doi=10.1126/science.155.3760.279 | pmid=5334057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related sequences are given more weight in the tree construction process to correct for the increased inaccuracy in measuring distances between distantly related sequences. The distances used as input to the algorithm must be normalized to prevent large artifacts in computing relationships between closely related and distantly related groups. The distances calculated by this method must be [[linear]]; the linearity criterion for distances requires that the [[expected value]]s of the branch lengths for two individual branches must equal the expected value of the sum of the two branch distances - a property that applies to biological sequences only when they have been corrected for the possibility of [[Mutation#By effect on function|back mutation]]s at individual sites. This correction is done through the use of a [[substitution matrix]] such as that derived from the [[Jukes-Cantor model]] of DNA evolution. The distance correction is only necessary in practice when the evolution rates differ among branches.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; Another modification of the algorithm can be helpful, especially in case of concentrated distances (please report to [[concentration of measure]] phenomenon and [[curse of dimensionality]]): that modification, described in,&lt;ref name="Lespinats"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lespinats | first1 = S. | last2 = Grando | first2 = D. | last3 = Maréchal | first3 = E. | last4 = Hakimi | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Tenaillon | first5 = O. | last6 = Bastien | first6 = O. | year = 2011 | title = How Fitch-Margoliash Algorithm can benefit from Multi Dimensional Scaling | url = | journal = [[Evolutionary Bioinformatics]] | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 61–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to improve the efficiency of the algorithm and its robustness.

The least-squares criterion applied to these distances is more accurate but less efficient than the neighbor-joining methods. An additional improvement that corrects for correlations between distances that arise from many closely related sequences in the data set can also be applied at increased computational cost. Finding the optimal least-squares tree with any correction factor is [[NP-complete]],&lt;ref name="day"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = William HE | year = 1987 | title = Computational complexity of inferring phylogenies from dissimilarity matrices | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092824087800071 | journal = [[Bulletin of Mathematical Biology]] | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 461–467 | doi=10.1016/s0092-8240(87)80007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; so [[heuristic]] search methods like those used in maximum-parsimony analysis are applied to the search through tree space.

===Using outgroups===
Independent information about the relationship between sequences or groups can be used to help reduce the tree search space and root unrooted trees. Standard usage of distance-matrix methods involves the inclusion of at least one [[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]] sequence known to be only distantly related to the sequences of interest in the query set.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; This usage can be seen as a type of [[experimental control]]. If the outgroup has been appropriately chosen, it will have a much greater [[genetic distance]] and thus a longer branch length than any other sequence, and it will appear near the root of a rooted tree. Choosing an appropriate outgroup requires the selection of a sequence that is moderately related to the sequences of interest; too close a relationship defeats the purpose of the outgroup and too distant adds [[signal noise|noise]] to the analysis.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; Care should also be taken to avoid situations in which the species from which the sequences were taken are distantly related, but the gene encoded by the sequences is highly [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] across lineages. [[Horizontal gene transfer]], especially between otherwise divergent [[bacteria]], can also confound outgroup usage.

==Maximum parsimony==
[[Maximum parsimony]] (MP) is a method of identifying the potential phylogenetic tree that requires the smallest total number of [[evolution]]ary events to explain the observed sequence data. Some ways of scoring trees also include a "cost" associated with particular types of evolutionary events and attempt to locate the tree with the smallest total cost. This is a useful approach in cases where not every possible type of event is equally likely - for example, when particular [[nucleotide]]s or [[amino acid]]s are known to be more mutable than others.

The most naive way of identifying the most parsimonious tree is simple enumeration - considering each possible tree in succession and searching for the tree with the smallest score. However, this is only possible for a relatively small number of sequences or species because the problem of identifying the most parsimonious tree is known to be [[NP-hard]];&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; consequently a number of [[heuristic]] search methods for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] have been developed to locate a highly parsimonious tree, if not the best in the set. Most such methods involve a [[steepest descent]]-style minimization mechanism operating on a [[tree rearrangement]] criterion.

===Branch and bound===
The [[branch and bound]] algorithm is a general method used to increase the efficiency of searches for near-optimal solutions of [[NP-hard]] problems first applied to phylogenetics in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="hendy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendy | first1 = MD | last2 = Penny | first2 = D | year = 1982 | title = Branch and bound algorithms to determine minimal evolutionary trees | url = | journal = Math Biosci | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 133–142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Branch and bound is particularly well suited to phylogenetic tree construction because it inherently requires dividing a problem into a [[tree structure]] as it subdivides the problem space into smaller regions. As its name implies, it requires as input both a branching rule (in the case of phylogenetics, the addition of the next species or sequence to the tree) and a bound (a rule that excludes certain regions of the search space from consideration, thereby assuming that the optimal solution cannot occupy that region). Identifying a good bound is the most challenging aspect of the algorithm's application to phylogenetics. A simple way of defining the bound is a maximum number of assumed evolutionary changes allowed per tree. A set of criteria known as Zharkikh's rules&lt;ref name="zharkikh"&gt;Ratner VA, Zharkikh AA, Kolchanov N, Rodin S, Solovyov S, Antonov AS. (1995). ''Molecular Evolution'' Biomathematics Series Vol 24. Springer-Verlag: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; severely limit the search space by defining characteristics shared by all candidate "most parsimonious" trees. The two most basic rules require the elimination of all but one redundant sequence (for cases where multiple observations have produced identical data) and the elimination of character sites at which two or more states do not occur in at least two species. Under ideal conditions these rules and their associated algorithm would completely define a tree.

===Sankoff-Morel-Cedergren algorithm===
The Sankoff-Morel-Cedergren algorithm was among the first published methods to simultaneously produce an MSA and a phylogenetic tree for nucleotide sequences.&lt;ref name="sankoff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sankoff | first1 = D | last2 = Morel | first2 = C | last3 = Cedergren | first3 = RJ | year = 1973 | title = Evolution of 5S RNA and the non-randomness of base replacement | url = | journal = Nature New Biology | volume = 245 | issue = 147| pages = 232–234 | doi=10.1038/newbio245232a0 | pmid=4201431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method uses a [[maximum parsimony]] calculation in conjunction with a scoring function that penalizes gaps and mismatches, thereby favoring the tree that introduces a minimal number of such events (an alternative view holds that the trees to be favored are those that maximize the amount of sequence similarity that can be interpreted as homology, a point of view that may lead to different optimal trees &lt;ref name="de_laet2005"&gt;De Laet J. (2005). Parsimony and the problem of inapplicables in sequence data. Pp. 81-116 in Albert, V.A. (ed.) ''Parsimony, phylogeny and genomics.'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-856493-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The imputed sequences at the [[interior node]]s of the tree are scored and summed over all the nodes in each possible tree. The lowest-scoring tree sum provides both an optimal tree and an optimal MSA given the scoring function. Because the method is highly computationally intensive, an approximate method in which initial guesses for the interior alignments are refined one node at a time. Both the full and the approximate version are in practice calculated by dynamic programming.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===MALIGN and POY===
More recent phylogenetic tree/MSA methods use heuristics to isolate high-scoring, but not necessarily optimal, trees. The MALIGN method uses a maximum-parsimony technique to compute a multiple alignment by maximizing a [[cladogram]] score, and its companion POY uses an iterative method that couples the optimization of the phylogenetic tree with improvements in the corresponding MSA.&lt;ref name="wheeler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = WC | last2 = Gladstein | first2 = DG | year = 1994 | title = MALIGN: a multiple nucleic acid sequence alignment program | url = | journal = Journal of Heredity | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 417–418 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a111492}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of these methods in constructing evolutionary hypotheses has been criticized as biased due to the deliberate construction of trees reflecting minimal evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="simmons"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = MP | year = 2004 | title = Independence of alignment and tree search | url = | journal = Mol Phylogenet Evol | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 874–879 | pmid = 15120385 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, has been countered by the view that such methods should be seen as heuristic approaches to find the trees that maximize the amount of sequence similarity that can be interpreted as homology.&lt;ref name="de_laet2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="de_laet2015"&gt;
{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/cla.12098 | title = Parsimony analysis of unaligned sequence data: maximization of homology and minimization of homoplasy, not Minimization of operationally defined total cost or minimization of equally weighted transformations | year = 2015 | author = De Laet, Jan | journal = Cladistics | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximum likelihood==
The [[maximum likelihood]] method uses standard statistical techniques for inferring [[probability distribution]]s to assign probabilities to particular possible phylogenetic trees. The method requires a [[substitution model]] to assess the probability of particular [[mutation]]s; roughly, a tree that requires more mutations at interior nodes to explain the observed phylogeny will be assessed as having a lower probability. This is broadly similar to the maximum-parsimony method, but maximum likelihood allows additional statistical flexibility by permitting varying rates of evolution across both lineages and sites. In fact, the method requires that evolution at different sites and along different lineages must be [[statistically independent]]. Maximum likelihood is thus well suited to the analysis of distantly related sequences, but it is believed to be computationally intractable to compute due to its NP-hardness.&lt;ref name="chor"&gt;Chor B, Tuller T. (2005). Maximum likelihood of evolutionary trees: hardness and approximation. ''Bioinformatics'' 21.suppl 1:  i97-i106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "pruning" algorithm, a variant of [[dynamic programming]], is often used to reduce the search space by efficiently calculating the likelihood of subtrees.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; The method calculates the likelihood for each site in a "linear" manner, starting at a node whose only descendants are leaves (that is, the tips of the tree) and working backwards toward the "bottom" node in nested sets. However, the trees produced by the method are only rooted if the substitution model is irreversible, which is not generally true of biological systems. The search for the maximum-likelihood tree also includes a branch length optimization component that is difficult to improve upon algorithmically; general [[global optimization]] tools such as the [[Newton-Raphson]] method are often used.

==Bayesian inference==&lt;!--There is at least one wikilink here, so fix if you change the section title--&gt;
{{Main|Bayesian inference in phylogeny}}
[[Bayesian inference]] can be used to produce phylogenetic trees in a manner closely related to the maximum likelihood methods. Bayesian methods assume a prior [[probability distribution]] of the possible trees, which may simply be the probability of any one tree among all the possible trees that could be generated from the data, or may be a more sophisticated estimate derived from the assumption that divergence events such as [[speciation]] occur as [[stochastic process]]es. The choice of prior distribution is a point of contention among users of Bayesian-inference phylogenetics methods.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

Implementations of Bayesian methods generally use [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] sampling algorithms, although the choice of move set varies; selections used in Bayesian phylogenetics include circularly permuting leaf nodes of a proposed tree at each step&lt;ref name="Mau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mau | first1 = B | last2 = Newton | first2 = MA | year = 1997 | title = Phylogenetic inference for binary data on dendrograms using Markov chain Monte Carlo | url = | journal = J Comp Graph Stat | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 122–131 | doi=10.2307/1390728| jstor = 1390728 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and swapping descendant subtrees of a random [[internal node]] between two related trees.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = Z | last2 = Rannala | first2 = B | year = 1997 | title = bayesian phylogenetic inference using DNA sequences: a Markov chain Monte Carlo method | url = | journal = Mol Biol Evol | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 717–724 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Bayesian methods in phylogenetics has been controversial, largely due to incomplete specification of the choice of move set, acceptance criterion, and prior distribution in published work.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;  Bayesian methods are generally held to be superior to parsimony-based methods; they can be more prone to long-branch attraction than maximum likelihood techniques,&lt;ref name="Kolaczkowski2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kolaczkowski | first1 = B. | last2 = Thornton | first2 = J.

Whereas likelihood methods find the tree that maximizes the probability of the data, a Bayesian approach recovers a tree that represents the most likely clades, by drawing on the posterior distribution.  However, estimates of the posterior probability of clades (measuring their 'support') can be quite wide of the mark, especially in clades that aren't overwhelmingly likely. As such, other methods have been put forwards to estimate posterior probability.&lt;ref name="Larget2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Larget | first1 = B. | title = The Estimation of Tree Posterior Probabilities Using Conditional Clade Probability Distributions | doi = 10.1093/sysbio/syt014 | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 501–511 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23479066| pmc =3676676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model selection==
Molecular phylogenetics methods rely on a defined [[substitution model]] that encodes a hypothesis about the relative rates of [[mutation]] at various sites along the gene or amino acid sequences being studied. At their simplest, substitution models aim to correct for differences in the rates of [[transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s in nucleotide sequences. The use of substitution models is necessitated by the fact that the [[genetic distance]] between two sequences increases linearly only for a short time after the two sequences diverge from each other (alternatively, the distance is linear only shortly before [[coalescent theory|coalescence]]). The longer the amount of time after divergence, the more likely it becomes that two mutations occur at the same nucleotide site. Simple genetic distance calculations will thus undercount the number of mutation events that have occurred in evolutionary history. The extent of this undercount increases with increasing time since divergence, which can lead to the phenomenon of [[long branch attraction]], or the misassignment of two distantly related but convergently evolving sequences as closely related.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152633 | title = Model Selection in Phylogenetics | year = 2005 | author = Sullivan, Jack | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 445–466 | last2 = Joyce | first2 = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum parsimony method is particularly susceptible to this problem due to its explicit search for a tree representing a minimum number of distinct evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===Types of models===
{{Main|Substitution model}}

All substitution models assign a set of weights to each possible change of state represented in the sequence. The most common model types are implicitly reversible because they assign the same weight to, for example, a G&gt;C nucleotide mutation as to a C&gt;G mutation. The simplest possible model, the [[Jukes-Cantor model]], assigns an equal probability to every possible change of state for a given nucleotide base. The rate of change between any two distinct nucleotides will be one-third of the overall substitution rate.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; More advanced models distinguish between [[transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s. The most general possible time-reversible model, called the GTR model, has six mutation rate parameters. An even more generalized model known as the general 12-parameter model breaks time-reversibility, at the cost of much additional complexity in calculating genetic distances that are consistent among multiple lineages.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; One possible variation on this theme adjusts the rates so that overall GC content - an important measure of DNA double helix stability - varies over time.&lt;ref name="Galtier"&gt;Galtier N, Guoy M. (1998.) Inferring pattern and process: maximum-likelihood implementation of a nonhomogeneous model of DNA sequence evolution for phylogenetic analysis. ''Mol. Biol. Evol.'' 15:871–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

Models may also allow for the variation of rates with positions in the input sequence. The most obvious example of such variation follows from the arrangement of nucleotides in protein-coding genes into three-base [[codon]]s. If the location of the [[open reading frame]] (ORF) is known, rates of mutation can be adjusted for position of a given site within a codon, since it is known that [[wobble base pair]]ing can allow for higher mutation rates in the third nucleotide of a given codon without affecting the codon's meaning in the [[genetic code]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; A less hypothesis-driven example that does not rely on ORF identification simply assigns to each site a rate randomly drawn from a predetermined distribution, often the [[gamma distribution]] or [[log-normal distribution]].&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; Finally, a more conservative estimate of rate variations known as the [[covarion]] method allows [[autocorrelation|autocorrelated]] variations in rates, so that the mutation rate of a given site is correlated across sites and lineages.&lt;ref name="FitchMarkowitz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WM | last2 = Markowitz | first2 = E | year = 1970 | title = An improved method for determining codon variability in a gene and its application to the rate of fixation of mutations in evolution | url = | journal = Biochemical Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 5| pages = 579–593 | doi=10.1007/bf00486096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choosing the best model===
The selection of an appropriate model is critical for the production of good phylogenetic analyses, both because underparameterized or overly restrictive models may produce aberrant behavior when their underlying assumptions are violated, and because overly complex or overparameterized models are computationally expensive and the parameters may be overfit.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; The most common method of model selection is the [[likelihood ratio test]] (LRT), which produces a likelihood estimate that can be interpreted as a measure of "[[goodness of fit]]" between the model and the input data.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; However, care must be taken in using these results, since a more complex model with more parameters will always have a higher likelihood than a simplified version of the same model, which can lead to the naive selection of models that are overly complex.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;  For this reason model selection computer programs will choose the simplest model that is not significantly worse than more complex substitution models. A significant disadvantage of the LRT is the necessity of making a series of pairwise comparisons between models; it has been shown that the order in which the models are compared has a major effect on the one that is eventually selected.&lt;ref name="Pol"&gt;Pol D. (2004.) Empirical problems of the hierarchical likelihood ratio test for model selection. ''Syst Biol'' 53:949–962.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative model selection method is the [[Akaike information criterion]] (AIC), formally an estimate of the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] between the true model and the model being tested. It can be interpreted as a likelihood estimate with a correction factor to penalize overparameterized models.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; The AIC is calculated on an individual model rather than a pair, so it is independent of the order in which models are assessed. A related alternative, the [[Bayesian information criterion]] (BIC), has a similar basic interpretation but penalizes complex models more heavily.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

A comprehensive step-by-step protocol on constructing phylogenetic tree, including DNA/Amino Acid contiguous sequence assembly, multiple sequence alignment, model-test (testing best-fitting substitution models) and phylogeny reconstruction using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference, is available at ''Nature Protocol''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/protex.2013.065 | title=Sequence similarity search, Multiple Sequence Alignment, Model Selection, Distance Matrix and Phylogeny Reconstruction | year=2013 | journal=Protocol Exchange | last1 = Bast | first1 = Felix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non traditional way of evaluating the phylogenetic tree is to compare it with clustering result. One can use a Multidimensional Scaling technique, so called Interpolative Joining to do dimensionality reduction to visualize the clustering result for the sequences in 3D, and then map the phylogenetic tree onto the clustering result. A better tree usually has a higher correlation with the clustering result.&lt;ref&gt;Ruan, Yang, et al. "Integration of Clustering and Multidimensional Scaling to Determine Phylogenetic Trees as Spherical Phylograms Visualized in 3 Dimensions." Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid), 2014 14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on. IEEE, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating tree support==
As with all statistical analysis, the estimation of phylogenies from character data requires an evaluation of confidence. A number of methods exist to test the amount of support for a phylogenetic tree, either by evaluating the support for each sub-tree in the phylogeny (nodal support) or evaluating whether the phylogeny is significantly different from other possible trees (alternative tree hypothesis tests).

===Nodal support===
The most common method for assessing tree support is to evaluate the statistical support for each node on the tree. Typically, a node with very low support is not considered valid in further analysis, and visually may be collapsed into a [[polytomy]] to indicate that relationships within a clade are unresolved.

====Consensus tree====
Many methods for assessing nodal support involve consideration of multiple phylogenies. The consensus tree summarizes the nodes that are shared among a set of trees.&lt;ref name="BaumSmith2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A. Baum|author2=Stacey D. Smith|title=Tree Thinking: An Introduction to Phylogenetic Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zW_ApwAACAAJ|year=2013|publisher=Roberts|isbn=978-1-936221-16-5|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a *strict consensus,* only nodes found in every tree are shown, and the rest are collapsed into an unresolved [[polytomy]]. Less conservative methods, such as the *majority-rule consensus* tree, consider nodes that are supported by a given percentage of trees under consideration (such as at least 50%).

For example, in maximum parsimony analysis, there may be many trees with the same parsimony score. A strict consensus tree would show which nodes are found in all equally parsimonious trees, and which nodes differ. Consensus trees are also used to evaluate support on phylogenies reconstructed with Bayesian inference (see below).

====Bootstrapping and jackknifing====
In statistics, the [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] is a method for inferring the variability of data that has an unknown distribution using pseudoreplications of the original data. For example, given a set of 100 data points, a [[pseudoreplicate]] is a data set of the same size (100 points) randomly sampled from the original data, with replacement. That is, each original data point may be represented more than once in the pseudoreplicate, or not at all. Statistical support involves evaluation of whether the original data has similar properties to a large set of pseudoreplicates.

In phylogenetics, bootstrapping is conducted using the columns of the character matrix. Each pseudoreplicate contains the same number of species (rows) and characters (columns) randomly sampled from the original matrix, with replacement. A phylogeny is reconstructed from each pseudoreplicate, with the same methods used to reconstruct the phylogeny from the original data. For each node on the phylogeny, the nodal support is the percentage of pseudoreplicates containing that node.&lt;ref name="Felsenstein1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Felsenstein|first1=Joseph|title=Confidence Limits on Phylogenies: An Approach Using the Bootstrap|journal=Evolution|volume=39|issue=4|year=1985|pages=783–791|issn=0014-3820|doi=10.2307/2408678|pmid=28561359|jstor=2408678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statistical rigor of the bootstrap test has been empirically evaluated using viral populations with known evolutionary histories,&lt;ref name="HillisBull1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillis|first1=D. M.|last2=Bull|first2=J. J.|title=An Empirical Test of Bootstrapping as a Method for Assessing Confidence in Phylogenetic Analysis|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=42|issue=2|year=1993|pages=182–192|issn=1063-5157|doi=10.1093/sysbio/42.2.182}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding that 70% bootstrap support corresponds to a 95% probability that the clade exists. However, this was tested under ideal conditions (e.g. no change in evolutionary rates, symmetric phylogenies). In practice, values above 70% are generally supported and left to the researcher or reader to evaluate confidence. Nodes with support lower than 70% are typically considered unresolved.

Jackknifing in phylogenetics is a similar procedure, except the columns of the matrix are sampled without replacement. Pseudoreplicates are generated by randomly subsampling the data—for example, a "10% jackknife" would involve randomly sampling 10% of the matrix many times to evaluate nodal support.

==== Posterior probability ====
Reconstruction of phylogenies using [[Bayesian inference]] generates a posterior distribution of highly probable trees given the data and evolutionary model, rather than a single "best" tree. The trees in the posterior distribution generally have many different topologies. Most Bayesian inference methods utilize a Markov-chain Monte Carlo iteration, and the initial steps of this chain are not considered reliable reconstructions of the phylogeny. Trees generated early in the chain are usually discarded as [[burn-in]]. The most common method of evaluating nodal support in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis is to calculate the percentage of trees in the posterior distribution (post-burn-in) which contain the node.

The statistical support for a node in Bayesian inference is expected to reflect the probability that a clade really exists given the data and evolutionary model.&lt;ref name="HuelsenbeckRannala2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huelsenbeck|first1=John|last2=Rannala|first2=Bruce|title=Frequentist Properties of Bayesian Posterior Probabilities of Phylogenetic Trees Under Simple and Complex Substitution Models|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=53|issue=6|year=2004|pages=904–913|issn=1063-5157|doi=10.1080/10635150490522629|pmid=15764559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the threshold for accepting a node as supported is generally higher than for bootstrapping.

==== Step counting methods====
[[Bremer support]] counts the number of extra steps needed to contradict a clade.

===Shortcomings ===
These measures each have their weaknesses. For example, smaller or larger clades tend to attract larger support values than mid-sized clades, simply as a result of the number of taxa in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/jzs.12024| title = Evaluating the clade size effect in alternative measures of branch support| journal = Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research| pages = n/a| year = 2013| last1 = Chemisquy | first1 = M. A. A. | last2 = Prevosti | first2 = F. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bootstrap support can provide high estimates of node support as a result of noise in the data rather than the true existence of a clade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msh137| pmid = 15084674| title = Genome-Scale Phylogeny and the Detection of Systematic Biases| journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution| volume = 21| issue = 7| pages = 1455–1458| year = 2004| last1 = Phillips | first1 = M. J.| last2 = Delsuc| first2 = F| last3 = Penny| first3 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and workarounds ==
Ultimately, there is no way to measure whether a particular phylogenetic hypothesis is accurate or not, unless the true relationships among the taxa being examined are already known (which may happen with bacteria or viruses under laboratory conditions). The best result an empirical phylogeneticist can hope to attain is a tree with branches that are well supported by the available evidence. Several potential pitfalls have been identified:

=== Homoplasy ===
{{main|Convergent evolution}}
Certain characters are more likely to [[Convergent evolution|evolve convergently]] than others; logically, such characters should be given less weight in the reconstruction of a tree.&lt;ref name=Goloboff2008&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00209.x |title=Weighting against homoplasy improves phylogenetic analysis of morphological data sets |year=2008 |last1=Goloboff |first1=Pablo A. |last2=Carpenter |first2=James M. |last3=Arias |first3=J. Salvador |last4=Esquivel |first4=Daniel Rafael Miranda |journal=Cladistics |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=758–773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weights in the form of a model of evolution can be inferred from sets of molecular data, so that [[maximum likelihood]] or [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] methods can be used to analyze them. For molecular sequences, this problem is exacerbated when the taxa under study have diverged substantially. As time since the divergence of two taxa increase, so does the probability of multiple substitutions on the same site, or back mutations, all of which result in homoplasies.  For morphological data, unfortunately, the only objective way to determine convergence is by the construction of a tree&amp;nbsp;– a somewhat circular method. Even so, weighting homoplasious characters{{how|date=September 2012}} does indeed lead to better-supported trees.&lt;ref name=Goloboff2008/&gt; Further refinement can be brought by weighting changes in one direction higher than changes in another; for instance, the presence of thoracic wings almost guarantees placement among the pterygote insects because, although wings are often lost secondarily, there is no evidence that they have been gained more than once.&lt;ref name=Goloboff1997&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1997.tb00317.x |title=Self-Weighted Optimization: Tree Searches and Character State Reconstructions under Implied Transformation Costs |year=1997 |last1=Goloboff |first1=Pablo A. |journal=Cladistics |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=225–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal gene transfer ===
In general, organisms can inherit genes in two ways: vertical gene transfer and [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Vertical gene transfer is the passage of genes from parent to offspring, and horizontal (also called lateral) gene transfer occurs when genes jump between unrelated organisms, a common phenomenon especially in [[prokaryote]]s; a good example of this is the acquired [[antibiotic resistance]] as a result of gene exchange between various bacteria leading to multi-drug-resistant bacterial species. There have also been well-documented cases of horizontal gene transfer [[Horizontal gene transfer#Eukaryotes|between eukaryotes]].

Horizontal gene transfer has complicated the determination of phylogenies of organisms, and inconsistencies in phylogeny have been reported among specific groups of organisms depending on the genes used to construct evolutionary trees. The only way to determine which genes have been acquired vertically and which horizontally is to [[Occam's razor|parsimoniously]] assume that the largest set of genes that have been inherited together have been inherited vertically; this requires analyzing a large number of genes.

=== Hybrids, speciation, introgressions and incomplete  lineage sorting===
The basic assumption underlying the mathematical model of cladistics is a situation where species split neatly in bifurcating fashion. While such an assumption may hold on a larger scale (bar horizontal gene transfer, see above), [[speciation]] is often much less orderly. Research since the cladistic method was introduced has shown that [[hybrid speciation]], once thought rare, is in fact quite common, particularly in plants.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=M.L.|title=Natural Hybridization and Evolution|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509975-1|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendel, J F. &amp; Doyle, J.J.

Kluwer, Boston, pp. 265–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[paraspecies|paraphyletic speciation]] is common, making the assumption of a bifurcating pattern unsuitable, leading to [[phylogenetic network]]s rather than trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funk | first1 = D.

In species level analysis this can be dealt with by larger sampling or better whole genome analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Iyer|first2=Venky N.|last3=Moses|first3=Alan M.|last4=Eisen|first4=Michael B.|title=Widespread Discordance of Gene Trees with Species Tree in Drosophila: Evidence for Incomplete Lineage Sorting|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=2006|volume=2|issue=10|pages=e173|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020173|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020173|pmid=17132051|pmc=1626107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the problem is avoided by restricting the analysis to fewer, not closely related specimens.

=== Taxon sampling ===
Owing to the development of advanced sequencing techniques in [[molecular biology]], it has become feasible to gather large amounts of data (DNA or amino acid sequences) to infer phylogenetic hypotheses. For example, it is not rare to find studies with character matrices based on whole [[mitochondrial]] genomes (~16,000 nucleotides, in many animals). However, simulations have shown that it is more important to increase the number of taxa in the matrix than to increase the number of characters, because the more taxa there are, the more accurate and more robust is the resulting phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name="Zwickl2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10635150290102339 |title=Increased Taxon Sampling Greatly Reduces Phylogenetic Error |year=2002 |last1=Zwickl |first1=Derrick J. |last2=Hillis |first2=David M. |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=588–598 |pmid=12228001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiens2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2005.04.001 |title=Missing data and the design of phylogenetic analyses |year=2006 |last1=Wiens |first1=John J. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics |volume=39 |pages=34–42 |pmid=15922672 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be partly due to the breaking up of [[long branch attraction|long branches]].

=== Phylogenetic signal ===
Another important factor that affects the accuracy of tree reconstruction is whether the data analyzed actually contain a useful phylogenetic signal, a term that is used generally to denote whether a character evolves slowly enough to have the same state in closely related taxa as opposed to varying randomly. Tests for phylogenetic signal exist.&lt;ref name="Blomberg2003"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12778543 |year=2003 |last1=Blomberg |first1=Simon P. |last2=Garland Jr |first2=Theodore |last3=Ives |first3=Anthony R. |title=Testing for phylogenetic signal in comparative data: Behavioral traits are more labile |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=717–745 |journal=Evolution |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00285.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuous characters ===
Morphological characters that sample a continuum may contain phylogenetic signal, but are hard to code as discrete characters. Several methods have been used, one of which is gap coding, and there are variations on gap coding.&lt;ref name=Archie1985&gt;{{cite journal|author=Archie, J.W.|year=1985|title=Methods for coding variable morphological features for numerical taxonomic analysis|journal=Systematic Zoology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=326–345|url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/3/326.abstract|doi=10.2307/2413151|jstor=2413151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original form of gap coding:&lt;ref name=Archie1985/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;group means for a character are first ordered by size. The pooled within-group standard deviation is calculated ... and differences between adjacent means ... are compared relative to this standard deviation. Any pair of adjacent means is considered different and given different integer scores ... if the means are separated by a "gap" greater than the within-group standard deviation ... times some arbitrary constant.&lt;/blockquote&gt; If more taxa are added to the analysis, the gaps between taxa may become so small that all information is lost. Generalized gap coding works around that problem by comparing individual pairs of taxa rather than considering one set that contains all of the taxa.&lt;ref name=Archie1985/&gt;

=== Missing data ===
In general, the more data that are available when constructing a tree, the more accurate and reliable the resulting tree will be. Missing data are no more detrimental than simply having fewer data, although the impact is greatest when most of the missing data are in a small number of taxa. Concentrating the missing data across a small number of characters produces a more robust tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prevosti |first1=Francisco J. |last2=Chemisquy |first2=María A. |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2009.00289.x |title=The impact of missing data on real morphological phylogenies: Influence of the number and distribution of missing entries |year=2009 |journal=Cladistics |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=326–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of fossils ==
Because many characters involve embryological, or soft-tissue or molecular characters that (at best) hardly ever fossilize, and the interpretation of fossils is more ambiguous than that of [[Extant taxon|living taxa]], extinct taxa almost invariably have higher proportions of missing data than living ones. However, despite these limitations, the inclusion of fossils is invaluable, as they can provide information in sparse areas of trees, breaking up long branches and constraining intermediate character states; thus, fossil taxa contribute as much to tree resolution as modern taxa.&lt;ref name=Cobbett2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10635150701627296 |title=Fossils Impact as Hard as Living Taxa in Parsimony Analyses of Morphology |year=2007 |last1=Cobbett |first1=Andrea |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Mark |last3=Wills |first3=Matthew |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=753–766 |pmid=17886145}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Fossils can also constrain the age of lineages and thus demonstrate how consistent a tree is with the stratigraphic record;&lt;ref name="Huelsenbeck"&gt;

'''Crowdreferencing''' is the collective effort of individuals who, usually via the [[Internet]], reference products and suppliers to help build a marketplace base, in exchange of a [[Royalties|royalty]] limited in time on these products. An early precursor of the crowdreferencing business model is Vialgo.co (2013), an online booking platform for [[tourism]] activities that created the concept to build its activity and supplier base. In the case of Vialgo.co, the crowdreferencer earns 6% of the price of the four first activities sold by supplier crowdreferenced.

In [[concurrent computing]], a '''deadlock''' is a state in which each member of a group is waiting for some other member to take action, such as sending a message or more commonly releasing a [[Lock (computer science)|lock]].&lt;ref name=coulouris&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulouris|first=George|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|title=Distributed Systems Concepts and Design|page=716|isbn=978-0-273-76059-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deadlock is a common problem in [[multiprocessing]] systems, [[parallel computing]], and [[Distributed computing|distributed systems]], where software and hardware locks are used to arbitrate shared resources and implement [[Synchronization (computer science)|process synchronization]].&lt;ref name=para_enclo&gt;{{cite book |last=Padua |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hm6LaufVKFEC&amp;pg=PA524#v=onepage&amp;q=deadlock&amp;f=false |publisher=Springer |year=2011 |title=Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing |page=524 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |isbn=9780387097657 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[operating system]], a deadlock occurs when a [[process (computing)|process]] or [[thread (computing)|thread]] enters a waiting [[Process state|state]] because a requested [[system resource]] is held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process. If a process is unable to change its state indefinitely because the resources requested by it are being used by another waiting process, then the system is said to be in a deadlock.&lt;ref name="os_galvin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Silberschatz| first=Abraham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjvX0HmVTlMC&amp;dq=deadlock+operating+systems|publisher=Wiley-India| year=2006 |title=Operating System Principles| edition=7th |page=237 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |isbn=9788126509621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[communications system]], deadlocks occur mainly due to lost or corrupt signals rather than resource contention.&lt;ref name=invi_comp&gt;{{cite book |last=Schneider |first=G.

(D) The deadlock can be resolved by cancelling and restarting the first process.]]

==Necessary conditions==
A deadlock situation on a resource can arise if and only if all of the following conditions hold simultaneously in a system:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silberschatz| first=Abraham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjvX0HmVTlMC&amp;dq=deadlock+operating+systems|publisher=Wiley-India| year=2006 |title=Operating System Principles| edition=7 |page=239 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |isbn=9788126509621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Mutual exclusion]]:'' At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode. Otherwise, the processes would not be prevented from using the resource when necessary. Only one process can use the resource at any given instant of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/classes/ecs150-1999-02/dl-cond.html|title=ECS 150 Spring 1999: Four Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Deadlock|author=|date=|website=nob.cs.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429180831/http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/classes/ecs150-1999-02/dl-cond.html|archivedate=29 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Hold and wait'' or ''resource holding:'' a process is currently holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources which are being held by other processes.
# ''No [[Preemption (computing)|preemption]]:'' a resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it. 
# ''Circular wait:'' each process must be waiting for a resource which is being held by another process, which in turn is waiting for the first process to release the resource. In general, there is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of waiting processes, ''P'' = {''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}, such that ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for a resource held by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for a resource held by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and so on until ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for a resource held by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="os_galvin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=embb&gt;{{cite book |last=Shibu |first=K. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hfn4gwR90MC&amp;pg=PA446#v=onepage&amp;q=%22waiting%20for%20a%20resource%22&amp;f=false |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |year=2009 |title=Intro To Embedded Systems |edition=1st |page=446 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |isbn=9780070145894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These four conditions are known as the ''Coffman conditions'' from their first description in a 1971 article by [[Edward G. Coffman, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="embb"/&gt;

==Deadlock handling==
Most current operating systems cannot prevent deadlocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silberschatz| first=Abraham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjvX0HmVTlMC&amp;dq=deadlock+operating+systems|publisher=Wiley-India |year=2006 |title=Operating System Principles| edition=7 |page=237 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |isbn=9788126509621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a deadlock occurs, different operating systems respond to them in different non-standard manners. Most approaches work by preventing one of the four Coffman conditions from occurring, especially the fourth one.&lt;ref name=pric_os&gt;{{cite book |last=Stuart |first=Brian L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5NC5-UfMMwC&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q=coffman%20conditions&amp;f=false |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2008 |title=Principles of operating systems |edition=1st |page=446 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major approaches are as follows.

===Ignoring deadlock===
In this approach, it is assumed that a deadlock will never occur. This is also an application of the [[Ostrich algorithm]].&lt;ref name="pric_os" /&gt;&lt;ref name="distri_tanen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tanenbaum| first=Andrew S. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l6sDRvKvCQ0C&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q=Tanenbaum%20ostrich&amp;f=false |publisher=Pearson Education |year=1995 |title=Distributed Operating Systems |edition=1st |page=117 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was initially used by [[MINIX]] and [[UNIX]].&lt;ref name="embb"/&gt; This is used when the time intervals between occurrences of deadlocks are large and the data loss incurred each time is tolerable.

===Detection===
Under the deadlock detection, deadlocks are allowed to occur. Then the state of the system is examined to detect that a deadlock has occurred and subsequently it is corrected. An algorithm is employed that tracks resource allocation and process states, it rolls back and restarts one or more of the processes in order to remove the detected deadlock. Detecting a deadlock that has already occurred is easily possible since the resources that each process has locked and/or currently requested are known to the resource scheduler of the operating system.&lt;ref name=distri_tanen /&gt;

After a deadlock is detected, it can be corrected by using one of the following methods:{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}
# ''Process termination:'' one or more processes involved in the deadlock may be aborted. One could choose to abort all competing [[Process (computing)|processes]] involved in the deadlock. This ensures that deadlock is resolved with certainty and speed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} But the expense is high as partial computations will be lost. Or, one could choose to abort one process at a time until the deadlock is resolved. This approach has high overhead because after each abort an algorithm must determine whether the system is still in deadlock.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Several factors must be considered while choosing a candidate for termination, such as priority and age of the process.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}
# ''Resource preemption:'' resources allocated to various processes may be successively preempted and allocated to other processes until the deadlock is broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSETD4_9.1.2/lsf_admin/resource_preemption_about.html|title=IBM Knowledge Center|author=|date=|website=www.ibm.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319112925/https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSETD4_9.1.2/lsf_admin/resource_preemption_about.html|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention===
{{main|Deadlock prevention algorithms}}
[[File:Avoiding deadlock.gif|380px|thumbnail|right|
(A) Two processes competing for one resource, following a first-come, first-served policy.

(B) Deadlock occurs when both processes lock the resource simultaneously.

(C) The deadlock can be ''resolved'' by breaking the symmetry of the locks.

(D) The deadlock can be ''prevented'' by breaking the symmetry of the locking mechanism.]]
Deadlock prevention works by preventing one of the four Coffman conditions from occurring.
* Removing the ''mutual exclusion'' condition means that no process will have exclusive access to a resource. This proves impossible for resources that cannot be [[Spooling|spooled]]. But even with spooled resources, deadlock could still occur. Algorithms that avoid mutual exclusion are called [[non-blocking synchronization]] algorithms.
* The ''hold and wait'' or ''resource holding'' conditions may be removed by requiring processes to request all the resources they will need before starting up (or before embarking upon a particular set of operations). This advance knowledge is frequently difficult to satisfy and, in any case, is an inefficient use of resources. Another way is to require processes to request resources only when it has none. Thus, first they must release all their currently held resources before requesting all the resources they will need from scratch. This too is often impractical. It is so because resources may be allocated and remain unused for long periods. Also, a process requiring a popular resource may have to wait indefinitely, as such a resource may always be allocated to some process, resulting in [[resource starvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silberschatz| first=Abraham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjvX0HmVTlMC&amp;dq=deadlock+operating+systems|publisher=Wiley-India| year=2006 |title=Operating System Principles| edition=7 |page=244 |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (These algorithms, such as [[serializing tokens]], are known as the ''all-or-none algorithms''.)
* The ''no [[Preemption (computing)|preemption]]'' condition may also be difficult or impossible to avoid as a process has to be able to have a resource for a certain amount of time, or the processing outcome may be inconsistent or [[thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]] may occur. However, inability to enforce preemption may interfere with a ''priority'' algorithm. Preemption of a "locked out" resource generally implies a [[Rollback (data management)|rollback]], and is to be avoided, since it is very costly in overhead. Algorithms that allow preemption include [[lock-free and wait-free algorithms]] and [[optimistic concurrency control]]. If a process holding some resources and requests for some another resource(s) that cannot be immediately allocated to it, the condition may be removed by releasing all the currently being held resources of that process. 
* The final condition is the ''circular wait'' condition. Approaches that avoid circular waits include disabling interrupts during critical sections and using a hierarchy to determine a [[partial order]]ing of resources. If no obvious hierarchy exists, even the memory address of resources has been used to determine ordering and resources are requested in the increasing order of the enumeration.&lt;ref name="os_galvin"/&gt; [[Dining philosophers problem#Resource hierarchy solution|Dijkstra's solution]] can also be used.

== Livelock ==
A ''livelock'' is similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another, none progressing.

The term was defined formally at some time during the 1970s. An early sighting in the published literature is in Babich's 1979 article on program correctness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1979.230192|first=A.F.|last=Babich|title=Proving Total Correctness of Parallel Programs|year=1979|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|volume=SE-5|issue=6|pages=558–574|doi=10.1109/tse.1979.230192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livelock is a special case of [[resource starvation]]; the general definition only states that a specific process is not progressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/anderson01sharedmemory.html|first=James H.|last=Anderson|author2=Yong-jik Kim|title=Shared-memory mutual exclusion: Major research trends since 1986|year=2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525013335/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/anderson01sharedmemory.html|archivedate=25 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livelock is a risk with some [[algorithm]]s that detect and recover from ''deadlock''. If more than one process takes action, the [[deadlock detection algorithm]] can be repeatedly triggered. This can be avoided by ensuring that only one process (chosen arbitrarily or by priority) takes action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/850752.850753 |title=The Deadlock problem: a classifying bibliography | first = Dieter |last = Zöbel | journal = ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review |volume=17 |issue=4 |date=October 1983 |issn=0163-5980 |pages = 6–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributed deadlock==
Distributed deadlocks can occur in [[distributed systems]] when [[distributed transaction]]s or [[concurrency control]] is being used. Distributed deadlocks can be detected either by constructing a global [[wait-for graph]] from local wait-for graphs at a deadlock detector or by a [[distributed algorithm]] like [[edge chasing]].

''Phantom deadlocks'' are deadlocks that are falsely detected in a distributed system due to system internal delays but don't actually exist. For example, if a process releases a resource ''R1'' and issues a request for ''R2'', and the first message is lost or delayed, a coordinator (detector of deadlocks) could falsely conclude a deadlock (if the request for ''R2'' while having ''R1'' would cause a deadlock).

'''Dematerialization of the art object''' is an idea in [[conceptual art]].  In "Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object" [[Lucy Lippard]] characterizes the period of 1966 to 1972 as one in which the [[art object]] was dematerialised through the new artistic practices of [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Blocker]] ''What the Body Cost''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diaspora studies''' is an academic field established in the late 20th century to study dispersed [[ethnicity|ethnic]] populations, which are often termed [[diaspora peoples]]. The usage of the term [[diaspora]] carries the [[connotation]] of forced resettlement, due to expulsion, coercion, slavery, [[racism]], or war, especially [[nationalism|nationalist]] conflicts.

'''Euxinia''' or '''euxinic conditions''' occur when water is both [[Anoxic event|anoxic]] and sulfidic. This means that there is no [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a raised level of free [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Euxinic bodies of water are frequently strongly stratified, have an oxic, highly productive, thin surface layer, and have anoxic, sulfidic bottom water.  The word euxinia is derived from the Greek name for the Black Sea- Εὔξεινος Πόντος (''Euxeinos Pontos)''- which translates to "hospitable sea".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Katja M.|last2=Kump|first2=Lee R.|date=2008-04-29|title=Oceanic Euxinia in Earth History: Causes and Consequences|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124256|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=251–288|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euxinic deep water is a key component of the [[Canfield ocean]], a model of oceans during the Proterozoic known as the [[Boring Billion]] proposed by [[Donald Canfield]], an American geologist, in 1998.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is still debate within the scientific community on both the duration and frequency of euxinic conditions in the ancient oceans.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W.|date=2008-08-15|title=Ironing Out Ocean Chemistry at the Dawn of Animal Life|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5891/923|journal=Science|language=en|volume=321|issue=5891|pages=923–924|doi=10.1126/science.1162870|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18703731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euxinia is relatively rare in modern bodies of water, but does still happen in places like the Black Sea and certain fjords.

== Background ==
Euxinia most frequently occurred in the Earth's ancient oceans, but its distribution and frequency of occurrence are still under debate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W.|last2=Anbar|first2=Ariel D.|last3=Severmann|first3=Silke|last4=Scott|first4=Clint|last5=Gill|first5=Benjamin C.|date=2009-04-27|title=Tracking Euxinia in the Ancient Ocean: A Multiproxy Perspective and Proterozoic Case Study|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124233|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=507–534|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original model was that it was quite constant for approximately a billion years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some meta-analyses have questioned how persistent euxinic conditions were based on relatively small [[black shale]] deposits in a period when the ocean should have theoretically been preserving more organic matter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Before the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] happened approximately 2.3 billion years ago, there was little free oxygen in either the atmosphere or the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12415-5_1|title=Sustaining Life on Planet Earth: Metalloenzymes Mastering Dioxygen and Other Chewy Gases|last=Torres|first=Martha E.

Sosa}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally thought that the ocean accumulated oxygen soon after the atmosphere did, but this idea was challenged by Canfield in 1998 when he proposed that instead of the deep ocean becoming oxidizing, it became sulfidic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=D. E.|year=|title=A new model for Proterozoic ocean chemistry|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/24839|journal=Nature|volume=396|issue=6710|pages=450–453|doi=10.1038/24839|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is partially based on the disappearance of [[banded iron formation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s from the geological records 1.8 billion years ago. Canfield argued that although enough oxygen entered the atmosphere to erode sulfides in continental rocks, there was not enough oxygen to mix into the deep ocean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would result in an anoxic deep ocean with an increased flux of sulfur from the continents. The sulfur would strip iron ions from the sea water, resulting in [[iron sulfide]] (pyrite), a portion of which was eventually buried. When sulfide became the major oceanic [[oxidant]] instead of iron, the deep water became euxinic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This has become what is known as the [[Canfield ocean]], a model backed by the increase in presence of δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in sedimentary [[pyrite]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the discovery of evidence of the first sulfate [[evaporite]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melezhik|first=Victor A.|last2=Fallick|first2=Anthony E.|last3=Rychanchik|first3=Dmitry V.|last4=Kuznetsov|first4=Anton B.|date=2005-04-01|title=Palaeoproterozoic evaporites in Fennoscandia: implications for seawater sulphate, the rise of atmospheric oxygen and local amplification of the δ13C excursion|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00600.x/abstract|journal=Terra Nova|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=141–148|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00600.x|issn=1365-3121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anoxic event|Anoxia]] and sulfidic conditions often occur together. In anoxic conditions anaerobic, sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfate into sulfide, creating sulfidic conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emergence of this metabolic pathway was very important in the pre-oxygenated oceans because adaptations to otherwise inhabitable or "toxic" environments like this may have played a role in the diversification of early eukaryotes and protozoa in the pre-Phanerozoic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Euxinia still occurs occasionally today, mostly in [[meromictic lakes]] and silled basins such as the [[Black Sea]] and some fjords.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is rare in modern times; less than 0.5% of today's sea floor is euxinic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:How oceans become euxinic.png|thumb|600x600px|Diagram of mechanisms of euxinia in the Canfield Ocean]]
The basic requirements for the formation of euxinic conditions are the absence of [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and the presence of [[Sulfate|sulfate ions]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), organic matter (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|bacteria]] capable of reducing sulfate to [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bacteria utilize the [[redox]] potential of sulfate as an [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] and organic matter as a [[Reducing agent|reductant]] to generate chemical energy through [[Anaerobic respiration|cellular respiration]]. The chemical species of interest can be represented via the reaction:

2CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 2HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

In the reaction above the sulfur has been reduced to form the [[By-product|byproduct]] hydrogen sulfide, the characteristic compound present in water under euxinic conditions. Although sulfate reduction occurs in waters throughout the world, most modern-day aquatic habitats are oxygenated due to [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] production of oxygen and [[gas exchange]] between the atmosphere and surface water. Sulfate reduction in these environments is often limited to occurring in [[seabed]] [[sediment]]s that have a strong [[redox gradient]] and become [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] at some depth below the [[Sediment–water interface|sediment-water interface]]. In the ocean the [[Reaction rate|rate]] of these reactions is not [https://online.science.psu.edu/biol011_active002/node/4343 limited] by sulfate, which has been present in large quantities throughout the oceans for the past 2.1 billion years.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] increased atmospheric oxygen concentrations such that oxidative [[weathering]] of [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]] became a major source of sulfate to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=E. M.|year=1982|title=Sulphate and sulphate reduction in early Precambrian oceans|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v296/n5853/pdf/296145a0.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=296|pages=145–148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=Donald E.|last2=Farquhar|first2=James|date=2009-05-19|year=|title=Animal evolution, bioturbation, and the sulfate concentration of the oceans|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8123|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=20|pages=8123–8127|doi=10.1073/pnas.0902037106|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2688866|pmid=19451639|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite plentiful sulfate ions being present in solution, they are not preferentially used by most bacteria. The reduction of sulfate does not give as much energy to an organism as reduction of oxygen or [[nitrate]], so the concentrations of these other elements must be nearly zero for sulfate-reducing bacteria to out-compete [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[denitrifying bacteria]]. In most modern settings these conditions only occur in a small portion of sediments, resulting in insufficient concentrations of hydrogen sulfide to form euxinic waters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Conditions required for the formation of persistent euxinia include [[anoxic waters]], high [[nutrient]] levels, and a [[Stratification (water)|stratified]] water column.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These conditions are not all-inclusive and are based largely on modern observations of euxinia. Conditions leading up to and triggering large-scale euxinic events, such as the [[Canfield ocean]], are likely the result of multiple interlinking factors, many of which have been inferred through studies of the [[geologic record]] at relevant locations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The formation of stratified anoxic waters with high nutrient levels is influenced by a variety of global and local-scale phenomena such as the presence of nutrient traps and a warming climate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nutrient traps ===
In order for euxinic conditions to persist, a positive feedback loop must exist that perpetuates organic matter export to bottom waters and reduction of sulfate under anoxic conditions. Organic matter export is driven by high levels of primary production in the [[photic zone]], supported by a continual supply of nutrients to the oxic surface waters. A natural source of nutrients, such as phosphate ({{chem|PO|4|3−}}), comes from [[weathering]] of rocks and subsequent transport of these dissolved nutrients via rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=C. M.|last2=Mills|first2=M. M.|last3=Arrigo|first3=K. R.|last4=Berman-Frank|first4=I.|last5=Bopp|first5=L.|last6=Boyd|first6=P. W.|last7=Galbraith|first7=E. D.|last8=Geider|first8=R. J.|last9=Guieu|first9=C.|title=Processes and patterns of oceanic nutrient limitation|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ngeo1765|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=6|issue=9|pages=701–710|doi=10.1038/ngeo1765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a nutrient trap, increased input of phosphate from rivers, high rates of recycling of phosphate from sediments, and slow vertical mixing in the water column allow for euxinic conditions to persist.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Geography ====
[[File:FjordCirculation.JPG|thumb|399x399px|A simplified model of estuarine circulation in a silled basin. Depicted here is a three-layered body of water which has been further simplified in the article by combining the intermediate and deep layers.]]
The arrangement of the continents has changed over time due to [[plate tectonics]], resulting in the [[bathymetry]] of ocean basins also changing over time. The shape and size of the basins influences the circulation patterns and concentration of nutrients within them. [[Computer simulation|Numerical models]] simulating past arrangements of continents have shown that nutrient traps can form in certain scenarios, increasing local concentrations of phosphate and setting up potential euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On a smaller scale, silled basins often act as nutrient traps due to their typical [[Estuarine water circulation|estuarine circulation]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Estuarine circulation occurs where surface water is replenished from river input and precipitation, causing an outflow of surface waters from the basin, while deep water flows into the basin over the sill. This type of circulation allows for anoxic, high nutrient bottom water to develop within the basin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Stratification ====
Stratified waters, in combination with slow vertical mixing, are essential to maintaining euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Stratification occurs when two or more water masses with different densities occupy the same basin. While the less dense surface water can exchange gas with the oxygen-rich atmosphere, the denser bottom waters maintain low oxygen content. In the modern oceans, [[thermohaline circulation]] and [[upwelling]] prevent the oceans from maintaining anoxic bottom waters. In a silled basin, the stable stratified layers only allow surface water to flow out of the basin while the deep water remains anoxic and relatively unmixed. During an intrusion of dense saltwater however, the nutrient-rich bottom water upwells, causing increased [[Primary production|productivity]] in the surface, further enhancing the nutrient trap due to [[biological pump]]ing. Rising sea level can exacerbate this process by increasing the amount of deep water entering a silled basin and enhancing estuarine circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Middelburg|first=J.

=== Warming climate ===
A warming climate increases surface temperatures of waters which effects multiple aspects of euxinic water formation. As waters warm, the [[solubility]] of [[Ocean deoxygenation|oxygen decreases]], allowing for deep anoxic waters to form more readily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hotinski|first=Roberta M.|year=2001|title=Ocean stagnation and end-Permian anoxia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235451836_Ocean_Stagnation_and_end_Permian_anoxia|journal=Geology|volume=29|pages=7–10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the warmer water causes increased respiration of organic matter leading to further oxygen depletion. Higher temperatures enhance the hydrologic cycle, increasing evaporation from bodies of water, resulting in increased precipitation. This causes higher rates of weathering of rocks and therefore higher nutrient concentrations in river outflows. The nutrients allow for more productivity resulting in more [[marine snow]] and subsequently lower oxygen in deep waters due to increased respiration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Volcanism has also been proposed to be a factor in creating euxinic conditions. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) released during [[Volcanism|volcanic]] outgassing causes [[global warming]] which has cascading effects on the formation of euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Evidence for euxinic events ==

=== Black shale ===
[[File:Black shale, Kansas City MO - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Black shale is one of the preliminary indicators of anoxia and perhaps euxinia]]
Black shales are organic rich, microlaminated sedimentary rocks often associated with bottom water anoxia. This is because anoxia slows the degradation of organic matter, allowing for greater burial in the sediments. Other evidence for anoxic burial of black shale includes the lack of [[bioturbation]], meaning that there were no organisms burrowing into the sediment because there was no oxygen for respiration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There must also be a source of organic matter for burial, generally from production near the oxic surface. Many papers discussing ancient euxinic events use the presence of black shale as a preliminary proxy for anoxic bottom waters, but it should be noted that their presence does not in and of itself indicate euxinia or even strong anoxia. Generally geochemical testing is needed to provide better evidence for conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Geochemistry ===
Some researchers study the occurrence of euxinia in ancient oceans because it was more prevalent then than it is today. Since ancient oceans cannot be directly observed, scientists use geology and chemistry to find evidence in [[sedimentary rock]] created under euxinic conditions. Some of these techniques come from studying modern examples of euxinia, while others are derived from geochemistry. Though modern euxinic environments have geochemical properties in common with ancient euxinic oceans, the physical processes causing euxinia most likely vary between the two.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Isotopes ====
[[Stable isotope ratio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can be used to infer the environmental conditions during the formation of sedimentary rock. Using [[stoichiometry]] and knowledge of [[redox]] pathways, paleogeologists can use [[isotope]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ratios of elements to determine the chemical composition of the water and sediments when burial occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945435170|title=Stable isotope geochemistry|last=Jochen.|first=Hoefs,|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319197159|oclc=945435170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur isotopes are frequently used to look for evidence of ancient euxinia. Low δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in black shales and sedimentary rocks provides positive evidence for euxinic formation conditions. The pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in euxinic basins typically has higher concentrations of light sulfur isotopes than pyrite in the modern ocean.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The reduction of sulfate to sulfide favors the lighter sulfur isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S) and becomes depleted in the heavier isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S). This lighter sulfide then bonds with Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to form FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is then partially preserved in the sediments. In most modern systems, sulfate eventually becomes limiting, and the isotopic weights of sulfur in both sulfate and sulfide (preserved as FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) become equal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Molybdenum (Mo), the most common transition metal ion in modern seawater, is also used to look for evidence for euxinia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Weathering of rocks provides an input of MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; into oceans.

Bacteria such as [[green sulfur bacteria]] (GSB) and [[purple sulfur bacteria]] (PSB), which exist where the photic zone overlaps with euxinic water masses, leave pigments behind in sediments.

==== Iron geochemistry ====
[[Pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a mineral formed by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) and bioreactive iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). In oxic bottom waters pyrite can only form in sediments where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is present. However, in iron-rich euxinic environments, pyrite formation can occur at higher rates in both the water column and in sediments due to higher concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Threfore the presence of euxinic conditions can be inferred by the ratio of pyrite-bound iron to the total iron in sediments. High ratios of pyrite-bound iron can be used as an indicator of past euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy|last2=Severmann|first2=Silke|year=2006|title=A critical look at iron paleoredox proxies: New insights from modern euxinic marine basins|url=|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=70|pages=5698–5722|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raiswell|first=R.|last2=Newton|first2=R.|last3=Wignall|first3=P.

== Euxinic events in Earth's history ==

  [[File:Timeline of euxinia in ancient oceans.png|thumb|660x660px|Presence of euxinia in the world's ancient deep oceans. According to Canfield, the deep ocean became sulfitic around 1.8 billion years ago and stayed that way for much of the boring billion. Periodic euxinia dominated through the Late Devonian Kelwasser events, and then most likely disappeared during the Carboniferous. Euxinia reemerged at the Permian-Triassic Boundary, and may have been present during the Ocean Anoxia Events of the Mesozoic. Euxinia is rare in Cenozoic oceans. Adapted from Lyons, 2008&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;]]

=== Proterozoic ===
The Proterozoic is the transition era between anoxic and oxygenated oceans. The classic model is that the end of the [[Banded iron formation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (BIFs) was due to the injection of oxygen into the deep ocean, an approximately 0.6 billion year lag behind the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holland|first=Heinrich D.|date=2006-06-29|year=|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=361|issue=1470|pages=903–915|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1838|issn=0962-8436|pmid=16754606|via=|pmc=1578726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canfield, however, argued that anoxia lasted much longer, and the end of the banded iron formations was due to the introduction of sulfide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Supporting Canfield's original hypothesis, 1.84 billion year old sedimentary records have been found in the Animike group in Canada that exhibit close to full pyritization on top of the last of the banded iron formations, showing evidence of a transition to euxinic conditions in that basin.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poulton|first=Simon W.|last2=Fralick|first2=Philip W.|last3=Canfield|first3=Donald E.|date=2004-09-09|title=The transition to a sulphidic ocean {{!}}[sim]{{!}} 1.84 billion years ago|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7005/full/nature02912.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=431|issue=7005|pages=173–177|doi=10.1038/nature02912|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In order for full pyritization to happen, nearly all of the sulfate in the water was reduced to sulfide, which stripped the iron from the water, forming pyrite. Because this basin was open to the ocean, deep euxinia was interpreted as being a widespread phenomena.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This euxinia is hypothesized to have lasted until about 0.8 billion years ago, making basin bottom euxinia a potentially widespread feature throughout the [[Boring Billion]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Further evidence for euxinia was discovered in the McArthur Basin in Australia, where similar iron chemistry was found. The degree of pyritization and the δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S were both high, supporting the presence of anoxia and sulfide, as well as the depletion of sulfate.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Yanan|last2=Canfield|first2=Donald E.|last3=Knoll|first3=Andrew H.|date=2002-02-01|title=Middle Proterozoic ocean chemistry: Evidence from the McArthur Basin, northern Australia|url=http://www.ajsonline.org/content/302/2/81|journal=American Journal of Science|language=en|volume=302|issue=2|pages=81–109|doi=10.2475/ajs.302.2.81|issn=0002-9599}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study found biomarkers for [[green sulfur bacteria]] and [[purple sulfur bacteria]] in the same area, providing further evidence for the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brocks|first=Jochen J.|last2=Love|first2=Gordon D.|last3=Summons|first3=Roger E.|last4=Knoll|first4=Andrew H.|last5=Logan|first5=Graham A.|last6=Bowden|first6=Stephen A.|date=2005-10-06|title=Biomarker evidence for green and purple sulphur bacteria in a stratified Palaeoproterozoic sea|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7060/abs/nature04068.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=437|issue=7060|pages=866–870|doi=10.1038/nature04068|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molybdenum isotopes have been used to examine the distribution of euxinia in the Proterozoic eon, and suggest that perhaps euxinia was not as widespread as Canfield initially postulated. Bottom waters may have been more widely suboxic than anoxic, and there could have been negative feedback between euxinia and the high levels of surface primary production needed to sustain euxinic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=C.|last2=Lyons|first2=T.

=== Phanerozoic ===
There is evidence for multiple euxinic events during the Phanerozoic. It is most likely that euxinia was periodic during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, but geologic data is too sparse to draw any large scale conclusions. In this eon, there is some evidence that euxinic events are potentially linked with mass extinction events including the [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]] and [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Paleozoic ====

The periodic presence of euxinic conditions in the Lower Cambrian has been supported by evidence found on the Yangtze platform in South China. Sulfur isotopes during the transition from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic give evidence for widespread euxinia, perhaps lasting throughout the Cambrian period.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Benjamin C, Timothy W Lyons, Seth a Young, Lee R Kump, Andrew H Knoll, and Matthew R Saltzman. 2010. “Geochemical Evidence for Widespread Euxinia in the Later Cambrian Ocean.” ''Nature'' 469 (7328): 80–83. doi:10.1038/nature09700.&lt;/ref&gt;  Towards the end of the Lower Cambrian, the euxinic chemocline grew deeper until euxinia was present only in the sediments, and once sulfate became limiting, conditions became anoxic instead of euxinic. Some areas eventually became oxic, while others eventually returned to euxinic for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Tatiana|last2=Strauss|first2=Harald|last3=Guo|first3=Qingjun|last4=Liu|first4=Congqiang|date=2007-10-08|title=Reconstructing marine redox conditions for the Early Cambrian Yangtze Platform: Evidence from biogenic sulphur and organic carbon isotopes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018207001800|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|series=From Snowball Earth to the Cambrian bioradiation: calibration of Ediacaran-Cambrian history in South China|volume=254|issue=1–2|pages=175–193|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geological records from the paleozoic in the Selwyn Basin in Northern Canada have also shown evidence for episodic stratification and mixing, where, using δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S, it was determined that hydrogen sulfide was more prevalent than [[sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodfellow|first=Wayne D|last2=Jonasson|first2=Ian R|year=1984|title=Data from ocean stagnation and ventilation defined by secular trends in pyrite and baritye, Selwyn Basin, Yukon|url=|journal=Geology|volume=12|pages=583–586|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was not originally attributed to euxinia, further studies found that seawater in that time likely had low concentrations of sulfate, meaning that the sulfur in the water was primarily in the form of sulfide. This combined with organic-rich black shale provide strong evidence for euxinia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowenstein|first=Tim K.|last2=Hardie|first2=Lawrence A.|last3=Timofeeff|first3=Michael N.|last4=Demicco|first4=Robert V.|title=Secular variation in seawater chemistry and the origin of calcium chloride basinal brines|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1130%2FG19728R.1|journal=Geology|volume=31|issue=10|doi=10.1130/g19728r.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is similar evidence in the black shales in the mid-continent North America from the Devonian and early Mississippian periods.

Evidence for euxinia has also been tied to the [[Kellwasser event]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the Late Devonian Extinction event. Euxinia in basinal waters in what is now central Europe (Germany, Poland, and France) persisted for part of the late Devonian, and may have spread up into shallow waters, contributing to the extinction event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=David|last2=Wignall|first2=Paul B.|last3=Racki|first3=Grzegorz|date=2004-03-01|title=Extent and duration of marine anoxia during the Frasnian–Famennian (Late Devonian) mass extinction in Poland, Germany, Austria and France|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/geological-magazine/article/div-classtitleextent-and-duration-of-marine-anoxia-during-the-frasnianfamennian-late-devonian-mass-extinction-in-poland-germany-austria-and-francediv/E23779056D0B8D8520D5A7E04FFF5B1D|journal=Geological Magazine|volume=141|issue=2|pages=173–193|doi=10.1017/S0016756804008866|issn=1469-5081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was perhaps a period of oxygenation of bottom waters during the [[Carboniferous]], most likely between the Late Devonian Extinction and the Permian-Triassic Extinction, at which point euxinia would be very rare in the paleo oceans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] may also have some ties to euxinia, with hypercapnia and hydrogen sulfide toxicity killing off many species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=K.

==== Mesozoic ====

The Mesozoic is well known for its distinct [[Ocean anoxic event|Ocean Anoxic Event]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (OAEs) which resulted in the burial of layers of black shale. Although these OAEs are not stand alone evidence for euxinia, many do contain biomarkers which support euxinic formation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Again, evidence is not universal. OAEs may have spurred the spread of existing euxinia, especially in upwelling regions or semi-restricted basins, but photic zone euxinia did not happen everywhere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Cenozoic ====
Few episodes of euxinia are evident in the sedimentary record during the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the end of the Cretaceous OAEs, it is most likely that the oceanic bottom waters have stayed oxic.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Modern euxinia ==
 
Euxinic conditions have nearly vanished from Earth's open-ocean environments, but a few small scale examples still exist today. Many of these locations share common biogeochemical characteristics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, low rates of overturning and vertical mixing of the total water column is common in euxinic bodies of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Small surface area to depth ratios allow multiple stable layers to form while limiting wind-driven overturning and thermohaline circulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, restricted mixing enhances stratified layers of high nutrient density which are reinforced by biological recycling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the chemocline, highly specialized organisms, such as green sulfur bacteria (GSB) take advantage of the strong redox potential gradient and minimal sunlight.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The only connection between the open ocean and the Black Sea is the [[Bosphorus|Bosphorus Strait]], through which dense Mediterranean waters are imported.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Subsequently, numerous rivers, such as the [[Danube]], [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Dnieper]], and [[Dniester]], drain fresh water into the Black Sea, which floats on top of the more dense Mediterranean water, causing a strong, stratified water column.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This stratification is maintained by a strong [[pycnocline]] which restricts ventilation of deep waters and results in an intermediate layer called the [[chemocline]], a sharp boundary separating oxic surface waters from anoxic bottom waters usually between 50m and 100m depth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=J.

=== Meromictic lakes ===
[[Meromictic lake]]s are poorly mixed and anoxic bodies of water with strong vertical stratification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While meromictic lakes are frequently categorized as bodies of water with the potential for euxinic conditions, many do not exhibit euxinia. Meromictic lakes are infamous for [[limnic eruption]]s.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; These events usually coincide with nearby tectonic or volcanic activity that disturbs the otherwise stable stratification of meromictic lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-663-05239-5_10|title=Natural Hazards in West and Central Africa|last=Tietze|first=Klaus|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Vieweg+Teubner Verlag|isbn=9783663052418|editor-last=Freeth|editor-first=Samuel J.|series=International Monograph Series|pages=97–107|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-663-05239-5_10|editor-last2=Ofoegbu|editor-first2=Charles O.|editor-last3=Onuoha|editor-first3=K.

[[File:Mariager fjord vinter.jpg|thumb|Mariager fjord often produces a "rotten egg" smell in the summer due to sulfur content.]]

=== North Sea fjords ===
Some [[fjord]]s develop euxinia if the connection to the open ocean is constricted, similar to the case of the Black Sea. This constriction prohibits relatively dense, oxygen-rich oceanic water from mixing with the bottom water of the fjord, which leads to stable stratified layers in the fjord.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low salinity melt water forms a lens of fresh, low density water on top of a more dense mass of bottom water.  Ground sources of sulfur are also an important cause for euxinia in fjords.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sørensen|first=Ketil B|last2=Canfield|first2=Donald E|date=2004-02-01|title=Annual fluctuations in sulfur isotope fractionation in the water column of a euxinic marine basin 1|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703703003879|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=68|issue=3|pages=503–515|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(03)00387-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Framvaren Fjord ====

This fjord was born as a glacial lake that was separated from the open ocean (the North Sea) when it was lifted during glacial rebound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A shallow channel (2m deep) was dug in 1850, providing a marginal connection to the North Sea.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A strong pycnocline separates fresh surface water from dense, saline bottom water, and this pycnolcine reduces mixing between the layers. Anoxic conditions persist below the chemocline at 20m, and the fjord has the highest levels of hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic marine world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millero|first=Frank J.|date=1991-07-01|title=The oxidation of H2S in Framvaren Fjord|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.1007/abstract|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=36|issue=5|pages=1007–1014|doi=10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.1007|issn=1939-5590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Like the Black Sea, vertical overlap of oxygen and sulfur is limited, but the decline of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S approaching the chemocline from below is indicative of oxidation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, which has been attributed to manganese and iron oxides, photo-autotrophic bacteria, and entrainment of oxygen horizontally from the boundaries of the fjord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yao|first=Wensheng|last2=Millero|first2=Frank J.|title=The chemistry of the anoxic waters in the Framvaren Fjord, Norway|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01025231|journal=Aquatic Geochemistry|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=53–88|doi=10.1007/BF01025231|issn=1380-6165}}&lt;/ref&gt; These oxidation processes are similar to those present in the Black Sea.

Two strong seawater intrusion events have occurred through the channel in recent history (1902 and 1942).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Seawater intrusions to fjords force dense, salty, oxygen-rich water into the typically anoxic, sulfidic bottom waters of euxinic fjords.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pakhomova|first=Svetlana|last2=Braaten|first2=Hans Fredrik|last3=Yakushev|first3=Evgeniy|last4=Skei|first4=Jens|date=2014-04-28|year=|title=Biogeochemical consequences of an oxygenated intrusion into an anoxic fjord|url=http://www.geochemicaltransactions.com/content/15/1/5|journal=Geochemical Transactions|language=En|volume=15|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1186/1467-4866-15-5|issn=1467-4866|pmid=24872727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events result in a temporary disturbance to the chemocline, raising the depth at which H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is detected. The breakdown of the chemocline causes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S to react with dissolved oxygen in a redox reaction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This decreases the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the biologically active photic zone which can result in basin-scale fish die-offs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The 1942 event, in particular, was strong enough to chemically reduce the vast majority of oxygen and elevate the chemocline to the air-water interface.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This caused a temporary state of total anoxia in the fjord, and resulted in dramatic fish mortality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mariager Fjord ====

This fjord is marked by a highly mobile chemocline with a depth that is thought to be related to temperature effects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Local reports of strong rotten egg smell- the smell of sulfur- during numerous summers around the fjord provide evidence that, like the Framvaren fjord, the chemocline has breached the surface of the fjord at least 5 times in the last century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sediments export during these events increased the concentrations of dissolved phosphates, inorganic bioavailable nitrogen, and other nutrients, resulting in a [[harmful algal bloom]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Cariaco Basin ===
The [[Cariaco Basin]] in Venezuela has been used to study the cycle of organic material in euxinic marine environments.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Werne|first=Josef P.|last2=Lyons|first2=Timothy W.|last3=Hollander|first3=David J.|last4=Formolo|first4=Michael J.|last5=Sinninghe Damsté|first5=Jaap S.|date=2003-04-15|title=Reduced sulfur in euxinic sediments of the Cariaco Basin: sulfur isotope constraints on organic sulfur formation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254102003935|journal=Chemical Geology|series=Isotopic records of microbially mediated processes|volume=195|issue=1–4|pages=159–179|doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(02)00393-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in productivity coincident with post glacial nutrient loading probably caused a transition from oxic to anoxic and subsequently euxinic conditions around 14.5 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W|last2=Werne|first2=Josef P|last3=Hollander|first3=David J|last4=Murray|first4=R.

The '''eyespot apparatus''' (or ''[[stigma (anatomy)|stigma]]'') is a photoreceptive [[organelle]] found in the flagellate or (motile) cells of [[green algae]] and other [[microorganism|unicellular]] [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms such as [[euglenid]]s. It allows the cells to sense [[light]] direction and intensity and respond to it by swimming either towards the light (positive [[phototaxis]]) or away from the light (negative phototaxis).  A related response ("photoshock" or photophobic response) occurs when cells are briefly exposed to high light intensity, causing the cell to stop, briefly swim backwards, then change swimming direction. Eyespot-mediated light perception helps the cells in finding an environment with optimal light conditions for photosynthesis. Eyespots are the simplest and most common "eyes" found in nature, composed of [[photoreceptor protein|photoreceptors]] and areas of bright orange-red pigment granules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kreimer | first1 = G.| title = The green algal eyespot apparatus: A primordial visual system and more? | doi = 10.1007/s00294-008-0224-8 | journal = [[Current Genetics]]| volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–43 | year = 2009| pmid =  19107486| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Signals relayed from the eyespot photoreceptors result in alteration of the beating pattern of the flagella, generating a phototactic response.&lt;ref name="Hegemann"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hegemann P |title=Vision in microalgae |journal=Planta |volume=203 |issue=3 |pages=265–74 |year=1997 |pmid=9431675 |doi=10.1007/s004250050191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microscopic structure==
Under the [[light microscope]], eyespots appear as dark, orange-reddish spots or ''stigmata''. They get their color from [[carotenoid]] pigments contained in bodies called pigment granules.  The photoreceptors are found in the [[plasma membrane]] overlaying the pigmented bodies.

The eyespot apparatus of ''[[Euglena]]'' comprises the paraflagellar body connecting the eyespot to the [[flagellum]]. In [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], the eyespot apparatus appears as a highly ordered lamellar structure formed by membranous rods in a helical arrangement.&lt;ref name="Wolken"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolken J |title=Euglena: the photoreceptor system for phototaxis |journal=J Protozool |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=518–22 |year=1977 |pmid=413913 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1977.tb01004.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'', the eyespot is part of the [[chloroplast]] and takes on the appearance of a membranous sandwich structure. It is assembled from [[chloroplast membrane]]s (outer, inner, and thylakoid membranes) and [[carotenoid]]-filled granules overlaid by [[plasma membrane]]. The stacks of granules act as a [[quarter-wave plate]], reflecting incoming photons back to the overlying photoreceptors, while shielding the photoreceptors from light coming from other directions.  It disassembles during [[cell division]] and reforms in the daughter cells in an asymmetric fashion in relation to the [[cytoskeleton]].  This asymmetric positioning of the eyespot in the cell is essential for proper phototaxis.&lt;ref name="Dieckmann"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dieckmann C |title=Eyespot placement and assembly in the green alga Chlamydomonas |journal=BioEssays |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=410–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12655648 |doi=10.1002/bies.10259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eyespot proteins==
The most critical eyespot proteins are the [[photoreceptor protein]]s that sense light. The photoreceptors found in unicellular organisms fall into two main groups: [[flavoprotein]]s and [[retinylidene protein]]s (rhodopsins). Flavoproteins are characterized by containing [[Flavin group|flavin]] molecules as [[chromophore]]s, whereas retinylidene proteins contain [[retinal]]. The photoreceptor protein in ''Euglena'' is likely a flavoprotein.&lt;ref name="Wolken"/&gt; In contrast, ''Chlamydomonas'' phototaxis is mediated by archaeal-type rhodopsins.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Suzuki T, Yamasaki K, Fujita S, Oda K, Iseki M, Yoshida K, Watanabe M, Daiyasu H, Toh H, Asamizu E, Tabata S, Miura K, Fukuzawa H, Nakamura S, Takahashi T |title=Archaeal-type rhodopsins in Chlamydomonas: model structure and intracellular localization |journal=Biochem Biophys Res Commun |volume=301 |issue=3 |pages=711–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12565839 |doi=10.1016/S0006-291X(02)03079-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides photoreceptor proteins, eyespots contain a large number of structural, metabolic and signaling proteins. The eyespot [[proteome]] of ''Chlamydomonas'' cells consists of roughly 200 different proteins.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidt M, Gessner G, Luff M, Heiland I, Wagner V, Kaminski M, Geimer S, Eitzinger N, Reissenweber T, Voytsekh O, Fiedler M, Mittag M, Kreimer G |title=Proteomic analysis of the eyespot of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii provides novel insights into its components and tactic movements |journal=Plant Cell |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=1908–30 |year=2006 |pmid=16798888 |doi=10.1105/tpc.106.041749 |pmc=1533972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photoreception and signal transduction==
The ''Euglena'' photoreceptor was identified as a blue-light-activated [[adenylyl cyclase]].&lt;ref name="Iseki"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Iseki M, Matsunaga S, Murakami A, Ohno K, Shiga K, Yoshida K, Sugai M, Takahashi T, Hori T, Watanabe M |title=A blue-light-activated adenylyl cyclase mediates photoavoidance in Euglena gracilis |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=6875 |pages=1047–51 |year=2002 |pmid=11875575 |doi=10.1038/4151047a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excitation of this receptor protein results in the formation of [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) as a [[second messenger system|second messenger]]. Chemical [[signal transduction]] ultimately triggers changes in flagellar beat patterns and cell movement.

The archaeal-type rhodopsins of ''Chlamydomonas'' contain an all-''trans'' retinylidene chromatophore which undergoes [[photoisomerization]] to a 13-''cis'' isomer. This activates a photoreceptor channel, leading to a change in [[membrane potential]] and cellular calcium ion concentration.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"/&gt; Photoelectric signal transduction ultimately triggers changes in flagellar strokes and thus cell movement.&lt;ref name="Hegemann"/&gt;

The '''Faculty of Political Science, [[Chulalongkorn University]]''', is regarded as one of the oldest modern higher education institutions in [[Thailand]]. It is the first faculty of political science in Thailand and is considered as one of the best according to the statistics of student who had highest score on admission system chose to study there for 4 years in a row (2010-2013).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.matichon.co.th/news_detail.php?newsid=1368077139&amp;grpid=03&amp;catid=19&amp;subcatid=1903&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of Thailand's leading institutions for [[political science]] training. Many senior government officials, politicians, diplomats and prominent academics are the graduates of the Faculty. Due to its logo and colour, the Faculty, students and its graduates are also called by the nickname, "Singh Dam" (Black Singha).

==History==
The Faculty of Political Science was originally established in 1899 as the School of Civil Servant Training by [[King Chulalongkorn]]. Students were selected from those who passed basic educational training and would be educated about [[public administration]] in the school. They were also required to do internship in different governmental agencies after completion and received certificate for specialised skill afterwards. This School had expanded and its graduates mostly worked as royal [[page (occupation)|page]] which allowed these young men to be close to the central authority and became accustomed to senior officials. As a general practice during that time, new government officials would start their career at the Department of Royal Pages before being promoted to work in other departments. Therefore, [[King Chulalongkorn]] renamed the School to the Royal Pages School to reflect this reality in 1902.

In 1910, [[King Vajiravudh]] viewed that training new graduates to work for the Ministry of Interior was not sufficient for increasing public services in other areas; therefore, he ordered and financially supported the expansion of the Royal Pages School to include many areas of trainings. The School was renamed again to "The Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn" on 1 January 1910. The general curriculum was four-year training of which the first three were for general education leaving the last year for internship. However, the School was upgraded and renamed [[Chulalongkorn University]] on 26 March 1916. The newly established [[Chulalongkorn University]] was then administered in 4 faculties, that is, the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Arts and Science, and the Faculty of Public Administration.
[[File:PolSciCUFront.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|Samranraj Borirak Building, the first building of the faculty ]]

In 1929 after the promulgation of the new Civil Service Act the popularity of the Faculty of Public Administration decreased significantly. The Act did not require applicants to hold university qualification to apply for first level entry of public service. Holders of ordinary secondary school certificate (equivalent to Grade 11) could also enter to the same level, while the students choosing to enter the Faculty had to pass advanced secondary certificate (equivalent to Grade 12) plus 3 years at the university before starting their career. The nadir of its popularity could be seen by only 35 students enrolling in that year. Therefore, the Ministry of Education proposed to [[King Prajadhipok]] to discontinue the Faculty after the completion of its last class. The King initially endorsed the proposal. However, many government officials especially from the Ministry of Interior appealed to the King to reconsider his decision as they still saw the necessity and usefulness of producing graduates in this field. The committee for reconsidering this issue was set up and finally agreed that the Faculty should be continued on the proviso that its admission and curriculum must be revamped. The name of the Faculty was changed to the School of Civil Service and directly overseen by the Office of the President of Chulalongkorn University. In 1933, the Law School of the Ministry of Justice was incorporated into the School, thereafter renamed together the "Faculty of Law and Political Science.

Following the collapse of the absolute monarchy in 1932, the [[University of Moral and Political Science]] (later called [[Thammasat University]]) was established. Then, the Faculty of Law and Political Science of Chulalongkorn University was transferred to be under this new university. The Faculty of Law and Political Science was therefore temporarily disappeared from Chulalongkorn University's academic structure.

In 1948, the government viewed that there was still need for more graduates for public administration, then agreed to re-establish the Faculty of Political Science in Chulalongkorn University in that same year. The new phase of the Faculty of Political Science then began and has progressively developed until today.

The then Faculty of Political Science comprised 3 divisions, that is, Political Science Division, Public Finance Division, and Law Division. Later on, Public Finance Division was merged with Economics Division of the Faculty of Commerce and Accountancy to become the Faculty of Economics in 1971. Also, Law Division was upgraded to the Faculty of Law in 1972. After these splits, the Faculty has mainly focused in teaching modern [[political science]] discipline.

==Academic Administration==
Currently, the Faculty of Political Science organises its academic disciplines into 4 departments, that is,&lt;br /&gt;
1. Department of [[Government]]&lt;br /&gt;
2. Department of [[International Relations]]&lt;br /&gt;
3. Department of [[Public Administration]]&lt;br /&gt;
4. Department of [[Sociology]] and [[Anthropology]]

The Faculty offers undergraduate ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) and postgraduate degrees ([[Master of Arts|MA]], [[Master of Public Administration|MPA]] and [[PhD]]), including an international master programme in International Development Studies taught in English.

There are also a number of research centres under the Faculty including Policy and Management Development Institute (PMDI), Institute of Security and International Studies (ISIS), Public Enterprise Institute (PEI), Centre for Social Development Studies (CSDS), Institute of Local Government Initiatives (ILGI), and Thai Politics Research Centre (TPRC).

The Faculty has also run a prominent academic journal namely Journal of Social Science for over 35 years. The published articles are both written in Thai and English.

==Logo==
The black singha is used as a symbol of the dedicated leader. The black colour symbolises the colour of the neck of [[Shiva]] who drinks the poison churned up from the world ocean ([[Halahala]]) to protect and save all creatures. (In fact, the actual colour of Shiva's neck in Hindu mythology is deeply dark blue or "nila". That's why one of his names is Nilakantha or "having a blue-coloured neck". However, "nila" in Thai (normally pronounced "nin") becomes a simply black colour). Singha is a mythical animal that rules the [[Himmapan]] forest representing the great ruler or leader. These symbolic meanings convey the fact that the Faculty aims at producing qualified graduates who will be leading figures in the society in any respect with passion and dedication to help improve people's quality of life as their foremost principle.

The '''Gallatin School of Individualized Study''' (commonly known as '''Gallatin''') is a small interdisciplinary college within [[New York University]]. Students design their own interdisciplinary program that meets their specific interests and career goals. Coursework can be taken at any of the schools that comprise NYU in addition to the school's own offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/07/degrees-are-getting-a-makeover/?_r=0| title=Creating Your Own Major, From ‘Keeping It Real’ to ‘Grand Romantic Gestures’| author=Lily Altivina| date=February 7, 2012| publisher=The New York Times| access-date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Founded in 1972 as the '''University Without Walls''', the school was renamed the Gallatin Division in 1976 after [[Albert Gallatin]], [[Secretary of the Treasury]] under [[Thomas Jefferson]], and the founder of NYU. In 1995, the school took its current name, The Gallatin School of Individualized Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallatin.nyu.edu/about/facts.html|title=Gallatin Leadership and Facts Page|last=|first=|date=|website=http://gallatin.nyu.edu/|publisher=NYU Gallatin|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert London]] was the school's first dean through 1992. The Gallatin building is situated within the [[Campus of New York University]] just east of [[Washington Square Park]] at 1 Washington Place.

The Gallatin School's facilities on the corner of Washington Place and Broadway underwent a redesign from 2007-2008. It was the first renovation project at NYU to achieve [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification. The project earned a LEED Gold certification for the renovation of five floors (approximately 32,000 square feet) of the existing building, including the construction of a theater, art gallery, classrooms, studios, and offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/gallatin/leed/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The main building is named after Georgina Bloomberg.

==Academics==

===Curriculum===

Gallatin students develop a concentration, as opposed to a [[Academic major|major]], that is individualized to suit their interests and goals. A concentration can encompass multiple areas of study and often involves taking courses in various schools within NYU.

Rather than prescribing a specific set of courses (e.g., English 101, Western Civ), Gallatin employs a form of [[student-centered learning]] in which students are free to choose courses they are interested in but are expected to take responsibility for their own academic growth. There are, however, general requirements for graduation. Among these are:

*Gallatin students are required to take 25% of their courses within Gallatin.  Options include writing and arts workshops, [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] seminars reaching across the [[liberal arts]], community learning, [[Tutorials#Academia|tutorials]], [[internship]]s, and independent studies.
*Foundation courses, either the Liberal Arts Foundation (8 Humanities credits, 8 Social Science credits, 4 Mathematics or Science credits) or Historical and Cultural Foundation (4 Premodern credits, 4 Early Modern credits, and 4 Global Cultures credits). The two sets of foundation requirements may overlap and fulfill more than one requirement at once.&lt;ref name="nyu"&gt;http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/requirements.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*First year requirements: Students take a First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar, a First-Year Writing Seminar, and a First-Year Research Seminar (numerous topics are available). 
*Second year requirements: The student writes their Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration (IAPC), an essay which charts their studies thus far and describes the plan for their continuation and refinement.
*Third year requirements: The student writes their Rationale, an essay describing their planned course of study for their final year accompanied by a list of 20-25 books that will be discussed during the Colloquium (see below).  The Rationale is reviewed and approved by two faculty members.
*Fourth year/graduation requirement: The student must successfully pass their Colloquium, an intensive [[oral examination]] during which the student engages with a panel of three faculty for approximately two hours about their concentration and concomitant literature.&lt;ref name="nyu" /&gt;

===Advising===

Because Gallatin focuses on students at the individual level, advising is a major component of the program. Each student is assigned two advisors: a class advisor who serves the needs of a full grade level (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors) and an academic advisor, who is more involved at the individual level with helping students shape their concentrations. The academic advisors help identify the interests of their advisees, approve class schedules, attend advisee Colloquiums, and serve as the primary source of advising. Academic advisors are usually faculty members at Gallatin who share similar interests with advisee students, but advisors can come from any of the schools within NYU across several disciplines. Students can request to change academic advisors.

===Colloquium===

In order to qualify for graduation, all students in the Gallatin undergraduate program must successfully complete a final oral examination called the Colloquium. The Colloquium is an intellectual conversation among four people (the student, the student's adviser, and two other members of the faculty) about a selection of books representing several academic disciplines and historical periods. The Colloquium provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their Gallatin concentration and to synthesize various experiences studying books, taking courses, doing independent studies and internships into an integrated discussion about several books and themes. In preparing for the Colloquium, each student creates a book list of twenty to twenty-five works and writes a brief paper known as the Rationale which describes the themes the student plans to discuss in the Colloquium.

==Student life==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
There are a variety of student-run organizations at Gallatin that span a vast array of interests for both undergraduate and graduate students of the school:

* '''Dancers Choreographers Alliance (DCA)''' provides student choreographers with the opportunity to create their work with fellow student dancers. DCA also allows other members of the performance community to participate in roles such as musicians, composers, and artistic managers.
* '''Gallatin Arts Festival (GAF)''' is a week-long community-wide celebration of the unique artistry and interdisciplinary scholarship of NYU’s Gallatin School. The festival features over 50 students presenting work in the visual and performing arts.
* '''Gallatin Cookies and Coloring''', invites students to eat cookies and color coloring books. The club provides an un-structured forum for students to socialize and relax. Under the current leadership, the club has hosted special events such as body painting and the appreciation of mid-70s feminist coloring books.
* '''Gallatin Theatre Troupe (GTT)''' exists as a collective of students interested in writing, directing, managing, and acting in theatre. GTT serves as a place to discuss theatre and attend shows.
* '''Students of Color &amp; Allies (SOCA)''' serves as a support and networking group that connects students within Gallatin for social outings, intellectual activities, and academic workshops that address common interests. SOCA now organizes events aimed at enhancing the Gallatin experience for students of color.
* '''''The Gallatin Review''''' publishes the poetry, prose, essays, and visual art of students and faculty. 
* '''''The Gallatin Research Journal (GRJ)'''''  is a student-run publication devoted to showcasing the excellence achieved by Gallatin students in the arena of academic non-fiction work. 
* '''''Journal of Global Affairs (JGA)''''' creates, produces, and publishes a scholarly undergraduate journal that showcases articles and artwork pertaining to all aspects of global affairs. JGA provides a forum for undergraduate students at NYU to publish their work in a scholarly journal.
* '''Gallatin Business Club (GBC)''' provides resources, such as seminars, speakers, and group discussion on a variety of business topics. This club is for students interested in the corporate world. The club is an outlet for students to discuss current events in business and provides networking opportunities through speakers in a variety of fields.
* '''NADI: Middle Eastern Studies Society''' endeavors to create an intellectual community for students of the Middle East at Gallatin by means of extra-curricular programming and an annual journal. The organization shares information about Middle Eastern Studies courses, study abroad programs and internships.
* '''Gallatin Math and Science Society''' allows students to advise each other on studying math and science within the Gallatin's requirements. G-MASS is also works to integrate science-based events into the Gallatin calendar.

==History==
[[File:GeologicalSurveyIndia1870.jpg|thumb|left|Earliest members of the [[Geological Survey of India|GSI]] and [[British Geological Survey|BGS]] in 1851.]]

As early as 1836–51, the [[British monarchy|British crown]] [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] decided to set up the geological survey to explore the [[British Indian Empire]] under the British geologist [[David Hiram Williams|David Williams]] who later founded the [[Geological Survey of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0007/bsb00079409/images/ copy in Bavarian State Library (also Horizontal and Vertical Sections)]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of Pakistan from the [[British Indian Empire]], the [[Geological Survey of India]]'s north-west branch, staff and assets were evolved into creating to Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP).&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"&gt;{{cite book|last=editor|first=Richard J. Ward|title=The challenge of development : theory and practice in human resource management|year=2008|publisher=AldineTransaction|location=Piscataway, N.J.|isbn=978-0202362267|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQypxEfL8XEC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=geological+survey+of+pakistan+1947#v=onepage&amp;q=geological%20survey%20of%20pakistan%201947&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its establishment, the GSP had consisted of only six geologist and two [[chemist]]s under British scientist H.L. Crookshank, who was at that time was the most senior scientist working.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; Immediately, H.L. Crookshank was appointed first director general of GSP which he remained until 1955. Under Crookshank, the technical staff was increased to 30 geoscientists in 1948.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; In its formative years, the GSP did the pioneering work in hydrogeology and [[Engineering geology|engineering]] but the efforts were transfer to engineering units of the [[Pakistan Military|military]].&lt;ref name="archives of the GSP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff editor |title=Historical perspective |url=http://gsp.gov.pk/about/historical_prespective.html |work=Govt.

Due to these activities, it increased the operational, scientific capabilities, and expansion of facilities of the GSP by 1956; it became one of the pioneering scientific institution of the government.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; In 1955, English geologist, E.R. Gee, took over the GSP who initiated a massive expansion programme for GSP, including engineering, photogeology sections, as well as systematic publications journals were established. In 1959, the construction of new headquarters in [[Quetta]] was completed with Dr. N.M. Khan becoming first native GSP's director.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt;

In the 2000s, the GSP gained international and public prominence when its scientists discovered and unearthed the first ever dinosaur fossils in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"/&gt; The remains were thought to be around  ~70 million years old and were found by geologists mapping the Barkhan district of the country's arid Balochistan province.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"/&gt; The specimens include legs and vertebrae.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title=First dinosaur find in Pakistan|newspaper=BBC Pakistan|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GSP publications===

The GSP researchers, engineers, technicians, and scientists publish the results of their science in a variety of ways.&lt;ref name="Geological Survey, Research"/&gt; Many researchers publish their science in peer-reviewed scientific journals as well as in one of a variety of series that includes series for preliminary results, maps data, and final results. All publications are published by the GSP and are available as public domains.&lt;ref name="Geological Survey, Research"&gt;{{cite web|first=Staff|title=Latest Research Publications|url=http://www.gsp.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56:latest-research-publications&amp;catid=2:publicationnews|work=Govt Pakistan|publisher=Geological Survey, Research|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accelerated increase in environment===
{{Main article|2005 Pakistan earthquake|2010 Pakistan floods|2012 Siachen Glacier avalanche}}

In 2006, the Geological Survey's two scientists published an assessed report, predicting the [[2010 Pakistan floods|hydrological threat]] posed to the country.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=David|title=Flash flood threat to Pakistan quake survivors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/feb/11/pakistan.naturaldisasters|accessdate=18 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The survey was conducted immediately after the [[2005 Pakistan earthquake|devastated earthquake]] in 2005, and the GSP's scientists began to study the hazards in the region, which were still geologically unstable.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

In 2009, the GSP submitted another report that recommended the potentially hazardous areas of [[Northern Pakistan]] where the earthquake and seismic activities were suspected. The survey also found out that the earthquake cracks were found in all over the [[Atta Abad lake]] region. The GSP declared the eastern part of the [[Atta Abad lake|Atta Abad]] as "High Hazard" area, and recommendations were submitted to evacuate the area.&lt;ref name="GSP Pakistan, 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Causative Mechanisms of Hunza Valley|url=http://www.ndma.gov.pk/Documents/Hunza_Landslide_Report/Report%20of%20Geological%20Survey%20of%20Pakistan%20in%20Pre%20disaster%20period%20of%20Hunza%20Attabad%20Landslide.pdf|publisher=GSP Pakistan, 2009|accessdate=18 January 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Astrophysical Observatory "GRANAT"''' (usually known as '''Granat'''; {{lang-ru|Гранат}}), was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] (later [[Russia]]n) [[space observatory]] developed in collaboration with [[France]], [[Denmark]] and [[Bulgaria]]. It was launched on 1 December 1989 aboard a [[Proton (rocket)|Proton rocket]] and placed in a [[Orbital eccentricity|highly eccentric]] four-day [[orbit]], of which three were devoted to observations. It operated for almost nine years.

In September 1994, after nearly five years of directed observations, the gas supply for its [[Attitude dynamics and control|attitude control]] was exhausted and the observatory was placed in a non-directed survey mode. Transmissions finally ceased on 27 November 1998.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

With seven different instruments on board, Granat was designed to observe the universe at energies ranging from [[X-ray]] to [[gamma ray]]. Its main instrument, SIGMA, was capable of imaging both hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray sources. The PHEBUS instrument was meant to study gamma-ray bursts and other transient X-Ray sources. Other experiments such as ART-P were intended to image X-Ray sources in the 35 to 100&amp;nbsp;[[Kiloelectronvolt|keV]] range. One instrument, WATCH, was designed to monitor the sky continuously and alert the other instruments to new or interesting X-Ray sources. The ART-S spectrometer covered the X-ray energy range while the KONUS-B and TOURNESOL experiments covered both the X-ray and gamma ray spectrum.

== Spacecraft ==
Granat was a three-axis-stabilized spacecraft and the last of the [[4MV]] Bus produced by the [[Lavochkin|Lavochkin Scientific Production Association]]. It was similar to the [[Astron (spacecraft)|Astron]] observatory which was functional from 1983 to 1989; for this reason, the spacecraft was originally known as the Astron 2. It weighed 4.4 [[Tonne|metric ton]]s and carried almost 2.3 metric tons of international scientific instrumentation. Granat stood 6.5&amp;nbsp;m tall and had a total span of 8.5 m across its [[solar array]]s. The power made available to the scientific instruments was approximately 400&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]].&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt;

== Launch and orbit ==
[[Image:Proton with Granat.jpg|thumb|left|Proton launch vehicle carrying Granat]]

The spacecraft was launched on 1 December 1989 aboard a [[Proton-K]] from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakh SSR]]. It was placed in a [[Orbital eccentricity|highly eccentric]] 98-hour orbit with an initial [[apogee]]/[[perigee]] of 202,480&amp;nbsp;km/1,760&amp;nbsp;km respectively and an inclination of 51.9 degrees.&lt;ref name="table"/&gt; This meant that solar and lunar perturbations would significantly increase the orbits inclination while reducing its eccentricity, such that the orbit had become near-circular by the time Granat completed its directed observations in September 1994. (By 1991, the perigee had increased to 20,000&amp;nbsp;km; by September 1994, the apogee/perigee was 59,025&amp;nbsp;km{{\}}144,550&amp;nbsp;km at an inclination of 86.7 degrees.)

Three days out of the four-day orbit were devoted to observations.&lt;ref name="IKI"/&gt; After over nine years in orbit, the observatory finally [[atmospheric reentry|reentered]] the Earth's atmosphere on May 25, 1999.&lt;ref name="Reentry"/&gt;

== Instrumentation ==

===SIGMA===
[[Image:Granat sigma layout.gif|thumb|SIGMA instrument]]

The hard X-ray and low-energy gamma-ray SIGMA [[telescope]] was a collaboration between [[Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements|CESR]] (Toulouse) and [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA]] (Saclay). It covered the energy range 35–1300&amp;nbsp;keV,&lt;ref name="SIGMA"/&gt; with an effective area of 800&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a maximum sensitivity field of view of ~5°&amp;times;5°. The maximum [[angular resolution]] was 15&amp;nbsp;arcmin.&lt;ref name=Revnivtsev2004/&gt; The energy resolution was 8% at 511&amp;nbsp;keV.&lt;ref name=IKI/&gt; Its imaging capabilities were derived from the association of a coded mask and a position sensitive detector based on the Anger camera principle.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===ART-P===
[[Image:Granat ART-P.gif|thumb|left|ART-P instrument]]
The ART-P X-ray telescope was the responsibility of the [[Russian Space Research Institute|IKI]] in [[Moscow]]. The instrument covered the energy range 4 to 60&amp;nbsp;keV for imaging and 4 to 100&amp;nbsp;keV for spectroscopy and timing. There were four identical modules of the ART-P telescope, each consisting of a position sensitive [[Wire chamber|multi-wire proportional counter (MWPC)]] together with a URA coded mask. Each module had an effective area of approximately 600&amp;nbsp;cm², producing a [[field of view]] of 1.8° by 1.8°. The angular resolution was 5 [[Minute of arc|arcmin]]; temporal and energy resolutions were 3.9&amp;nbsp;[[Millisecond|ms]] and 22% at 6&amp;nbsp;keV, respectively.&lt;ref name="ART-P"/&gt; The instrument achieved a sensitivity of 0.001 of the [[Crab nebula]] source (= 1 "mCrab") in an eight-hour exposure. The maximum time resolution was 4&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IKI/&gt;

===ART-S===
The ART-S X-ray spectrometer, also built by the IKI, covered the energy range 3 to 100&amp;nbsp;keV. Its field of view was 2° by 2°. The instrument consisted of four detectors based on [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] MWPCs, making an effective area of 2,400&amp;nbsp;cm² at 10&amp;nbsp;keV and 800&amp;nbsp;cm² at 100&amp;nbsp;keV. The time resolution was 200 [[microsecond]]s.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===PHEBUS===
The PHEBUS experiment was designed by [[Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements|CESR (Toulouse)]] to record high energy transient events in the range 100&amp;nbsp;keV to 100&amp;nbsp;MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated [[electronics]]. Each detector consisted of a [[bismuth germanate]] (BGO) crystal 78&amp;nbsp;mm in [[diameter]] by 120&amp;nbsp;mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4[[Pi|π]] [[steradian]]s. The burst mode was triggered when the count rate in the 0.1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;MeV energy range exceeded the background level by 8 &lt;!--explain:--&gt;[[sigma]] in either 0.25 or 1.0 seconds. There were 116 &lt;!--explain:--&gt;energy channels.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===WATCH===
Starting in January 1990, four WATCH instruments, designed by the [[Danish Space Research Institute]], were in operation on the Granat observatory. The instruments could localize bright sources in the 6 to 180&amp;nbsp;keV range to within 0.5° using a Rotation Modulation [[Collimator]]. Taken together, the instruments' three fields of view covered approximately 75% of the sky. The energy resolution was 30% [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] at 60&amp;nbsp;keV. During quiet periods, count rates in two energy bands (6 to 15 and 15 to 180&amp;nbsp;keV) were accumulated for 4, 8, or 16 seconds, depending on onboard computer memory availability. During a burst or transient event, count rates were accumulated with a [[Temporal resolution|time resolution]] of 1 second per 36 &lt;!--See previous section:--&gt;energy channels.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===KONUS-B===
The KONUS-B instrument, designed by the [[Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], consisted of seven detectors distributed around the spacecraft that responded to [[photon]]s of 10&amp;nbsp;keV to 8&amp;nbsp;MeV energy. They consisted of [[Sodium iodide|NaI]](Tl) [[Gamma ray spectroscopy#Scintillator Detector|scintillator crystal]]s 200&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter by 50&amp;nbsp;mm thick behind a [[Beryllium|Be]] entrance window. The side surfaces were protected by a 5&amp;nbsp;mm thick lead layer. The burst detection threshold was 500 to 50 [[Joule|microjoules]] per square meter (5&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10{{smallsup|-7}} to 5&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10{{smallsup|-8}} erg/cm²), depending on the burst spectrum and [[rise time]]. [[electromagnetic spectrum|Spectra]] were taken in two 31-channel [[pulse height analyzer]]s (PHAs), of which the first eight were measured with 1/16&amp;nbsp;s time resolution and the remaining with variable time resolutions depending on the count rate. The range of resolutions covered 0.25 to 8&amp;nbsp;s.

The KONUS-B instrument operated from 11 December 1989 until 20 February 1990. Over that period, the "on" time for the experiment was 27 days. Some 60 solar flares and 19 cosmic gamma-ray bursts were detected.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===TOURNESOL===
The French TOURNESOL instrument consisted of four proportional counters and two [[Photodetector|optical detector]]s. The proportional counters detected photons between 2&amp;nbsp;keV and 20&amp;nbsp;MeV in a 6° by 6° field of view. The visible detectors had a field of view of 5° by 5°. The instrument was designed to look for optical counterparts of high-energy burst sources, as well as performing [[Gamma spectroscopy|spectral analysis]] of the high-energy events.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

== Science results ==
Over the initial four years of directed observations, Granat observed many galactic and extra-galactic X-ray sources with emphasis on the deep imaging and spectroscopy of the [[galactic center]], broad-band observations of [[black hole]] candidates, and [[Soft X-ray transient|X-ray novae]]. After 1994, the observatory was switched to survey mode and carried out a sensitive all-sky survey in the 40 to 200&amp;nbsp;keV energy band.

Some of the highlights included:
* A very deep imaging (more than 5 million seconds duration) of the galactic center region.&lt;ref name="IKI Sigma"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hea.iki.rssi.ru/GRANAT/sigma/sigma.html |title=SIGMA Telescope |publisher=[[IKI RAN]] |accessdate=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discovery of [[electron]]-[[positron]] annihilation lines from the galactic [[microquasar]] 1E1740-294 and the [[GRS 1124-683|X-ray Nova Muscae]].&lt;ref name="NASA2"/&gt;
* Study of spectra and time variability of black hole candidates.&lt;ref name="NASA2"/&gt;
* Across eight years of observations, Granat discovered some twenty new X-ray sources, i.e. candidate [[black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s. Consequently, their designations begin with "GRS" meaning "GRANAT source".&lt;ref name="IKI"/&gt; Examples are [[GRS 1915+105]] (the first [[microquasar]] discovered in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]]) and [[GRS 1124-683]].&lt;ref name="IKI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Revnivtsev2004"&gt;M.G. Revnivtsev, R.A. Sunyaev, M.R. Gilfanov, E.M. Churazov, A. Goldwurm, J. Paul, P. Mandrou and J. P. Roques "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/p461k5k336p11568 A hard X-ray sky survey with the SIGMA telescope of the GRANAT observatory]", (2004) ''[[Astronomy Letters]]'', vol. 30, p.527-533&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the dissolution of the Soviet Union ==
After the end of the [[Soviet Union]], two problems arose for the project. The first was geopolitical in nature: the main spacecraft control center was located at the [[Yevpatoria]] facility in the [[Crimea]] region. This control center was significant in the Soviet space program, being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70&amp;nbsp;m [[dish antenna]]. With the breakup of the Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated by ethnic Russians, found itself part of the newly independent [[Ukraine]] and the center was put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt;

The main and most urgent problem, however, was in finding funds to support the continued operation of the spacecraft amid the spending crunch in post-Soviet Russia. The [[CNES|French space agency]], having already contributed significantly to the project (both scientifically and financially), took upon itself to fund the continuing operations directly.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt;

'''Hay Swamp''' (Hay Swamp Management Area) is a provincially significant [[wetland]] complex, 1839 hectares (4544 acres) in size, located in parts of the central land areas of the municipalities of [[Bluewater, Ontario|Bluewater]] and [[South Huron, Ontario|South Huron]], in [[southwestern Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Approximately {{convert|13|km|mi|sp=us}} in length and {{convert|2|km|mi|sp=us}} in width, at its widest point; it consists of 15 extensively forested individual wetlands, situated on either side, of sections of both the upper drainage of the [[Ausable River (Lake Huron)|Ausable River]] and its tributary, Black Creek.

Hay Swamp is situated at the northern limit of the [[Carolinian forest|Carolinian Biotic Province]] and is categorized as consisting of 98% [[swamp]] and 2% [[marsh]]land. Apart from the Ausable and the Black, its primary source of water is considered to be the local [[Wyoming Moraine]] [[aquifer]]. Hay Swamp is an important regional habitat for wildlife populations including [[white-tailed deer]], [[great blue heron]], ducks, geese, as well as a significant  [[beaver]] presence. The swamp is also home to several plant [[Species at Risk Act|species at risk]], including green dragon and Riddell's goldenrod. Endangered fish and mussel species present in Hay Swamp include, eastern [[Ammocrypta|sand darter]], greenside darter, [[northern riffleshell]], snuffbox, wavy-rayed lampmussel, rainbow mussel and kidneyshell.

Historic logging operations, as well as continuing intensive drainage practices to obtain access to the rich underlying organic [[soil]]s of the swamp, have affected its overall size and health as a [[Habitat (ecology)|natural habitat]]. Since the Ausable River only partially drains the swamp on an ongoing basis, Hay Swamp acts as a natural water 'storage basin', guarding against large-scale [[flood]]ing in other areas downstream and helping to maintain and moderate [[baseflow]] conditions during the summer months. By doing so it improves both the overall [[water quality]] in the Ausable system and aids local fish, bird and wildlife populations during the times of the year when water sources that are available for local wildlife are at a premium. The swamp contains several sites of abandoned 19th and early 20th century farms, including the location of the former community of [[Sodom, Ontario|Sodom]]. Hay Swamp (Hay Swamp Management Area) is administered by the [[Conservation Authority (Canada)|Ausable Bayfield Conservation Authority]].

It was developed by [[Eugene Garfield]], the founder of the Institute for Scientific Information and the inventor of important information retrieval tools such as ''[[Current Contents]]'' and the ''[[Science Citation Index]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 21 July 2008 from http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Purpose==
The main purpose of the software is to make it easier for individuals to perform bibliometric analysis and visualization tasks. [[Bibliometrics|Bibliometric]] analysis is the use of the bibliographic information (titles, authors, dates, author addresses, references, etc.) that describe published items to measure and otherwise study various aspects of a specific field of scholarly endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Apriliyanti, I.D., Alon, I.

HistComp: bibliographic analysis and visualization of the “Biological Bulletin.” In: Anderson KL, editor. Every continent, every ocean. Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Conference of the [[International Association of the Aquatic and Marine Science Libraries and Information Centers (IAMSLIC)]]; 2006 Oct 8–12; Portland, OR.

Lib Q. 2006;76(1):10-18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some typical questions asked by bibliometricians that can be answered by HistCite analysis are:

# How much literature has been published in this field? When and in what countries has it been published? What countries are the major contributors to this field? What are the languages most frequently used by the items published in this field?
# What journals cover the literature of the field? Which are the most important?
# Who are the key authors in this field? What institutions do these authors represent?
# Which articles are the most important?
# How have the various contributors to the field influenced each other?

The answers to such questions are valuable to researchers, librarians, and administrators.

[[Visualization (computer graphics)|Information visualization]] is the transformation of non-numerical data into a graphic format. Visualization helps various researchers and scholars understand large collections of information. Although there are numerous uses for information visualization, HistCite performs one specific application: it converts bibliographies into diagrams called historiographs. 

A historiograph is a time-based network diagram of the papers in a bibliography and their citation relationships to each other. Historiographs are based on the citation relationships between the papers in a bibliography. In a historiograph, each paper in the bibliography is represented by a symbol selected by the user. The symbols are arranged over a timeline of the publication dates of the papers. By changing the time frame of the analysis, the resulting historiograph can form a snapshot of a specific period or an in-depth look at the total history of a subject. Once a historiograph is created for a bibliography, it is easier to see and understand the subject’s key publication events, their chronology, and their relative influence.

==Applications==
A wide variety of professionals who need to analyze the published literature use HistCite for analysis, for example: researchers, historians, journal editors, librarians and patent lawyers.

==Operation==
In order to perform its functions, HistCite must import a bibliography from another source. Once the bibliography is imported, basic point-and-click commands initiate the various analyses and visualizations. 

HistCite is currently set up to import bibliographies created by searches of the Web of Science database offered by Thomson-Reuters Scientific. Bibliographies from other sources can be manually entered into HistCite.

The bibliography the user feeds to HistCite represents the literature of the subject area as it is defined by that user’s unique perspective. Thus, the analyses and visualizations produced by HistCite from that bibliography are one-of-a-kind. 
 
HistCite operates on Windows computers with Internet Explorer.

Homespun offers music instruction for many instruments and styles on CD, DVD and streaming media.

==History==
[[Happy Traum]]'s inspiration for Homespun came in 1967, when he was a musician and part-time guitar teacher in New York City. When he moved to Woodstock, New York and began to tour with his brother [[Artie Traum]], he made tapes (based on his 1965 book ''Fingerpicking Styles for Guitar'') for his guitar students to use when he was unavailable.&lt;ref name=HS-puremusic-2017&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.puremusic.com/71happy1.html|title=Puremusic interview with Happy Traum|work=puremusic.com|accessdate=July 5, 2017|author=Frank Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also received letters from others who wanted to learn to play, so he made more tapes and sold them via classified advertisements in ''[[Guitar Player]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[Sing Out!]]'' magazines.&lt;ref name=HS-monitor-1993&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacLachlan|first1=Suzanne L.
|title=Homespun Tapes Runs with Music Giants|url=https://m.csmonitor.com/1993/0913/13061.html|accessdate=July 5, 2017|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=September 13, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS-rollmag-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cordtz|first1=Kay|title=Documenting the Greats, Teaching the New: Happy and Jane Traum’s Homespun Tapes and Video|url=http://www.rollmagazine.com/archive/jul11/articles/music.php|accessdate=July 7, 2017|work=Roll Magazine|date=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He decided to turn this effort into the Homespun business, with his wife Jane as co-owner and his brother Artie assisting. They invited musicians they knew to record instructional tapes. [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] (banjo) and [[Kenny Kosek]] (fiddle) were among the first to participate.&lt;ref name=HS-deseret-1989&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff writer|first1= |title=Tapes Bring Homespun Sound Home|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/43034/TAPES-BRING-HOMESPUN-SOUND-HOME.html?pg=all|accessdate=July 7, 2017|work=Deseret News|date=April 20, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homespun's first instructional lessons were recorded in Traum's home and sold on five-inch reel-to-reel tapes, as cassettes were not yet generally available.&lt;ref name=HS-whichside-2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Weissman|first=Dick|authorlink= |date=2005|title=Which Side Are You On?: An Inside History of the Folk Music Revival in America|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Which_Side_Are_You_On.html?id=ocXMnBpa-DYC|access-date=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tapes were manually reproduced one by one at home: thus the name "Homespun."&lt;ref name=HS-rollmag-2011 /&gt;

Traum produced the sessions, and provided guidance for artists who were uncomfortable teaching.&lt;ref name=HS-namm-2017&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/jane-traum|title=Oral Histories: Jane Traum|work=NAMM.org|accessdate=July 7, 2017|author= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the business grew, Traum traveled to other locations to record more musicians, and invited musicians outside their circle of friends to participate.&lt;ref name=HS-puremusic-2017 /&gt;

In 1983, Homespun introduced music instruction on VCR tapes, before most homes had video players. Through the years, Homespun has expanded its audio and video formats, moving from audio cassette and video tape to CDs, DVDs, and streaming media.&lt;ref name=HS-billboard-1997&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bessman|first1=Jim|title=Homespun Turns 30 with CD Instructional, Video Lines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=homespun+music+instruction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V2a56is6-B&amp;sig=BdlbEe13wwqmkjoYz9BpOVZvM70&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq9fjD-fjUAhUU1GMKHX9gAUc4HhDoAQgjMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=homespun%20music%20instruction&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 7, 2017|work=Billboard|date=November 8, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS-rhythm-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patience|first1=Iain|title=Happy Traum Interview|url=https://rhythms.com.au/happy-traum-interview-by-iain-patience/|accessdate=July 5, 2017|work=Rhythms|date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hal Leonard Corporation]] has been distributing Homespun products since 1995. Homespun products are also sold at their website, and the Roots music channel offers a web subscription service for Homespun streaming media.&lt;ref name=HS-retailer-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van Dyke|first1=Matthew|title=Hal Leonard &amp; Homespun Celebrate 20 Years Together|url=http://msretailer.com/hal-leonard-homespun-celebrate-20-years-together/

==History==
The IGS evolved from the Centro de Diálogo y Análisis sobre América del Norte (Center of Dialogue and Analysis of North America) or CEDAN, both founded by María Isabel Studer Noguez.&lt;ref name=iberori&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iberori.org/archivo/vita/isabelstuder28vita.pdf |title= María Isabel Studer  |publisher= Universidad Iberoamericana  |location=Mexico |language= Spanish |accessdate=June 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lanza&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cedan.org.mx/evento_igs |title=Lanzamiento Instituto Global para la Sostenibilidad |publisher=CEDAN |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Launch of the Instituto Global para la Sostenibilidad |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130701184529/http://cedan.org.mx/evento_igs |archivedate=July 1, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, much of CEDAN’s activities were related to environmental issues, so Studer reorganized the institute, which opened in 2011 as a partnership between Tec de Monterrey and Arizona State University’s Global Institute for Sustainability.&lt;ref name=crean/&gt;&lt;ref name=compromiso&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itesm.edu/wps/wcm/connect/snc/portal+informativo/por+tema/educacion/70anostecdemonterrey060_9may13 |title= María Isabel Studer: su compromiso con México la lleva a generar un cambio |date=May 9, 2013 |publisher=Tec de Monterrey |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=María Isabel Studer: her committement with Mexico makes her generate change |accessdate=June 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IGS’s inaugural event included Carlos Gay of [[UNAM]], Martha Delgado of the Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources, Ellis J. Juan, director of the Inter- American Development Bank, Irina Maslesnikova, of [[Xerox]] México, and [[Gabriel Quadri de la Torre]] of SIGEA. It has grown to sponsor research, educational and promotional activities both on the Tec de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus and other parts of Mexico, successful enough to be known in the United States and Canada as well.&lt;ref name=crean/&gt;&lt;ref name=compromiso/&gt;

Former professors and students of the institute have gone on to create projects such as the Xooc Foundation, which promotes awareness of marine biodiversity of Mexico, DameUnAveton, an online platform to share rides, and Impulso Urbano, a research and service organization to improve housing and public spaces through the use of recycled materials.&lt;ref name=promocionan/&gt;

'''Laurie L. Patton''' (born November 14, 1961) is an [[Americans|American]] academic, author and poet who serves as the 17th President of [[Middlebury College]]. Previously, she was the Charles Howard Candler Professor of Early Indian Religions at [[Emory University]] before assuming the role of Robert F. Durden Professor of Religion and Dean of Arts and Sciences at [[Duke University]].

Patton was named Middlebury's 17th President on  November 18, 2014, and became Middlebury's first woman president upon taking office on July 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/help/mediaserv/stream&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2008-12-01 |title=Mumbai is Not 9/11 |first=Laurie |last=Patton |newspaper=Religious Dispatches |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/797/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604090208/http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/797/ |archivedate=June 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patton graduated from [[Choate Rosemary Hall]] in Wallingford, Connecticut, holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], a doctorate from the [[University of Chicago]], and was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 2000. She focuses her research on early Indian rituals, narrative and mythology, literary theory in religious studies, and [[Hinduism]] in modern India. She has published on the interpretation of early Indian ritual and narrative, comparative mythology, literary theory in the study of religion, women and Hinduism in contemporary India, and religion and conflict.

Her early Indological work applies literary theory and theory of canon to the texts of early India, particularly Vedic texts. Later, she used a theory of metonymy to rethink the application of mantras in early Indian ritual.  Her first edited work, ''Authority, Anxiety, and Canon'' (1994) surveyed the larger field of Vedic interpretation as it existed in various intellectual contexts throughout India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunypress.edu/p-1849-authority-anxiety-and-canon.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

She was co-editor on ''Myth and Method'' an assessment of the state of the field in comparative mythology. Her co-edited work with Edwin Bryant (2005) brings together for the first time a variety of differing perspectives on the problem of Aryan origins.

Patton has also worked on gender questions, beginning with her edited volume, ''Jewels of Authority'' (2002), which examined early feminist stereotypes about women in Indian textual traditions as well as contemporary life.  Her recent articles on gender are derived from her present project, the first ethnography of women Sanskritists ever to be undertaken in India.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Her translation of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' in the [[Penguin Classics]] Series follows a free verse style constrained by eight line stanzas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stainton|first1=Hamsa|title=Review: The Bhagavad Gita|url=http://www.saglobalaffairs.com/book-reviews/191-review-the-bhagavad-gita.html|website=SAGlobalAffairs.com|publisher=SAGlobalAffairs.com|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patton regularly teaches in public venues nationally and internationally on interfaith issues, comparative religion, and religion and conflict.  In 2008–09 she co-hosted a TV series on "Faith and Feminism" for Atlanta Interfaith Broadcasting.  Patton served as Chair of the Department from 2000–07, as Co-convenor of the Religions and the Human Spirit Strategic Plan from 2005–07, and as Winship Distinguished Research Professor from 2003–06. She was the recipient of Emory’s highest award for teaching, the Emory Williams Award, in 2006. She co-convenes the Religion and Conflict Initiative at Emory University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ovguide.com/laurie-l-patton-9202a8c04000641f8000000012e52aaa#&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4694">'''Lawlessness''' is a lack of [[law]], in any of the various senses of that word. Lawlessness may describe various conditions.
{{TOC right}}

==In society==
'''[[Anomie]]''' is a breakdown of social bonds between an individual and their community, in which individuals do not feel bound by the moral strictures of society. The term was popularized by French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] in his influential 1897 book ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mestrovic |first=Stjepan |title=Emile Durkheim and The Reformation of Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Anarchy]]''' (meaning "without leadership") is a condition in which a person or group of people reject societal hierarchies, laws, and other institutions. It often entails the dissolution of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1551642484 |title=Decentralism: Where It Came From-Where Is It Going? |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Anarchism]]''' is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[self-governance|self-governed]] societies based on voluntary institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies." George Woodcock. "Anarchism" at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. "Anarchism" from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Anarchism." The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 "Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state." Judith Suissa. ''Anarchism and Education: a Philosophical Perspective''. Routledge. New York. 2006. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organisation and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist." [[Peter Kropotkin]]. [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Anarchism__its_philosophy_and_ideal.html Anarchism: its philosophy and ideal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"anarchists are opposed to irrational (e.g., illegitimate) authority, in other words, hierarchy — hierarchy being the institutionalisation of authority within a society." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/The_Anarchist_FAQ_Editorial_Collective__An_Anarchist_FAQ__03_17_.html#toc2 "B.1 Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?"] in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Civil disorder]]''', or civil unrest, refers to public disturbances generally involving groups of people, and resulting in danger or damage to persons or property.&lt;ref&gt;Schurink, W.J. (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KMlv2eJozAUC&amp;pg=PA416 ''Victimization: Nature and Trends.''] Human Sciences Research Council. {{ISBN|0796912580}}. p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil disorder is a breakdown of civil society, and may be a form of protest. It may take various forms, such as illegal parades, sit-ins, riots, sabotage, and other forms of crime.

==In nature==
'''[[Randomness]]''' is the lack of [[pattern]] or [[predictability]] in events.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines "random" as "Having no definite aim or purpose; not sent or guided in a particular direction; made, done, occurring, etc., without method or conscious choice; haphazard."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
'''[[Antinomianism]]''', in [[Christianity]], is a theological position which takes the principle of [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] by [[Faith#Christianity|faith]] and [[divine grace]] to the point of asserting that the saved are not bound to follow the [[Law of Moses]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/28267/antinomianism Encyclopædia Britannica: Antinomianism]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichens are grouped by common '''lichen growth forms'''. There are a wide range of growth forms ([[morphology (biology)|morphology]]). These groupings may not be consistent with lichen [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], since lichens with similar growth forms are not necessarily related by ancestry. Groups based on growth may overlap and have borderline cases. A species usually has the same overall growth form wherever it is found, but not always.&lt;ref name=WIL&gt;[https://www.anbg.gov.au/lichen/what-is-lichen.html What is a lichen?, Australian National Botanical Garden]&lt;/ref&gt;

Common groupings of lichens based on overall growth form include 1. bushy or shrubby ([[fruticose lichen|fruticose]]) 2. leafy ([[foliose lichen|foliose]]) 3. crust-like ([[crustose lichen|crustose]]) 4. scaly ([[Squamulose lichen|squamulose]]) 5. stringy ([[wikt:filamentose|filamentose]]), 6. whispy ([[Byssoid lichen|Byssoid]]), 7. powdery ([[Leprose lichen|leprose]]), or 8. structureless (e.g., [[Gelatinous lichen|gelatinous]]). Ways of grouping by growth forms is usually based on the form of the part of lichen that is not involved in sexual reproduction, the "vegetative" part, which is called the [[thallus]]. This includes both the fungus (mycobiont) and the algae and/or cyanobacteria cells (photobiont) they surround, but does not include any part with sexual fruit bodies of the mycobiont. The thallus may or may not have a "skin", a surface layer of differentiated tissue that covers the undifferentiated middle tissue, the [[Glossary of botanical terms#medulla|medulla]]. When part of a lichen has a cortex it is called [[wikt:corticate|corticate]].&lt;ref name=ASLGAF&gt;[http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary1.html Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (a-f), Alan Silverside]&lt;/ref&gt; If it lacks a cortex it is called [[ecorticate (lichen)|ecorticate]].&lt;ref name=ASLGGO&gt;[http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary2.html Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (g-o), Alan Silverside]&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple way to group lichens that requires use of a microscope to see a lichen's surface structure ([[anatomy]]) is by the presence or absence of a "skin" ([[Cortex (botany)|cortex]]). Fruticose lichens have one cortex encircling the "branches", even when the branches are flattened and look like "leaves". Foliose lichens have a separate upper cortex and lower cortex on each side of the "leaf". Crustose and squamulose lichens have an upper cortex, but do not have a lower cortex. Filimentous,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} byssoid,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} leprose,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and other lichens do not have a cortex (are ecorticate).

The following are commonly used groupings for lichens:
* 1. [[fruticose lichen|fruticose]] (branched, 3-dimiensional, one cortex surrounds thallus), e.g., ''[[Cladonia|Cladonia evansii]]'', ''[[Cladonia|C. subtenuis]]'', and ''[[Usnea|Usnea australis]]'' - The thallus is extended up, or hangs down, in a branched or tufted structure.
* 2. [[foliose lichen|foliose]] (leafy, 2-dimensional planes, two cortices&amp;nbsp;– upper and lower), e.g., ''[[Hypogymnia|Hypogymnia physodes]]''&amp;nbsp;– The thallus generally forms flat, leaf-like lobes that are not firmly bonded to the substrate, with the underside having its own cortex.
* 3. [[Crustose]] lichens (paint-like, flat, 2-dimensional, upper cortex, no lower cortex), e.g., ''[[Caloplaca marina]] ''- The thallus lies flat and tightly bound at all points to the substrate, like it is painted on.
:*3a. Crustose [[Placodioid lichen|placodioid]] (flattened and radiating out from a center, possibly raising up to being leaf-like at the outer edges with no cortex under raised part if present) - The thallus structure radiates out, with the outer edges peeling up from the substrate at the tips. These may peel up so much as to appear like foliose lichens, but unlike foliose lichens, they lack a cortex under the edges that lift from the substrate.
* 4. [[squamulose lichen|squamulose]] (scale-like or platelet-like, upper cortex but no lower cortex under raised portion), e.g., ''[[Normandina|Normandina pulchella]]'' - The thallus is composed of mostly flat laying, overlapping, scale-like plates ("squamules"), which may become leaf-like in form where they are not attached to the substrate, but which do not have a lower cortex on the underside. Some lichenologists consider squamulous lichens to be a special kind of crustose lichen.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;
* 5. [[filamentous lichen|Filamentous]] (hairlike), e.g., ''[[Ephebe (lichen)|Ephebe lanata]]'', ''[[Cystocoleus ebeneus]]''&amp;nbsp;– The thallus forms mostly nonbranching hair-like structures that may look overall like matted hair.
* 6. [[Byssoid lichen|Byssoid]] (whispy), e.g., ''[[Coenogonium implexum]]''&amp;nbsp;– Whispy like [[teased cotton]] or [[teased wool]].&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;
* 7. [[Leprose lichen|leprose]] (powdery), e.g., ''[[Lepraria|Lepraria incana]]''&amp;nbsp;– The thallus is a layer so thin that it is almost like a powder stuck to the substrate.
* 8. Structureless&amp;nbsp;– Lichens may not have a recognizable thallus structure, including [[Collema|gelatinous lichens]] where the cyanobacteria produce a [[polysaccharide]] that absorbs and retains water.

Since growth forms may be variable, there are gray areas between these groups, and there is overlap, placement of lichens in these groups is not definite. Placement of a lichen in one of these groups may vary from author to author.

Sometimes, such as when the thallus grows ''inside'' solid rock, between the grains, only the fruiting part of a lichen is visible, and this may be visible in a dramatic way (e.g., ''[[Caloplaca luteominea]]'' subspecies ''bolandri'').&lt;ref name=LV&gt;Lichen Vocabulary, LICHENS OF NORTH AMERICA, Sylvia and Stephen Sharnoff, [http://www.lichen.com/vocabulary.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other trees may have marcescent leaves in seasons where an early freeze kills the leaves before the abscission layer develops or completes development. Diseases or pests can also kill leaves before they can develop an abscission layer.

Marcescent leaves may be retained indefinitely and do not break off until mechanical forces (wind for instance) cause the dry and brittle petioles to snap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Addicott|first=Fredrick T.|title=Abscission|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4i87cALU8K0C&amp;pg=PA51|year=1982|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04288-9|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''marcescent'' is also used in [[mycology]] to describe a mushroom which (unlike most species, described as "putrescent") can dry out, but later revive and continue to disperse spores.&lt;ref&gt;See introduction to Roy E. Halling "[http://www.nybg.org/bsci/res/col/index.html A revision of Collybia s.l. in the northeastern United States &amp; adjacent Canada]" Inst. of Syst. Botany, The New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, NY 10458-5126&lt;/ref&gt; Genus ''[[Marasmius]]'' is well known for this feature, which was considered taxonomically important by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in his 1838 classification of the fungi.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Magnus Fries|E. M. Fries]]  ''Epicrisis systematis mycologici'' (1838) Uppsala: Typographia Academica&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary reasons for marcescence are not clear, theories include: protection of leaf buds from winter desiccation, and as a delayed source of nutrients or moisture-conserving mulch when the leaves finally fall and decompose in spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/leaves-dont-leave/|title=When Leaves Don't Leave » Arnold Arboretum|date=2016-02-19|work=Arnold Arboretum|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
One possible advantage of marcescent leaves is that they may deter feeding of large [[herbivore]]s, such as [[deer]] and [[moose]], which normally eat the twigs and their nutritious buds. Dead, dry leaves make the twigs less nutritious and less palatable.&lt;ref&gt;Svendsen, Claus R. 2001. Effects of marcescent leaves on winter browsing by large herbivores in northern temperate deciduous forests.

Some ecologists suggest that marcescence has adaptive significance for trees growing on dry, infertile sites. Beech and oak often grow relatively well and can outcompete other species on such sites. The hypothesis is that retaining leaves until spring could be a means of slowing the [[decomposition]] of the leaves (which would rot faster on the ground) and that dropping them in spring delivers organic material, much like compost or mulch, at a time when it is most needed by the growing tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://northernwoodlands.org/articles/article/why-do-some-leaves-persist-on-beech-and-oak-trees-well-into-winter|title=Why Do Some Leaves Persist On Beech and Oak Trees Well Into Winter?  {{!}} Winter 2010|last=Woodlands|first=Northern|work=Center for Northern Woodlands Education|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experimentation on [[plant litter]] from marcescent trees indicates that keeping the leaves aboveground may increase the amount of [[photodegradation]] the leaves are exposed to. Because some marcescent species' leaves do not decompose well, the increased photodegradation may allow them to decompose better once they finally fall off the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angst|first=Šárka|last2=Cajthaml|first2=Tomáš|last3=Angst|first3=Gerrit|last4=Šimáčková|first4=Hana|last5=Brus|first5=Jiří|last6=Frouz|first6=Jan|date=2017-09-01|title=Retention of dead standing plant biomass (marcescence) increases subsequent litter decomposition in the soil organic layer|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-017-3318-6|journal=Plant and Soil|language=en|volume=418|issue=1-2|pages=571–579|doi=10.1007/s11104-017-3318-6|issn=0032-079X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others theorize that leaves which remain on a tree due to marcescence allow the tree to trap snow during the winter months. By using their dead leaves to collect additional snow, trees are able to provide themselves more water in spring when the snow begins to melt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://northernwoodlands.org/articles/article/why-do-some-leaves-persist-on-beech-and-oak-trees-well-into-winter|title=Why Do Some Leaves Persist On Beech and Oak Trees Well Into Winter?  {{!}} Winter 2010|last=Woodlands|first=Northern|work=Center for Northern Woodlands Education|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcescent leaves may protect some species from water stress or temperature stress. For example, in tropical alpine environments a wide variety of plants in different plant families and different parts of the world have evolved a [[growth form]] known as the ''caulescent rosette'', characterized by evergreen rosettes growing above marcescent leaves.  Examples of plants for which the marcescent leaves have been confirmed to improve survival, help water balance, or protect the plant from cold injury are ''[[Espeletia]] schultzii'' and ''Espeletia timotensis'', both from the [[Andes]].&lt;ref name=Andes1&gt;[http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=688033&amp;q=marcescent+leaves+&amp;uid=788491162&amp;setcookie=yes Goldstein, G. and Meinzer, F.1983.

Function of dead leaves in ''Espeletia schultzii'' (Compositae), and Andean caulescent rosette species. ''Biotropica'' 11: 43-47.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The litter-trapping marcescent leaf crowns of ''[[Dypsis]]'' palms accumulate [[detritus]] thereby enhancing their nutrient supply,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bramwell|first1=David|last2=Caujapé-Castells|first2=Juli|title=The Biology of Island Floras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fCYWrKJAu4C&amp;pg=PA189|date=2011-07-21|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49780-0|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in trapping nutrient-rich detritus, palms with marcescent leaf bases are also more likely to allow the germination of [[epiphytic]] [[Ficus|fig]]s in the marcescent leaves, with the figs possibly subsequently strangling the palms.&lt;ref name=Kramer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kramer|first1=Gregory T.|title=Palm Tree Susceptibility to Hemi-Epiphytic Parasitism by Ficus|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0043410/00001|website=(M.S. thesis)|publisher=University of Florida|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palm genera with taxa having marcescent leaf bases and attracting epiphytic fig growth include ''[[Attalea (plant)|Attalea]]'', ''[[Butia]]'', ''[[Caryota]]'', ''[[Copernicia]]'', ''[[Elaeis]]'', ''[[Hyphaene]]'', ''[[Livistona]]'', ''[[Phoenix (plant)|Phoenix]]'', ''[[Sabal]]'', and ''[[Syagrus (plant)|Syagrus]]''.&lt;ref name=Kramer/&gt;

[[File:Max Planck Institute for Brain Research at Night of Science 2018 (1).jpg|thumb|New building of the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt]]
The '''Max Planck Institute for Brain Research''' is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. It was founded as [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Brain Research in Berlin 1914, moved to Frankfurt-Niederrad in 1962 and more recently in a new building in Frankfurt-Riedberg. It is one of 83 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (Max Planck Gesellschaft).

== Research ==
Research at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research focuses on the operation of networks of neurons in the brain. The institute hosts three scientific departments (with directors [[Moritz Helmstaedter]] of the Helmstaedter Department, [[Gilles Laurent]] of the Laurent Department, and [[Erin Schuman]] of the Schuman Department), the [[Wolf Singer|Singer]] Emeritus Group, two Max Planck Research Groups, namely [[Johannes Letzkus]]' Neocortical Circuits Group and [[Tatjana Tchumatchenko]]'s Theory of Neural Dynamics Group, as well as several additional research units. The common research goal of the Institute is a mechanistic understanding of neurons and synapses, of the structural and functional circuits which they form, of the computational rules which describe their operations, and ultimately, of their roles in driving perception and behavior. The experimental focus is on all scales required to achieve this understanding - from networks of molecules in dendritic compartments to networks of interacting brain areas. This includes interdisciplinary analyses at the molecular, cellular, multi-cellular, network and behavioral levels, often combined with theoretical approaches.

== History ==
The "Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Hirnforschung" (KWI for Brain Research) was founded in [[Berlin]] in 1914, making it one of the oldest institutes of the "Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science", itself founded in 1911. It was based on the Neurologische Zentralstation (Neurological Center), a private research institute established by [[Oskar Vogt]] in 1898 and run together with his wife [[Cécile Vogt-Mugnier]], also an accomplished brain researcher.

From 1901 to 1910, Vogt's coworker at this institute was [[Korbinian Brodmann]], who in 1909 established the cytoarchitectonic classification of cortical areas still in use today (e.g., his area 17 is the primary visual cortex). Oskar Vogt's own scientific achievements also were in the field of cortical cytoarchitectonics and myeloarchitectonics.

In the 1920s Oskar Vogt became interested in the potential morphological correlates of mental abilities, and hence in the neuroanatomical study of 'elite brains'. When [[Lenin]] died of a brain hemorrhage in 1924, his brain was preserved in formaldehyde, where it remained for two years. In 1926, Vogt was recruited by the Soviet government to help establish Lenin's genius via histological investigation of his brain. He was given some space in Moscow to carry out this work and two years later, a spacious and representative brick building that had been confiscated from an American business. In it, he helped establish and then headed the Moscow Brain Institute. Between 1926 and 1930, Vogt travelled to Moscow several times to supervise the work on Lenin's brain by the Russian collaborators who had been trained at Vogt's KWI for Brain Research in Berlin.

In 1927, Vogt gave a preliminary report on his findings in Moscow, concluding from his histological observations that Lenin must have been an athlete in associative thinking ("Assoziationsathlet") - a conclusion deemed farfetched by some of his neurologist colleagues and adversaries. Lenin's brain was, for a time, on display in the Lenin Mausoleum and now rests at Moscow's Brain Institute.

World War I delayed the plans for a new building to house the KWI for Brain Research. The KWI's first proper building in Berlin-Buch was only inaugurated in 1931 under the directorship of Oskar Vogt. It was the world's largest and most modern brain research institute of its time, including Departments of Neurophysiology (Tönnies and Kornmüller), Neurochemistry (Marthe Vogt and Veit), Genetics (Timoféeff-Ressovsky), a Research Clinic (Soeken, Zwirner), and the Neuroanatomical Departments of Oskar and his wife Cécile Vogt. Based on critical remarks Vogt had made about national socialism, a protective attitude towards Jewish coworkers at the institute, and rumors that he was a communist (spirited by his Moscow contacts), Vogt was pressed to early retirement by 1937. The Vogts moved to Neustadt in the Black Forest and established another private brain research institute, funded in part by the family of steel baron Krupp (who had already funded Vogt´s first private institute in Berlin) and by Vogt´s own funds.
In 1937, Hugo Spatz, a pupil of Franz Nissl, became Vogt's successor as director of the KWI for Brain Research and head of the Neuroanatomy Department. During his tenure, the Departments of Neuropathology (Hallervorden) and of Tumor Research (Tönnis) were added. One focus of both Spatz’s and Hallervorden’s histological research were pathologies of the extrapyramidal/motor system. In a previous collaboration they had described an extrapyramidal disease that was later named Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome. 

Between 1940 and 1945, Hallervorden and Spatz became involved in the atrocities of the [[Nazi party|Nazi regime]] by studying the brains of euthanasia victims. For many years, brain sections from these studies remained archived in the institute (which by then had become the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt am Main) together with research material from other periods. When this was recognized, all sections dating from the period 1933-1945 were given a burial at a Munich cemetery by the Max Planck Society in 1990. A memorial stone was erected in honor of the victims of these atrocities. Use of the eponym Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome is strongly discouraged due to Hallervorden and Spatz's involvement with the Nazi party and was replaced by the more descriptive terminology [[pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration]].

After 1945, the different departments of the KWI for Brain Research were relocated to Dillenburg, Giessen, Köln, Marburg and Göttingen. In 1948 the Max Planck Society was founded to succeed the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, and the institute became the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research. Hallervorden retired as director in 1955, Spatz in 1959. In 1962, a new building was erected in Frankfurt-Niederrad to house the Departments of Neurobiology (Hassler, Director 1959-1982) and Neuropathology (Krücke, Director 1956-1979), as well as the Research Groups "Evolution of the Primate Brain" (Stephan) and "Neurochemistry" (Werner). Rolf Hassler, a pupil of Oskar Vogt and coworker of the famous Freiburg neurologist Richard Jung, studied subcortical brain areas, thalamo-cortical systems, basal ganglia and the limbic system. Wilhelm Krücke, a pupil of Hallervorden, was a renowned specialist on peripheral neuropathies. He was the reason for the institute's relocation to Frankfurt, as he was simultaneously head of the 'Edinger Institute', the Neuropathology Department of Frankfurt University's Medical School. In 1982, the KWI for Brain Research's Department of General Neurology, which had been relocated to Köln, became the Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research in that city, independent of the MPI for Brain Research. The other relocated departments of the KWI were closed with the retirement of their directors.

In 1981, the MPIH was restructured towards non-clinical, basic neuroscience through the establishment of the Departments of Neuroanatomy (Wässle, Director 1981-2008) and Neurophysiology (Singer, Director 1982-2011), followed by the Department of Neurochemistry (Betz, Director 1991-2009). Heinz Wässle conducted functional and structural studies of the mammalian retina, Heinrich Betz analyzed the molecular components of synapses, and Wolf Singer studied higher cognitive functions with a focus on the visual system.

In the first decade of the new millennium, the MPG defined the analysis of neural networks as a central research topic for the institute. In 2008 Erin Schuman and Gilles Laurent were appointed as directors of the departments "Synaptic Plasticity" and "Neural Systems", respectively. The new departments took up work in the summer of 2009 and were initially located in interim facilities on the Science Campus "Riedberg" of the Frankfurt University. The construction of a new building for the institute on this campus was recently finalized, next to the MPI of Biophysics. The new institute building currently houses the three departments of the institute (those of Erin Schuman, Gilles Laurent and Moritz Helmstaedter), several Research Groups at the institute (Tatjana Tchumatchenko and Johannes Letzkus recently joined as Max Planck Group Leaders in 2013), several core facilities, and the Max Planck Research Unit for Neurogenetics of Peter Mombaerts.

{{As of|2016}}, Moritz Helmstaedter is the [[Managing Director]] of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marx|first=Vivien|date=May 2015|title=Erin Margaret Schman|url=http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n5/full/nmeth.3374.html|department=The Author File|journal=[[Nat.

'''[[Military]] [[logistics]]''' is the discipline of planning and carrying out the movement and maintenance of military forces. In its most comprehensive sense, it is those aspects or military operations that deal with:&lt;ref&gt;AAP-6 2009, ''NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions.''&lt;/ref&gt;

* Design, development, [[Military acquisition|acquisition]], storage, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and disposition of [[materiel]]. 
* Transport of personnel. 
* Acquisition or construction, maintenance, [[operations (military staff)|operation]], and disposition of facilities. 
* Acquisition or furnishing of services.
* Medical and health service support.

== History ==
The word "logistics" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] adjective ''logistikos'' meaning "skilled in calculating". The first [[public administration|administrative]] use of the word was in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times when there was a military administrative official with the title ''Logista''. At that time, the word apparently implied a skill involved in numerical computations.

Historically supplies for an army were first acquired by foraging or looting, especially in the case of food and [[fodder]], although if traveling through a desolated region or staying in one place for too long resources could quickly be exhausted. A second method was for the army to bring along what was needed, whether by ships, pack animals, wagons or carried on the backs of the soldiers themselves. This allowed the army some measure of self-sufficiency, and up through to the 19th century most of the [[ammunition]] a soldier needed for an entire campaign could be carried on their person. However, this method led to an extensive [[Train (military)|baggage train]] which could slow down the army's advance and the development of faster-firing weapons soon outpaced an army's ability to supply itself. Starting with the [[Industrial Revolution]] new technological, technical and administrative advances led to a third method, that of maintaining supplies in a [[rear (military)|rear area]] and transporting them to the [[front (military)|front]].  This led to a "logistical revolution" which began in the 20th century and drastically improved the capabilities of modern armies while making them highly dependent on this new system.&lt;ref&gt;Kress, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a concise global history see Earl J. Hess, ''Civil War Logistics: A Study of Military Transportation'' (2017) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plundering van Aalst, fantasie voorstelling - Aalst - 20318282 - RCE.jpg|thumb|Depiction of soldiers pillaging a town, carrying away their loot by the barrow-load, 14th century]]
Through the medieval period (the 5th to 15th century in Europe), soldiers were responsible for supplying themselves, either through foraging, looting, or purchases. Even so, military commanders often provided their troops with food and supplies, but this would be provided in lieu of the soldiers' wages, or soldiers would be expected to pay for it from their wages, either at cost or even with a profit.&lt;ref name=AbelsRichard&gt;{{cite web

In 1294, the same year [[John Balliol|John II de Balliol of Scotland]] refused to support [[Edward I of England]]'s planned invasion of France, Edward I implemented a system in [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] where [[sheriff]]s would acquire foodstuffs, horses and carts from merchants with [[Eminent domain|compulsory sales]] at prices fixed below typical market prices under the Crown's rights of [[purveyance|prise and purveyance]]. These goods would then be transported to [[Supply depot|Royal Magazine]]s in southern Scotland and along the Scottish border where English [[Conscription|conscript]]s under his command could purchase them. This continued during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|First War of Scottish Independence]] which began in 1296, though the system was unpopular and was ended with Edward I's death in 1307.&lt;ref name=AbelsRichard/&gt;

Starting under the rule of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] in 1307 and ending under the rule of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in 1337, the English instead used a system where merchants would be asked to meet armies with supplies for the conscripts to purchase. This led to discontent as the merchants saw an opportunity to [[War profiteering|profiteer]], forcing conscripts to pay well above normal market prices for food.&lt;ref name=AbelsRichard/&gt;

As Edward III went to war with France in the [[Hundred Years' War]] (starting in 1337), the English returned to a practice of foraging and looting to meet their logistical needs. This practice lasted throughout the course of war, extending through the remainder of Edward III's reign into the reign of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].&lt;ref name=AbelsRichard/&gt;

===16th century===
Starting in the late sixteenth century armies in [[Europe]] greatly increased in size, upwards of 100,000 or more in some cases.  This increase in size came not just in the number of actual soldiers but also [[camp followers]]—anywhere from half to one and a half the size of the army itself—and the size of the [[baggage train]]—averaging one wagon for every fifteen men.&lt;ref&gt;Creveld, pp. 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;  However, very little state support was provided to these massive armies, the vast majority of which consisted of [[mercenaries]].  Beyond being paid for their service by the state—an act which bankrupted even the [[Spanish Empire]] on several occasions—these soldiers and their commanders were forced to provide everything for themselves.  If permanently assigned to a town or city with a working marketplace, or traveling along a well-established military route, supplies could be easily bought locally with [[intendant]]s overseeing the exchanges.  In other cases an army traveling in friendly territory could expect to be followed by [[sutler]]s—although their supply stocks were small and subject to [[price gouging]]—or a [[commissioner]] could be sent ahead to a town to make arraignments, including [[billet|quartering]] if necessary.&lt;ref name="Creveld10"&gt;Creveld, pp. 8–10&lt;/ref&gt;

When operating in enemy territory an army was forced to plunder the local countryside for supplies, a historical tradition meant to allow war to be conducted at the enemy's expense.  However, with the increase in army sizes this reliance on plunder became a major problem, as many decisions regarding where an army could move or fight were made based not on strategic objectives but whether a given area was capable of supporting the soldiers' needs. [[Sieges]] in particular were affected by this, both for any army attempting to lay siege to a location or coming to its relief.  Unless a military commander was able to implement some sort of regular resupply, a fortress or town with a devastated countryside could be effectively immune to either operation.&lt;ref name="Creveld10"/&gt;

Conversely, armies of this time had little need to maintain [[lines of communication]] while on the move, except insofar as it was necessary to recruit more soldiers, and thus could not be cut off from non-existent supply bases.  Although this theoretically granted armies freedom of movement, the need for plunder prevented any sort of sustained, purposeful advance.  Many armies were further restricted to following [[waterways]] due to the fact that what supplies they were forced to carry could be more easily transported by boat. [[Artillery]] in particular was reliant of this method of travel, since even a modest number of [[cannons]] of the period required hundreds of [[horses]] to pull overland and traveled at half the speed of the rest of the army.&lt;ref&gt;Creveld, pp.10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
By the seventeenth century, the French under [[Secretary of State for War (France)|Secretary of State for War]] [[Michel Le Tellier]] began a series of military reforms to address some of the issues which had plagued armies in the previous century.  Besides ensuring that soldiers were more regularly paid and combating the corruption and inefficiencies of private contractors, Le Tellier devised formulas to calculate the exact amount of supplies necessary for a given campaign, created standardized contracts for dealing with commercial suppliers, and formed a permanent vehicle-park manned by army specialists whose job was to carry a few days' worth of supplies while accompanying the army during campaigns.  With these arrangements there was a gradual increase in the use of [[supply depot|magazines]] which could provide a more regular flow of supply via [[convoys]].  While the concepts of magazines and convoys was not new at this time, prior to the increase in army sizes there had rarely been cause to implement them.&lt;ref name="Creveld20"&gt;Creveld, pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these changes, French armies still relied on plunder for a majority of their needs while on the move.  Magazines were created for specific campaigns and any surplus was immediately sold for both monetary gain and to lessen the tax burden.  The vehicles used to form convoys were contracted out from commercial interests or requisitioned from local stockpiles.  In addition, given warfare of this era's focus on fortified towns and an inability to establish [[front lines]] or exert a stabilizing control over large areas, these convoys often needed armies of their own to provide [[wikt:escort|escort]].  The primary benefits of these reforms was to supply an army during a siege.  This was borne out in the successful campaign of 1658 when the French army at no point was forced to end a siege on account of supplies, including the [[Siege of Dunkirk (1658)|Siege of Dunkirk]].&lt;ref name="Creveld20"/&gt;

Le Tellier's son [[François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]] would continue his father's reforms after assuming his position.  The most important of these was to guarantee free daily rations for the soldiers, amounting to two pounds of bread or [[hardtack]] a day.  These rations were supplemented as circumstances allowed by a source of protein such as [[meat]] or [[beans]]; soldiers were still responsible for purchasing these items out-of-pocket but they were often available at below-market prices or even free at the expense of the state.  He also made permanent a system of magazines which were overseen by local governors to ensure they were fully stocked.  Some of these magazines were dedicated to providing frontier towns and fortresses several months' worth of supplies in the event of a siege, while the rest were dedicated to supporting French armies operating in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Creveld, pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;

With these reforms French armies enjoyed one of the best logistical systems in Europe, however there were still severe restrictions on its capabilities.  Only a fraction of an army's supply needs could be met by the magazines, requiring that it continue to use plunder.  In particular this was true for perishable goods or those too bulky to store and transport such as fodder.  The administration and transportation of supplies remained inadequate and subject to the deprivations of private contractors.  The primary aim of this system was still to keep an army supplied while conducting a siege, a task for which it succeeded, rather than increase its freedom of movement.&lt;ref&gt;Creveld, pp.23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
The British were seriously handicapped in the [[American Revolutionary War]] by the need to ship all supplies across the Atlantic, since the Americans prevented most local purchases. The British found a solution after the war by creating the infrastructure and the experience needed to manage an empire. London reorganized the management of the supply of military food and transport that was completed in 1793–94 when the naval Victualling and Transport Boards undertook those responsibilities. It built upon experience learned from the supply of the very-long-distance Falklands garrison (1767–72) to systematize needed shipments to distant places such as Australia, Nova Scotia, and Sierra Leone. This new infrastructure allowed Britain to launch large expeditions to the Continent during the French Revolutionary War and to develop a global network of colonial garrisons.&lt;ref&gt;Morriss, Roger. "Colonization, Conquest, and the Supply of Food and Transport: The Reorganization of Logistics Management, 1780–1795," ''War in History,'' (July 2007), 14#3 pp&amp;nbsp;310–324,&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

====Napoleon====
Before the [[Napoleonic wars]], military supply was based on contracts with private companies, looting and requisition (legal taking of whatever the army needed, with minimal compensation). [[Napoleon]] made logistical operations a major part of French strategy.{{sfn|Schneid|2005|p=106}} During the [[Ulm Campaign]] in 1805, the French army of 200,000 men had no need for time-consuming efforts to scour the countryside for supplies and live off the land, as it was well provided for by France's German allies.{{sfn|Schneid|2005|p=106}} France's ally, the [[Electorate of Bavaria]], turned the city of [[Augsburg]] into a gigantic supply center, allowing the [[Grande Armée]], generously replenished with food, shoes and ammunition, to quickly invade Austria after the decisive French victory at [[Ulm]].{{sfn|Schneid|2005|p=129}} Napoleon left nothing to chance, requesting the Bavarians to prepare in advance a specified amount of food at certain cities such as [[Würzburg]] and Ulm, for which the French reimbursed them.{{sfn|Schneid|2005|p=107}} When French demands proved excessive for the German principalities, the French army used a system of vouchers to requisition supplies and keep the rapid French advance going.{{sfn|Schneid|2005|p=108}} The agreements with French allies permitted the French to obtain huge quantities of supplies within a few days' notice.{{sfn|Schneid|2005|p=167}} Napoleon built up a major supply magazine at [[Passau]], with barges transporting supplies down the [[Danube]] to [[Vienna]] to maintain the French army prior to the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in combat readiness.{{sfn|Schneid|2005|p=129}} In 1807, Napoleon created the first ''[[Train (military)|military train]]'' regiments — units entirely dedicated to the supply and the transport of equipment.

The French system fared poorly in the face of a [[guerrilla warfare]] that targeted supply lines during the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain, and the British blockade of Spanish ports. The need to supply a besieged Barcelona made it impossible to control the province and ended French plans to incorporate Catalonia into Napoleon's Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, John. "War Feeding War? The Impact of Logistics on the Napoleonic Occupation of Catalonia", ''Journal of Military History'', January 2009, 73#1 pp&amp;nbsp;83–116&lt;/ref&gt;

The first theoretical analysis of this was by the Swiss writer, [[Antoine-Henri Jomini]], who studied the Napoleonic wars. In 1838, he devised a theory of war based on the trinity of ''strategy'', ''tactics'', and ''logistics''.

====Railways====
[[File:Firefly train.JPG|thumb|[[United States Military Railroad|US Military Railroad]] engineers monitor the first use of a wooden [[trestle]] they have hastily built to replace the masonry bridge destroyed by [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]], [[Orange and Alexandria Railroad|O&amp;A railroad]], Northern [[Virginia]], c. 1863]]
Railways and steamboats revolutionized logistics by the mid-19th century.

In the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65), both armies used railways extensively, for transport of personnel, supplies, horses and mules, and heavy field pieces. Both tried to disrupt the enemy's logistics by destroying trackage and bridges.&lt;ref&gt;Huston, James A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8pabWzrsocC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online ''The Sinews of War: Army Logistics, 1775–1953''] U.S. Army, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; [[Military railways]] were built specifically for supporting armies in the field.

During the [[Austro-Prussian War|Seven Weeks War]] of 1866, railways enabled the swift mobilization of the Prussian Army, but the problem of moving supplies from the end of rail lines to units at the front resulted in nearly 18,000 tons trapped on trains unable to be unloaded to ground transport.&lt;ref&gt;Creveld, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; The Prussian use of railways during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] is often cited as a prime example of logistic modernizations, but the advantages of maneuver were often gained by abandoning supply lines that became hopelessly congested with rear-area traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Creveld, pp. 92–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 104-0984A, Bei Etricourt, Truppen auf Landstraße.jpg|thumb|German horse-drawn supply bottleneck in front of two provisional bridges near [[Étricourt-Manancourt|Étricourt]], France, during [[Operation Michael]], 24 March 1918]]
With the expansion of military [[conscription]] and [[Military reserve force|reserve]] systems in the decades leading up to the 20th century, the potential size of armies increased substantially, while the [[Industrial warfare|industrialization of firepower]] ([[bolt-action rifle]]s with higher rate-of-fire, larger and more artillery, plus [[machine gun]]s) was starting to multiply the potential amount [[munitions]] each required. Military logistical systems, however, continued to rely on 19th century technology.

When [[World War I]] started, the capabilities of rail and horse-drawn supply were stretched to their limits. Where the stalemate of [[trench warfare]] took hold, special [[narrow gauge]] [[trench railways]] were built to extend the rail network to the front lines. The great size of the German Army proved too much for its railways to support except while immobile.&lt;ref&gt;Creveld, pp. 138–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Tactical successes like [[Operation Michael]] devolved into operational failures where logistics failed to keep up with the army's advance over shell-torn ground. 

On the seas, the British [[blockade of Germany]] kept a stranglehold on raw materials, goods, and food needed to support Germany's war efforts, and is considered one of the key elements in the eventual Allied victory in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vincent |first=C. Paul|title=The Politics of Hunger: The Allied Blockade of Germany, 1915–1919|publisher=Ohio University Press|date=1985|location=Athens (Ohio) and London}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Germany's [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] showed the vulnerability of shipping lanes despite Allied [[naval superiority]].

===World War II===

The [[Mechanized warfare|mechanization of warfare]], starting at the tail end of World War I, added increasing ammo, fuel, and maintenance needs of [[tank]]s and other [[combat vehicle]]s to the burden on military logistics. The growing needs of more powerful and numerous military ships and [[military aircraft|aircraft]] increased this burden even further. On the other hand, mechanization also brought [[Military vehicle#Military trucks|truck]]s to logistics; though they generally require better roads and bridges, trucks are much faster and far more efficient than [[fodder]]-bound horse-drawn transport. While many nations, including Germany, continued to rely on wagons to some extent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schilling |title=Weapons, Strategy, and War, The Organization of Armies |url=http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/services/dropoff/schilling/mil_org/milorgan_99.html |website=Columbia University Center for Teaching and Learning |accessdate=30 October 2017 |quote=For transport, the [standard 1944 German Infantry] division had 615 motor vehicles and 1,450 horse-drawn vehicles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US and UK readily switched to trucks wherever possible.

Military logistics played a significant role in many [[World War II]] operations, especially ones far from industrial centers, from the [[Winter War#Finnish Lapland|Finnish Lapland]] to the [[Burma Campaign]], limiting the size and movement of any military forces. In the [[North African Campaign]], with a lack of rail, few roads, and hot-dry climate, attacks and advances were timed as much by logistics as enemy actions. Poor logistics, in the form of Russia's vast distances and its state of road and rail networks, contributed to the fate of [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany's invasion of the USSR]]: despite many battlefield victories, the campaign lost momentum before the gates of Moscow.

Breaking the logistics supply line became a major target for [[airpower]]; a single [[fighter aircraft]] could attack dozens of supply vehicles at a time by [[strafing]] down a road, many miles behind the front line. [[Air superiority]] became critical for almost any major offensive in good weather. Allied air forces took out German-controlled bridges and rail infrastructure throughout northern France to help ensure the success of the [[Normandy landings]], but after the [[breakout from Normandy]], this now limited the Allies' own logistics. In response, the [[Red Ball Express]] was organized — a massive truck convoy system to supply the advance towards Germany. During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], Supplying by air, called an [[Airbridge (logistics)|airbridge]], was attempted by Germany to keep its surrounded [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] supplied, but they lacked sufficient air transport. Allied airbridges were more successful, in the Burma Campaign, and in "[[The Hump]]" to resupply the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese war effort]]. (A few years after the war, the [[Berlin Air Lift]] was successful in supplying the whole non-Soviet half of the city.)

At sea, the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] began in the first days of the war and continued to the end. [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Commerce raiding|surface raider]]s and [[U-boat]]s targeted vital Allied cargo ship [[convoy]]s supplying English, US, and Russian forces, and became more effective than in World War I. Technological improvements in both U-boats and [[anti-submarine warfare]] raced to out-do each other for years, with the Allies eventually keeping losses to U-boats in check.

Logistics was a major challenge for the American war effort, since wartime material had to be supplied across either the Atlantic or the even wider Pacific Ocean.  Germany undertook an aggressive U-boat campaign against American logistics on the Atlantic, but the Japanese neglected to attack shipping in the Pacific, using their submarines to fight alongside the surface Navy in large-scale battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Gropman, ed.|title=The big 'L' : American logistics in World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSeJJDfj140C&amp;pg=PA265|year=1997|publisher= National Defense University Press|pages=265–92}}, Detailed overview.

Coakley, '' United States Army in World War II: War Department, Global Logistics and Strategy, 1940-1943'' (1955). &lt;/ref&gt; 

Long logistical distances dominated the [[Pacific War]]. For the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] required numerous [[Replenishment oiler|oiler]] ships to refuel the attacking fleet at sea on-route. Massive numbers of transports, including thousands of US [[Liberty ship]]s, were required to sustain the Allied forces fighting back towards the Japanese homeland. As in the Atlantic, [[Pacific War#Submarine warfare|submarine warfare]] accounted for more losses than naval battles, with over 1,200 merchant ships sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blair|first1=Clay, Jr.|title=Silent Victory|date=1976|publisher=Bantam|location=New York|isbn=9780553010503|page=359–360, 551–552, 816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logistics, occasionally referred to as "[[combat service support]]", must address highly uncertain conditions.  While perfect forecasts are rarely possible, forecast models can reduce uncertainty about what supplies or [[Service (economics)|services]] will be needed, where and when they will be needed, or the best way to provide them.

Ultimately, responsible officials must make judgments on these matters, sometimes using intuition and scientifically weighing alternatives as the situation requires and permits. Their judgments must be based not only upon professional knowledge of the numerous aspects of logistics itself but also upon an understanding of the interplay of closely related military considerations such as [[strategy]], [[military tactics|tactics]], [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]], [[training]], [[personnel]], and [[finance]].

However, case studies have shown that more quantitative, statistical analysis are often a significant improvement on human judgment.  One such recent example is the use of [[Applied Information Economics]] by the Office of Naval Research and the Marine Corps for forecasting bulk fuel requirements for the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, Douglas. ''How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In major military conflicts, logistics matters are often crucial in deciding the overall outcome of wars.  For instance, [[tonnage war]]—the bulk sinking of cargo ships—was a crucial factor in [[World War II]]. The successful Allied anti-submarine campaign and the failure of the German Navy to sink enough cargo in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] allowed Britain to stay in the war and the ability to maintain a Mediterranean supply chain allowed the maintenance of the second front against the Nazis in North Africa; by contrast, the successful U.S. [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War|submarine campaign]] against Japanese maritime shipping across Asian waters effectively crippled its economy and its military production capabilities and the Axis were unable to consistently maintain a supply chain to their North African forces with on average 25% fewer supplies than required being landed and critical fuel shortages dictating strategic decisions.  In a tactical scale, in the [[Battle of Ilomantsi]], the Soviets had an overwhelming numerical superiority in guns and men, but managed to fire only 10,000 shells against the Finnish 36,000 shells, eventually being forced to abandon their heavy equipment and flee the battlefield, resulting in a Finnish victory. One reason for this was the successful Finnish harassment of Soviet supply lines.

More generally, protecting one's own [[supply line]]s and attacking those of an enemy is a fundamental military strategy; an example of this as a purely logistical campaign for the military means of implementing strategic policy was the [[Berlin Blockade#Berlin airlift|Berlin Airlift]].

Military logistics has pioneered a number of techniques that have since become widely deployed in the commercial world. [[Operations research]] grew out of WWII military logistics efforts.  Likewise, military logistics borrows from methods first introduced to the commercial world.

The [[Kargil Conflict]] in 1999 between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] also referred to as [[Operation Vijay (1999)|Operation Vijay]] (Victory in [[Hindi]]) is one of the most recent examples of high altitude warfare in mountainous terrain that posed significant logistical problems for the combating sides. The [[Ashok Leyland Stallion|Stallion]] which forms the bulk of the Indian Army's logistical vehicles proved its reliability and serviceability with 95% operational availability during the operation.

== Loss of Strength Gradient ==
{{main|Loss of Strength Gradient}}
Geographic ''[[distance]]'' is a key factor in military affairs. The shorter the distance, the greater the ease with which force can be brought to bear upon an opponent. This is because it is easier to undertake the supply of logistics to a force on the ground as well as engage in [[bombardment]]. The importance of distance is demonstrated by the [[Loss of Strength Gradient]] devised by [[Kenneth Boulding]]. This shows the advantage of supply that is forward based.&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. ''Conflict and Defence: A General Theory'', Harper &amp; Bros., 1962, p.262&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Armed Forces classes of supply ==
{{main|Classes of supply}}
The United States Military logistics support is grouped into 10 classes of supply:&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Field Manual 4-0 [[Combat Service Support]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supply chain management in military logistics often deals with a number of variables in predicting cost, deterioration, consumption, and future demand. The US Military's categorical supply classification was developed in such a way that categories of supply with similar consumption variables are grouped together for planning purposes. For instance peacetime consumption of ammunition and fuel will be considerably less than wartime consumption of these items, whereas other classes of supply such as subsistence and clothing have a relatively consistent consumption rate regardless of war or peace. Troops will always require uniform and food.  More troops will require equally more uniforms and food.

In the table above, each class of supply has a consumer.  Some classes of supply have a linear demand relationship—as more troops are added more supply items are needed—as more equipment is used more fuel and ammo is consumed. Other classes of supply must consider a third variable besides usage and quantity: time.  As equipment ages more and more repair parts are needed over time, even when usage and quantity stays consistent.  By recording and analyzing these trends over time and applying to future scenarios, the US military can accurately supply troops with the items necessary at the precise moment they are needed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jlat.army.mil Joint Logistics Analysis Tool])&lt;/ref&gt; History has shown that good logistical planning creates a lean and efficient fighting force. Lack thereof can lead to a clunky, slow, and ill-equipped force with too much or too little supply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4454">'''Neighbourhoods Green''' is an English partnership initiative which works with [[Public housing|social landlords]] and [[housing associations]] to highlight the importance of open and [[Urban open space|green space]] for residents and raise the overall quality of design and management with these groups.

==History and governance==
The partnership was established in 2003 when [[Peabody Trust]] and Notting Hill Housing Group held a conference which identified the need to raise the profile of the green and open spaces owned and managed by social landlords.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zurich.co.uk/municipal/yoursector/socialhousing/neighbourhoodsgreen.htm Neighbourhoods Green], ''Zurich Municipal Website''.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme attracted praise from the then [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for parks and green spaces [[Yvette Cooper]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgcplus.com/lgc-news/minister-applauds-neighbourhoods-green/1276728.article Minister Applauds Neighbourhoods Green], ''Local Government Chronicle'', 4 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003 the partnership has expanded to include [[National Housing Federation]], [[Groundwork UK|Groundwork]], [[The Wildlife Trusts]], [[Landscape Institute]], [[Green Flag Award]], [[Royal Horticultural Society]], [[Natural England]] and [[CABE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/enjoying/linkingpeople/communities/neighbourhoodsgreen/default.aspx Neighbourhoods Green Partners], ''Natural England Website''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is overseen by a steering group which includes representatives from [[Circle Housing Group]], Great Places Housing Group, Helena Homes, [[London Borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham]], Medina Housing, New Charter Housing Trust, Notting Hill Housing, Peabody Trust, [[Places for People]], Regenda Group and Wakefield &amp; District Housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/partners Neighbourhoods Green Partners], ''Neighbourhoods Green Website''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Neighbourhoods Green has three main areas of emphasis. It produces [[best practice]] guidance, highlighting the contribution parks, gardens and play areas make to the quality of life for residents – including the [[mitigation of climate change]], promotion of [[biodiversity]] and aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/news/index.php/news_articles/view/residential_green_space_boosts_community_cohesion/ Residential green space boosts community cohesion], ''Landscape Institute News and Events'' 24 Nov 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also generates a number of case studies from housing associations and community groups and offers training for landlords, residents and partners on areas such as playspace, green infrastructure and growing food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/training Training and Events], ''Neighbourhoods Green''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, working in conjunction with [[University of Sheffield]] and the National Housing Federation, Neighbourhoods Green produced ''Greener Neighbourhoods'' a best practice guide to managing green space for social housing. Its ten principles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/upload/public/documents/webpage/Greener-neighbourhoods-weblinks-2110.pdf Greener Neighbourhoods : A Good Practice Guide to Managing Green Space], ''Neighbourhoods Green'' 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  for housing green space were:
* Commit to quality
* Involve residents
* Know the bigger picture
* Make the best use of funding
* Design for local people
* Develop training and skills	
* Maintain high standards
* Make places feel safe	
* Promote healthy living
* Prepare for climate change		

During 2013/14 Neighbourhoods Green will be working with [[Keep Britain Tidy]] to support the expansion of the Green Flag Award into the social housing sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/about/gfa Green Flag Award], ''Neighbourhoods Green''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1522">[[Image:Nurse tree.jpg|thumb|right|A nurse tree in an Oregon forest.]]
A '''nurse tree''' is a larger, faster-growing tree that shelters a small, slower-growing tree or plant.  The nurse tree can provide shade, shelter from wind, or protection from animals who would feed on the smaller plant.

For example, the [[Norway Spruce]] (Picea abies) and [[Larch]] (Larix) can function as a nurse for [[hardwoods]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningni.gov.uk/areaplans_policy/DesignGuides/RDGNI/Appendix3.htm Northern Ireland, Planning Service Website.  A Design Guide for Rural Northern Ireland.  Appendix 3:  Tree Species.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Sonoran desert]], [[Parkinsonia|Palo Verde]], [[Olneya tesota|Ironwood]] or [[mesquite]] trees serve as nurse trees for young [[Saguaro|saguaro cacti]].  As the Saguaro grows and becomes more acclimated to the desert sun, the older tree may die, leaving the saguaro alone.  In fact, as the Saguaro grows larger it may compete for resources with its nurse tree, hastening its death.  Consequently, young saguaros are often seen near trees, but old saguaros are not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/sagu/naturescience/how-saguaros-grow.htm National Park Service.  How Saguaros Grow.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Early years ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
[[File:Farmer's High School and Old Main.jpg|thumb|left|Old Main c. 1855]]
The school was founded as a degree-granting institution on February 22, 1855, by act P.L. 46, No. 50 of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] as the '''[[Farmers' High School]] of Pennsylvania'''. [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]], Pennsylvania, became the home of the new school when [[James Irvin]] of [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]], Pennsylvania, donated {{convert|200|acre|km2|1}} of land{{spaced ndash}}the first of {{convert|10101|acre|km2|0}} the school would eventually acquire. In 1862, the school's name was changed to the '''Agricultural College of Pennsylvania''', and with the passage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]], Pennsylvania selected the school in 1863 to be the state's sole [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] college. The school's name changed to the '''Pennsylvania State College''' in 1874; enrollment fell to 64 undergraduates the following year as the school tried to balance purely [[Agricultural science|agricultural studies]] with a more classic education.&lt;ref name="history_short" /&gt;

[[George W. Atherton]] became president of the school in 1882, and broadened the curriculum.

=== Early 20th century ===
In the years that followed, Penn State grew significantly, becoming the state's largest grantor of baccalaureate degrees and reaching an enrollment of 5,000 in 1936.&lt;ref name="history_short"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania State University – Mission and Public Character|url=http://www.psu.edu/ur/about/historyshort.html|publisher=Pennsylvania State University |accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, a system of commonwealth campuses was started by President [[Ralph Dorn Hetzel]] to provide an alternative for [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era students who were economically unable to leave home to attend college.&lt;ref name="history_short" /&gt;

In 1953, President [[Milton S. Eisenhower]], brother of then-[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], sought and won permission to elevate the school to university status as '''The Pennsylvania State University'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bezilla|first1=Michael|title=Penn State: An Illustrated History|date=1985|publisher=Pennsylvania State university Press |isbn=0-271-00392-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under his successor [[Eric A. Walker (engineer)|Eric A.

=== Modern era ===
In the 1970s, the university became a [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education|state-related]] institution. As such, it now belongs to the [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]]. In 1975, the lyrics in Penn State's alma mater song were revised to be gender-neutral in honor of [[International Women's Year]]; the revised lyrics were taken from the posthumously-published autobiography of the writer of the original lyrics, Fred Lewis Pattee, and Professor Patricia Farrell acted as a spokesperson for those who wanted the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/ur/about/almamater.html|title=For The Glory of Old State|website=psu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Pennsylvania College of Technology]] in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]] joined ranks with the university, and in 2000, so did the Dickinson School of Law.&lt;ref name="dickinson_history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Penn State Law – History |url=http://law.psu.edu/prospective_students/history|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=September 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609222249/http://law.psu.edu/prospective_students/history|archivedate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is now the largest in Pennsylvania, and in 2003, it was credited with having the second-largest impact on the state economy of any organization, generating an economic effect of over $17 billion on a budget of $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="economic_impact"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pennsylvania State University Economic Impact Statement|url=http://econimpact.psu.edu/|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To offset the lack of funding due to the limited growth in state appropriations to Penn State, the university has concentrated its efforts on philanthropy (2003 marked the end of the Grand Destiny campaign—a seven-year effort that raised over $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Historic Grand Destiny Campaign Raises $1.371 Billion for Penn State |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/219453/2003/07/11/historic-grand-destiny-campaign-raises-1371-billion-penn-state|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Penn State child sex abuse scandal}}

In 2011, the university and its football team garnered major international media attention and criticism due to a [[Penn State sex abuse scandal|sex abuse scandal]] in which university officials were alleged to have covered up incidents of [[child sexual abuse]] by former football team defensive coordinator [[Jerry Sandusky]]. Athletic director [[Timothy Curley]] and Gary Schultz, Senior Vice President for Finance and Business, were indicted for perjury.

A subcommittee of the Board of Trustees engaged former [[FBI]] director [[Louis Freeh]] to head an independent investigation on the university's handling of the incidents. Freeh released his findings in July 2012, announcing that Paterno, along with Spanier, Curley and Schultz "conceal[ed] Sandusky's activities from the Board of Trustees, the University community and authorities" and "failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade".&lt;ref name=FreehReport&gt;[http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/other/REPORT_FINAL_071212.pdf Report of the Special Investigative Counsel Regarding the Pennsylvania State University Related to the Child Sexual Abuse Committed by Gerald A.

An investigation led by former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who was retained by the Paterno family to review the Freeh report,&lt;ref name="usatoday2013" /&gt; concluded that the report that placed so much blame on Penn State and Paterno was a "rush to injustice" that could not be relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thinktank/Penn-State-release-Freeh-report-documents.html|title=Thornburgh: Penn State, release Freeh report documents|date=April 16, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that not only did the evidence "fall far short" of showing Paterno attempted to conceal the Sandusky scandal, but rather that "the contrary is true".&lt;ref name="usatoday2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/02/11/paterno-report-thornburgh/1910529/|author=Dick Thornburgh|title=Freeh hastily misjudged Paterno: Column |work=USA Today |publisher=ESPN |date=February 11, 2013|accessdate=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, state Sen.

Transportation access:

The University Park campus is centrally located at the junction of [[Interstate 99]] and [[U.S. Route 322]], and is due south of [[Interstate 80]]. Before the arrival of the Interstates, University Park was a short distance from the [[Lock Haven, PA|Lock Haven]] – [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]] branch line of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. The last run of long-distance trains from Buffalo or Harrisburg through Lock Haven was in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher T.|last=Baer|title=Named Trains of the PRR including Through Services|year=2009|url=http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR%20NAMED%20TRAINS.pdf|format=PDF|website=prrths.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the nearest passenger rail access is in [[Lewistown, PA|Lewistown]], 31 miles to the southeast. The [[University Park Airport]], serving four [[regional airlines]], is near University Park.

Distance education has a long history at Penn State, one of the first universities in the country to offer a correspondence course for remote farmers in 1892. Examples of online programs include an MBA, master of professional studies in homeland security, a bachelor of science in nursing, and post-baccalaureate certificates in geographic information systems and applied behavior analysis. Penn State's World Campus offers 18 graduate degrees, 21 graduate certificates, 17 undergraduate degrees, and 11 undergraduate certificates. World Campus students come from all 50 U.S. states, more than 40 countries, and six continents.

== Organization and administration ==
Penn State is a "state-related" university, part of Pennsylvania's [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]]. As such, although it receives funding from the Commonwealth and is connected to the state through its board of trustees, it is otherwise independent and not subject to the state's direct control. For the 2006–2007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="state approps"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/03/03-01-06tdc/03-01-06dnews-07.asp |title=Spanier Testifies for More Funding |last=Horan |first=Kevin |date=March 1, 2006 |accessdate=January 27, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031041834/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/03/03-01-06tdc/03-01-06dnews-07.asp |archivedate=October 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports concerning the 2007–2008 fiscal year indicated that Pennsylvania Governor [[Ed Rendell]] is recommending a 1.6 percent increase in state appropriations.&lt;ref name="approps 0708"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/02/02-06-07tdc/02-06-07dweb-03.asp |title=Penn State To Receive Increased Appropriations |last=Boyer |first=Lauren |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 6, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031041856/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/02/02-06-07tdc/02-06-07dweb-03.asp |archivedate=October 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn State's appropriation request, submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education in September, requested a 6.8 percent increase in funding.&lt;ref name="approp request 07-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.psu.edu/President/AppropRequest200708/Table2.asp |title=2007–08 Appropriation Request |accessdate=February 6, 2007 |publisher=University Budget Office.

In addition, the university's Board of Trustees voted in January 2007 to create a [[School of International Affairs]], with the first classes admitted in the fall 2008 semester.&lt;ref name="intl affairs announce"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/198805/2007/01/19/university-establish-school-international-affairs|title=University To Establish School of International Affairs |publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=January 19, 2007|accessdate=January 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is part of Penn State Law.&lt;ref name="intl affairs director"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/198805/2007/01/19/university-establish-school-international-affairs|title=Penn State Names Inaugural Director for School of International Affairs|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=March 28, 2007|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Board of Trustees ===
{{Main|Penn State Board of Trustees}}
The university is governed by the 32-member board of trustees. Its members include the university's president, the [[Governor of Pennsylvania|Governor of the Commonwealth]], and the state Secretaries of Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and Education. The other members include six trustees appointed by the Governor, nine elected by alumni, and six elected by Pennsylvania agricultural societies. Six additional trustees are elected by a board representing business and industry enterprises.&lt;ref name=trusteesmembership&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/selection.html|title=Membership Selection|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduate students do not elect any trustees; the court case ''[[Benner v. Oswald]]'' ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the undergraduate students be allowed to participate in the selection of trustees.

{{as of|2013}}, the chair of the board of trustees is Keith E. Masser, a graduate of Penn State and the Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer of Sterman Masser, Inc.&lt;ref name="trusteescommittees"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/committees.html |title=Committee Memberships &amp; Other Assignments|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main responsibilities of the board are to select the president of Penn State, to determine the goals and strategic direction of the university, and to approve the annual budget.&lt;ref name=trusteesrole&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/governance.html |title=Role of the Board of Trustees in University Governance|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular meetings of the board are held bi-monthly and take place primarily on the University Park campus, although on occasion meetings are held at other locations within the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="trusteesmeetings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/meetings.html|title=Meeting Dates, Agendas, and Minutes|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old Main - Penn State.png|300px|thumb|[[Old Main (Pennsylvania State University)|Old Main]], the main administrative building of Penn State, located at University Park.]]

The president of the university is selected by the board and is given the authority for actual control of the university, including day-to-day management. In practice, part of this responsibility is delegated by the president to other departments of the administration, to the faculty, and to the student body.&lt;ref name=trusteesrole /&gt; [[Eric J.

=== Student government ===
[[File:Penn state hub building exterior.jpg|thumb|Penn State's student union building, the [[HUB-Robeson Center]]]]

Penn State has a long history of student governance. Elected student leaders remain directly involved in the decision-making of the university administration, as provided for in the Board of Trustee's Standing Orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/trustees/pdf/standingorders.pdf Standing Orders (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are three Student Governments recognized by the university administration: the University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA), the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA), and the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG).

The University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA) is the representative student government of the 39,102&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Undergraduate and Graduate/First Professional Enrollment Fall Enrollment 2012 and 2011 |url=http://budget.psu.edu/factbook/StudentDynamic/UGGREnrollSummary.aspx?YearCode=2012Enr&amp;FBPlusIndc=N |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005035001/http://www.budget.psu.edu/FactBook/StudentDynamic/UGGREnrollSummary.aspx?YearCode=2012Enr&amp;FBPlusIndc=N |archivedate=October 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; undergraduate students at Penn State's University Park campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Park Undergraduate Association|url=http://upua.psu.edu/|publisher=The University Park Undergraduate Association|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was established in 2006 after the former student government, Undergraduate Student Government (USG), lost its recognition by way of a student referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPUA History |url=http://upua.org/history/|publisher=The University Park Undergraduate Association|accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227101957/http://upua.org/history/|archivedate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UPUA is composed of an Assembly of Student Representatives, an Executive Board, and a Judicial Board. The Executive Board is the bureaucratic branch of the UPUA and is led by Student Body President Katie Jordan. The Assembly, which is led by Chair Brent Rice, is the [[legislative]] body of UPUA and is composed of elected representatives whose constituencies include the academic units of Penn State, Greek Life, Freshmen Representatives, and At-Large Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Assembly |url=http://pennstateupua.com/generalassembly|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222144/http://pennstateupua.com/generalassembly|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 4, 2013|publisher=The University Park Undergraduate Association|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UPUA meets every Wednesday at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm in 233A HUB.

The graduate and professional students of the university are governed by the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA), which is the oldest continuously existing student governance organization at Penn State.&lt;ref name=gpsa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpsa.psu.edu |title=GPSA – Home |website=GPSA.PSU.EDU |accessdate=July 24, 2012 |archivedate=August 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806081621/http://gpsa.psu.edu/ |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPSA "work[s] on the behalf of the students to make sure that the graduate voice is heard by all levels of the administration and faculty at Penn State and to put on events geared towards graduate and professional students."&lt;ref name=gpsa /&gt;

The 19 [[Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth campuses|commonwealth campuses]] of the university are governed by the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG), formerly known as the Council of Branch Campus Student Governments (CBCSG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psuccsg.org/ |title=CCSG &amp;#124; Council of Commonwealth Student Governments |website=Php.scripts.psu.edu |accessdate=January 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929032127/http://php.scripts.psu.edu/clubs/up/ccsg/index.php |archivedate=September 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
Penn State is [[regional accreditation|regionally accredited]] by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]].

{{as of|2009|September}}, only 24 Pennsylvania colleges and universities held [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] accreditation in business and only four in accounting. The [[Smeal College of Business]], The [[Sam and Irene Black School of Business]], [[Penn State Harrisburg]], and [[Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies|Penn State Great Valley]] were among the institutions accredited.&lt;ref name=aacsb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/General/InstLists.asp?lid=3 |title=Schools Accredited in Business – ordered by country, state, name |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222080454/http://www.aacsb.edu/General/InstLists.asp?lid=3 |archivedate=February 22, 2007 |accessdate=February 28, 2007 |publisher=The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university offers an accelerated [[Pre-medical|Premedical]]-[[Medical education in the United States|Medical]] Program in cooperation with [[Thomas Jefferson University|Sidney Kimmel Medical College]].&lt;ref name="pmm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.psu.edu/premed/6yrpremedprogram.html |title=Penn State's Accelerated Premedical-Medical Program |publisher=Penn State Eberly College of Science |accessdate=April 28, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414083712/http://www.science.psu.edu/premed/6yrpremedprogram.html |archivedate=April 14, 2005 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in the program spend two or three years at the university before attending medical school at Jefferson.

Recently, a joint venture between the [[Eberly College of Science]] and the [[Smeal College of Business]] created an integrated undergraduate/graduate program to give highly motivated students the opportunity to receive a bachelor's degree in Science and an MBA two to five years sooner than those pursuing a traditional path. The BS/MBA Program prepares individuals to be future leaders of the world's scientific organizations and is led by Mr. Peter Tombros and Dr. James Gardner.

=== Demographics ===
As of fall 2010, the racial makeup of the Penn State system including all campuses and special-mission colleges, was 75.4 percent white, 5.5 percent black, 4.3 percent Asian, 4.4 percent Hispanic, 0.2 percent Native American, 0.1 percent Native Hawaiian/Pac Island, 1.7 percent two or more races, 5.8 percent international students and 3.1 percent of an unknown race. Over the period 2000–2010, minority enrollment as a percentage of total enrollments has risen 5.3 percentage points,&lt;ref name="Enrollment by Race/Ethnicity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.psu.edu/FactBook/StudentDynamic/minorityenrolbyethnicity.aspx?YearCode=2010&amp;FBPlusIndc=N |title=Enrollment by Race/Ethnicity |work=Penn State Fact Book |publisher=University Budget Office.

Penn State has been the subject of controversy for several issues of discrimination. Following some violent attacks on African-Americans in downtown State College in 1988 and complaints that Penn State was not adequately recruiting African-American faculty and students to representative population levels, student activists occupied Old Main and demanded that Penn State do more to recruit minority students and address intolerance toward minority students on campus, as well as in the local community.  After President Bryce Jordan canceled a promised meeting with students and organizations in the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on April 8, 1988, 250 students and activists nonviolently occupied Penn State's Telecommunications building on campus. The following morning, 50 state troopers and 45 local and campus police, equipped with helmets, batons, and rubber gloves, entered the building as the crowd outside sang "We Shall Overcome", arresting 89 individuals for trespassing.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]''. April 11, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; All charges were later dismissed.

In 1990 a vice provost for educational equity was appointed to lead a five-year strategic plan to "create an environment characterized by equal access and respected participation for all groups and individuals irrespective of cultural differences."&lt;ref name="vp ed equity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equity.psu.edu/|title=Office of the Vice Provost for Educational Equity|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=February 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="framework mission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equity.psu.edu/framework/campus-climate|title=Campus Climate and Intergroup Relations |work=A Framework To Foster Diversity at Penn State, 2004–2009|author=Office of the Vice Provost for Educational Equity|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=December 12, 2005 |accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, discrimination issues include the handling of death threats in 1992 and 2001,&lt;ref name="village threats"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_153a562b-d9da-559a-86df-1d7ccdea836d.html|title=University, students respond to threats|last=Grote|first=Danielle|date=April 29, 2002|work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_d4ef9159-6474-5dcd-9a29-a32e2e458921.html|title=African Americans Should Not Trust 'Devilish' White People|work=The Daily Collegian|accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=January 28, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thompson|first=Amanda|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_2e86668d-40a5-594d-8cfc-956d4018f24c.html|title=Collegian columnist generating national stir|date=February 3, 1992|work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andron|first=Scott |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_397eb196-3e9e-51ba-8db3-9d586b9aa7df.html|title=Case might affect policy|work=The Daily Collegian|date=August 4, 1992|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversy around [[LGBT]] issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Patrick R. |last=Gibbons |title=My Opinion: Conservatives Are the Group in the Closet |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2003/04/04-08-03tdc/04-08-03dops-column-01.asp |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603030213/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2003/04/04-08-03tdc/04-08-03dops-column-01.asp |archivedate=June 3, 2009 |date=April 8, 2003 |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the investigation of a 2006 sexual discrimination lawsuit filed by former Lady Lions basketball player [[Jennifer Harris]], alleging that head coach [[Rene Portland]] dismissed her from the team in part due to her perceived sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=amicable&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/198428/2007/02/05/harris-claim-settled |title=Harris Claim Settled|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=February 5, 2007|accessdate=February 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="old main protest"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/image_3a5265c9-f4d8-5c3e-8a75-02f77779bd61.html|title=Activists Protest Diversity Policies |author1=MGll, Andrew |author2=Owens, Alyssa |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]|accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=February 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Materials Research Institute was created to coordinate the highly diverse and growing materials activities across Penn State's University Park campus. With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments, 4 colleges, and 2 Department of Defense research laboratories, MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and thereby enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university. Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high-temperature materials. He pioneered high-temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high-temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high-temperature materials. His vision for Interdisciplinary research played a key role in the creation of the Materials Research Institute, and the establishment of Penn State as an acknowledged leader among major universities in materials education and research.&lt;ref name="aboutmri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mri.psu.edu/AboutMRI/index.asp |title=About MRI |author=Materials Research Institute |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912072004/http://www.mri.psu.edu/AboutMRI/index.asp |archivedate=September 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mri.psu.edu/|title=Materials Research Institute|author=Materials Research Institute|accessdate=August 27, 2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.matse.psu.edu/ret/tresslerbio |title=Dr. Richard E.

{{Main|Penn State Nittany Lions}}

Penn State's mascot is the [[Nittany Lion]], a representation of a type of [[mountain lion]] that once roamed what is now University Park. The school's official colors, now blue and white, were originally black and dark pink.  Penn State participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I FBS]] and in the [[Big Ten Conference]] for most sports.&lt;ref name="ncaa directory"&gt;{{cite web|title=NCAA Members by Division|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/onlineDir/exec/divisionListing|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|quote=Select Division I and press Run Report|accessdate=August 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611161846/http://web1.ncaa.org/onlineDir/exec/divisionListing#|archive-date=June 11, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two sports participate in different conferences: men's volleyball in the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] (EIVA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EIVA, Penn State Member Page|url=http://www.eivavolleyball.com/members/penn_state/index|website=Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women's hockey in [[College Hockey America]] (CHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Women's Hockey Quick Facts|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/psu/sports/w-hockey/auto_pdf/2015-16/quick_facts/quick_facts.pdf|website=GoPSUsports.com|publisher=Penn State Athletics |format=PDF|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fencing teams operate as independents.

Athletic teams at Penn State have won 77 national collegiate team championships (49 [[NCAA]], 2 consensus [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|Division I football]] titles, 6 [[AIAW Champions|AIAW]], 3 USWLA, 1 [[Women's International Bowling Congress|WIBC]], and 4 national titles in boxing, 11 in men's soccer and one in wrestling in years prior to NCAA sponsorship).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/national-champions.html Penn State championship history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324043952/http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/national-champions.html# |date=March 24, 2009 }}".

Since joining the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] in 1991, Penn State teams have won 103 conference regular season and tournament titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/big-ten-champions.html|title=Penn State Has Won 103 Big Ten Regular Season and Tournament Championships|last=|first=|date=|website=GoPSUsports.com|publisher=Penn State Athletics|accessdate=April 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704120746/http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/big-ten-champions.html#|archive-date=July 4, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn State has one of the most successful overall athletic programs in the country, as evidenced by its rankings in the [[NACDA Director's Cup]], a list compiled by the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] that charts institutions' overall success in college sports. From the Cup's inception in the 1993–1994 season, the Nittany Lions have finished in the top 25 every year.&lt;ref name=dcup&gt;{{cite web|title=Nittany Lions No. 9 in Final Directors' Cup Standings; Penn State Earns Eighth Top 10 Finish in the Survey's 15 Years|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/genrel/062608aab.html|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=June 26, 2008|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite widespread success in the overall athletic program, however, the school is best known for its [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|football team]], which draws a very large following. Penn State's Beaver Stadium has the second largest [[seating capacity]] of any stadium in the nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fortuna |first=Matt |accessdate=September 24, 2008 |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/03/17/beaver_to_rule_arenas.aspx |title=Beaver To Rule Arenas |date=March 17, 2008 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202110638/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/03/17/beaver_to_rule_arenas.aspx |archivedate=December 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an official capacity of 106,572 slightly behind Michigan Stadium with an official capacity of 107,601. For decades, the football team was led by coach [[Joe Paterno]]. Paterno was in a close competition with [[Bobby Bowden]], the head coach for [[Florida State]], for the most wins ever in Division I-A (now the FBS) history. This competition effectively ended with Paterno still leading following Bowden's retirement after the [[2010 Gator Bowl]]. In 2007, he was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paterno inducted into College Football Hall of Fame |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/192048/2007/11/30/paterno-inducted-college-football-hall-fame|publisher= Pennsylvania State University |date=November 30, 2007|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterno amassed 409 victories over his career, the most in NCAA Division 1 history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=With Penn State wins restored, Joe Paterno the winningest coach again |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2015/01/16/ncaa-joe-paterno-wins-restored-penn-state-settlement/21867685/ |accessdate=November 27, 2015|publisher=USA Today|date=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterno died on January 22, 2012, at the age of 85.

The school's wrestling team has also become noticed. Under [[Cael Sanderson]], the Nittany Lions won six national titles in a seven-year span, from 2011 to 2017.

The university opened a new [[Penn State All-Sports Museum]] in February 2002. This two-level {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|-3|adj=on}} museum is located inside Beaver Stadium.&lt;ref name="sports museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=GoPSUsports.com – Official Home of Penn State Athletics |url=http://www.gopsusports.com/hallfame/psu-hallfame.html |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |accessdate=July 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723052027/http://www.gopsusports.com/hallfame/psu-hallfame.html |archivedate=July 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the school funded athletics, club sports also play a major role in the university, with over 68 club sport organizations meeting regularly to date. Many club teams compete nationally in their respective sports. The Penn State Ski Team, which competes as part of the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA) in the Allegheny Conference, as well as the Penn State Swim Club, which competes in the American Swimming Association – University League (ASAU), are just a few examples. Some other clubs include baseball, [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[karate]], [[crew (sport)|crew]], and sailing.

Penn State's most well known athletic cheer is "We are...Penn State." Typically, the students and cheerleaders shout, "We are," followed by a response of "Penn State" from the rest of the fans. By tradition, this is done three times, and followed by "Thank you..." "... You're welcome!"

[[File:presidenthouse.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Former President's house, now adjoined to the Hintz Alumni Center]]

Established in 1870, nine years after the university's first commencement exercises, the Penn State Alumni Association has the stated mission "to connect alumni to the University and to each other, provide valuable benefits to members and support the University's mission of teaching, research, and service."&lt;ref name="psaa mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Penn State Alumni Association |url=http://www.alumni.psu.edu/about_us/default.htm |accessdate=January 23, 2007 |publisher=Penn State Alumni Association |archivedate=January 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123010417/http://www.alumni.psu.edu/about_us/default.htm |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alumni Association supports a number of educational and extracurricular missions of Penn State through financial support and is the network that connects alumni through over 280 "alumni groups", many of which are designated based on geographical, academic, or professional affiliation.&lt;ref name="psaa groups"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alumni Groups |url=http://www.alumni.psu.edu/groups/default.htm|accessdate=January 23, 2007|publisher=Penn State Alumni Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, the university, along with all schools in the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], has participated in the "Big Ten Challenge" website, which is a "competitive" clearinghouse of alumni donation statistics for member schools. Results are tracked to determine a percentage of each school's alumni from the previous decade who gave to their alma mater each calendar year (during the 2005–2006 year, alumni donations from 1996 to 2005 were tallied).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2872">The '''Perestroika Movement''' is a loose-knit intellectual tendency in academic [[political science]] which seeks to expand [[methodological pluralism]] in order to make the discipline more accessible and relevant to laypeople and non-specialist academics. Established in 2000, the movement was organized in response to the perceived hegemony of quantitative and mathematical methodology in the field. Such dominance breeds academic isolation and poor scholarship, the movement's leaders contend.

==Origins==

The Perestroika Movement began in 2000 with an anonymous e-mail message sent by one “Mr. [[Perestroika]]” to the editors of the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' calling for "a dismantling of the [[Orwellian system]] that we have in [[American Political Science Association|APSA]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/OnTheIrrelevanceOfApsaAndApsrToTheStudyOfPoliticalScience E-mail from Mr. Perestroika, October 17, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; The message went to seventeen recipients who quickly forwarded it to others, and within weeks the Perestroika Movement became a force calling for change in the American political science community (Monroe 2005).

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The '''pilot Polder Andijk''', or '''Test Polder Andijk''', ''Proefpolder Andijk'' in Dutch, is a [[polder]] established in 1926 - 1927 in the Zuiderzee near the village of [[Andijk]]. The aim of this prototype is to study the embankments and agriculture for future polders in the [[Zuiderzee Works]].&lt;ref name=hoeksema2006&gt;{{cite book |title=Designed for dry feet: flood protection and [[land reclamation]] in the Netherlands |last=Hoeksema |first=R. J. |page=70 |year=2006 |publisher=[[ASCE Publications]] |isbn=978-0-7844-0829-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the pilot polder was inaugurated by [[Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]].

==Construction==
In 1924 the Lovink Committee published a proposal to build a pilot polder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Land conservation and development: examples of land-use planning projects and programs |last=Steiner |first=Frederick R. |author2=H. N. van Lier  |page=21 |year=1984 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=978-0-444-42253-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This polder could, on a small scale experiment future agriculture. The knowledge would then be used for the [[Wieringermeer]]. For this reason, in 1926-1927 near the village Andijk, {{convert|40|hectare}} of land were reclaimed.&lt;ref name=hoeksema2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="ley196110"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 27, 1927, the pilot polder was drained. The cost of the polder, about 1 million guilders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wunderwerke von Menschenhand |last=Karger-Decker |first=Bernt |page=408 |year=1963 |publisher=Koehler &amp; Amelang |oclc=73487630 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was relatively high, but the cost of polders to come should be lower.

==Research==
The Directorate of [[Wieringermeer]] wanted to study the behavior of a [[land reclamation|soil recovered from the sea]], and how saline soils can be cultivated. After the draining was completed, a farm was built as well as laboratories for agriculture, soil science and research in microbiology. Different aspects for optimal use of land have been studied, such as desalination, drying and compacting. Experiments were also made to know the best way to cultivate and to select suitable crops. Some species can concentrate the salt and prepare future plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Polderlands |last=Wagret |first=Paul |page=117 |year=1968 |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing]] |oclc=462365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
By 1929 the polder was dry. Rain normally washes salt from reclaimed land in six or seven years; to make the soil useful faster, [[gypsum]] was added to the soil with different fertilizers in various parts of the [[experimental farm]]. The land became an ordinary farm on 1 November 1935{{r|ley196110}} after tests showed that the polder could be cultivated. With the experience gained in the pilot, development of the polder Wieringermeer was accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The golden band: Holland's fight against the sea |last=Jenkins |first=Alan C. |page=71 |year=1966 |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing]] |oclc=955509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later use==
In the late twentieth century the polder became a site for holiday homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In praise of common sense: planning the ordinary: a physical planning history of the new towns in the Ijsselmeerpolders |last=van der Wal |first=Coen |page=83 |year=1997 |publisher=010 Publishers |isbn=978-90-6450-302-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21144">'''Problematic integration theory''' is a [[Outline of communication|theory of communication]] that addresses the processes and dynamics of how people receive, evaluate, and respond to information and experiences. The premises of PI are based on the view that message processing, specifically the development of probabilistic and evaluative orientations (our perceptions of something's likelihood of occurring and its value, respectively), is a social and cultural construction. In situations where there is agreement between probabilistic orientation (a person's constructed belief about an object's likelihood, i.e., how likely something is to occur) and evaluative orientation (a person's constructed belief about an object's value), integration is in harmony, i.e., not problematic. However, when there is disagreement between these orientations about an object (i.e., an event, thing, person, idea, outcome, etc.), then integration becomes problematic. This disharmony leads to conflict and discomfort, which can manifest itself as cognitive, communicative, affective, and/or motivational.

== History ==
Austin Babrow&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014234303/http://coms.ohiou.edu/austin-babrow Austin Babrow, Ph.D.], Ohio University (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; first introduced the theory of Problematic Integration (PI) in 1992.  Babrow brought together a diverse and interdisciplinary literature (from the field of communication and related disciplines, like psychology, sociology, and philosophy) to serve as building blocks for his new theory.  Among the theoretical underpinnings that support PI are:  [[uncertainty reduction theory]]; the theory of belief in a just world; analysis of decision-making; the theory of and motivation and self-esteem; and [[cognitive dissonance]]. However, despite integrating elements from these theories, PI has striking differences (e.g., unlike URT, PI does not assume that uncertainty is an undesirable situation, nor does it suggest that resolution of uncertainty is always necessary or desirable).&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''[[Journal of Communication]]'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 456-476.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

Problematic Integration is a type of message-processing communication theory that relates to theories of decision making and persuasion.  Problematic Integration Theory (PI) proposes that: (1) people orient themselves to the world by forming both probabilistic and evaluative orientations; (2) that probability and evaluation are not independent from one another; (3) that probability and evaluation are socially based and socially constructed, and that probability and evaluation are integral to our daily experience; and, (4) that integration of these orientations can be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 555.&lt;/ref&gt;  Probabilistic orientation is an assessment of the likelihood of an event or outcome.  Evaluative orientation is an assessment of the favorability of an outcome. Often, assessments of probability and value are cooperative and easily integrated. However, as the theory's title implies, there are occasions when integration becomes problematic. PI proposes that integration becomes more difficult as:
# clarity of object probability decreases
# object value conflicts increase
# or, there is an increase in the divergence between object expectation and desire&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''[[Communication Monographs]]'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, problematic integration is what we experience when our probabilistic and evaluative orientations conflict with one another, causing instability and disharmony.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conflict arising from problematic integration may or may not be significant.  The more important a value and the more central an issue (or object, to use PI terminology) is to one's beliefs or cultural values, the more likely that problematic integration will cause greater discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 287-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assumptions of problematic integration theory===

Babrow identified four distinct manifestations, or forms, of problematic integration:
# Divergence
# Ambiguity
# Ambivalence
# Impossibility

The first of these integrative predicaments, divergence, arises when there is a discrepancy between what we believe to be true or to be likely to occur and what we want to be true (the desired outcome). Ambiguity arises when the probability or value of an object (i.e., situation, outcome, thing, etc.) is unclear or highly uncertain. Babrow explained, that “in ambiguous situations, neither the outcome, nor the probability of the outcome is known, though the latter has restrictions” (Babrow, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;112).  Uncertainty occurs when an unknown factor obscures or complicates the development of one's orientation (probability and evaluation) toward an outcome.   Ambiguity has also been described as uncertainty about what is unknown.  Ambivalence is borne from one of two conditions: (1) an individual is forced to choose between two similarly valued alternatives; or (2) an individual is forced to choose between mutually exclusive alternatives. The last form of PI, impossibility, occurs upon the realization or belief that an outcome is will not happen. Impossibility is recognized as different from a form of divergence, because only impossibility denotes a sense of certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, Communication Monographs, 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 285-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Responses to impossibility can range from a sense of futility, to one of increased motivation to deny the impossibility. All of these situations give rise to conflict.

===The role of communication in problematic integration theory===

Communication is both a source of, a medium, and a method for resolving conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;  Communication is a source of problematic integration in that knowledge and evaluative orientations are the result of communication, probabilistic and evaluative orientations are based on and developed through message and [[meaning-making]] (forms of communication), and communication is itself "an object of thought" and is therefore  an object "of probabilistic and evaluative orientations."&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible that a person experiencing problematic integration will seek new information or new sources of information to bolster or reinforce a desired probabilistic or evaluative orientation.  This could also be seen engaging in as a form of [[cognitive dissonance]].  Communication is seen as a medium of problematic integration because communication inherently involves or is based on probabilistic and evaluative orientations, or communication is about probability and value.  Communication is influenced by and formed from culture; thus, communication is a medium of PI, as and the formation of probabilistic and evaluative orientations derives from cultural frameworks.  Lastly, communication is a resource for PI as we try to resolve and manage conflict caused by problematic integration through communication (internal, interpersonal, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because communication may be a source, medium, and/or method for resolving problematic integration, it is possible for conflict to manifest as "extended chains" of problematic integration.  Such extended chains occur through forms, foci, and layers of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 461-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  By extended chains, it is meant that experiences of problematic integration and efforts to resolve problematic integration may lead to development of a new form of PI.  As conflict between probability and value develops around a focal point (or topic), it can lead to conflict regarding a new topic (e.g., stress and anxiety about earning an end-of-year bonus at work can lead to new worries about personal finances, sense of self-worth, and/or one's status and career prospects at work).  Problematic integration becomes shared (or chained) through layers of experience when people discuss and relate their struggles with others.  In this process of communicating our conflicts, others may share in our problematic integration through empathy and sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 287&lt;/ref&gt;  Babrow proposed that communication becomes more important to resolve problematic integration as the conflict or integration becomes more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique and analysis===

As mentioned above, Problematic Integration Theory is a type of communication theory that examines how we make meaning of information and experiences, and how we handle uncertainty.  PI differs from [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory]] and other axiomatic and predictive communication theories in a number of ways.  PI proposes that there are numerous and varied meanings of the term uncertainty.  Unlike URT, PI predicts that experiencing uncertainty does not automatically lead to a desire to reduce the uncertainty.  Further, PI proposes that: (1) uncertainty is not always "bad; (2) uncertainty has a single or narrow meaning; (3) reduction of uncertainty is not always possible; (4) any resolution of uncertainty is not necessarily final; and, (5) integrative dilemmas do not necessarily have an identifiable or singular cause.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 562-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problematic Integration Theory (PI) falls under the socio-psychological and socio-cultural communication traditions. PI began with a focus on intra- and inter-personal contexts, but has been applicable in many contexts, including interpersonal, small group, and organizational; thus, it has a broad scope of application.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, Journal of Communication, September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 568.&lt;/ref&gt;  PI is considered an interpretive/hermeneutic approach of theory rather than positivistic/empirical (i.e., predictive) or critical.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related work: uncertainty management theory===

Babrow's theory shares some common ideas with Uncertainty Management Theory (UMT), which was developed by Dale Brashers (2007, A theory of communication and uncertainty management. In B. Whaley &amp; W. Samter (Eds.), Explaining communication theory (pp.&amp;nbsp;201–218). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum). For a comparison of the perspectives, see Bradac (2001).&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 463-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current usage ==

The complexity of PI and the multiplicity of its manifestations makes it difficult to operationalize, measure, and apply.  However, this breadth of scope also indicates that it may have extremely wide-ranging applications and opportunities for research.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 466.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the concepts within PI are based on cultural definitions, PI is seen as being overly responsive to external conceptual influences; thus, making it potentially falsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

PI has been used within the realm of [[Health Communication]] studies in order to assess methods of educating, and communicating with, patients facing a variety chronic or life-threatening conditions. In 2003, Babrow received the prestigious Woolbert Award for scholarship of exceptional originality and influence from the National Communication Association [http://www.natcom.org/nca/Template2.asp?sid=9] for his work with PI.

PI has been used extensively in analysis of the health care system, particularly in regard to communication between health care providers and patients.  The health-care system inherently involves communication between health-care providers (e.g., doctors, nurses, various therapists, dietitians, social workers, counselors, etc.), patients, and members of the patient's social and support network (e.g., family members, friends, members of support groups, etc.).  Because understanding and communicating diagnoses, prognoses, treatment plans, expectations, and more can be complicated and because this communication relies on the communication skills of the various people involved, health-care situations offer ample opportunity to examine problematic integration.  Research in this area has revealed that information is used to decrease and increase uncertainty, depending on the situation.  In some cases, patients may seek information to reduce stressful uncertainty.  However, in other cases, the care team and the patient may need to increase uncertainty in order to increase optimism and allow for re-evaluation of a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Brashers, Dale E., Daena J. Goldsmith, and Elaine Hsieh; “Information Seeking and Avoiding in Health Contexts”, ''Human Communication Research'', 2002, Vol. 28, No. 2, pp. 261-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  PI has been used to study communication involving various medical issues, including breast cancer,&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, Michael Robert, Adrianne Kunkel, and Joann Keyton; “Problematic Integration Theory, Appraisal Theory, and the Bosom Buddies Breast Cancer Support Group”, Journal of Applied Communication Research, Ed. 36, pp. 415-436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Leigh A., Austin S. Babrow, and Cynthia Stohl; “Social Support Messages and the Management of Uncertainty in the Experience of Breast Cancer: An Application of Problematic Integration Theory”, Communication Monographs, 1996, Vol. 63, pp. 189-207.&lt;/ref&gt; the treatment of diabetes in the elderly, end-of-life issues, and pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias, Marianne Sassi and Austin S. Babrow; “Problematic Integration of Uncertainty and Desire in Pregnancy”, Qualitative Health Research, 2007, Vol. 17, pp. 786-798.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthias, Marianne Sassi; “Problematic Integration in Pregnancy and Childbirth: Contrasting Approaches to Uncertainty and Desire in Obstetric and Midwifery Care”, Health Communication, 2009, Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problematic Integration has also been used to evaluate [[organizational communication]].  Organizations, comprising networks and hierarchies of individuals, by their very nature, create complex webs of various dynamic social and cultural relationships.  Moreover, most organizations do not exist for themselves, but for an external audience, client, or consumer; thereby, increasing the nature, types, and numbers of relationships.  Communication within these relationships will very likely give rise to instances of uncertainty.  In the context of such complex systems of communication, PI takes on a much different appearance than intrapersonal situations.  An organization's structure, system design, and strategy can create, maintain, or help reduce problematic integration.&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, Robert D. and Pamela Zaug, “Organizational Theory, Organizational Communication, Organizational Knowledge, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 578-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

One area of this study has been problematic integration arising from [[Constitutive role of communication in organizations|internal bureaucracy or organizational rules or objectives]] and how this conflict involves matters of formal rationality (a quantitative calculation of an action or choice) or substantive rationality (a value judgment of consequences of an action or choice).&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, Robert D. and Pamela Zaug, “Organizational Theory, Organizational Communication, Organizational Knowledge, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 575-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In examining marketing strategies for tourism, PI has been used to suggest methods for decreasing uncertainty for potential customers and thereby increasing transactions from the on-line shoppers for the related retail businesses ("converting lookers to bookers").&lt;ref&gt;Han, Jee-Hee and Juline E. Mills, “The Use of Problematic Integration Theory to Assess Destination On-Line Promotion Activities: The Case of Australia.com in the United States Market”, ''Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing'', 2006, Vol. 20 (3/4), pp. 93-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, PI lends itself to application to a broad scope of issues.  A few other examples of areas of interest to which PI has been applied include:
* [[Risk management tools|Risk study and evaluation]]&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Laura and Austin Babrow; “Risk in the Making: Narrative, Problematic Integration, and the Social Construction of Risk”, Communications Theory, 2011, pp. 239-260.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Family and relationships
* [[Narrative communication]]
* [[Mass media]] and [[media Studies]] (e.g., news reporting)
* Marketing and advertising

[[Image:Pert chart colored.svg|thumb|309px|PERT network chart for a seven-month project with five [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] (10 through 50) and six activities (A through F).]]

The '''program '''(or '''project''') '''evaluation and review technique''' ('''PERT''') is a statistical tool used in [[project management]], which was designed to analyze and represent the [[task (project management)|tasks]] involved in completing a given [[project]]. 

First developed by the [[United States Navy]] in the 1950s, it is commonly used in conjunction with the [[critical path method]] (CPM).

== Overview ==
Project Evaluation and Review Techniques is commonly abbreviated to PERT.
PERT is a method of analyzing the tasks involved in completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and to identify the minimum time needed to complete the total project. It incorporates uncertainty by making it possible to schedule a project while not knowing precisely the details and [[Duration (project management)|durations]] of all the activities. It is more of an event-oriented technique rather than start- and completion-oriented, and is used more in projects where time is the major factor rather than cost. It is applied to very large-scale, one-time, complex, non-routine infrastructure and Research and Development projects.

Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) offers a management tool, which relies "on arrow and node diagrams of ''activities'' and ''events'': arrows represent the ''activities'' or work necessary to reach the ''events'' or nodes that indicate each completed phase of the total project."&lt;ref name="MB 1968"/&gt;

PERT and CPM are complementary tools, because "CPM employs one time estimate and one cost estimate for each activity; PERT may utilize three time estimates (optimistic, expected, and pessimistic) and no costs for each activity. Although these are distinct differences, the term PERT is applied increasingly to all critical path scheduling."&lt;ref name="MB 1968"/&gt;

==History==
"PERT" was developed primarily to simplify the planning and scheduling of large and complex projects. It was developed for the [[United States Navy Special Projects Office|U.S. Navy Special Projects Office]] in 1957 to support the U.S. Navy's Polaris nuclear submarine project.&lt;ref name="MRCW 1959"&gt;Malcolm, D. G., J. H. Roseboom, C. E. Clark, [[Willard Fazar|W. Fazar]]. "Application of a Technique for Research and Development Program Evaluation," ''OPERATIONS RESEARCH,'' Vol. 7, No. 5, September–October 1959, pp. 646–669&lt;/ref&gt; It found applications all over industry. An early example was it was used for the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]] which applied PERT from 1965 until the opening of the 1968 Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1968/or1968.pdf 1968 Winter Olympics official report.] p. 49. Accessed 1 November 2010. {{en icon}} &amp; {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project model was the first of its kind, a revival for [[scientific management]], founded by Frederick Taylor ([[Taylorism]]) and later refined by Henry Ford ([[Fordism]]). [[DuPont]]'s [[critical path method]] was invented at roughly the same time as PERT.

[[File:PERT Summary Report Phase 2, 1958.jpg|thumb|upright|''PERT Summary Report Phase 2'', 1958]]
Initially PERT stood for ''Program Evaluation Research Task,'' but by 1959 was already renamed.&lt;ref name="MRCW 1959"/&gt; It had been made public in 1958 in two publications of the U.S. Department of the Navy, entitled ''Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of the Navy. ''[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/735902.pdf Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1].'' Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Phase 2.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of the Navy. ''[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100954569 Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 2].'' Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1959 article in  ''The American Statistician'' the main [[Willard Fazar]], Head of the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, U.S. Navy, gave a detailed description of the main concepts of the PERT. He explained:

{{Quote|Through an electronic computer, the PERT technique processes data representing the major, finite accomplishments (events) essential to achieve end-objectives; the inter-dependence of those events; and [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]] of time and range of time necessary to complete each activity between two successive events. Such time expectations include estimates of "most likely time", "optimistic time", and "pessimistic time" for each activity. The technique is a management control tool that sizes up the outlook for meeting objectives on time; highlights danger signals requiring management decisions; reveals and defines both methodicalness and slack in the flow plan or the network of sequential activities that must be performed to meet objectives; compares current expectations with [[Schedule (project management)|scheduled]] completion dates and computes the probability for meeting scheduled dates; and simulates the effects of options for decision&amp;nbsp;— before decision.&lt;br /&gt;The concept of PERT was developed by an operations research team staffed with representatives from the Operations Research Department of [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]; the Evaluation Office of the [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems|Lockheed Missile Systems Division]]; and the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, of the Department of the Navy.&lt;ref name="SDFJWM 1959"&gt;[[Willard Fazar]] cited in: B. Ralph Stauber, H. M. Douty, Willard Fazar, Richard H. Jordan, William Weinfeld and Allen D. Manvel. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2682310 Federal Statistical Activities]."

[[File:PERT Guide for management use, June 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|''PERT Guide for management use'', June 1963]]
Ten years after the introduction of PERT in 1958 the American [[librarian]] Maribeth Brennan published a selected [[bibliography]] with about 150 publications on PERT and CPM, which had been published between 1958 and 1968. The origin and development was summarized as follows:
{{Quote|PERT originated in 1958 with the... [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris missile]] design and construction scheduling. Since that time, it has been used extensively not only by the [[aerospace industry]] but also in many situations where management desires to achieve an objective or complete a task within a scheduled time and cost expenditure; it came into popularity when the algorithm for calculating a maximum value path was conceived. PERT and CPM may be calculated manually or with a computer, but usually they require major computer support for detailed projects. A number of colleges and universities now offer instructional courses in both.&lt;ref name="MB 1968"&gt;Brennan, Maribeth, ''PERT and CPM: a selected bibliography,''  Monticello, Ill., Council of Planning Librarians, 1968. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the subdivision of work units in PERT&lt;ref&gt;Desmond L. Cook (1966), ''Program Evaluation and Review Technique.'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; another tool was developed: the [[Work Breakdown Structure]]. The Work Breakdown Structure provides "a framework for complete networking, the Work Breakdown Structure was formally introduced as the first item of analysis in carrying out basic PERT/COST."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bright Maynard]] (1967), ''Handbook of Business Administration.'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
=== Events and activities ===
In a PERT diagram, the main building block is the ''event'', with connections to its known predecessor events and successor events.
* ''PERT event'': a point that marks the start or completion of one or more activities. It consumes no time and uses no resources. When it marks the completion of one or more activities, it is not "reached" (does not occur) until ''all'' of the activities leading to that event have been completed.
* ''predecessor event'': an event that immediately precedes some other event without any other events intervening. An event can have multiple predecessor events and can be the predecessor of multiple events.
* ''successor event'': an event that immediately follows some other event without any other intervening events. An event can have multiple successor events and can be the successor of multiple events.

Besides events, PERT also knows activities and sub-activities:
* ''PERT activity'': the actual performance of a task which consumes time and requires resources (such as labor, materials, space, machinery). It can be understood as representing the time, effort, and resources required to move from one event to another. A PERT activity cannot be performed until the predecessor event has occurred.
* ''PERT sub-activity'': a PERT activity can be further decomposed into a set of sub-activities. For example, activity A1 can be decomposed into A1.1, A1.2 and A1.3. Sub-activities have all the properties of activities; in particular, a sub-activity has predecessor or successor events just like an activity. A sub-activity can be decomposed again into finer-grained sub-activities.

PERT has defined four types of time required to accomplish an activity:
* ''optimistic time'': the minimum possible time required to accomplish an activity (o) or a path (O), assuming everything proceeds better than is normally expected
* ''pessimistic time'': the maximum possible time required to accomplish an activity (p) or a path (P), assuming everything goes wrong (but excluding major catastrophes).
* ''most likely time'': the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (m) or a path (M), assuming everything proceeds as normal.
* ''expected time'': the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (te) or a path (TE), accounting for the fact that things don't always proceed as normal (the implication being that the expected time is the average time the task would require if the task were repeated on a number of occasions over an extended period of time).
::: '''te''' =  ('''o''' + '''4m''' + '''p''') ÷ '''6'''
:::&lt;math&gt;TE = \sum_{i=1}^n te_i&lt;/math&gt;
* ''standard deviation of time'' : the variability of the time for accomplishing an activity (σ&lt;sub&gt;te&lt;/sub&gt;) or a path (σ&lt;sub&gt;TE&lt;/sub&gt;)
::: '''σ&lt;sub&gt;te&lt;/sub&gt;''' =  ('''p''' - '''o''') ÷ '''6'''
:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{TE} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n {\sigma_{te_i}}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Management tools ===
PERT supplies a number of tools for management with determination of concepts, such as:
* ''[[Float (project management)|float]] or [[Float (project management)|slack]]'' is a measure of the excess time and resources available to complete a task. It is the amount of time that a project task can be delayed without causing a delay in any subsequent tasks (''free float'') or the whole project (''total float''). Positive slack would indicate ''ahead of schedule''; negative slack would indicate ''behind schedule''; and zero slack would indicate ''on schedule''.
* ''[[critical path method|critical path]]'': the longest possible continuous pathway taken from the initial event to the terminal event. It determines the total calendar time required for the project; and, therefore, any time delays along the critical path will delay the reaching of the terminal event by at least the same amount.
* ''critical activity'': An activity that has total float equal to zero. An activity with zero float is not necessarily on the critical path since its path may not be the longest.
* ''[[wikt:lead#Verb_2|Lead]] time'': the time by which a ''predecessor event'' must be completed in order to allow sufficient time for the activities that must elapse before a specific PERT event reaches completion.
* ''lag time'': the earliest time by which a ''successor event'' can follow a specific PERT event.
* ''[[Critical path method|fast tracking]]'': performing more critical activities in parallel
* ''[[Critical path method|crashing critical path]]'': Shortening duration of critical activities

==Implementation==

The first step to scheduling the project is to determine the tasks that the project requires and the order in which they must be completed.  The order may be easy to record for some tasks e.g.When building a house, the land must be graded before the foundation can be laid) while difficult for others (there are two areas that need to be graded, but there are only enough bulldozers to do one).  Additionally, the time estimates usually reflect the normal, non-rushed time.  Many times, the time required to execute the task can be reduced for an additional cost or a reduction in the quality.

=== Example ===
In the following example there are seven tasks, labeled ''A'' through ''G''.  Some tasks can be done concurrently (''A'' and ''B'') while others cannot be done until their predecessor task is complete (''C'' cannot begin until ''A'' is complete).  Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (''o''), the most likely or normal time estimate (''m''), and the pessimistic time estimate (''p'').  The expected time (''te'') is computed using the formula (''o'' + 4''m'' + ''p'') ÷ 6.

Once this step is complete, one can draw a [[Gantt chart]] or a network diagram.

Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is the black lines connected to non-critical activities, (3) since Saturday and Sunday are not work days and are thus excluded from the schedule, some bars on the Gantt chart are longer if they cut through a weekend.]]
:[[Image:Pert example gantt chart.png|frame|none|A Gantt chart created using [[OmniPlan]].  Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is highlighted, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is not specifically indicated on task 5 (d), though it can be observed on tasks 3 and 7 (b and f), (3) since weekends are indicated by a thin vertical line, and take up no additional space on the work calendar, bars on the Gantt chart are not longer or shorter when they do or don't carry over a weekend.]]

=== Next step, creating network diagram by hand or by using diagram software ===
A network diagram can be created by hand or by using diagram software.  There are two types of network diagrams, activity on arrow ([[Arrow Diagramming Method|AOA]]) and activity on node ([[Precedence Diagram Method|AON]]).  Activity on node diagrams are generally easier to create and interpret.  To create an AON diagram, it is recommended (but not required) to start with a node named ''start''.  This &lt;nowiki&gt;"activity"&lt;/nowiki&gt; has a duration of zero (0).  Then you draw each activity that does not have a predecessor activity (''a'' and ''b'' in this example) and connect them with an arrow from start to each node.  Next, since both ''c'' and ''d'' list ''a'' as a predecessor activity, their nodes are drawn with arrows coming from ''a''.  Activity ''e'' is listed with ''b'' and ''c'' as predecessor activities, so node ''e'' is drawn with arrows coming from both ''b'' and ''c'', signifying that ''e'' cannot begin until both ''b'' and ''c'' have been completed.  Activity ''f'' has ''d'' as a predecessor activity, so an arrow is drawn connecting the activities.  Likewise, an arrow is drawn from ''e'' to ''g''.  Since there are no activities that come after ''f'' or ''g'', it is recommended (but again not required) to connect them to a node labeled ''finish''.

:[[Image:pert example network diagram.gif|frame|none|A network diagram created using [[Microsoft Project]] (MSP).  Note the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red.]]

:[[Image:pert example node legend.GIF|frame|right|A node like this one (from [[Microsoft Visio]]) can be used to display the activity name, duration, ES, EF, LS, LF, and slack.]]

By itself, the network diagram pictured above does not give much more information than a Gantt chart; however, it can be expanded to display more information.  The most common information shown is:
# The activity name
# The expected duration time
# The early start time (ES)
# The early finish time (EF)
# The late start time (LS)
# The late finish time (LF)
# The [[float (project management)|slack]]

In order to determine this information it is assumed that the activities and normal duration times are given.  The first step is to determine the ES and EF.  The ES is defined as the maximum EF of all predecessor activities, unless the activity in question is the first activity, for which the ES is zero (0).  The EF is the ES plus the task duration (EF = ES + duration).

*The ES for ''start'' is zero since it is the first activity.  Since the duration is zero, the EF is also zero.  This EF is used as the ES for ''a'' and ''b''.
*The ES for ''a'' is zero.  The duration (4 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of four.  This EF is used as the ES for ''c'' and ''d''.
*The ES for ''b'' is zero.  The duration (5.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 5.33.
*The ES for ''c'' is four.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 9.17.
*The ES for ''d'' is four.  The duration (6.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 10.33.  This EF is used as the ES for ''f''.
*The ES for ''e'' is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (''b'' and ''c'').  Since ''b'' has an EF of 5.33 and ''c'' has an EF of 9.17, the ES of ''e'' is 9.17.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.34.  This EF is used as the ES for ''g''.
*The ES for ''f'' is 10.33.  The duration (4.5 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.83.
*The ES for ''g'' is 14.34.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 19.51.
*The ES for ''finish'' is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (''f'' and ''g'').  Since ''f'' has an EF of 14.83 and ''g'' has an EF of 19.51, the ES of ''finish'' is 19.51.  ''Finish'' is a milestone (and therefore has a duration of zero), so the EF is also 19.51.

Barring any [[Theory of Constraints|unforeseen events]], the project should take 19.51 work days to complete.  The next step is to determine the late start (LS) and late finish (LF) of each activity.  This will eventually show if there are activities that have [[float (project management)|slack]].  The LF is defined as the minimum LS of all successor activities, unless the activity is the last activity, for which the LF equals the EF.  The LS is the LF minus the task duration (LS = LF − duration).

*The LF for ''finish'' is equal to the EF (19.51 work days) since it is the last activity in the project.  Since the duration is zero, the LS is also 19.51 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''f'' and ''g''.
*The LF for ''g'' is 19.51 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 14.34 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''e''.
*The LF for ''f'' is 19.51 work days.  The duration (4.5 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 15.01 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''d''.
*The LF for ''e'' is 14.34 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 9.17 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''b'' and ''c''.
*The LF for ''d'' is 15.01 work days.  The duration (6.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 8.68 work days.
*The LF for ''c'' is 9.17 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 4 work days.
*The LF for ''b'' is 9.17 work days.  The duration (5.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 3.84 work days.
*The LF for ''a'' is the minimum LS of its successor activities.  Since ''c'' has an LS of 4 work days and ''d'' has an LS of 8.68 work days, the LF for ''a'' is 4 work days.  The duration (4 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 0 work days.
*The LF for ''start'' is the minimum LS of its successor activities.  Since ''a'' has an LS of 0 work days and ''b'' has an LS of 3.84 work days, the LS is 0 work days.

=== Next step, determination of critical path and possible slack ===
The next step is to determine the [[critical path method|critical path]] and if any activities have [[float (project management)|slack]].  The critical path is the path that takes the '''longest''' to complete.  To determine the path times, add the task durations for all available paths.  Activities that have slack can be delayed without changing the overall time of the project.  Slack is computed in one of two ways, slack = LF − EF ''or'' slack = LS − ES.  Activities that are on the critical path have a slack of zero (0).

*The duration of path ''adf'' is 14.83 work days.
*The duration of path ''aceg'' is 19.51 work days.
*The duration of path ''beg'' is 15.67 work days.

The critical path is ''aceg'' and the critical time is 19.51 work days.  It is important to note that there can be more than one critical path (in a project more complex than this example) or that the critical path can change.  For example, let's say that activities ''d'' and ''f'' take their pessimistic (b) times to complete instead of their expected (T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) times.  The critical path is now ''adf'' and the critical time is 22 work days.  On the other hand, if activity ''c'' can be reduced to one work day, the path time for ''aceg'' is reduced to 15.34 work days, which is slightly less than the time of the new critical path, ''beg'' (15.67 work days).

Assuming these scenarios do not happen, the slack for each activity can now be determined.

*''Start'' and ''finish'' are milestones and by definition have no duration, therefore they can have no slack (0 work days).
*The activities on the critical path by definition have a slack of zero; however, it is always a good idea to check the math anyway when drawing by hand.
** LF&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 − 4 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.17 − 9.17 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.34 − 14.34 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 19.51 − 19.51 = 0
*Activity ''b'' has an LF of 9.17 and an EF of 5.33, so the slack is 3.84 work days.
*Activity ''d'' has an LF of 15.01 and an EF of 10.33, so the slack is 4.68 work days.
*Activity ''f'' has an LF of 19.51 and an EF of 14.83, so the slack is 4.68 work days.

Therefore, activity ''b'' can be delayed almost 4 work days without delaying the project.  Likewise, activity ''d'' '''or''' activity ''f'' can be delayed 4.68 work days without delaying the project (alternatively, ''d'' and ''f'' can be delayed 2.34 work days each).

== As project scheduling tool ==
=== Advantages ===
*  PERT chart explicitly defines and makes visible [[Dependency (project management)|dependencies]] (precedence relationships) between the work breakdown structure (commonly [[Work breakdown structure|WBS]]) elements.
*  PERT facilitates identification of the critical path and makes this visible.
*  PERT facilitates identification of early start, late start, and slack for each activity.
*  PERT provides for potentially reduced project duration due to better understanding of dependencies leading to improved overlapping of activities and tasks where feasible.
* The large amount of project data can be organized and presented in diagram for use in decision making.
* PERT can provide a probability of completing before a given time.

=== Disadvantages ===
* There can be potentially hundreds or thousands of activities and individual dependency relationships.
* PERT is not easily scalable for smaller projects.
* The network charts tend to be large and unwieldy, requiring several pages to print and requiring specially-sized paper.
* The lack of a timeframe on most PERT/CPM charts makes it harder to show status, although colours can help, ''e.g.'', specific colour for completed nodes.

=== Uncertainty in project scheduling ===

During project execution, however, a real-life project will never execute exactly as it was planned due to uncertainty. This can be due to ambiguity resulting from subjective estimates that are prone to human errors or can be the result of variability arising from unexpected events or risks. The main reason that PERT may provide inaccurate information about the project completion time is due to this schedule uncertainty. This inaccuracy may be large enough to render such estimates as not helpful.

One possible method to maximize solution robustness is to include safety in the baseline schedule in order to absorb the anticipated disruptions. This is called ''proactive scheduling''. A pure proactive scheduling is a utopia; incorporating safety in a baseline schedule which allows for every possible disruption would lead to a baseline schedule with a very large make-span. A second approach, termed ''reactive scheduling'', consists of defining a procedure to react to disruptions that cannot be absorbed by the baseline schedule.

{{Race}}

'''Race and health''' refers to the relationship between individual [[health]] and one's [[race (human categorization)|race]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]]. Differences in health status, health outcomes, [[life expectancy]], and many other indicators of health in different racial and ethnic groups are well documented, and referred to as racial [[health disparities]]. Some individuals in certain racial groups receive less care, have less access to resources, and live shorter lives in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spalter-Roth |title=Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans |website=asanet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Race is a complex concept, and the two major competing theories of race use biological definitions and social construction to define racial difference. A "race" is also viewed as physically distinguishable populations that share a common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spalter-Roth |first1=Roberta |title=Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans |website=asanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this relationship can vary depending on the definitions used, race is generally used in the context of health research as a fluid concept to group populations of people according to various factors that include but are not limited to ancestry, social [[Identity (social science)|identity]], visible [[phenotype]], and [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=171|author=National Human Genome Research Institute|title=Race|work=Talking Glossary of Genetic Terms|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Determinants of health include environmental, social, and genetic factors, as well as the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.&lt;ref name="The determinants of health"&gt;[[World Health Organization]]. [http://www.who.int/hia/evidence/doh/en/ ''The determinants of health'']. Geneva. Accessed 12 May 2011 (which are inter-related with all three, but mostly social factors).&lt;/ref&gt; Race and medicine are related additionally by how environmental factors and physiological factors respond to each other. Additionally, how genetic needs coerce with environmental standings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1047-2797(97)00051-3 |pmid=9250627 |title=Race and health: Basic questions, emerging directions |journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=322–33 |year=1997 |last1=Williams |first1=David R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health disparities ==
Health disparities refer to gaps in the quality of health and [[health care]] across racial and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), [[Healthy People 2010]]: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives, conference ed. in two vols (Washington, D.C., January 2000).{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] defines health disparities as "population-specific differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Janet |last1=Goldberg |first2=William |last2=Hayes |first3=Jill |last3=Huntley |date=November 2004 |title=Understanding Health Disparities |publisher=Health Policy Institute of Ohio |url=http://www.healthpolicyohio.org/pdf/healthdisparities.pdf |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010615/http://www.healthpolicyohio.org/pdf/healthdisparities.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Health is measured through variables such as life expectancy and incidence of diseases.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Collins |first=Francis S. |title=What we do and don't know about 'race', 'ethnicity', genetics and health at the dawn of the genome era |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=36 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=S13–S15 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15507997 |doi=10.1038/ng1436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

How researchers view race is often linked to how we address racial disparities because the national administrator of health uses these research findings to implement policies.&lt;ref name="library.brown.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.brown.edu/reserves/pdffiles/34469_Whitmarsh_Vernaculars.pdf|title=Brown University Authentication for Web-Based Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining race ==
{{main|Race (human categorization)}}

There are various paradigms used to discuss race, including biological and social views. Definitions have changed throughout history to yield a modern understanding of race that is complex and fluid. Moreover, there is no one definition that stands, as there are many competing and interlocking ways to look at race.&lt;ref name="library.brown.edu"/&gt; The terms race, genetic population, ethnicity, geographic population, and ancestry are used interchangeably in everyday discourse involving race.

Biological definitions of race encompass essentialist and anti-essentialist views. The scientific community does not universally accept a single definition of race. Essentialism is a mode of thought that uses scientific data to argue that racial groups are genetically distinct populations. Essentialists describe "races as groups of people who share certain innate, inherited biological traits, aka use of biological evidence to demonstrate racial differences".&lt;ref name="raceandgenomics.ssrc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Morning/|title=On Distinction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its counterpart, anti-essentialism uses biological evidence to demonstrate that "race groupings do not reflect patterns of human biological variation, countering essentialist claims to the contrary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Race: How Scientists Think and Teach About Human Difference|chapter=Chapter 4: Teaching Race|author=Ann Morning|p=114|year=2011|publisher= University of California Press |doi=10.1525/j.ctt1pnrht |isbn=978-0-520-27031-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social definitions are commonly constructionist. Racial groups are "constructed" from differing historical, political, and economic contexts, rather than corresponding to inherited, biological variations. Proponents of the constructionist view claim that biological definitions have been used to justify racism in the past and still have the potential to be used to encourage racist thinking in the future.&lt;ref name="raceandgenomics.ssrc.org"/&gt;

Social views also better explain the ambiguity of racial definitions. An individual may self-identify as one race based on one set of determinants (for example, phenotype, culture, ancestry) while society may ascribe the person otherwise based on external forces and discrete racial standards. Dominant racial conceptions influence how individuals label both themselves and others within society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social interpretations of race]]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern human populations are becoming more difficult to define within traditional racial boundaries due to racial admixture. Most scientific studies, applications, and government documents ask individuals to self-identify race from a limited assortment of common racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rds.epi-ucsf.org/ticr/syllabus/courses/23/2012/03/29/Lecture/readings/The%20Importance%20of%20Race%20&amp;%20Ethnicity%20in%20Biomedical%20Research%20and%20Clinical%20Practice..pdf|title=Training in Clinical Research Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between self-identification and societal ascription further complicates biomedical research and public health policies. However complex its sociological roots, race has real biological ramifications; the intersection of race, science, and society permeates everyday life and influences human health via genetics, access to medical care, diagnosis, and treatment.

==Race and disease==
There are a myriad of factors that affect health disparities between racial groups. Among these factors are genetic differences within racial populations, cultural [[mores]], and social and environmental factors. For instance, in some populations where perceptions of race are linked with socioeconomic disparities and differences, the access to care can be considerably lesser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=D R|last2=Lavizzo-Mourey|first2=R|last3=Warren|first3=R C|date=1994-01-01|title=The concept of race and health status in America.|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=109|issue=1|pages=26–41|issn=0033-3549|pmc=1402239|pmid=8303011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dually, bias in healthcare systems themselves can perpetuate non-biologically founded higher instances of disease. A study conducted by the [[National Health Service]] checks program in the United Kingdom, which aims to increase diagnosis across demographics, noted that "the reported lower screening in specific black and minority ethnic communities... may increase inequalities in health."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riley|first=Ruth|last2=Coghill|first2=Nikki|last3=Montgomery|first3=Alan|last4=Feder|first4=Gene|last5=Horwood|first5=Jeremy|date=2015-12-10|title=The provision of NHS health checks in a community setting: an ethnographic account|journal=BMC Health Services Research|volume=15|pages=546|doi=10.1186/s12913-015-1209-1|issn=1472-6963|pmc=4676171|pmid=26651487}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this specific case, the lack of attention to certain demographics can be seen as a cause of increased instances of disease from this lack of proper, equal preventative care. One must consider these external factors when evaluating statistics on the prevalence of disease in populations, even though genetic components can play a role in predispositions to contracting some illnesses. These linkages should be more closely evaluated than by ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=Carol R.|last2=Davis|first2=Margaret H.|last3=Palermo|first3=Ann-Gel S.|last4=Vladeck|first4=Bruce C.|date=2000-01-01|title=Approaches to Eliminating Sociocultural Disparities in Health|journal=Health Care Financing Review|volume=21|issue=4|pages=57–74|issn=0195-8631|pmc=4194638|pmid=11481745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, health disparities, which include variations in life expectancy and prevalence of disease, due to the differences in health conditions across various ethnic populations that can be attributed to inequalities in living environment and access to healthcare may also play a role.

===Single-gene disorders===
{{See also|Genetic disorder}}
There are many single gene [[genetic disorder]]s that differ in frequency between different populations due to the region, though many assume it to be solely based on race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=YF|last2=Goldstein|first2=DB|last3=Angrist|first3=M|last4=Cavalleri|first4=G|title=Personalized medicine and human genetic diversity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine|date=24 July 2014|volume=4|issue=9|pages=a008581|pmid=25059740|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a008581|pmc=4143101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:

*[[Cystic fibrosis]], the most common life-limiting [[autosomal recessive]] disease among people of Northern European heritage
*[[Sickle-cell anemia]], most prevalent in populations with sub-Saharan African ancestry but also common among Latin-American, Middle Eastern populations, as well as those people of South European regions such as Turkey, Greece, and Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/posters/chromosome/sca.shtml|title=Human Genome Project Information Site Has Been Updated|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Miriam.

===Multifactorial polygenic diseases===
Many diseases differ in frequency between different populations. However, complex diseases are affected by multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. There is controversy over the extent to which some of these conditions are influenced by genes, and ongoing research aims to identify which genetic loci, if any, are linked to these diseases. "Risk is the probability that an event will occur. In epidemiology, it is most often used to express the probability that a particular outcome will occur following a particular exposure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/59E8463F-469F-4D06-95C3-CB877673DC98/0/Brian_Burt_Risk.pdf|title=Definitions of Risk|journal=Journal of Dental Education|date=October 1, 2001|volume=65|issue=10|pages=1007–8 |author=Brian A.

Beyond genetic factors, history and culture, as well as current environmental and social conditions, influence a certain populations' risk for specific diseases.

===Disease progression===
Groups may differ in how a disease progresses. Black men who were diagnosed with HIV generally fared worse than their white and Hispanic counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2007|title=Racial/ethnic and age disparities in HIV prevalence and disease progression among men who have sex with men in the United States|url=|journal=Am J Public Health|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1060–6|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.087551|pmc=1874211|pmid=17463370|author1=Hall HI|author2=Byers RH|author3=Ling Q|author4=Espinoza L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of men studied with very low CD4+ T-cell count, defined as fewer than 50 cells per microliter, at AIDS diagnosis was 24.1% for white men, 27.8% for Hispanic men, and 34.4% for Black men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Black men were also significantly less likely to be alive three years after diagnosis (80.6%) than Hispanic or white men, who had 85.2% and 84.5% survival rates, respectively. However, the reasons for these differences are not clear, and should not be understood as an essential difference between races, but rather as effects of social and environmental factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Prevention===
Genetics have been proven to be a strong predictor for common diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric illnesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernandez|first=Lyla M.|last2=Blazer|first2=Dan G.|last3=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Assessing Interactions Among Social|first3=Behavioral|date=2006-01-01|title=Genetics and Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19932/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and geneticists have been able to determine that "[[human genetic variation]] is geographically structured".  The different geographic regions correlate with different races,&lt;ref name=pmid15508000&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jorde|first=Lynn B.|last2=Wooding|first2=Stephen P.|date=2004-10-26|title=Genetic variation, classification and 'race' |journal=Nature Genetics|language=en|volume=36|issue=11 Suppl|pages=S28–S33|doi=10.1038/ng1435|pmid=15508000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is logical when looking at the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|"Out of Africa" theory]] and understanding how changes in genetics of a population acquire over time.

Examples of diseases which are more common in certain racial groups are [[sickle-cell disease]] in African and Mediterranean populations, and [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[HFE hereditary haemochromatosis|hemochromatosis]] in northern European populations.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt;  This information can be made available to people by their physicians, and is useful in prevention or early detection of these diseases.  For instance, a baby with sickle cell disease should be more closely monitored throughout their life than a baby without it.

While genetics certainly play a role in determining how susceptible a person is to specific diseases, environmental factors and lifestyle play a large role as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Norman B.|last2=Bulatao|first2=Rodolfo A.|last3=Cohen|first3=Barney|last4=National Research Council (US) Panel on Race|first4=Ethnicity|date=2004-01-01|title=Genetic Factors in Ethnic Disparities in Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25517/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, it is impossible to discern exactly what causes a person to acquire a disease, but it's clear that a mixture of all 3 factors are at play.  Each person's health is unique, as they have different genetic compositions and life histories.

===Race-based treatment===
{{See also|Pharmacogenomics}}
The science of 'ethnic health', or research into ethnicity and health, and the development of services which are [[Cultural competence|culturally competent]] to meet the specific health care needs of minority ethnic groups, is still in its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Mark | last=Johnson | contribution=Ethnicity | title=Public Health Evidence: Tackling health inequalities | editor1-first=Amanda | editor1-last=Killoran | editor2-first=Catherine| editor2-last=Swann|editor3-first=Michael P.|editor3-last=Kelly|year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press| url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198520832.do}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091021011210/http://www.omhrc.gov/ Office of Minority Health] provides useful links and supports research and development relating to the needs of America's ethnic minorities. In the United Kingdom, the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] established a specialist collection on Ethnicity &amp; Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS Evidence - ethnicity and health|url=http://www.library.nhs.uk/ethnicity|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324235329/http://www.library.nhs.uk/ethnicity/|archivedate=2007-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This resource was supported by the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) as part of the UK NHS Evidence initiative [[NHS Evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NHS Evidence]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, there are growing numbers of resource and research centers which are seeking to provide this service for other national settings, such as [http://mmha.org.au/ Multicultural Mental Health Australia].

"Race-based medicine" is the term for medicines that are targeted at specific ethnic clusters which are shown to have a propensity for a certain disorder. The first example of this in the U.S. was when [[BiDil]], a medication for congestive heart failure, was licensed specifically for use in American patients that self-identify as black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = AL | last2 = Ziesche | first2 = S | last3 = Yancy | first3 = C |name-list-format=vanc| last4 = Carson | first4 = P | last5 = D'agostino Jr | first5 = R | last6 = Ferdinand | first6 = K | last7 = Taylor | first7 = M | last8 = Adams | first8 = K | last9 = Sabolinski | first9 = M| last10 = Worcel | first10 = Manuel | last11 = Cohn | first11 = Jay N. | date = November 2004 | title=Combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in blacks with heart failure | url = | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 20| pages = 2049–57 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa042934 | pmid = 15533851 | display-authors = 8 | author12 = African-American Heart Failure Trial Investigators }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous studies had shown that African American patients with congestive heart failure generally respond less effectively to traditional treatments than white patients with similar conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Exner | first1 = DV | last2 = Dries | first2 = DL | last3 = Domanski | first3 = MJ | last4 = Cohn | first4 = JN |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2001 | title = Lesser response to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy in blacks as compared with white patients with left ventricular dysfunction | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 344 | issue = 18| pages = 1351–7 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200105033441802 | pmid = 11333991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two trials, BiDil was licensed exclusively for use in African American patients. Critics have argued that this particular licensing was unwarranted, since the trials did not in fact show that the drug was more effective in African Americans than in other groups, but merely that it was more effective in African Americans than other similar drugs. It was also only tested in African American males, but not in any other racial groups or among women. This peculiar trial and licensing procedure has prompted suggestions that the licensing was in fact used as a race-based advertising scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2006.00181.x |title=Medicine in black and white: BiDil®: race and the limits of evidence‐based medicine |journal=Significance |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=118–21 |year=2006 |last1=Ellison |first1=George }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics are concerned that the trend of research on race-specific pharmaceutical treatments will result in inequitable access to pharmaceutical innovation and smaller minority groups may be ignored. This has led to a call for regulatory approaches to be put in place to ensure scientific validity of racial disparity in pharmacological treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Winichoff, D. E.|author2=Obasagie, O. K. |year=2008|title=Race-specific drugs: Regulatory trends in public policy|journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences|url=http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=4110|volume=29|issue=6|pages=277–9 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2008.03.008|pmid=18453000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to "race-based medicine" is personalized medicine that involves identifying genetic, genomic (i.e., genomic sequencing), and clinical information—as opposed to using race as a proxy for these data—to better predict a patient's predisposition to certain diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-conditions/cancer/personalized-medicine#2|title=2.

==Environmental factors==
{{see also|Environmental racism|Race and health in the United States}}
A positive correlation between minorities and a socio economic status of being low income in industrialized and rural regions of the U.S. depict how low income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in [[health]]. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low income minorities, to be conscious about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that [[Minority group|minorities]] in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets.&lt;ref name="Suarez 912–920"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suarez|first=Jonathan J.|last2=Isakova|first2=Tamara|last3=Anderson|first3=Cheryl A.

Furthermore, this can also occur when minorities living in rural areas undergoing urbanization, are introduced to fast food. A study done in Thailand focused on urbanized metropolitan areas, the students who participated in this study as were diagnosed as “non-obese” in their early life according to their BMI, however were increasingly at risk of developing [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 Diabetes]], or obesity as adults, as opposed to young adults who lived in more rural areas during their early life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angkurawaranon|first=Chaisiri|last2=Wisetborisut|first2=Anawat|last3=Rerkasem|first3=Kittipan|last4=Seubsman|first4=Sam-ang|last5=Sleigh|first5=Adrian|last6=Doyle|first6=Pat|last7=Nitsch|first7=Dorothea|date=2015-09-16|title=Early life urban exposure as a risk factor for developing obesity and impaired fasting glucose in later adulthood: results from two cohorts in Thailand|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=15 |pages=902|doi=10.1186/s12889-015-2220-5|issn=1471-2458|pmc=4572635|pmid=26376960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, early exposure to urbanized regions can encourage unhealthy eating due to widespread presence of inexpensive fast food.  Different racial populations that originate from more rural areas and then immigrate to the urbanized metropolitan areas can develop a fixation for a more westernized diet;  this change in lifestyle typically occurs due to loss of traditional values when adapting to a new environment. For example, a 2009 study named CYKIDS was based on children from [[Cyprus]], a country east of the mediterranean sea, who were evaluated by the KIDMED index to test their adherence to a mediterranean diet after changing from rural residence to an urban residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lazarou|first=Chrystalleni|last2=Kalavana|first2=Theano|date=2009-01-01|title=Urbanization influences dietary habits of Cypriot children: the CYKIDS study|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=54|issue=2|pages=69–77|doi=10.1007/s00038-009-8054-0|issn=1661-8564|pmid=19234670}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that children in urban areas swapped their traditional dietary patterns for a diet favoring fast food.

==Genetic factors==
The fact that every human has a unique genetic code is the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting. Versions of a trait, known as alleles, occur at different frequencies in different human populations; populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tend to differ more.

A phenotype is the "outward, physical manifestation" of an organism."&lt;ref name="brooklyn.cuny.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/BioInfo/GP/Definition.html|title=Definition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For humans, phenotypic differences are most readily seen via skin color, eye color, hair color, or height; however, any observable structure, function, or behavior can be considered part of a phenotype. A genotype is the "internally coded, inheritable information" carried by all living organisms. The human genome is encoded in DNA&lt;ref name="brooklyn.cuny.edu"/&gt;

For any trait of interest, observed differences among individuals "may be due to differences in the genes" coding for a trait or "the result of variation in environmental condition". This variability is due to gene-environment interactions that influence genetic expression patterns and trait heritability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/heritability/heritability.htm|title=Estimating additive genetic variation and heritability of phenotypic traits|website=userwww.sfsu.edu|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For humans, there is "more genetic variation among individual people than between larger racial groups".&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt; In general, an average of 80% of genetic variation exists within local populations, around 10% is between local populations within the same continent, and approximately 8% of variation occurs between large groups living on different continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-9063-3_14 |chapter=The Apportionment of Human Diversity |title=Evolutionary Biology |pages=381–98 |year=1972 |last1=Lewontin |first1=R.

Genes may be under strong selection in response to local diseases. For example, people who are [[duffy antigen|duffy negative]] tend to have higher resistance to malaria. Most Africans are duffy negative and most non-Africans are duffy positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaria and the Red Cell|publisher=Harvard University|year=2002|url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127201806/http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html|archivedate=2011-11-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of genetic diseases more prevalent in malaria-afflicted areas may provide some [[genetic resistance to malaria]] including [[sickle cell disease]], [[thalassaemias]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]], and possibly others.

[[Cystic fibrosis#Theories about prevalence|Many theories about the origin of the cystic fibrosis]] have suggested that it provides a [[heterozygote advantage]] by giving resistance to diseases earlier common in Europe.

In earlier research, a common theory was the "[[common disease-common variant]]" model. It argues that for common illnesses, the genetic contribution comes from the additive or multiplicative effects of gene variants that each one is common in the population. Each such gene variant is argued to cause only a small risk of disease and no single variant is enough to cause the disease. An individual must have many of these common gene variants in order for the risk of disease to be substantial.&lt;ref name=pmid20403315&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McClellan | first1 = J. | last2 = King | first2 = M.

More recent research indicates that the "common disease-rare variant" may be a better explanation for many common diseases.

In either case varying frequencies of genes variants in different populations may be an explanation for health disparities.&lt;ref name=pmid20403315/&gt; Genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease, [[deep venous thrombosis]], [[Crohn disease]], and [[type 2 diabetes]] appear to adhere to "common disease-common variant" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lohmueller KE, Pearce CL, Pike M, Lander ES, Hirschhorn JN | year = 2003 | title = Meta-analysis of genetic association studies supports a contribution of common variants to susceptibility to common disease | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 177–182 | doi = 10.1038/ng1071 | pmid = 12524541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gene flow===
[[Gene flow]] and [[Genetic admixture|admixture]] can also have an effect on relationships between race and race-linked disorders. Multiple sclerosis, for example, is typically associated with people of European descent, but due to admixture African Americans have elevated levels of the disorder relative to Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15596747  |name-list-format=vanc| last1 = Cree | first1 = BA | last2 = Khan | first2 = O | last3 = Bourdette | first3 = D | last4 = Goodin | first4 = DS | last5 = Cohen | first5 = JA | last6 = Marrie | first6 = RA | last7 = Glidden | first7 = D | last8 = Weinstock-Guttman | first8 = B | last9 = Reich | first9 = D | last10 =Patterson | first10 =N. | last11 =Haines | first11 =J.

Some diseases and physiological variables vary depending upon their admixture ratios. Examples include measures of [[insulin]] functioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gower B. A.| year = 2003 | title = Using genetic admixture to explain racial differences in insulin-related phenotypes | url = | journal = Diabetes | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 1047–1051 | doi=10.2337/diabetes.52.4.1047|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernandez J.

=== Gene interactions ===
The same gene variant, or group of gene variants, may produce different effects in different populations depending on differences in the gene variants, or groups of gene variants, they interact with. One example is the rate of progression to [[AIDS]] and death in [[HIV]]&amp;ndash;infected patients. In Caucasians and Hispanics, HHC [[haplotype]]s were associated with disease retardation, particularly a delayed progression to death, while for African Americans, possession of HHC haplotypes was associated with disease acceleration. In contrast, while the disease-retarding effects of the CCR2-641 allele were found in African Americans, they were not found in Caucasians.&lt;ref name=gonz1996&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Gonzalez E, etal | year = 1999 | title = Race-specific HIV-1 disease-modifying effects associated with CCR5 haplotypes | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.21.12004 | journal = Proc.

==Controversy==
{{See also|Race (classification of humans)|Race and genetics}}

There is a controversy regarding race as a method for classifying humans. Different sources argue it is purely social construct&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witzig|first=Ritchie|date=1996-10-15|title=The Medicalization of Race: Scientific Legitimization of a Flawed Social Construct|url=http://annals.org/aim/article/710064/medicalization-race-scientific-legitimization-flawed-social-construct|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=125|issue=8|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-125-8-199610150-00008|issn=0003-4819|pmid=8849153|pages=675–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a biological reality reflecting average genetic group differences.  New interest in human biological variation has resulted in a resurgence of the use of race in biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press. Page 188. "Far from waning in the age of molecular genetics, race has been resurgent in biomedical discourse, especially in relation to a torrent of new interest in human biological variation and its quantification."&lt;/ref&gt;

The main impetus for this development is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of certain [[disease]]s by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors, such as genetically conditioned health factors, based on more easily ascertained characteristics such as phenotype and racial self-identification. Since medical judgment often involves decision making under uncertain conditions,&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 9"&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press. Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; many doctors consider it useful to take race into account when treating disease because diseases and treatment responses tend to cluster by geographic ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Satel, Sally. [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/magazine/i-am-a-racially-profiling-doctor.html "I Am a Racially Profiling Doctor"]. The New York Times, published May 5, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery that more diseases than previously thought correlate with racial identification have further sparked the interest in using race as a proxy for bio-geographical ancestry and genetic buildup.

Race in medicine is used as an approximation for more specific genetic and environmental risk factors. Race is thus partly a surrogate for environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health. It is also an imperfect surrogate for ancestral geographic regions and differences in gene frequencies between different ancestral populations and thus differences in genes that can affect health. This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less than perfect.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;

Taking the example of [[sickle-cell disease]], in an [[Emergency department|emergency room]], knowing the geographic origin of a patient may help a doctor doing an initial diagnosis if a patient presents with symptoms compatible with this disease. This is unreliable evidence with the disease being present in many different groups as noted above with the trait also present in some Mediterranean European populations. Definitive diagnosis comes from examining the blood of the patient. In the US, screening for sickle cell anemia is done on all newborns regardless of race.&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 9" /&gt;

The continued use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the continued use of racial categories in health care and as risk factors could result in increased [[stereotype|stereotyping]] and discrimination in society and health services.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 5"&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Sheldon TA, Parker H |title=Race and ethnicity in health research |journal=Journal of Public Health Medicine |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=104–10 |date=June 1992 |pmid=1515192 |url=http://jpubhealth.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1515192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Williams DR, Lavizzo-Mourey R, Warren RC |title=The concept of race and health status in America |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=26–41 |year=1994 |pmid=8303011 |pmc=1402239}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some racial groups are less likely than others to receive adequate treatment for osteoporosis, even after risk factors have been assessed. Since the 19th century, blacks have been thought to have thicker bones than whites have and to lose bone mass more slowly with age.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11606-009-1031-8| pmc= 2710475 | pmid=19551449 | volume=24 | issue= 8 | title=Population-based fracture risk assessment and osteoporosis treatment disparities by race and gender | year=2009 | journal=J Gen Intern Med | pages=956–62 | author1=Curtis JR|author2= McClure LA|author3=Delzell E|author4=Howard VJ|author5=Orwoll E|author6=Saag KG|author7=Safford M|author8=Howard G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent study, African Americans were shown to be substantially less likely to receive prescription osteoporosis medications than Caucasians. Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.

David Williams (1994) argued, after an examination of articles in the journal ''Health Services Research'' during the 1966–90 period, that how race was determined and defined was seldom described. At a minimum, researchers should describe if race was assessed by self-report, proxy report, extraction from records, or direct observation. Race was also often used questionable, such as an indicator of socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Williams DR |title=The concept of race in Health Services Research: 1966 to 1990 |journal=Health Services Research |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=261–74 |date=August 1994 |pmid=8063565 |pmc=1070005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial genetic explanations may be overemphasized, ignoring the interaction with and the role of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Goodman AH |title=Why genes don't count (for racial differences in health) |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=1699–702 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11076233 |pmc=1446406 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.11.1699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From concepts of race to ethnogenetic layering ===

There is general agreement that a goal of health-related genetics should be to move past the weak surrogate relationships of racial health disparity and get to the root causes of health and disease. This includes research which strives to analyze human genetic variation in smaller groups than races across the world.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;

One such method is called ethnogenetic layering. It works by focusing on geographically identified microethnic groups. For example, in the Mississippi Delta region ethnogenetic layering might include such microethnic groups as the Cajun (as a subset of European Americans), the Creole and Black groups [with African origins in Senegambia, Central Africa and Bight of Benin] (as a subset of African Americans), and Choctaw, Houmas, Chickasaw, Coushatta, Caddo, Atakapa, Karankawa and Chitimacha peoples (as subsets of Native Americans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackson F.L.C. | year = 2008 | title = Ethnogenetic layering (EL): an alternative to the traditional race model in human variation and health disparity studies | url = | journal = Annals of Human Biology | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 121–144 | doi = 10.1080/03014460801941752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = F.

Better still may be individual genetic assessment of relevant genes.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt; As genotyping and sequencing have become more accessible and affordable, avenues for determining individual genetic makeup have opened dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gis.a-star.edu.sg/internet/site/data/sup_data/2253/individual_genomes_instead_of_race_for_personalized_medicine.pdf |title=Individual Genomes Instead of Race for Personalized Medicine|vauthors=Ng PC, Zhao Q, Levy S, Strausberg RL, Venter JC|journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther|year=2008|volume=84|issue=3|pages=306–309|doi=10.1038/clpt.2008.114|pmid=18714319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when such methods become commonly available, race will continue to be important when looking at groups instead of individuals such as in epidemiologic research.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt;

Some doctors and scientists such as geneticist [[Neil Risch]] argue that using self-identified race as a proxy for ancestry is necessary to be able to get a sufficiently broad sample of different ancestral populations, and in turn to be able to provide health care that is tailored to the needs of minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Risch N. |author2=Burchard E. |author3=Ziv E. |author4=Tang H. | year = 2002 | title = Categorization of humans in biomedical research: genes, race and disease | doi = 10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-comment2007| journal = Genome Biol | volume = 3 | issue = 7| pages = 1–12 | pmc=139378 | pmid=12184798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association studies==
{{See also|Genetic association}}
One area in which population categories can be important considerations in genetics research is in controlling for confounding between population genetic substructure, environmental exposures, and health outcomes. [[Association studies]] can produce spurious results if cases and controls have differing allele frequencies for genes that are not related to the disease being studied,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cardon LR, Palmer LJ | year = 2003 | title = Population stratification and spurious allelic association | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9357| pages = 598–604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12520-2 | pmid = 12598158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchini J, Cardon LR, Phillips MS, Donnelly P | year = 2004 | title = The effects of human population structure on large genetic association studies | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 512–517 | doi = 10.1038/ng1337 | pmid = 15052271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the magnitude of its problem in genetic association studies is subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas DC, Witte JS | year = 2002 | title = Point: population stratification: a problem for case-control studies of candidate-gene associations? | url = | journal = Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 505–512 | pmid = 12050090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wacholder S, Rothman N, Caporaso N|title=Counterpoint: bias from population stratification is not a major threat to the validity of conclusions from epidemiological studies of common polymorphisms and cancer|journal=Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev|year=2002|volume=11|issue=6|pages=513–20 |pmid=12050091|url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/11/6/513.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various techniques detect and account for population substructure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morton NE, Collins A | year = 1998 | title = Tests and estimates of allelic association in complex inheritance | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 95 | issue = 19| pages = 11389–11393 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.19.11389 | pmid = 9736746 | pmc = 21652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoggart CJ, Parra EJ, Shriver MD, Bonilla C, Kittles RA, Clayton DG, McKeigue PM | year = 2003 | title = Control of confounding of genetic associations in stratified populations | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 72 | issue = 6| pages = 1492–1504 | doi = 10.1086/375613 | pmid = 12817591 | pmc = 1180309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but these methods can be difficult to apply in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Freedman ML|author2=Reich D|author3=Penney KL|author4=McDonald GJ|author5=Mignault AA|author6=Patterson N|author7=Gabriel SB|author8=Topol EJ|author9=Smoller JW | year = 2004 | title = Assessing the impact of population stratification on genetic association studies | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 388–393 | pmid = 15052270 | doi = 10.1038/ng1333 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population genetic substructure also can aid genetic association studies. For example, populations that represent recent mixtures of separated ancestral groups can exhibit longer-range [[linkage disequilibrium]] between susceptibility alleles and genetic markers than is the case for other populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoggart CJ, Shriver MD, Kittles RA, Clayton DG, McKeigue PM | year = 2004 | title = Design and analysis of admixture mapping studies | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 74 | issue = 5| pages = 965–978 | pmid = 15088268 | doi = 10.1086/420855 | pmc = 1181989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors  = Patterson N, Hattangadi N, Lane B, Lohmueller KE, Hafler DA, Oksenberg JR, Hauser SL, Smith MW, O'Brien SJ | year = 2004 | title = Methods for high-density admixture mapping of disease genes | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 74 | issue = 5| pages = 979–1000 | pmid = 15088269 | doi = 10.1086/420871 | pmc = 1181990 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith| first1 = Michael W.| last2 = Patterson| first2 = Nick| last3 = Lautenberger| first3 = James A.| last4 = Truelove| first4 = Ann L.| last5 = McDonald| first5 = Gavin J.| last6 = Waliszewska| first6 = Alicja| last7 = Kessing| first7 = Bailey D.| last8 = Malasky| first8 = Michael J.| last9 = Scafe| first9 = Charles| last10 = Le| first10 = Ernest| last11 = Jager| first11 = Philip L.

==Human genome projects==
The [[Human Genome Diversity Project]] has collected genetic samples from 52 indigenous populations.

==Sources of racial disparities in care==
In a report by the [[Institute of Medicine]] called Unequal Treatment, three major source categories are put forth as potential explanations for disparities in health care: patient-level variables, healthcare system-level factors, and care process-level variables.&lt;ref name=Smed2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Smedley|first=Brian D.|title=Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care|year=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC.|isbn=0-309-50911-4|pages=7–12|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient-level variables===
There are many individual factors that could explain the established differences in health care between different racial and ethnic groups.  First, attitudes and behaviors of minority patients are different.  They are more likely to refuse recommended services, adhere poorly to treatment regimens, and delay seeking care, yet despite this, these behaviors and attitudes are unlikely to explain the differences in health care.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; In addition to behaviors and attitudes, biological based racial differences have been documented, but these also seem unlikely to explain the majority of observed disparities in care.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt;

===Health system-level factors===
Health system-level factors include any aspects of health systems that can have different effects on patient outcomes.  Some of these factors include different access to services, access to insurance or other means to pay for services, access to adequate language and interpretation services, and geographic availability of different services.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; Many studies assert that these factors explain portions of the existing disparities in health of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States when compared to their white counterparts.

===Care process-level variables===
Three major mechanisms are suggested by the Institute of Medicine that may contribute to healthcare disparities from the provider's side: bias (or prejudice) against racial and ethnic minorities; greater clinical uncertainty when interacting with minority patients; and beliefs held by the provider about the behavior or health of minorities.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; Research in this area is new and ongoing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1631">'''Ravensborg''', formerly called '''Norstead''', is the name of a replica [[Viking Age]] [[fort]] in northern [[Missouri]] which began construction in the spring of 2007.

[[File:Ravensborg ringfort.jpg|thumb|Ravensborg Viking Ringfort]]

Ravensborg is a type of [[ringfort]] -- a circular earthen rampart and wood palisade with several buildings within. 

While not permanently inhabited, the site is used to recreate a Viking Age fortification allowing [[living history]] enthusiasts to experience Medieval life in a longhouse for short periods. This is a form of [[experimental archeology]] and is expected to shed new light on how ordinary folk lived and functioned in such an environment. The fort contrasts with the temporary tent encampments typically experienced by reenactors.

Various Viking reenactment groups gather here for twice-yearly celebrations in April and October.  Participants are required to wear period clothing, participate in traditional crafts, eat historical foods, and essentially live an [[early Medieval]] lifestyle.  Those trained in live-steel combat techniques may participate in such activities here as well.

The site currently consists of a [[longhouse]], a cookhouse, a forge shelter, gate house, and personal cottages regular visitors have constructed for use by their families and guests. 

The site was renamed "Ravensborg" in 2009.

'''Relative nonlinearity''' is a [[Coexistence theory|coexistence mechanism]] that maintains species diversity via differences in the response to and effect on variation in [[Resource (biology)|resource]] density or some other factor mediating competition. Relative nonlinearity depends on two processes: 1) species have to differ in the curvature of their responses to resource density and 2) the patterns of resource variation generated by each species must favor the relative growth of another species. In its most basic form, one species grows best under equilibrium competitive conditions and another performs better under variable competitive conditions. Like all coexistence mechanisms, relative nonlinearity maintains species diversity by concentrating [[intraspecific competition]] relative to [[interspecific competition]]. Because resource density can be variable, intraspecific competition is the reduction of per-capita growth rate under variable resources generated by conspecifics (i.e. individuals of the same species). Interspecific competition is the reduction of per-capita growth rate under variable resources generated by heterospecifics (i.e. individuals of a different species). Like some other coexistence mechanisms (see [[storage effect|the storage effect]]), relative nonlinearity can allow coexistence of at least two species on a single resource.

==Functional components==

===Differential nonlinear responses to resources===
Relative nonlinearity requires that species differ in the curvature of their fitness response &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; to some competitive factor, ''F'', like resource density. The nonlinearity of a response to competition is the [[second derivative]] of the per-capita growth rate with respect to the competitive factor &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi_i^{\prime \prime}(F)&lt;/math&gt;, which is zero if the growth response is linear, positive if the response is accelerating ([[convex function|convex]]), and negative if the response is decelerating ([[Concave function|concave]]). For competition between two species, the greater the difference in the curvatures of their response to changes in a competitive factor, the greater the differences in their overall specialization on competitive factor variation. For example, by [[Jensen's inequality]], compared to constant resource density, variation in a competitive factor has no effect on species with zero curvature, positive effects on species with positive curvature, and negative effects on species with negative curvature. Thus, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi_i^{\prime \prime}(F)&lt;/math&gt; indicates a species response to variation in competitive factors, a dimension of competition that can be partitioned.

Competitive factors are best thought of as dimensions of the environment that are jointly used by more than one species and contribute to a reduction in performance of individuals when used. For example, space is a common competitive factor for trees because many species require space for new trees to grow and the reduction in space reduces opportunities for other species to capture that space and grow. Resources and predators have similar properties and count as competitive factors. For competition between two species for a single shared resource, it is easy enough to think of the competitive factor as the reduction in species density due to consumption. In the absence of resource consumption, resources will tend to be at some equilibrium value, K. Thus, the competitive factor for our example is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;F = K - R&lt;/math&gt; for any value of R.

The original demonstration of relative nonlinearity was in a consumer-resource model with differences in [[functional response]]s of the two species. One species has a [[functional response#Type I|Type I functional response]] and has zero curvature. The second species has a [[functional response#TypeII|Type II functional response]] - which occurs when individuals must spend time handling handling resources before moving on to the next resource - and has negative curvature. Because the second species is limited by time when capturing resources, it is unable to exploit resources at high density compared to its competitor. If the Type II functional response species does better under average conditions than the species with a Type I functional response, the species differ in their ''response to'' equilibrium and variable resource density.

===Differential effect on resource variation===
Not only must species respond differently to variation in competition, species must also affect variation in competition differently.

Given these two processes, differential effects on and response to resource variation, species may coexist via relative nonlinearity.

==Mathematical derivation==
Here, we will show how relative nonlinearity can occur between two species.  We will start by deriving the average growth rate of a single species.  Let us assume that each species' growth rate depends on some density-dependent factor, ''F'', such that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN_j}{dt} = \phi_j(F)N_j &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is species ''j'''s population density, and &lt;math&gt;\phi_j(F)&lt;/math&gt; is some function of the density-dependent factor ''F''.  For example, under a Monod [[chemostat]] model, ''F'' would be the resource density, and &lt;math&gt;\phi_j(F)&lt;/math&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;a_jF - d&lt;/math&gt;, where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is the rate that species ''j'' can uptake the resource, and ''d'' is its death rate. In a classic paper by Armstrong and McGehee &lt;ref name="Armstrong+McGehee"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Robert A.|last2=McGehee|first2=Richard|title=Competitive Exclusion|journal=The American Naturalist|date=February 1980|volume=115|issue=2|pages=151–170|doi=10.1086/283553}}&lt;/ref&gt;[cite Armstrong], &lt;math&gt;\phi_j(F)&lt;/math&gt; was the a [[functional response|Type I functional response]] for one species and a [[functional response|Type II functional response]] for the other.  We can approximate the per-capita growth rate, &lt;math&gt;r_j = \frac{1}{N_j} \frac{dN_j}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;, using a [[Taylor series]] approximation as 
:&lt;math&gt; r_j \approx \phi_j(\overline{F}) + (F - \overline{F}) \phi_j(\overline{F})' + \frac{1}{2} (F - \overline{F})^2 \phi_j(\overline{F})'' &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the average value of ''F''.  If we take the average growth rate over time (either over a [[limit cycle]], or over an infinite amount of time), then it becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{r_j} \approx \phi_j(\overline{F}) + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2_F \phi_j(\overline{F})'' &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[variance]] of ''F''.  This occurs because the average of &lt;math&gt;(F - \overline{F})&lt;/math&gt; is 0, and the average of &lt;math&gt;(F - \overline{F})^2&lt;/math&gt; is the variance of ''F''. Thus, we see that a species' average growth rate is helped by variation if ''Φ'' is convex, and it is hurt by variation if ''Φ'' is concave.

We can measure the effect that relative nonlinearity has on coexistence using an [[invasion analysis]].  To do this, we set one species' density to 0 (we call this the invader, with subscript ''i''), and allow the other species (the resident, with subscript ''r'') is at a long-term steady state (e.g., a [[limit cycle]]).  If the invader has a positive growth rate, then it cannot be excluded from the system.  If both species have a positive growth rate as the invader, then they can coexist.&lt;ref name="schreiber"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schreiber|first1=Sebastian J.|last2=Benaïm|first2=Michel|last3=Atchadé|first3=Kolawolé A. S.|title=Persistence in fluctuating environments|journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology|date=8 June 2010|volume=62|issue=5|pages=655–683|doi=10.1007/s00285-010-0349-5|arxiv=1005.2580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the resident's density may fluctuate, its average density over the long-term will not change (by assumption).  Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\overline{r_r} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Because of this, we can write the invader's density as
:&lt;math&gt; \overline{r_i} = \overline{r_i} - \overline{r_r}&lt;/math&gt;
.&lt;ref name="Chesson1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=P.|title=Multispecies Competition in Variable Environments|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=June 1994|volume=45|issue=3|pages=227–276|doi=10.1006/tpbi.1994.1013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substituting in our above formula for average growth, we see that
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{r_i} \approx \left(\phi_i(\overline{F}) + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2_F \phi_i(\overline{F})'' \right) - \left(\phi_r(\overline{F}) + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2_F \phi_r(\overline{F})'' \right) &lt;/math&gt;.
We can rearrange this to
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{r_i} \approx \left(\phi_i(\overline{F}) - \phi_r(\overline{F}) \right) + \Delta N_i&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta N_i&lt;/math&gt; quantifies the effect of relative nonlinearity,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta N_i = \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2_F \left( \phi_i(\overline{F})''- \phi_r(\overline{F})'' \right) &lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, we have partition the invader's growth rate into two components.  The left term represents the [[coexistence theory#Stabilizing mechanisms|variation-independent mechanisms]], and will be positive if the invader is less hindered by a shortage of resources.  Relative nonlinearity, &lt;math&gt;\Delta N_i&lt;/math&gt; will be positive, and thus help species ''i'' to invade, if &lt;math&gt;\phi_i(\overline{F})''&gt; \phi_r(\overline{F})''&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., if the invader is less harmed by variation than the resident). However, relative nonlinearity will hinder species ''i'''s ability to invade if &lt;math&gt;\phi_i(\overline{F})'' &lt; \phi_r(\overline{F})''&lt;/math&gt;.

Under most circumstances, relative nonlinearity will help one species to invade, and hurt the other.  It will have a net positive impact on coexistence if its sum across all species is positive (i.e., &lt;math&gt; \Delta N_j + \Delta N_k &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; for species ''j'' and ''k'').&lt;ref name="chesson2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|title=Quantifying and testing coexistence mechanisms arising from recruitment fluctuations|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=November 2003|volume=64|issue=3|pages=345–357|doi=10.1016/s0040-5809(03)00095-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The &lt;math&gt;\phi_j(\overline{F})&lt;/math&gt; terms will generally not change much when the invader changes, but the variation in ''F'' will.  For the sum of the &lt;math&gt;\Delta N_i&lt;/math&gt; terms to be positive, the variation in ''F'' must be larger when the species with the more positive (or less negative) &lt;math&gt;\phi_j(\overline{F})''&lt;/math&gt; is the invader.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67280">{{sociology}}
The '''sociology of law''' (or '''legal sociology''') is often described as a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] or an interdisciplinary approach within [[jurisprudence|legal studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For various definitions of the sociology of law,see Ehrlich 1936 (orig 1912); Timasheff 1939; Pound 1943; Selznick 1965, Aubert 1969 and 1980, Black 1972, Stjernquist 1983, Hydén 1986, Tomasic 1987, Ferrari 1989, Podgorecki 1991, Cotterrell 1992, Banakar 2003 and 2011; Mathiesen 2005, Deflem 2008, Travers 2009, Nelken 2009, Scuro 2010, Banakar and Travers 2013, Banakar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some see sociology of law as belonging "necessarily" to the field of sociology,&lt;ref&gt;See Deflem 2008:3.&lt;/ref&gt; but others tend to consider it a field of research caught up between the disciplines of [[law]] and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003 and 2009, Banakar and Travers 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others regard it neither a subdiscipline of sociology nor a branch of legal studies but as a field of research on its own right within the broader social science tradition. Accordingly, it may be described without reference to mainstream sociology as "the systematic, theoretically grounded, empirical study of law as a set of social practices or as an aspect or field of social experience".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as treating law and justice as fundamental institutions of the basic structure of society mediating "between political and economic interests, between culture and the normative order of society, establishing and maintaining interdependence, and constituting themselves as sources of consensus, coercion and social control".&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrespective of whether sociology of law is defined as a sub-discipline of sociology, an approach within legal studies or a field of research in its own right, it remains intellectually dependent mainly on the traditions, methods and theories of mainstream [[sociology]] and, to a lesser extent, on other [[social sciences]] such as [[social anthropology]], [[political science]], [[social policy]], [[criminology]] and [[psychology]]. As such, it reflects social theories and employs social scientific methods to study [[law]], [[legal institutions]] and legal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Travers 2005, pp. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, sociology of law consists of various approaches to the study of law in society, which empirically examine and theorise the interaction between law, legal, non-legal institutions and social factors.&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976; Cotterrell 1992; Hunt 1993; Santos 2002; Banakar 2003; Banakar and Travers 2002; Ferrari 1989; Luhmann 1985; Trevino 2008; Travers 2009, Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of socio-legal inquiry include the social development of legal institutions, forms of [[social control]], legal [[regulation]], the interaction between [[legal culture]]s, the social construction of legal issues, [[legal profession]] and the relation between law and [[social change]].

Sociology of law also benefits from and occasionally draws on research conducted within other fields such as [[comparative law]], [[critical legal studies]], [[jurisprudence]], [[legal theory]], [[law and economics]] and [[law and literature]]. Its object encompasses the historical movement of law and justice and their relentless contemporary construction such as in the field of jurisprudence focused on institutional questions conditioned by social and political situations, in interdisciplinary dominions such as criminology and through analysis of the economic efficiency and the social impact of legal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual origins==
[[File:Veber.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Max Weber]]]]
The roots of the sociology of law can be traced back to the works of sociologists and jurists of the turn of the previous century. The relationship between law and society was sociologically explored in the seminal works of both [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]]. The writings on law by these classical sociologists are foundational to the entire sociology of law today.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other scholars, mainly jurists, also employed social scientific theories and methods in an attempt to develop sociological theories of law. Notably among these were [[Leon Petrazycki]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]].

For [[Max Weber]], a so-called "legal rational form" as a type of domination within society, is not attributable to people but to abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the body of coherent and calculable law in terms of a [[rational-legal authority]]. Such coherent and calculable law formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the development of modern law is the formal rationalisation of law on the basis of general procedures that are applied equally and fairly to all. Modern rationalised law is also codified and impersonal in its application to specific cases. In general, Weber's standpoint can be described as an external approach to law that studies the empirical characteristics of law, as opposed to the internal perspective of the legal sciences and the moral approach of the philosophy of law.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on Weber's typology see Kronman 1983: 8-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
[[Émile Durkheim]] wrote in ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with [[restitution]] and [[damages|compensation]] grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, law has undergone a transformation from repressive law to restitutive law. Restitutive law operates in societies in which there is a high degree of individual variation and emphasis on personal rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For Durkheim, law is an indicator of the mode of integration of a society, which can be mechanical, among identical parts, or organic, among differentiated parts such as in industrialized societies. Durkheim also argued that a sociology of law should be developed alongside, and in close connection with, a sociology of morals, studying the development of value systems reflected in law.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of [[Durkheim|Durkheim's]] sociology of law see Cotterrell 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law'', [[Eugen Ehrlich]] developed a sociological approach to the study of law by focusing on how social networks and groups organized social life.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich 1936 (orig. 1912).&lt;/ref&gt; He explored the relationship between law and general social norms and distinguished between "positive law," consisting of the compulsive norms of state requiring official enforcement, and "living law," consisting of the rules of conduct that people in fact obeyed and which dominated social life. The latter emerged spontaneously as people interacted with each other to form social associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegert 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The centre of gravity of legal development therefore from time immemorial has not lain in the activity of the state, but in society itself, and must be sought there at the present time".|Eugen Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, 1936: 390.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was subjected to criticism by the advocates of legal positivism such as the jurist [[Hans Kelsen]] for its distinction between "law created by the state and law produced by the organisational imperatives of non-state social associations".&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kelsen, Ehrlich had confused ''Sein'' ("is") and ''Sollen'' ("ought").&lt;ref&gt;For a presentation of this debate and references to the original sources of the debate see van Klink 2006. For an analysis of the debate between Kelsen and Ehrlich see Banakar 2008. Banakar argues that Kelsen could not help but miss the point that Ehrlich was making by his distinction.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argued that Ehrlich was distinguishing between positive (or state) law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law', what Ehrlich called "living law", that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109&lt;br&gt;* Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leon Petrazycki ii.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Leon Petrazycki]]]]
[[Leon Petrazycki]] distinguished between forms of "official law," supported by the state, and "intuitive law," consisting of legal experiences that, in turn, consist of a complex of psychic processes in the mind of the individual with no reference to outside authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Petrazycki1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrazycki's work addressed sociological problems and his method was empirical, since he maintained that one could gain knowledge of objects or relationships only by observation. However, he couched his theory in the language of cognitive psychology and moral philosophy rather than sociology. Consequently, his contribution to the development of sociology of law remains largely unrecognized.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2006; also see Podgórecki 1980; Kurczewski 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Petrazycki's "intuitive law" influenced not only the development of Georges Gurvitch's concept of "social law" (see below), which in turn has left its mark on socio-legal theorising, but also the work of later socio-legal scholars. Among those who were directly inspired by Petrazycki's work is the Polish legal sociologist [[Adam Podgórecki]].&lt;ref&gt;See Podgórecki 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Geiger]] developed a close-knit analysis of the Marxist theory of law. He highlighted how law becomes a "factor in social transformation in democratic societies of the kind that are governed by the consent expressed by universal suffrage of the population practised at regular intervals".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Geiger went on to develop the salient characteristics of his antimetaphysical thinking, until he exceeded it with practical [[nihilism]]. Geiger's nihilism of values paved the way for a form of [[legal nihilism]], which encourages the construction of a sober democracy "that is capable of raising conflict to the intellectual level and of anaesthetising feelings, as it is aware of its own inability to make any proclamation of value, ethics or policy about the nature of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Gurvitch]] was interested in the fusion of simultaneous manifestation of law in various forms and at various levels of social interaction. His aim was to devise the concept of "social law" as a law of integration and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;see Gurvitch, Georges, ''L'idée du droit social'' (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; Gurvitch's social law was an integral part of his general sociology. "It is also one of the early sociological contributions to the theory of legal pluralism, since it challenged all conceptions of law based on a single source of legal, political, or moral authority".&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the sociology of law had an early reception in Argentina. As a local movement of legal scholars steeming from the work of Carlos Cossio, South American researchers have focused on comparative law and sociological insights, constitutional law and society, human rights, and psycho-social approaches to the legal practices.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Lista, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological approaches to the study of law==

===Modern sociology of law===
The sociology of law became clearly established as an academic field of learning and empirical research after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the emergence of the "sociological movement" in law after World War II see Deflem 2009: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the study of law was not central in sociology, although some well-known sociologists did write about the role of law in society. In the work of [[Talcott Parsons]], for instance, law is conceived as an essential mechanism of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticisms that were developed against functionalism, other sociological perspectives of law emerged. Critical sociologists,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Cotterrell 1992: 122-3&lt;/ref&gt;  developed a perspective of law as an instrument of power. However, other theorists in the sociology of law, such as [[Philip Selznick]], argued that modern law became increasingly responsive to a society's needs and had to be approached morally as well.&lt;ref&gt;Selznik, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Still other scholars, most notably the American sociologist [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]], developed a resolutely scientific theory of law on the basis of a paradigm of [[pure sociology]]. Equally broad in orientation, but again different, is the [[autopoietic system]]s theory of the German sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]], who presents law or "the legal system" as one of the ten ''function systems'' (see [[Differentiation (sociology)|functional differentiation]]) of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Luhmann 2004 and 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth and Schutz 2015"&gt;[[Steffen Roth]] and Anton Schutz: ''Ten systems. Toward a canon of function systems.'' In: ''Cybernetics and Human Knowing'', Vol. 22, No. 4., 2015. Vorversion verfügbar (englisch; [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2508950 online] auf ssrn.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|All collective human life is directly or indirectly shaped by law. Law is like knowledge, an essential and all-pervasive fact of the social condition.|Niklas Luhmann, ''A Sociological Theory of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann, 1985: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] disagrees with Luhmann and argues that the law can do a better job as a 'system' institution' by representing more faithfully the interests of everyday people in the 'lifeworld'. Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and economic capital and in so doing develop the reproductive professional ''habitus'' of the lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his associates (often influenced by [[Petrazycki]]'s ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by [[Per Stjernquist]], and in Norway by [[Vilhelm Aubert]].

In more recent years, a very wide range of theories has emerged in the sociology of law as a result of the proliferation of theories in sociology at large. Among the recent influences can be mentioned the work of the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], the German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]], [[neo-Marxism]], and [[behaviorism]]. The variety of theoretical influences in the sociology of law has also marked the broader law and society field. The multi-disciplinary law and society field remains very popular, while the disciplinary speciality field of the sociology of law is also "better organized than ever in institutional and professional respects".&lt;ref&gt;Deflem 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and Society===
Law and Society is an American movement, which was established after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had a vested interest in the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale of the Law and Society movement is subtly summed up in two short sentences by [[Lawrence Friedman]]: "Law is a massive vital presence in the United States. It is too important to be left to lawyers".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986:780.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders believed that the "study of law and legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods".&lt;ref&gt;Austin et al, 1998:2.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the [[Law and Society Association]] in 1964 and of the ''Law and Society Review'' in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of the Law and Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.&lt;ref&gt;See Munger 1998 and Simon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

On one view, the main difference between the sociology of law and Law and Society is that the latter does not limit itself theoretically or methodologically to sociology and tries instead to accommodate insights from all social science disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;For an example see Friedman 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; "Not only does it provides a home for sociologists and social anthropologists and political scientists with an interest in law, it also tries to incorporate psychologists and economists who study law."&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From another point of view, both sociology of law and Law and Society should be seen as multi-disciplinary or trans-disciplinary enterprises although sociology of law has special ties to the methods, theories and traditions of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s a number of original empirical studies were conducted by Law and Society scholars on conflict and dispute resolution. In his early work, [[Bill Felstiner|William Felstiner]], for example, focused on alternative ways to solve conflicts (avoidance, mediation, litigation etc.). Together with [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]] and [[Austin Sarat]], Felstiner developed the idea of a disputes pyramid and the formula "naming, blaming, claiming", which refers to different stages of conflict resolution and levels of the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;"See, Felstiner, Abel and Sarat 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological jurisprudence===
The sociology of law is often distinguished from sociological jurisprudence. The latter is not primarily concerned with debates within mainstream sociology and instead engages with some of the debates within jurisprudence and legal theory. Sociological jurisprudence seeks to base legal arguments on sociological insights and, unlike legal theory, is concerned with the mundane practices that create legal institutions and social operations which reproduce legal systems over time. It was developed in the United States by [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faigman|first=David L.|title=Laboratory of Justice: The Supreme Court's 200-Year Struggle to Integrate Science and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsMjpPS5AXoC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2005|publisher=Henry Holt |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Roscoe. "Scope and Purpose of Sociological Jurisprudence." ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 24 (1910): 591. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1324392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfrid E. Rumble, Jr., "Legal Realism, Sociological Jurisprudence and Mr. Justice Holmes," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1965) 26#4 pp. 547-566 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708499 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It was influenced by the work of pioneer legal sociologists, such as the Austrian jurist [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and the Russian-French sociologist [[Georges Gurvitch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Although distinguishing between different branches of the social scientific studies of law allows us to explain and analyse the development of the sociology of law in relation to mainstream sociology and legal studies, such potentially artificial distinctions are not necessarily fruitful for the development of the field as whole. For the social scientific studies of law to transcend the theoretical and empirical limits, which currently define their scope, they need to go beyond such artificial distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-legal studies==
'Socio-legal studies' in the UK has grown mainly out of the interest of law schools in promoting interdisciplinary studies of law.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whether regarded as an emerging discipline, sub-discipline or a methodological approach, it is often viewed in light of its relationship to, and oppositional role within, law.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It should not, therefore, be confused with the legal sociology of many West European countries or the Law and Society scholarship in the US, which foster much stronger disciplinary ties with social sciences. In the past, it has been presented as the applied branch of the sociology of law and criticised for being empiricist and atheoretical.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Max Travers, for example, regards socio-legal studies as a subfield of social policy, 'mainly concerned with influencing or serving government policy in the provision of legal services'&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and adds that it "has given up any aspirations it once had to develop general theories about the policy process".&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001: 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable practitioners of socio-legal studies include [[Carol Smart|Professor Carol Smart]], co-director of the [[Arthur Lewis Building#External links|Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life]], (named after the sociologist, [[David Morgan (sociologist)|David Morgan]]), as well as [[Mavis Maclean|Professor Mavis Maclean]] and [[John Eekelaar]] who are joint directors of the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy (OXFLAP).

'''Socio-legal methods of investigation'''

The sociology of law has no methods of investigation which have been developed specifically for conducting socio-legal research. Instead, it employs a wide variety of social scientific methods, including qualitative and quantitative research techniques, to explore law and legal phenomena. Positivistic&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as interpretive (such as discourse analysis) and ethnographic&lt;ref&gt;See Travers 1997, Flood 2005 and 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; approaches to data collection and analysis is used within the socio-legal field.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of various methods see Banakar and Travers 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of law in Britain==
Sociology of law was a small, but developing, sub-field of British sociology and legal scholarship at the time when Campbell and Wiles wrote their review of law and society research in 1976. Unfortunately, despite its initial promise, it has remained a small field. Very few empirical sociological studies are published each year. Nevertheless, there have been some excellent studies, representing a variety of sociological traditions as well as some major theoretical contributions. The two most popular approaches during the 1960s and 1970s were interactionism and Marxism.

'''Symbolic interactionism and Marxism'''

[[Symbolic interactionism|Interactionism]] had become popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a politically radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing society as a system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people were doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Becker 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a problem to be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused on the process of law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paterson 1982; Flood 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential sociological approach during this period was, however, Marxism—which claimed to offer a scientific and comprehensive understanding of society as a whole in the same way as structural-functionalism, although with the emphasis on the struggle between different groups for material advantage, rather than value-consensus. This approach caught the imagination of many people with left-wing political views in law schools, but it also generated some interesting empirical studies. These included historical studies about how particular
statutes were used to advance the interests of dominant economic groups, and also Pat Carlen's memorable ethnography,&lt;ref&gt;Pat Carlen 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; which combined analytic resources from Marxism and interactionism, especially the sociology of Erving Goffman, in writing about magistrates' courts.

'''The Oxford Centre for Socio-Legal Studies'''

The 1980s were also a fruitful time for empirical sociology of law in Britain, mainly
because Donald Harris deliberately set out to create the conditions for a fruitful
exchange between lawyers and sociologists at the [[University of Oxford]] Centre for Socio-Legal Studies. He was fortunate enough to recruit a number of young and
talented social scientists, including J. Maxwell Atkinson and Robert Dingwall who were interested in ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and the sociology
of the professions, and Doreen McBarnet who became something of a cult figure on the left after publishing her doctoral thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Doreen McBarnet 1981&lt;/ref&gt; which advanced a particularly clear and vigorous Marxist analysis of the criminal justice system. Ethnomethodology has not previously been mentioned in this review, and tends to be overlooked by many reviewers in this field since it cannot easily be assimilated to their theoretical interests. One can note, however, that it has always offered a more radical and thorough-going way of theorizing action than interactionism (although the two approaches have a lot in common when compared to traditions that view society as a structural whole, like Marxism or structural-functionalism). During his time at the center, J. Maxwell Atkinson collaborated with Paul Drew, a sociologist at the University of York, in what became the first conversation analytic study of courtroom interaction, using transcripts of coroner's hearings in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson and Drew, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of interest developed at Oxford during this period was the sociology of the professions. Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; edited what remains an interesting and theoretically diverse collection, bringing together specialists from the sociology of law and medicine. The best known study to date has, however, been published by the American scholar [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]]&lt;ref&gt;Abel 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who employed ideas and concepts from functionalist, Marxist, and Weberian
sociology to explain the high incomes and status that British lawyers enjoyed for most of the twentieth century.

'''Recent developments'''

Since the 1980s, relatively few empirical studies of law and legal institutions have been conducted by British sociologists, i.e. studies which are empirical and at the same time engage with the theoretical concerns of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some exceptions. To begin with, sociology of law, along with so many areas of academic work, has been enlivened and renewed through engagement with feminism. There has been a great deal of
interest in the implications of Foucault's ideas on governmentality for understanding
law,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt and Wickham 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and also in continental thinkers such as Niklas Luhmann and Pierre Bourdieu. Again, one can argue that rather fewer empirical studies have been produced than one might have hoped, but a great deal of interesting work has been published.

A second exception is to be found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 1997; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science can address the content of legal practice.

Despite the relatively limited developments in recent empirical research, theoretical debates in sociology of law have been important in British literature during recent decades, with contributions from [[David Nelken]] exploring the problems of a comparative sociology of law and the potential of the idea of legal cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2004; 2007; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Cotterrell]] seeking to develop a new view of the relations of law and community to replace what he sees as outdated 'law and society' paradigms,&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and other scholars, such as [[David Schiff]] and Richard Nobles, examining the potential of Luhmannian systems theory and the extent to which law can be seen as an autonomous social field rather than as intimately interrelated with other aspects of the social.&lt;ref&gt;Nobles and Schiff 2006; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant has been the burgeoning field of socio-legal research on regulation and government,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} to which British scholars have been prominent contributors.

==Devising a sociological concept of law==
In contrast to the traditional understanding of law (see the separate entry on [[law]]), the sociology of law does not normally view and define the law only as a system of rules, doctrine and decisions, which exist independently of the society out of which it has emerged. The rule-based aspect of law is, admittedly, important, but provides an inadequate basis for describing, analysing and understanding law in its societal context.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009; Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, legal sociology regards law as a set of institutional practices which have evolved over time and developed in relation to, and through interaction with, cultural, economic and socio-political structures and institutions. As a modern social system, law does strive to gain and retain its autonomy to function independently of other social institutions and systems such as religion, polity and economy. Yet, it remains historically and functionally linked to these other institutions. Thus, one of the objectives of the sociology of law remains to devise empirical methodologies capable of describing and explaining modern law's interdependence with other social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar and Travers 2005 and Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some influential approaches within the sociology of law have challenged definitions of law in terms of official (state) law (see for example [[Eugen Ehrlich]]'s concept of "living law" and [[Georges Gurvitch]]'s "social law"). From this standpoint, law is understood broadly to include not only the legal system and formal (or official) legal institutions and processes, but also various informal (or unofficial) forms of nomativity and regulation which are generated within groups, associations and communities. The sociological studies of law are, thus, not limited to analysing how the rules or institutions of the legal system interact with social class, gender, race, religion, sexuality and other social categories. They also focus on how the internal normative orderings of various groups and "communities", such as the community of lawyers, businessmen, scientists, members of political parties, or members of the Mafia, interact with each other. In short, law is studied as an integral and constitutive part of social institutions, groupings and communities. This approach is developed further under the section on legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;For studies of legal pluralism see Dalberg-Larsen 2000; Merry 1988; Chiba 1989; John Griffiths 1986; Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western sociology of law==

The interest in the sociology of law continues to be more widespread in Western countries. Some important research has been produced by Indian scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Deva, 2005; Baxi, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but we find only a limited amount of socio-legal work by researchers from, for example, the Middle East or central and northern parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;For an earlier overview of the field, see Ferrari, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the global spread of sociological studies of law appears uneven and concentrated, above all, in industrialised nations with democratic political systems. In this sense, the global expansion of legal sociology “is not taking place uniformly across national boundaries and appears to correlate with a combination of factors such as national wealth/poverty and form of political organisation, as well as historical factors such as the growth of the welfare state... However, none of these factors alone can explain this disparity”.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the disparity between Western and non-Western sociology of law see Banakar 2011 at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary perspectives==

===Legal pluralism===
[[Legal pluralism]] is a concept developed by legal sociologists and social anthropologists "to describe multiple layers of law, usually with different sources of legitimacy, that exist within a single state or society".&lt;ref&gt;Olgiati 2007; also see Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also defined "as a situation in which two or more legal systems coexist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Sally Engle Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralists define law broadly to include not only the system of courts and judges backed by the coercive power of the state, but also the "non-legal forms of normative ordering".&lt;ref&gt;Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralism consists of many different methodological approaches and as a concept, it embraces "diverse and often contested perspectives on law, ranging from the recognition of different legal orders within the nation-state, to a more far reaching and open-ended concept of law that does not necessarily depend on state recognition for validity. This latter concept of law may come into being whenever two or more legal systems exist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The ideology of legal positivism has had such a powerful hold on the imagination of lawyers and social scientists that its picture of the legal world has been able successfully to masquerade as fact and has formed the foundation stone of social and legal theory.|John Griffiths, "What is Legal Pluralism"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths, 1986:5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Legal pluralism has occupied a central position in socio-legal theorising from the very beginning of the sociology of law. The sociological theories of [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]] were early sociological contributions to legal pluralism. It has, moreover, provided the most enduring topic of socio-legal debate over many decades within both the sociology of law and legal anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and has received more than its share of criticism from the proponents of the various schools of [[legal positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Tamanaha 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The critics often ask: "How is law distinguished in a pluralist view from other normative systems? What makes a social rule system legal?".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy arises mainly "from the claim that the only true law is the law made and enforced by the modern state".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This standpoint is also known as "legal centralism". From a legal centralist standpoint, John Griffiths writes, "law is and should be the law of the state, uniform for all persons, exclusive of all other law, and administrated by a single set of state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to legal centralism, "customary laws and religious laws are not properly called 'law' except in so far as state has chosen to adopt and treat any such normative order as part of its own law".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is often made between the "weak" and the "strong" versions of legal pluralism. The "weak" version does not necessarily question the main assumptions of "legal centralism", but only recognises that within the domain of the Western state law other legal systems, such as customary or Islamic law, may also have an autonomous (co-)existence.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths, 2002: 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "weak" version does not consider other forms of normative ordering as law. As Tamanaha, one of the critics of legal pluralism, puts it: "Normative ordering is, well, normative ordering. Law is something else, something that we isolate out and call law…".&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha 1993: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The "strong" version, on the other hand, rejects all legal centralist and formalist models of law, as "a myth, an ideal, a claim, an illusion,"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding state law as one among many forms of law or forms of social ordering. It insists that modern law is plural, that it is private as well as public, but most importantly "the national (public official) legal system is often a secondary rather than the primary locus of regulation".&lt;ref&gt;Galanter 1981: 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism directed at legal pluralism often uses the basic assumptions of legal positivism to question the validity of theories of legal pluralism which aim at criticising those very (positivistic) assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roger Cotterrell]] explains, the pluralist conception should be understood as part of "the legal sociologist's effort to broaden perspectives on law. A legal sociologist's specification of law might be different from that presupposed by a lawyer in practice, but it will relate (indeed, in some way incorporate) the latter because it must (if it is to reflect legal experience) take account of lawyers' perspectives on law. Thus a pluralist approach in legal theory is likely to recognise what lawyers typically recognize as law, but may see this law as one species of a larger genus, or treat lawyers' conception of law as reflecting particular perspectives determined by particular objectives".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopoiesis===
[[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] originally coined the concept of autopoiesis within theoretical biology to describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana and Varela 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by [[Niklas Luhmann]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ziegert 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann's systems theory transcends the classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising a solution to the problem of the humanised 'subject'.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Perhaps the most challenging idea incorporated in the theory of autopoiesis is that social systems should not be defined in terms of human agency or norms, but of communications. Communication is in turn the unity of utterance, information and understanding and constitutes social systems by recursively reproducing communication. This sociologically radical thesis, which raises the fear of a dehumanised theory of law and society, attempts to highlight the fact that social systems are constituted by communicative."&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Max Travers 2005: 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roger Cotterrell]], "Luhmann... treats the theory as the basis for all general sociological analysis of social systems and their mutual relations.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; But its theoretical claims about law's autonomy are very powerful postulates, presented in advance of (and even, perhaps, in place of) the kind of detailed empirical study of social and legal change that comparatists and most legal sociologists are likely to favour. The postulates of autopoiesis theory do not so much guide empirical research as explain conclusively how to interpret whatever this research may discover."&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cultures===
[[Legal culture]] is one of the central concepts of the sociology of law. The study of legal cultures may, at the same time, be regarded as one of the general approaches within the sociology of law.

As a concept, it refers to "relatively stable patterns of legally-oriented social behaviour and attitudes," and as such is regarded as a subcategory of the concept of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Nelken, 2004: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively new concept which, according to [[David Nelken]], can be traced to "terms like legal tradition or legal style, which have a much longer history in comparative law or in early political science. It presupposes and invites us to explore the existence of systematic variations in patterns in 'law in the books' and 'law in action,' and, above all, in the relation between them".&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an approach, it focuses on the cultural aspects of law, legal behaviour and legal institutions and, thus, has affinity with [[cultural anthropology]], legal pluralism, and [[comparative law]].

[[Lawrence M. Friedman]] is among socio-legal scholars who introduced the idea of legal culture into the sociology of law. For Friedman, legal culture "refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 193. But for criticism of the vagueness of this and other formulations of the concept of legal culture in sociology of law, see Cotterrell, 2006, ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It can also consist of "bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures at different levels of abstraction, e.g. at the level of the legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the "internal" and "external" legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.

===Feminism===
Law has always been regarded as one of the important sites of engagement for feminism. As pointed out by Ruth Fletcher feminist engagement with the law has taken many forms through the years, which also indicates their successful merging of theory and practice: "Through litigation, campaigns for reform and legal education, feminists have engaged explicitly with law and the legal profession. In taking on the provisions of specialist advice services, women's groups have played a role in making law accessible to those in need. By subjecting legal concepts and methods to critical analysis, feminists have questioned the terms of legal debate."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization===
[[Globalization]] is often defined in terms of economic processes which bring about radical cultural developments at the level of world society. Although law is an essential ingredient of the process of globalization - and important studies of law and globalization were already conducted in the 1990s by, for example, Yves Dezalay and Bryant Garth&lt;ref&gt;Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Volkmar Gessner&lt;ref&gt;Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; - law's importance for creating and maintaining the globalization processes are often neglected within the sociology of globalization and remain, arguably, somewhat underdeveloped within the sociology of law.&lt;ref&gt;For one of the relatively early empirical studies see Dezalay and Garth 1996. For a collection of empirical studies of law and globalization see Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

As pointed out by Halliday and Osinsky, "[[Economic globalization]] cannot be understood apart from global business regulation and the legal construction of the markets on which it increasingly depends. Cultural globalization cannot be explained without attention to intellectual property rights institutionalized in law and global governance regimes. The globalization of protections for vulnerable populations cannot be comprehended without tracing the impact of international criminal and humanitarian law or international tribunals. Global contestation over the institutions of democracy and state building cannot be meaningful unless considered in relation to constitutionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday and Osinsk 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socio-legal approaches to the study of globalization and global society often overlap with, or make use of, studies of legal cultures and legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;See Teubner 1996; Feest and Nelken 2007, Friedman and Perez-Perdomo 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''superquadrics''' or '''super-quadrics''' (also '''superquadratics''')  are a family of [[geometry|geometric shapes]] defined by formulas that resemble those of [[ellipsoid]]s and other [[quadric]]s, except that the [[square (algebra)|squaring]] operations are replaced by arbitrary powers. They can be seen as the three-dimensional relatives of the [[superellipse]]s. The term may refer to the solid object or to its [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]], depending on the context. The equations below specify the surface; the solid is specified by replacing the equality signs by less-than-or-equal signs.

The superquadrics include many shapes that resemble [[cube]]s, [[octahedron|octahedra]], [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinders]], [[lozenge]]s and [[spindle torus|spindle]]s, with rounded or sharp corners. Because of their flexibility and relative simplicity, they are popular [[geometric model]]ing tools, especially in [[computer graphics]]. 

Some authors, such as [[Alan H. Barr|Alan Barr]], define "superquadrics" as including both the [[superellipsoid]]s and the [[supertoroid]]s.&lt;ref name="barr81"&gt;Barr, A.H. (January 1981), ''Superquadrics and Angle-Preserving Transformations''. IEEE_CGA vol. 1 no. 1, pp. 11–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barr92"&gt;Barr, A.H. (1992), ''Rigid Physically Based Superquadrics''. Chapter III.8 of ''Graphics Gems III'', edited by D. Kirk, pp. 137–159&lt;/ref&gt; However, the (proper) supertoroids are not superquadrics as defined above; and, while some superquadrics are superellipsoids, neither family is contained in the other.

== Formulas ==
=== Implicit equation ===
The surface of the basic superquadric is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \left|x\right|^r + \left|y\right|^s + \left|z\right|^t =1&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'', ''s'', and ''t'' are positive real numbers that determine the main features of the superquadric. Namely:

* less than 1: a pointy octahedron modified to have [[concave polygon|concave]] [[face (geometry)|faces]] and sharp [[edge (geometry)|edges]].
* exactly 1: a regular [[octahedron]].
* between 1 and 2: an octahedron modified to have convex faces, blunt edges and blunt corners.
* exactly 2: a sphere
* greater than 2: a cube modified to have rounded edges and corners.
* [[infinity (mathematics)|infinite]] (in the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]): a cube

Each exponent can be varied independently to obtain combined shapes. For example, if ''r''=''s''=2, and ''t''=4, one obtains a solid of revolution which resembles an ellipsoid with round cross-section but flattened ends. This formula is a special case of the superellipsoid's formula if (and only if) ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''.

If any exponent is allowed to be negative, the shape extends to infinity. Such shapes are sometimes called '''super-hyperboloids'''.

The basic shape above spans from -1 to +1 along each coordinate axis. The general superquadric is the result of [[similarity (geometry)|scaling]] this basic shape by different amounts ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' along each axis. Its general equation is
:&lt;math&gt; \left|\frac{x}{A}\right|^r + \left|\frac{y}{B}\right|^s + \left|\frac{z}{C}\right|^t = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Parametric description ===
Parametric equations in terms of surface parameters ''u'' and ''v'' (longitude and latitude) are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 x(u,v) &amp;{}= A g\left(v,\frac{2}{r}\right) g\left(u,\frac{2}{r}\right) \\
 y(u,v) &amp;{}= B g\left(v,\frac{2}{s}\right) f\left(u,\frac{2}{s}\right) \\
 z(u,v) &amp;{}= C f\left(v,\frac{2}{t}\right) \\
 &amp; -\frac{\pi}{2} \le v \le \frac{\pi}{2}, \quad -\pi \le u &lt; \pi ,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the auxiliary functions are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f(\omega,m) &amp;{}= \sgn(\sin \omega) |\sin \omega|^m \\
 g(\omega,m) &amp;{}= \sgn(\cos \omega) |\cos \omega|^m
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and the [[sign function]] sgn(''x'') is 
:&lt;math&gt; \sgn(x) = \begin{cases}
 -1, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\
  0, &amp; x = 0 \\
 +1, &amp; x &gt; 0 .
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- Fix this for superquadrics:

===Volume and area===
The volume inside this surface can be expressed in terms of [[beta function]]s, β(''m'',''n'')&amp;nbsp;= Γ(''m'')Γ(''n'')/Γ(''m''+''n''), as
:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac{2}{3} A B C e n \beta \left( \frac{1}{r},\frac{1}{r} \right) \beta \left({2}{t},\frac{1}{t} \right) . &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Ronald Reagan televised address from the Oval Office, outlining plan for Tax Reduction Legislation July 1981.jpg|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]]'s economic policies, which were dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]", included large tax cuts and were characterized as trickle-down economics—in this picture, he is outlining his plan for Tax Reduction Legislation from the [[Oval Office]] in a televised address, July 1981]]
'''Trickle-down economics''', also called '''trickle-down theory''', refers to the economic proposition that taxes on businesses and the wealthy in society should be reduced as a means to stimulate business investment in the short term and benefit society at large in the long term. In recent history, the term has been used by critics of [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, such as "[[Reaganomics]]." Whereas general supply-side theory favors lowering taxes overall, trickle-down theory more specifically targets taxes on the upper end of the [[Social class|economic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Why Trickle Down Economic Works in Theory But Not in Fact|author=Amadeo, Kimberly|date=April 29, 2017|magazine=The Balance|url=https://www.thebalance.com/trickle-down-economics-theory-effect-does-it-work-3305572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cross and Reaganomics: Conservative Christians Defending Ronald Reagan|author=Crouse, Eric R.|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-vkVdJPN4wC|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "trickle-down" originated as a joke by humorist [[Will Rogers]] and today is often used to criticize economic policies which favor the wealthy or privileged while being framed as good for the average citizen. [[David Stockman]], who as [[Ronald Reagan]]'s budget director championed [[Reagan tax cuts|Reagan's tax cuts]] at first, later became critical of them and told journalist [[William Greider]] that "supply-side economics" is the trickle-down idea:&lt;ref name=atlantic-stockman&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1981/12/the-education-of-david-stockman/305760/?single_page=true "The Education of David Stockman"] by William Greider&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Greider. ''The Education of David Stockman.'' {{ISBN|0-525-48010-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|It's kind of hard to sell 'trickle down,' so the supply-side formula was the only way to get a tax policy that was really 'trickle down.' Supply-side is 'trickle-down' theory.|David Stockman|''[[The Atlantic]]''}}

Political opponents of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] soon seized on this language in an effort to brand the administration as caring only about the wealthy.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Multiple studies have found a correlation between trickle-down economics and reduced growth.&lt;ref name=imf/&gt;&lt;ref name=pav/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/business/12scene.html|title=In the Real World of Work and Wages, Trickle-Down Theories Don’t Hold Up|date=April 12, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tjn/&gt; Trickle-down economics has been widely criticised particularly by [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ([[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Social liberalism|social liberal]]) and [[moderate]] politicians and economists, but also some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] ([[conservative]]) politicians.

== History and usage ==
[[File:WilliamJBryan1902.png|thumb|150px|[[William Jennings Bryan]], who criticized trickle-down theory in his [[Cross of Gold speech]] in 1896]]
In 1896, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[List of United States presidential candidates|presidential candidate]] [[William Jennings Bryan]] described the concept using the metaphor of a "leak" in his {{nowrap|[[Cross of Gold speech]]:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas Frederick. 1992.

:There are two ideas of government. There are those who believe that if you just legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, that their prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that rests upon it.&lt;ref name="historymatters.gmu.edu"&gt;[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/ Bryan's "Cross of Gold" Speech: Mesmerizing the Masses], historymatters.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Humorist Will Rogers jokingly advised in a column in 1932:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiredpen.com/2015/01/30/will-rogers-trickle-economics/|title=Will Rogers on "trickle up" economics|date=2015-01-30|website=WiredPen|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;This election was lost four and six years ago, not this year. They [Republicans] didn’t start thinking of the old common fellow till just as they started out on the election tour. The money was all appropriated for the top in the hopes that it would trickle down to the needy. Mr. Hoover was an engineer. He knew that water trickles down. Put it uphill and let it go and it will reach the driest little spot. But he didn’t know that money trickled up. Give it to the people at the bottom and the people at the top will have it before night, anyhow. But it will at least have passed through the poor fellows hands. They saved the big banks, but the little ones went up the flue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William J. Bennett]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Humorist Will Rogers referred to the theory that cutting taxes for higher earners and businesses was a "trickle down" policy, a term that has stuck over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, William J. (2007).

Harper Collins. p. 78. {{ISBN|1595551115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Presidential speech writer [[Samuel Rosenman]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The philosophy that had prevailed in Washington since 1921, that the object of government was to provide prosperity for those who lived and worked at the top of the economic pyramid, in the belief that prosperity would trickle down to the bottom of the heap and benefit all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' notes that the first known use of "trickle-down" as an adjective meaning "relating to or working on the principle of trickle-down theory" was in 1944&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trickle-down ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' (online edition) entry for "trickle-down."] Accessed September 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; while the first known use of "trickle-down theory" was in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trickle-down%20theory ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' (online edition) entry for "trickle-down theory."] Accessed September 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the [[President of the United States|presidency]], Democrat [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] alleged "[[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] [...] simply don't know how to manage the economy. They're so busy operating the trickle-down theory, giving the richest corporations the biggest break, that the whole thing goes to hell in a handbasket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/73jul/janos.htm|title=The Last Days of the President|first=Leo|last=Janos|work=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on the [[United States Senate|Senate]] floor in 1992, Senator [[Hank Brown]] (R-Colorado) said: "Mr. President, the trickle-down theory attributed to the Republican Party has never been articulated by President Reagan and has never been articulated by [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]] and has never been advocated by either one of them. One might argue whether trickle down makes any sense or not. To attribute to people who have advocated the opposite in policies is not only inaccurate but poisons the debate on public issues".&lt;ref&gt;Hank Brown. ''[[Congressional Record]],'' March 24, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Thomas Sowell]] has written extensively on trickle-down economics and loathes its characterization, citing that supply-side economics has never claimed to work in a "trickle-down" fashion. Rather, the economic theory of reducing marginal tax rates works in precisely the opposite direction: "Workers are always paid first and then profits flow upward later – if at all".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsowell.com/images/Hoover%20Proof.pdf "Tricle Down" Theory and "Tax Cuts for the Rich"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
The economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] noted that "trickle-down economics" had been tried before in the United States in the 1890s under the name "horse and sparrow theory", writing: {{quote|Mr. [[David Stockman]] has said that [[supply-side economics]] was merely a cover for the trickle-down approach to economic policy—what an older and less elegant generation called the horse-and-sparrow theory: 'If you feed the horse enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows.'|sign=|source=}} Galbraith claimed that the horse and sparrow theory was partly to blame for the [[Panic of 1896]].&lt;ref name=galbraith&gt;Galbraith, John Kenneth (February 4, 1982) "[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1982/feb/04/recession-economics/ Recession Economics]."

In the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]], [[Independent politician|independent]] candidate [[Ross Perot]] called trickle-down economics "political voodoo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1992/trickle-down|title=The Living Room Candidate - Commercials - 1992 - Trickle Down|website=www.livingroomcandidate.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same election during a presidential town hall debate, [[Bill Clinton]] said: {{quote|What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of [declining economic conditions in America]. It is because America has not invested in its people. It is because we have not grown. It is because we've had 12 years of trickle-down economics.

In New Zealand, [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament (New Zealand)|Member of Parliament]] [[Damien O'Connor]] has called trickle-down economics "the rich pissing on the poor" in the Labour Party campaign launch video for the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5870477/Labour-campaign-video-harks-back-to-history|title=Labour campaign video harks back to history|last=Chapman|first=Kate|date=October 28, 2011|work=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by the [[Tax Justice Network]] indicates that wealth of the super-rich does not trickle down to improve the economy, but it instead tends to be amassed and sheltered in [[tax haven]]s with a negative effect on the tax bases of the home economy.&lt;ref name=tjn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/21/offshore-wealth-global-economy-tax-havens| author=Heather Stewart |title=Wealth doesn't trickle down – it just floods offshore, research reveals| work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 21, 2012 |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Pope Francis]] referred to "trickle-down theories" in his [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Evangelii Gaudium]]'' with the following statement (No. 54): {{quote|Some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world.

A 2015 paper by researchers for the [[International Monetary Fund]] argues that there is no trickle-down effect as the rich get richer: &lt;blockquote&gt;[I]f the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth.&lt;ref name=imf&gt;Era Dabla-Norris; Kalpana Kochhar; Nujin Suphaphiphat; Frantisek Ricka; Evridiki Tsounta (June 15, 2015).

A 2015 report on policy by economist [[Pavlina R. Tcherneva]] described the failings of increasing economic gains of the rich without commensurate participation by the working and middle classes, referring to the problematic policies as "Reagan-style trickle-down economics," and "a trickle-down, financial-sector-driven policy regime".&lt;ref name=pav&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tcherneva|first1=Pavlina|title=When a Rising Tide Sinks Most Boats: Trends in US Income Inequality|url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/pn_15_4.pdf|website=Levy Economics Institute|publisher=Bard College|accessdate=November 25, 2016|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential candidates]] debate, [[Hillary Clinton]] accused [[Donald Trump]] of supporting the "most extreme" version of trickle-down economics with his tax plan, calling it "trumped-up trickle-down" as a pun on his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/26/clinton-trump-would-cut-taxes-for-the-rich-in-trump-dump-economics.html| author=Jacob Pramuk |title=Clinton: Trump would cut taxes for the rich in 'trumped up' trickle down economics| work=[[CNBC]] |date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USC Canada''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]], international development organization working to improve livelihoods by promoting [[agricultural biodiversity]]. The organization was founded in 1945 by [[Lotta Hitschmanova]] as the ''Unitarian Service Committee of Canada''.

USC Canada’s mission is to promote sustainable living through strong rural communities with [[family farms]] and healthy [[ecosystem]]s. The Canadian organization partners with programs in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to provide training and to promote self-sustaining communities that strengthen biodiversity, [[food sovereignty]], and the human rights. As of 2017, the organization is run by a staff of approximately 30, most of whom are based in Ottawa, Canada.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.usc-canada.org/about-us/our-people/our-staff|title=USC Canada website, "Our Staff"|accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

USC Canada's award-winning flagship program, ''Seeds of Survival''&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.usc-canada.org/sos|title=Seeds of Survival|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was featured in a [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] article in July, 2011.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/07/food-ark/siebert-text|title=National Geographic, July 2011 "Food Ark"|accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

USC Canada also works to influence global food production policies and practices that nurture fertile landscapes, regenerating the water, soils and vegetation that seeds, plants, and animals depend on.

==History==
Lotta Hitschmanova founded the organization in 1945, receiving registered charity status on August 30 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Clyde Sanger, Lotta, 1986, p43, Stoddart Publishing, Toronto, {{ISBN|0-7737-2072-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as Executive Director for nearly 40 years, retiring in 1982. Throughout her career, her work took her to conflict zones and newly independent countries; wherever the need was greatest.

Through [[Public Service Announcements]] on television and radio, Hitschmanova became one of Canada’s most recognized humanitarians and public figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/hist/biography/biographi249e.shtml/|title=Canadian Personalities - Lotta Hitschmanova|accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her distinctive [[Czech language|Czech]] accent as she pronounced USC Canada’s address, ''56 Sparks Street, Ottawa'' became an unforgettable signature. She struck a special chord with Canadians and mobilized a whole generation to take action and help.

== Present Day ==
Today, USC Canada works in 12 countries around the world, including Canada. The organization's mission is to "build [[food sovereignty]] by working with partners to enhance biodiversity, promote [[Agroecology|ecological food systems]], and counter inequity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usc-canada.org/about-us/our-approach|title=USC Canada - Our Approach|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, USC Canada partnered with [[Seeds of Diversity|Seeds of Diversity Canada]] to start The Bauta Family Initiative on Canadian Seed Security. This initiative is building a movement for resilient seed systems across Canada. Working with farmers, seed producers, researchers, and partners from civil society, government and business, the program conserves and advances biodiversity, maintains public access to seed, delivers research and training programs on ecological seed production, and promotes the wisdom and knowledge of farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seedsecurity.ca/en/about|title=The Bauta Family Initiative on Canadian Seed Security - About us|website=seedsecurity.ca|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WiRED International''' is a 501(c)(3)non-profit, volunteer-driven organization that has been delivering medical and health information to war-affected and underserved regions since 1997. WiRED International’s goal is to address the severe global inequality of health knowledge.

WiRED International provides health information to underdeveloped areas by delivering programs, equipment and coordinated health education. Over the years, the organization has opened facilities in 15 countries, while NGOs, medical schools and hospitals in many additional countries have adopted its programs for community health education. The organization serves remote regions and, when appropriate, supplies laptops, projectors, solar equipment and complete health education libraries.

All WiRED International’s resources online and on portable media are cost-free to users.

WiRED International’s educational programs are technology-based. Starting in the 1990s, the organization stored programs on floppy disks and CD-ROMS and today relies on the Internet and flash drives. With this technology, people can put hundreds of training programs in their pockets, to take beyond the grid. These programs can be run on portable laptops and projectors for group presentations.

In 2009, the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health awarded WiRED International its Organizational Public Health Hero Award. WiRED earned the award “for its achievements in using information technology to provide up-to-date health education and medical information in developing, post-conflict, and isolated regions of the world.”

== History ==
San Francisco State University professor, Gary Selnow, Ph.D., founded WiRED International in 1997 while on a Fulbright Fellowship as a visiting professor at the [[University of Zagreb]] in Croatia right after the [[Yugoslav War]]. Selnow said, “UNICEF had donated computers to a high school in [[Vukovar]], Croatia, but they were sitting in boxes. We connected them to the Internet.”

Within two years, after formally registering as an NGO, WiRED International had established technology-based programs in six of the former Yugoslav countries. The U.S. Department of State engaged WiRED International’s services in Bosnia and then in Kosovo, where the organization’s volunteers set up community-access Internet centers to help people find family members who fled during the conflict with Serbia. Dr. Selnow noted that physicians made up “the largest group visiting the centers in Kosovo.”

As a small and flexible organization, WiRED International can respond quickly to community needs. While most of its work deals with health education, occasionally the organization comes across circumstances that merit special attention. One example took place in Kosovo in 1999, where a number of children had been unable to receive adequate treatment for life-threatening illnesses because of a war-damaged health care system.

Selnow was traveling by van from [[Pristina|Prishtina]] (Priština), Kosovo, to [[Skopje]], Macedonia, which, at the time, had the nearest operational airport. In the van was a five-year-old boy and a nurse. The nurse explained that [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]] was funding the boy’s travel to France for heart surgery, but that budgets couldn’t pay for his parents to go along. “Will you go with him?” Selnow asked. “No, I’ll drop him off and someone from the hospital will meet him at [[de Gaulle Airport]].”

“So, this boy will undergo open-heart surgery without anyone to hold his hand and tell him in his Albanian language that he’ll be fine?” The nurse said, “That’s how it is, I’m sorry.”

Soon afterwards, WiRED International set up a program it called “Video Visit,” where a computer in [[Prishtina]] (Priština), where the parents remained, and a computer in the host country, where the children were being treated, could connect via the Internet. The connections allowed the parents and the children to speak on a regular basis and stay in touch during the children’s often extended treatments. WiRED International’s Video Visit wasn’t set up in time for the boy in the van, but it operated for many other children set off in the months that followed.

WiRED International’s mission became focused on medical and health education as a result of the clear needs evident in Kosovo. A year later, with a National Institutes of Health developmental grant, WiRED began HIV/AIDS education programs across Kenya and then in Sierra Leone. The work expanded to all medical and health concerns, and today through partnerships, WiRED programs are in several African countries and in parts of China, Central and South America, the Middle East, Melanesia and Eurasia.
 
In spring 2003 the State Department asked Selnow to travel to Baghdad with a representative of its U.S. Global Technology Corps to explore how WiRED could most effectively deliver medical training programs to Iraqi doctors. In June 2003, after reviewing field conditions and talking with U.S officials, Iraqi physicians and medical educators, WiRED launched the first technology-based medical training program in the country, starting with the opening of a facility in Iraq’s Medical City Center. Within 18 months the organization had set up 39 centers around Iraq. Several years later WiRED launched the country’s first telemedicine program. Technical problems with satellite availability in the war zone made that program difficult, and it never fully matured. WiRED’s work in Iraq ended in 2010, as the U.S. commitment was winding down.
 
In 2011, as WiRED’s ground programs expanded elsewhere, it began development of its own educational training materials. The program evolved, in 2013, into the Center for the Development and Distribution of Health Education Programs. This resource supplies medical and health education modules via the Internet and portable storage media. It allows partners or any interested NGO to store training modules on thumb drives and laptops and sync them to acquire updates. The result has been a broad distribution of health education programs, even in the most remote areas.
 
In 2014, WiRED has evolved into a health education hub operating in remote and resource-starved regions globally. WiRED collects intellectual content from physicians, nurses and medical educators from around the world. WiRED packages and translates it, when appropriate, and distributes it widely. This clearinghouse model has enabled many medical professionals to contribute to the program, and it has provided a source of health content for people in places isolated and often ignored.

== WiRED International’s Center for the Development and Distribution of Health Information ==
In 2011, WiRED International launched a virtual [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net Center] which draws intellectual content and resources from regions of abundance, processes it for new audiences and distributes that information to regions of scarcity. This project is funded in large part by [http://philanthropy.medtronic.com/ Medtronic Philanthropy].

The WiRED International e-library of more than 300 medical and health education modules enables physicians and nurses, patients, health workers and communities to address the prevention and treatment of both infectious and non-communicable disease in developing areas of the world. The more than 300 topics as diverse as maternal health and hand washing, rheumatic heart disease and Ebola, clean water strategies and home caregiver training.

In 2014 WiRED International expanded the global reach of its programs by creating a “Filling Station.” This is a tool that provides file synchronization (or syncing), whereby a person’s computer can upload data from a master file in an automatic process that adds new or changed material. Thus, the Filling Station allows instant updating of the entire community health education (CHE) e-library from any Internet access point in the world.

With these interactive training programs, communities and medical professionals alike can educate themselves through the material released on this website and also distributed on portable media for communities off the grid.

These training modules are developed by WiRED International’s team of physicians, medical editors, imagers and technicians along with a host of other medical experts. The team continually updates the existing material and creates new modules to provide a rich source of health information.

== Rapid Response Modules ==
[[File:WiRED International Ebola Module Screenshot.png|thumb|WiRED International Ebola Module Screenshot]]
When a community health crisis occurs, WiRED International speeds the creation of a rapid response module and translates it into appropriate languages. Examples include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46887">Since the late 20th century, substantial [[labour migration]] from developing countries to high-income countries has occurred. 
This includes a substantial portion of female migrants.  The term '''feminization of migration''' has been proposed as a suggested "[[gendered]] pattern" in [[international migration]] where there is a trend towards a higher percentage of women among voluntary migrants.&lt;ref name=Lan&gt;Lan, Pei-Chia. ''Global Cinderellas: Migrant Domestics and Newly Rich Employers in Taiwan''. Durham, NC: Duke UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies on women migrant workers in high-income countries tend to focus on their employment in [[domestic work]] and [[care work]] for dual-income families.

For more than 4 decades, female migrant numbers have rivaled those of male migrants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 2000, the difference between female and male migrant numbers stayed about the same since 1960, with 5 million more male migrants than female migrants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Statistics==
According to estimates published by the World Bank, there has been only a slight increase in the percentage of women among international migrants over the past fifty years, with 46.7% estimated for 1960 and 48.4% for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Schiff &amp; Sjöblom (2008): ''The International Migration of Women''. Washington: The World Bank. Page 2; [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf Migration and Remittances Factbook 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although "South-South migration" (migration between developing countries) is generally more substantial than migration from developing to high-income countries, the World Bank estimates that there are about 73 million migrants from developing countries living in high-income OECD countries; about half being female and half being male.&lt;ref&gt;these numbers include both refugees and migrant workers. [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf Migration and Remittances Factbook 2011].
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to censuses carried out in 1990, the United Nations Population Division estimated that women constitute 48% of all migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2001|title=Trends in International Migration 2001|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/trends-in-international-migration-2001_migr_outlook-2001-en#page27|journal=OECD|volume=|pages=374|via=OECD iLibrary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, 52% of the 56 million migrants in Europe were female.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/global-dimensions-female-migration|title=The Global Dimensions of Female Migration|date=2003-03-01|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of immigrants in Europe has continually increased, due to a higher demand for [[care work]] for multi-income families, among other things.&lt;ref name=WMW&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beneria, Lourdes|year=2008|title=The crisis of care, international migration, and public policy|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545700802081984#.UkAVLIZTAhE|journal= Feminist Economics|volume= 14|issue=3|pages=1–21|doi=10.1080/13545700802081984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sites for female labor include GCC countries in Western Asia as well as Pacific Rim countries in Eastern and Southeastern Asia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 2000, there were 5 million female migrants compared to 4.9 million male migrants in Eastern and Southeastern Asia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Western Asia, female migrants constituted 48% of all migrants in the region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women migrants work in domestic occupations that are considered part of the [[informal sector]] and lack a degree of government [[regulation]] and protection. [[Lourdes Beneria]], a [[feminist economics|feminist economist]], argues that the demand for care work in Europe in the 1990s and 2000s has brought young [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinas]] to countries like [[Spain]], in order to provide care work for the aging population. The demand for these workers has risen due to an increasing number of European women moving toward the formal sector of work, leaving their domestic duties for hire.

Women leaving their country of origin are often considered to be temporary migrants. They leave for an uncertain amount of time, with the intent to return to their homeland after they have earned enough money. Given that women are statistically better at saving their capital gains, they are becoming increasingly economically significant to the capital gains of their country of origin.&lt;ref name="unwomen-eseasia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen-eseasia.org/projects/migrant/08capacity.pdf|title=Women Migrant Workers Capacity and Contribution}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be measured through [[remittance]]s and how much is sent back to the country of origin. Documentaries, such as ''Letters from the Other Side'', illustrate that after some time, remittances may cease due to new responsibilities or new circumstances that migrant workers face.&lt;ref&gt;Courtney, Heather, dir. Letters from the Other Side. Side street Films, 2006. Film.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic impacts and the impact of women working abroad have both negative and positive impacts upon traditional family roles, children, and gender roles. In addition to diversifying the domestic workforce, women migrant workers also impact the global economy. Remittances by women migrant workers help bolster the [[Gross domestic product|GDPs]] of their countries of origin.

==Feminization of migration==
The term '''feminization of migration''' was used by the United Nations in a 2007 working paper.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2007|title=Feminization of Migration|url=http://www.renate-europe.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Feminization_of_Migration-INSTRAW2007.pdf|journal=UN-INSTRAW|volume=|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gender, Remittances and Development. Feminization of Migration 2007''. Working paper 1 for United Nations Instraw. Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Donato&gt;Donato, K. M., Gabaccia, D., Holdaway, J., Manalansan, M. and Pessar, P. R. (2006), ''A Glass Half Full? Gender in Migration Studies''. International Migration Review, 40: 3–26. {{doi|10.1111/j.1747-7379.2006.00001.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to an increase in the proportion of female migrant workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For a long time,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2017}} females have constituted a high proportion of all international migrants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1960, females constituted 47 out of every 100 migrants residing in a foreign country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2000, women made up almost 49% of all international migrants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although these statistics illustrate a "feminization of migration", a high level of feminization already existed in 1960.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Female laborers are mostly found in low-status and unskilled occupations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2007|title=Women and Migration|url=https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/Femme_Migrations_Eng.pdf|journal=FIDH|volume=|pages=4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, "women migrants are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, a multimillion-dollar business."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/pds/migration.html|title=Migration: a world on the move." United Nations Population Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women in [[Latin America]] respond to demands created in Europe, especially Spain, for jobs as care workers for dual-income houses.&lt;ref name="WMW" /&gt; This demand is created by the increase in European women moving from their traditional household labors to market work, where they can contribute to a company's bottom line.

Limited education can force those with a lack of skills to move to a foreign country to help support their family, but these situations often promote [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=The Social-Economy Impacts of Women Migrant Workers on their Families and Communities|journal=A Case Study in Waru Doyong Village, Central Java, Indonesia|volume=4|pages=144–162|ssrn=1833004|author=Hunga, Arianti Ina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in feminization of migration has led to an increase in concerns regarding females' security in the locations in which they are moving to such as human rights issues and security.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2006/TheFeminizationofMigration.aspx|title=Feminization of Migration|website=www.prb.org|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy surrounding migration has led to challenges for international analysts as they look to change implications. Assumptions have been made regarding the reason women migrate, which causes popular debate among developing countries in considering implication changes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Some of the issues this research addresses are [[remittances]] and their economic impacts, family cohesion, the [[racialization]] of migrants, [[human trafficking]], gendered [[division of labor]], and economic as well as educational opportunities.&lt;ref name=Donato/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zlotnik&gt;Zlotnik, Hania. ''The Global Dimensions of Female Migration.'' Migration Information Source. Mar. 2003. Web. 04 Mar. 2011. &lt;http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=109&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the gender studies boom of the 1990s, statistical evidence on migration patterns have not often been classified by gender.&lt;ref name=Zlotnik/&gt;

A more recent shift in migration, in September 2014, patterns relates to an increase in the migration of single women and partnered women who migrate without their families.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt;

==Gender-specific division of labor==
Much of the work made available to women migrants is gendered and concentrated in the entertainment industry,&lt;ref name=":0b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Tiantian|year=2008|title=Anti-Trafficking Campaign and Karaoke Bar Hostesses in China|journal=Wagadu: A Journal of Transnational Women's and Gender Studies|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[health services]], and most of all in the domestic services.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt;

The gendered [[division of labor]] includes [[reproductive labor]], which refers to work performed within the domestic or private sphere and which helps to sustain a household (e.g. cleaning, cooking, childcare and rearing, etc.).&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt; Reproductive labor enables paid, productive labor to take place.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt; Reproductive labor is typically performed by women and, as dominant gender discourses are threaded throughout labor ideologies, domestic work has historically been considered a "natural" part of a woman's duties and [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt; As such, feminized labor has typically been considered "unskilled" and, thus, has gone unpaid.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt;

As noted by Filipino [[popular culture studies]] professor Roland Tolentino, when women migrate to perform domestic labor, "unpaid home labor in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] becomes paid labor in international spaces".&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt;

===Analyses of migrant nannies===
It has been argued that women migrants working as full-time [[nannies]] support the shift in division of labour in the First World because it becomes affordable to outsource child-care for a larger portion of families.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"&gt;Cheever, Susan. "The Nanny Dilemma." Global Women: Nannies, Maids, and Sex Workers in the New Economy. New York City: Metropolitan /Henry Holt and, 2002. 31-38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  
At the same time, it has been argued, the absence of the migrants working as nannies in high-income countries in their home countries create a shift of gender roles in developing countries as well.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"&gt;Gamburd, Michele. "Breadwinner No More." Global Women: Nannies, Maids, and Sex Workers in the New Economy. New York City: Metropolitan /Henry Holt and, 2002. 190-206. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, both the first-world  mother and the nanny are arguably [[outsourcing]] child care to someone else—the mother to the nanny and the nanny to either her husband, one of her children, or a family relative.  The First World mother gives up her time as mother by going to work and paying the nanny to take care and raise the child. The mother passes on her role as mother to the nanny.  At the same time, the nanny is giving up her time with her children and passing on her role to another person back in her home country.  And, when a woman migrates to a First World country, she is taking on the gender role of "[[breadwinner model|breadwinner]]" of the family—a role that has traditionally been the role of the man in the family, yet the restructuring of the family and [[globalization]] have started changing this ideology of the man being the main financial caretaker of the family.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt;

Those men within the familial unit are displaced as the "breadwinner" for their family—the migrant mothers take over this role when they leave for a First World country and send her earnings back home as [[remittances]] (Add source). This may lead to the perceived [[emasculation]] of the husband, who is left with three options:
# Take on the role of the women in her absence
# Find a job of his own within the Third World country in order to still be seen as a financial contributor and still be considered a man
# Reject the womanly role and continue to not provide to the family in relation to child care and house work.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt;

Nannies leave their children back in the Third World countries, taking their love with them.  The mothers (nannies) then need someone to love at the moment, therefore most usually giving their love to the closest children possible—the ones that they are nannies for.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;  The child that is being taken care of by the nanny is also lacking someone to love because his/her parents are working during the day, and depending on the exact situation it is hard to tell how much of a [[parenting]] [[role]] they take when they get home from work.

In many cases the children in turn love the person that is most like a parent to them; the person they spend most of their time with—their nanny.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;  Parents often become jealous of the nannies; however, they are the ones who decided to have kids, the ones that decided to pursue working jobs, and those who decided to hire a nanny.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;  This often leads to the parents firing the nanny.  Yet, most children have created a bond with their nanny, and they have come to assume that the nanny is going to be a part of their life for some time.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;  The firing of a nanny in some cases leave a child heart-broken and the nanny as well for she has treated this child as one of her own.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;
  
From studies and personal stories of family members, scholars have noted that nannies transplant their love for their own children into the children in which they take care of.  It is rare for the families of nannies to migrate to the First World with them.  Also, nannies do not often get to return home to visit their children—in some cases, every two or three years.  Nannies still try to stay in connection with their families, and the advancements of [[technology]] and [[communication]] have made this easier to do.&lt;ref name="Parrenas, Rhacel 2005"&gt;Parrenas, Rhacel. "Long Distance Intimacy: Class, Gender and Intergenerational Relations between Mothers and Children in Filipino Transnational Families." Global Networks. 5.4 (2005): 317-336. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most all migrant mothers are seen as "here and there" at the same time—[[Nurturant parent model|nurturing]] her children from another country.  Physical love is not present within the transnational family.  Mothers cannot nurture up close and the physical love is not allowed to be transferred from two different countries.&lt;ref name="Parrenas, Rhacel 2005"/&gt;  Cases have shown that many of the mothers transfer their physical love onto the children that they nanny.

[[Power (social and political)|Power]] shifts among Third World families when the mother leaves the country to find enhanced and better paying work.  The breadwinner holds the power within the family unit because they are the one that provides the family with (the most) monetary [[assets]].  The reason mothers of Third World countries are leaving their homes is due to the lack of well-paying jobs within their country—not only for women, but for men as well.

It is easier for mothers to move to First World countries to find work due to the increase in the need of child care and household work.  These jobs that the mothers are searching for are very well paid—much better than any job in Third World countries.  The women are leaving home, working at well-paid jobs, sending their wages back to their families in the Third World countries in the form of remittances, therefore becoming the member of the family that holds the most power—the power that is traditionally seen as masculine power, and the highest power (based on [[cultural]] [[ideology]]) being held by the 'man' in the family.

Most fathers lose their masculine power and the children can gain more power if more responsibility is placed on them in the nonappearance of their mothers.  The family should theoretically gain more power within their respected community due to the increase in wage earnings and newfound wealth due to the remittances sent by the mother—power in the sense of moving up of the [[social stratification]] &lt;ref&gt;Walkerdine, Valerie.

The families that outsource child care and home work are in [[Power (social and political)|power]] of their hired nanny.  Those that pay for a service hold most of the power in the [[Workplace relationships|employee-employer relationship]].  The mothers and fathers have power over the nanny's day-to-day schedule, along with her employment and pay (Zdravomyslova, 218).  The employers determine if the nanny is suitable for the job and if she can be trusted to occupy a place in their house and oversee the care of their child and house.  They are allowed to set up cameras inside the house in order to watch the nanny's actions and the care their child is receiving.

Employers can also be in communication with their nanny at any time during the day, allocating jobs for the nanny to do.&lt;ref name="Zdravomyslova, Elena 2010"&gt;Zdravomyslova, Elena. "Working Mothers and Nannies: Commercialization of Childcare and Modifications in the Gender Contract (A Sociological Essay)." Anthropology of East Europe Review [Online], 28.2 (2010): 200-225. Web. 7 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The employers decide when the nanny works and does not work, the labor that the nanny is responsible for, when the nanny is allowed to return home, and the overall stability of the nanny's job.  Power is defined as control over the one that is hired in the sense of the employer-employee relationship between parents and their nannies &lt;ref name="Zdravomyslova, Elena 2010"/&gt;

All nannies hold power in the employee-employer relationship.  The nanny is in control of the child and its health and security, and she is the manager of the household while the employers are away.  This allows the nanny to have say in the [[Contractual term|conditions]] of her [[contract]] with the family.&lt;ref name="Zdravomyslova, Elena 2010"/&gt;  Most nannies and the children under their care, after time, create bonds and become attached to one another.  Some nannies use this attachment against the parents if their employment is at stake―parents not wanting to take away a stable relationship from their child, limiting the risk of [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]] present in the child, and the feeling of guilt felt by the parents.&lt;ref&gt;Baquedano-López, Patricia, Ph.D. "A Stop at the End of the Bus Line: Nannies, Children, and the Language of Care."

==Manufacturing workers==

===Women in China (aka rural to urban migration)===
Young Chinese girls are sent to cities to work in factories, where they work for low wages, and often go unpaid for a large length of time.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/chinablue/film.html|title= dir. China Blue|author=Peled, Micah|year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary [[China Blue]] provides insight into the treatment of these young Chinese women and the conditions under which they live.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; Many of the laborers are migrant workers that travel from the countryside to the city to find work, and as seen in China Blue, these workers are often underpaid, and face strict regulations in the city. The city provides legislation and/or policies stating that the factories must house them. By having dormitories onsite, the factory works like a small city. It provides food and shelter, and because the factory controls every part of the laborer's life, laborers can be forced to work late, and can be penalized for bad behavior, or not meeting their quotas.

According to Ngai, the dormitory system is also stressful on these migrant workers as it removes them from their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ngai, Pun|year=2007|title=Gendering the dormitory labor system: production, reproduction, and migrant labor in south China|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545700701439465#.UkAb94ZTAhE|journal=Feminist Economics|volume= 13|issue=3|pages=239–258|doi=10.1080/13545700701439465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isolation and maltreatment in the form of cheap labor is how [[China]] competes globally. China forces its workers to work long hours, subsidizes their living expenses, while keeping their wages low.

===Burmese in Thailand===
Ruth Pearson discusses the millions of [[Women in Burma|Burmese women]] who migrate to [[Thailand]] each year. These women almost entirely make up the agricultural and manufacturing workforce.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Burmese who migrate are typically undocumented, and there is very little regulation of the migration. The workers, more than half of which are women, are considered disposable, and face aggression from the Thai government and police force. The Thai manufacturing and agricultural businesses are far more dependent upon the Burmese migrants due to their low pay, and the amount of work that they can demand from them.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Pearson, Ruth; Kusakabe, Kyoko. ''Thailand's Hidden Workforce : Burmese Migrant Women Factory Workers.'' London: Zed Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''Migration within Africa''' ===
There has been an increase of female migration within [[Africa]]. Due to all the harsh conditions Africa withstands such as starvation, poverty, and disease, these have been some of the reasons to increase the need for work. In Africa there has also been in increase in high male unemployment, which has been a factor in the increase of women working more. &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caritas.org/includes/pdf/backgroundmigration.pdf|title=The Female Face of Migration|last=|first=|date=2009|website=Caritas Internationalis|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since women are working more and have become the main providers for their families, they go wherever there is work. They don't always go out of the country for work, sometimes they tend to [[Human migration|migrate]] within their country. The work that constantly has them moving from region to region is the agriculture and mineral deposits. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/international-migration-africa-analysis-based-estimates-migrant-stock|title=International Migration in Africa: An Analysis Based on Estimates of the Migrant Stock|last=Zlotnik|first=Hania|date=2004-09-01|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2018-03-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is work within their own country there are others that will migrate outside their region. Some places they migrate to are, but not limited to, areas in [[North America]] or even [[Europe]]. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; There are many jobs outside their country that they hear about that they are willing to travel to. A reason that has attracted African migrant workers to places outside their country is the demand for domestic work. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;   

==Care workers==
The most common work found by women migrant workers is in domestic care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In Spain, 70% of all women migrants find jobs in this sector.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The increase in women migrants from Latin America is illustrated by the fact that 70% of Brazilian and Dominican migrant workers going to Spain in 2001 were women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Domestic workers are employed by private households as nannies to care for the elderly or sick family members, or as maids that provide household services. The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) estimates that care workers are 8% more prevalent in developing countries than developed countries.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/2011/05/gender-and-migration-care-workers-at-the-interface-of-migration-and-development/|title=Gender and migration: Care Workers at the Interface of Migration and Development|author=Bachelet, Michelle|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these positions require that women remain with the families that hire them, which makes exploitation and abuse highly likely in these situations, given that the work is often unregulated, and there is no real way to track payment or living conditions. Furthering the issue, some of these care workers are illegally living in the United States and are undocumented.

De Parle shows through anecdote that a man from [[Manila]] was gone for twenty years to provide for his family.&lt;ref name="Parle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://duygukorhan.com/articles/deparle.pdf|title=A Good Provider is One Who Leaves|author=de Parle, Jason|pages=50–74. New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; This man's family followed his example, and all five of his children became migrant workers. Migrant workers make about 10 times the amount of domestic wages. There is often a dramatic need that motivates these workers to move abroad. 1 in every 7 Filipinos is a migrant worker, and migrant workers are viewed as heroes as a result of their willingness to leave their families and send remittances from their pay. However, these remittances do not cover the social costs and familial costs that these workers face. For example, many children don’t recognize their parents, and grow up not knowing their closest family members. Though there are some protections for families, there is still the propensity for remittances and migrant work to have more of a negative impact on family dynamics. Though situations for children in terms of growth have improved, money is still not a replacement for their parent(s).

==Emigration from Sri Lanka==
It has become more common for women from Sri Lanka to immigrate to the Middle East to work as domestic servants. This migration forces those in the villages of Sri Lanka to create new gender [[norm (social)|norm]]s and [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, going against cultural [[ideology]].

A few men reluctantly take over the work of women in their absence, and when possible, pawn this work off to female relatives. Reconstruction of gender roles occurs, creating uncomfortable situations for the men of the communities.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt;  Men have the chance to take on different roles of which they themselves choose:
* Drinking in order to maintain a masculine identity and showcase wealth
* Find work
* Take on the work of the women

In Sri Lankan communities drinking of alcohol is seen as a masculine activity. Unemployed and underemployed men take to drinking in order to still be seen as masculine and to protect their identities within the social sphere of the community. Drinking is also a sign of wealth. Creation of male groups comes out of drinking—a group of men that wish to still be seen as masculine and instead show laziness and unwillingness to provide. Men that drink spend much of their wives' remittances, making her migration of little use financially to their families.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt; Some men find work of their own in, and outside, of the communities. These men do not give up their entire [[role]] of breadwinner; yet earn less than their migrant wives. This man is still seen as taking on a masculine role and is still considered a 'man'.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt;

Very few men take on the work of the women by taking care of the house, the preparation of food, and the care of their children. These men are looked down upon as 'not-men', therefore making them look as 'women'.  This work comes with the loss of the prestige of being a 'man' and doing 'men's work'.  This job is not paid and the men that do this job are not breadwinners. These men are taking on responsibility, unlike those that drink and do not work and only spend remittance money. However, they are seen as 'not-men' by others within the community. With the ability to be humbled and take on responsibility in order to provide, in other ways than the earning of money, these men are still looked down upon as [[Failure|failing]] to be a 'man'.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt;

==Migration within East Asia==
Since the 1970s, the economic growth in [[East Asia]] has spurred workers to migrate from low-income Southeast Asian countries, like the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], to wealthier, but typically more crowded locations, like [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]], in search of employment.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt; As a result of [[globalization]], women are migrating in large numbers and entering the domestic field of work, a phenomenon which scholars refer to as "the global nanny chain" or "the international division of reproductive labor".&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt;

[[File:Girl in Muyuan in Jiangxi.jpg|thumb|A woman from one of China's rural areas]]
Economic growth in China in particular has led many women from the rural areas of China to migrate to urban areas in search of employment.&lt;ref name=":1b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=Canfei|last2=Gober|first2=Patricia|year=2003|title=Gendering Interprovincial Migration in China|journal=International Migration Review|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1220–1251}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women want to be a part of the push for the modernization of China,&lt;ref name=":2b"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Out to Work|last=Gaetano|first=Arianne|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=2015|location=United States of America|pages=28–45|quote=|via=Open Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving behind the traditional practices of their rural families in favor of a chance to be a part of the modern age. This motivation, as well as the sense of duty they feel to help provide for their parents, is one of the most commonly cited reasons rural women decide to migrate to bigger cities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In order to find jobs in China's bigger cities, like Shanghai, they rely on [[social network]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By connecting with family members or other villagers who have already left for the city, a wide range of jobs are available.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rural women take up a wide variety of jobs, from [[Domestic worker|domestic]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and factory work to owning their own businesses&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=AsiaFoundation|title=Empowering Migrant Women as Entrepreneurs in China|date=2015-09-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tIJU3rQFA4|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to working as hostesses in China's popular [[Host and hostess clubs|karaoke bars]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These women usually spend their income on education for themselves or family members, sending any leftover money to the rest of the family that remains in the village.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Not all migrant workers come from poorer regions, however. In the Philippines, for example, workers often come from more economically [[developed]] regions.&lt;ref name="Lan" /&gt; [[Thailand]] has seen an increase in the migration of women from higher classes as well. Once practiced exclusively by the wealthy elite, the 1960s marked a time when [[middle-class]] [[Sino-Thai]] families began to increasingly send daughters overseas in pursuit of [[higher education]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[[Ara Wilson|Wilson, Ara]].

==Consequences and aid==
Cheng states that there is an isolation of women who work abroad even within their own social circles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This discourages support systems, and often puts these women in heightened vulnerable positions, placing more dependency on the family structure and household where they are employed. The first year's wages are used to secure their place in their new job, and from then onward the isolation in the household keeps the women obedient.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cheng, SJ|year=1996|title= Migrant Women domestic workers in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan: a comparative analysis|journal=Asian Pac Migr J|volume=5 |issue=1|pages=139–152|pmid=12291761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors Tonya Basok and Nicola Piper discuss the global governance of international migration efforts undertaken by the non-governmental organizations trying to protect the rights of Latin Americans and those from the [[Caribbean]], moving to Europe.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They argue that although the management of trafficking the women to and from their country of origin has improved, the management of labor rights abroad is difficult due to the lack of rights promotions as opposed to management efforts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Basok, Tonya |author2=Nicola Piper |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012|title=Management Versus Rights: Women's Migration and Global Governance in Latin America and the Caribbean|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545701.2012.690525#.UkAePIZTAhE|journal= Feminist Economics|volume=18|issue=2|pages= 35–61|doi=10.1080/13545701.2012.690525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who leave their homes in search of work abroad often leave their duties to another member of the family, or even their children. It is often female children or another woman who assume responsibility for maternal duties, thereby further strengthening a gendered role of domestic work, and perpetuating traditional [[gender role]]s.

[[United Nations Development Fund for Women|UNIFEM]] (now UN Women) is a branch of the [[United Nations]] dedicated to the support and defense of women workers. As the advent of migrant work has become more prevalent among women, UNIFEM has had to help keep their rights protected. This includes establishing a human rights standard, timely payment, rest days, medical care, and housing investigation. UNIFEM has promoted several laws similar to the law on the Protection of Migrant Women in [[Indonesia]]. Their goal is to make a universal code of ethics and treatment for all those engaging in migration for work or other reasons.&lt;ref name="unifem.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unifem.org/gender_issues/women_poverty_economics/women_migrant_workers.html|title=Women migrant Workers|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219051632/http://www.unifem.org/gender_issues/women_poverty_economics/women_migrant_workers.html|archivedate=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender protections in migrant work have become a necessity, given the exploitation of migrant women and the propensity of [[sex trafficking]] once they arrive in their destination country. As many women in these positions are either involved in the sex trade or domestic care, they are prone to abuse.

===Remittances===
Economically, women enter the market to help support their family and their home in their native country. Women migrant laborers are often only skilled to work in factory or care work positions. The effect these migrant workers have on domestic and foreign economies varies, and there is too little data to make any conclusive argument regarding economic impact. However, impact can be seen through continued globalization, monetary exchange, and remittances by women.&lt;ref name="unwomen-eseasia.org"/&gt; "Remittances have had significant macro economic effects in several countries of origin in coping with trade deficits, reducing pressure on local currency, reducing external debt, etc." This means that a major source of capital for developing countries are the wages earned and sent home by these women.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; "Formal remittance transfers of some $150 billion were reported in 2004. Possibly twice this amount was transferred informally. These financial transfers are growing in significance. In many countries, they are larger than either development assistance or foreign direct investment."

Rosewarne argues that the lack of temporary migrant laws is a hindrance to the continual flow of remittances.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As well as the families that receive them, countries' GDPs are becoming dependent on the flow of these remittances. However, there are various limitations. Women traditionally have a more difficult time finding temporary employment due to their lack of education and job availability, as well as laws to support them abroad.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rosewarne, Stuart|year=2012|title=Temporary International Labor Migration and Development in South and Southeast Asia|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545701.2012.696314#.UkAeyoZTAhE|journal= Feminist Economics|volume= 18|issue=2|pages=63–90|doi=10.1080/13545701.2012.696314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing gender roles===
Throughout history, women have taken on the role of a caregiver, someone who stays at home to care for the children while maintaining housework. This role while still popular among many households, has begun to change across the globe as women are taking on more male positions in the home and workforce.This change in roles has been incredibly difficult for women. They have needed to adapt to a more male physical appearance and take on the characteristics of the opposite sex, as to be taken seriously in the workforce. This change in the appearance and attitude of women has caused a shift in the way women present themselves both at work and at home. Although recently, women have chosen to adopt an assertive lifestyle rather than taking on the appearance of males in attempt to keep their femininity while maintaining seriousness in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bodylanguageexpert.co.uk/changinggenderroles.html|title=Changing Gender Roles|website=www.bodylanguageexpert.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women migrate in order to escape oppressive gender roles, leaving their home and obtaining increased economic independence and freedom, which challenge traditional gender roles. This can strengthen a woman's position in the family by improving her relative bargaining position. Women have more leverage in controlling the household because they have control over a degree of economic assets, depending on their economic situation. Gender roles often follow women from their rural or domestic environment to the labor they are allowed to participate in. It can have a stratifying effect on their work and social life. Jie-Yu Lui states that social roles follow migrant workers in their new environments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is a strong connection between a woman's role in her rural life to her new life in an urban city or foreign country. Women accept the treatment they receive because it is normalized by their traditional and domestic roles, e.g. their roles at home as homemaker and houseworker.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Liu, Jie-yu|year= 2007|title=Gender Dynamics and Redundancy in Urban China|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545700701445322#.UkAe24ZTAhE|journal= Feminist Economics|volume= 13|issue=3-4|pages=125–158|doi=10.1080/13545700701445322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beneria says that gender roles are ever-changing as women from Latin America are leaving their families there, and moving to be domestic care workers in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=WMW/&gt; Europeans create demand as they are focused on providing income, and have to balance their domestic duties with their market work. She uses the argument that a woman's choice to leave and provide remittances for her family initiates a role reversal for the family as a whole, in addition to a new gender category. Given that most migrant workers work in the care field, their traditional familial role is reinforced. Their absence from their homes may elicit resentful feelings from their children, but this is dependent on the presence of family. She closes by saying that the reconciliation policy is affected by the availability of migrant care workers who help balance the domestic and market work in more developed countries. If there are solutions that don't require policy changes, governments are prone to use these examples as reasons against such policy change. Additionally, there is a risk for infidelity abroad, which also erodes the family structure.&lt;ref name="Parle" /&gt;

===Extortion and abuse experienced by migrant workers===
Mistreatment of women migrant workers is primarily due to the fact that they tend to seek employment in the informal sector, and are therefore either not covered or partially covered by the labor legislation, social security, and welfare provisions of the host country.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2008|title=Women and men migrant workers: Moving towards equal rights and opportunities|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---gender/documents/publication/wcms_101118.pdf|journal=International Labour Organization (ILO)|volume=|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation of women migrant workers is less identifiable than exploitation of male migrant workers because exploitation occurs at a premature stage of the migration process or in situations with weak labor inspection services.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Examples of maltreatment include: not getting paid, restricted movement, removal of personal identity documents, long shifts, working for a whole week without days-off, sexual exploitation, and poor living conditions with inadequate food, water, and accommodation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Women migrant workers are often mistreated and isolated by their employers, particularly in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Domestic workers experience this isolation, and become dependent upon their employers. They can be physically as well as psychologically abused.

===Care work deficit in country of origin===
With the trend of women migrant labor, the absence of women, mothers in particular, leaves a deficit in family life. When women leave to provide for their families, the role of mother or caretaker is left to the other female family members. These can be the eldest daughter, aunts, or even further extended family members. These kin help with domestic duties and child-rearing for the parent(s) abroad, but the absence of the parents sparks a trend and cycle within the family.

Children's education falters due to a lack of supervision and parental support. "Despite parents' effort of remaining in touch via telephone, contact may be irregular and sometimes falls short of meaningful exchange between parent and child."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Suarez-Orozco, C.|author2=Todorova, I.|author3=Louie, J|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|title= Making up for lost time: The experience of separation and reunification among immigrant families|journal= Family Process|volume= 41|pages=625–643|pmid=12613121|issue=4|doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.2002.00625.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reunion of these families leaves children isolated from their parents, and makes the women strangers to their children.
