'''''A Checklist of Painters from c1200-1994''''' is the second edition of a book first published in 1978 by the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]]. It contains a list of names of painters, draughtsmen and engravers that are indexed in The Witt Library, named after the art historian [[Robert Witt (art historian)|Sir Robert Witt]], who bequeathed his library to the Courtauld Institute in 1952.

The purpose of the book is to provide a list of [[metadata]] on prominent painters, striving in each case to provide a common spelling for the name, nationality, and birth and death dates for Western artists from the early thirteenth century to the present. In the first version, the "present" was defined as 1976 and the list was 40,000 names long, encompassing 337 pages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/library/127789 A checklist of painters c.1200-1976] represented in the Witt Library, Courtauld Institute of Art, first edition, London, 1978 {{ISBN|0720107180}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second edition corrects mistakes made in the first edition, and lists 66,000 names collected up to 1994 and is 557 pages long.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/library/10790 A checklist of painters c.1200-1994] represented in the Witt Library, Courtauld Institute of Art, second edition, London, 1995 {{ISBN|0720121787}}&lt;/ref&gt; After publication of the second list, the Witt Library continued to collect photographic material on paintings, drawings and engravings and contains over two million reproductions of works by over 70,000 artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/research/photographic/witt/index.shtml Image Libraries: Witt Library] on The Courtauld Institute of Art website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anagnorisis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|ɡ|ˈ|n|ɒr|ᵻ|s|ᵻ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἀναγνώρισις}}) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. Anagnorisis originally meant [[Recall (memory)|recognition]] in its Greek context, not only of a person but also of what that person stood for. Anagnorisis was the [[hero]]'s sudden awareness of a real situation, the realisation of things as they stood, and finally, the hero's insight into a relationship with an often [[antagonist]]ic [[fictional character|character]] in [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], "Myth, Fiction, And Displacement" p 25 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tragedy==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', as part of his discussion of [[peripeteia]], Aristotle defined anagnorisis as "a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune" (1452a). It is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[catharsis]].

[[File:Lear and Cordelia.jpg|right|thumb|"Lear and Cordelia" by [[Ford Madox Brown]]:  Lear, driven out by his older daughters and rescued by his youngest, realizes their true characters.]]
In the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] definition of tragedy, it was the discovery of one's own identity or true character (e.g. Cordelia, Edgar, Edmund, etc. in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'') or of someone else's identity or true nature (e.g. Lear's children, Gloucester's children) by the tragic hero.  

Aristotle was the first writer to discuss the uses of anagnorisis, with peripeteia caused by it. He considered it the mark of a superior tragedy, as when [[Oedipus]] killed his father and married his mother in ignorance, and later learned the truth, or when [[Iphigeneia in Tauris]] realizes in time that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, and refrains from sacrificing them.  Aristotle considered these complex plots superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when [[Medea]] resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so.

Another prominent example of anagnorisis in tragedy is in [[Aeschylus]]'s "The Choephoroi" ("[[Libation Bearers]]") when [[Electra]] recognizes her brother, [[Orestes]], after he has returned to [[Argos]] from his exile, at the grave of their father, [[Agamemnon]], who had been murdered at the hands of [[Clytemnestra]], their mother. [[Electra]] convinces herself that Orestes is her brother with three pieces of evidence: a lock of Orestes's hair on the grave, his footprints next to the grave, and a piece of weaving which she embroidered herself.  The footprints and the hair are identical to her own. Electra's awareness is of her brother's presence, who is the one person who can help her by avenging the death of their father.&lt;ref&gt;
Aeschylus, and Robert Lowell. The Oresteia of Aeschylus. New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy==
[[File:Robson Crane Comedy of Errors.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for a performance of ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'':  When the twins, confused with each other throughout the play, recognize each other's existence, the play reaches its happy ending.]]
The section of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' dealing with comedy did not survive, but many critics also discuss recognition in comedies.  A standard plot of the [[New Comedy]] was the final revelation, by birth tokens, that the heroine was of respectable birth and so suitable for the hero to marry. This was often brought about by the machinations of the [[tricky slave]].  This plot appears in Shakespeare's ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', where a recognition scene in the final act reveals that Perdita is a king's daughter rather than a shepherdess, and so suitable for her prince lover.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, "Recognition in ''The Winter's Tale''" p 108-9 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and modern usage==
===Mystery===
The earliest use of anagnorisis in a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a classical ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the device is employed to great effect in its [[twist ending]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Tale of the Three Apples]]&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist of the story, [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]], is ordered by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to find the culprit behind a murder mystery within three days or else be executed. It is only after the deadline has passed, and as he prepares to be executed, that he discovers that the culprit was his own slave all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern usage===
Anagnorisis, however, is not limited to classical or Elizabethan sources. Author and lecturer Ivan Pintor Iranzo points out that contemporary ''auteur'' [[M. Night Shyamalan]] uses similar revelations in ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', in which child psychologist Malcolm Crowe successfully treats a child who is having visions of dead people, only to realize at the close of the film that Crowe himself is dead, as well as in ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', in which the character of David realizes that he survived a train crash that killed the other passengers, due to a supernatural power.&lt;ref name="formats"&gt;Ivan Pintor Iranzo. [http://www.upf.edu/materials/depeca/formats/arti6_ing.htm The naked and the dead. The Representation of the dead and the construction of the other in contemporary cinema: The case of M. Night Shyamalan], No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Another well known example of anagnorisis from popular culture is the revelation that [[Darth Vader]] is the father of [[Luke Skywalker]] in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. An extensive account of the history and application of anagnorisis is provided by Terence Cave in his book ''Recognitions''.&lt;ref&gt;''Recognitions: A Study in Poetics''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

A humorous definition is included in 'The Banner: mock-heroic verse epic, Part 1: Sid' by Robin Gordon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In any moment of such crisis / 
one thinks, of course, of those devices / 
which Aristotle said were needed / 
in any poem.  We have heeded / 
Aristotle, and our plot, / 
(beginning, middle, end), has got / 
complications too, and error / 
fit to rouse cathartic terror, / 
protagonists, antagonists, / 
peripiteia, turns and twists. / 
The poet's comments form the choruses, / 
but now it's time for anagnorisis. / 
When Oedipus sees the bird he's bedded / 
is his own father's lawful wedded / 
wife, in fact she is his mother, / 
or Iphigenia finds her brother, / 
Discovery or Recognition / 
brings the plot to its fruition.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Winners 2007/2008==
In 2007/2008 the final was held at [[Queen Elizabeth II Law Courts, Liverpool]] on Saturday 1 March 2008.  The sixteen Regional Heat winners from across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland competed in three preliminary rounds in order to determine the top two finalist teams that would progress onto the Grand Final.

Queen Elizabeth's Community College, [[Crediton]] (winners of the Plymouth Regional Heat) and Whitley Bay High School (winners of the Newcastle Regional Heat) were announced as the two finalists.

In the Grand Final the teams presented the case of Jordan Potter before a panel of five judges and senior counsel from across the UK: HHJ Clifton, HHJ Harris QC, Brian Kennedy QC, [[Herbert Kerrigan]] QC and HHJ Roddy.

Whitley Bay High School were declared national champions.  HHJ Clifton praised both teams on the high standard of their performances, noting the dramatic flair of the witnesses and the quality of all four barristers.

The new national champions received their trophy and prizes from the judges.

==Winners 2006/2007==
A total of 158 schools had taken part in the Competition since heats began in November the previous year.

Lumen Christi College was the winner of the 2006/2007 competition. The Lumen Christi student who played the role of a barrister said: "The opportunity to work with real barristers and prepare a case has been a great experience. It gave us a real insight into how the justice system works"{{cite this quote|date=December 2013}} Her teacher added: "I was impressed by how a number of shy students flourished and came out of their shells by taking part in the competition and the level of articulation and analytical skills was heartening to see. The actual day in court showed me how readily students rose to the challenge of such a pressurised setting. Their confidence shone through. The school was enlivened by our victory and the level of support has been fantastic."{{cite this quote|date=December 2013}}

In 2004, Tek began collecting artworks, amassing a collection of over 1,500 pieces, the Yuz Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artreview.com/power_100/budi_tek/|title=Budi Tek / Power 100 / ArtReview|last=name|first=Site|website=artreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Invited by London's [[Tate]] to sit on its Asia Pacific Acquisitions Committee to raise awareness of Asia Pacific arts, Tek expanded the scope of his interests beyond Asian art to include Western art, acquiring works by artists such as [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Anselm Kiefer]] and [[Adel Abdessemed]] to his collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artcollector.net.au/RemarkablecollectorsphilanthropistsBudiTek|title=Remarkable collectors &amp; philanthropists: Budi Tek - Art Collector|website=www.artcollector.net.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has made a name for collecting large and difficult to display 'mega art' works, including a tigerskin made of 600,000 cigarettes, a high pressure fire hose which whips around in a purpose-built room,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ocula.com/magazine/conversations/budi-tek/|title=Budi Tek in Conversation {{!}} Ocula|date=2018-11-25|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Random International]]'s ''[[Rain Room]]'', a computer-controlled indoor rain shower which remains dry around visitors walking through the deluge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peninsula.com/en/shanghai/our-city/pencities/content-calendar/everything-or-nothing|title=Everything or Nothing {{!}} The Peninsula Shanghai|website=www.peninsula.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 he announced plans to house the Yuz Collection in [[Bali]], including a super-sized 150-metre square version of ''Rain Room'', but the plan was shelved due to his ill health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/budi-tek-presses-china-to-make-his-yuz-museum-public|title=Budi Tek presses China to make his Yuz Museum public|website=www.theartnewspaper.com|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yuz Foundation ==
Tek founded the Yuz Foundation in 2007. It is the umbrella organization of the Yuz Collection and the Yuz Museum. The Yuz Museum was established in Jakarta&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/arts/16iht-rartjessop16.html|title=Chinese-Indonesian Collector Makes Up for Lost Time|last=Kolesnikov-Jessop|first=Sonia|date=15 March 2012|work=New York Times|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed by Shanghai, which opened in May 2014, is a non-profit museum of contemporary art, located in the core area of Shanghai West Bund. The museum was launched with the aim of establishing itself as a new landmark for exhibiting contemporary Chinese art and to be a preeminent contemporary art museum in the world. Since its opening, it has staged exhibitions by [[Yang Fudong]], Huang Yuxing, Liu Shiyuan, Random International, [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Alberto Giacometti]] since its opening in May 2014.

Designed by Japanese Architect [[Sou Fujimoto]] and built on the old site of the aircraft hangar of the former [[Shanghai Longhua Airport|Long Hua Airport]], the museum boasts a total area of 9,000 square meters, among which the hangar-converted great hall alone covers over 3,000 square meters, complementing the numerous large-scale art installations, while the other galleries offer more than 1,000 square meters for paintings, sculptures and photography of contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yuzmshanghai.org/about-yuz-foundationyuz-museum-and-the-founder-budi-tek/|title=About Yuz Foundation/Yuz Museum and the founder Budi Tek - Yuz Museum Shanghai|work=Yuz Museum Shanghai|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Tek was voted eighth on [[Art+Auction|Art&amp;Auction]]’s list of the top 10 most influential figures in the art world. He was also listed by ''[[Business Insider]]'' as one of the 12 most influential art collectors in the world in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/most-powerful-art-collectors-2011-12#budi-tek-9|title=Now Meet The 12 Most Powerful Art Collectors In The World|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013 he was conferred the [[Legion of Honour|French Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artasiapacific.com/Blog/LegaciesProfileOfBudiTek|title=ArtAsiaPacific: Legacies Profile Of Budi Tek|website=artasiapacific.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joint foundation with LACMA ==
Tek compared his 2018 partnership with LACMA, two years in the making, to a marriage. The move will see most of the Yuz Collection donated to a new, jointly-owned foundation. The [[University of Chicago]] art history professor Wu Hung will oversee the programme as consulting artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/budi-tek-reveals-landmark-deal-with-lacma-to-preserve-his-collection|title=Budi Tek reveals landmark deal with Lacma to preserve his collection|website=www.theartnewspaper.com|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move will significantly expand LACMA's holding of contemporary Chinese art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2018/03/28/lacma-yuz-museum-will-partner-exhibitions-programming/|title=In Historic U.S.-China Partnership, Budi Tek’s Shanghai-Based Yuz Museum Will Partner With LACMA|last=Binlot|first=Ann|date=2018-03-28|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed attempts by Tek to convince the Chinese government to establish a special status for the Yuz Museum, which would have created a China-based NGO.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/budi-tek-presses-china-to-make-his-yuz-museum-public|title=Budi Tek presses China to make his Yuz Museum public|website=www.theartnewspaper.com|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Announcing the foundation, speaking remotely to an audience in Hong Kong, Tek spoke of his desire to establish his legacy: "For the last two years, not only, I used to say that was always on my mind—the second thing on my mind—is always how my legacy will be preserved for the benefit of the world [and] the glory of my God, because I am a Christian. So, this is the second thing that I need to do in my life, actually."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://museumnetwork.sothebys.com/en/articles/museum-directors-discuss-the-future-of-museums|title=Museum Directors Discuss the Future of Museums|date=2018-04-23|work=Museum Network|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Aztecs]], the '''Cihuacalli''' was the name given to those controlled buildings where [[prostitution]] was permitted by political and religious authorities.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} "Cihuacalli" is a [[Nahuatl]] word which means "House of Women".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The Cihuacalli was a closed compound with rooms, all of which were looking into a central patio. At the center of the patio was a statue of [[Tlazolteotl]], the goddess of "filth".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Religious authorities believed women should work as prostitutes, if they wish, only at such premises guarded by Tlazolteotl. It was believed Tlazolteotl had the power to incite [[sexual activity]] and, at the same time, do spiritual cleansing of such acts.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

There are stories that also refer to certain places, either inside the Cihuacalli or outside, where women would perform [[erotic dance]]s in front of men.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The poet [[Tlaltecatzin of Cuauhchinanco]] noted that special "Joyful Women" would perform erotic dances at certain homes outside of the compound.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

[[File:52-aspetti di vita quotidiana, amore,Taccuino Sanitatis, Cas.jpg|thumb|240px|Illustration from ''[[Tacuinum Sanitatis]]'', a medieval handbook on wellness.]]
In many traditions and statutes of civil or religious law, the '''consummation of a marriage''', often called simply ''consummation'', is the first (or first officially credited) act of [[sexual intercourse]] between two people, either following their [[marriage]] to each other or after a prolonged romantic attraction. The definition of consummation usually refers to penile-vaginal sexual penetration, but some religious doctrines hold that there is an additional requirement that there must ''not'' be any [[contraception]] used.&lt;ref name="pcd"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hardon, S.J. | first=John | authorlink=John Hardon | isbn=0-385-23238-1 | title=Pocket Catholic Dictionary | page=91 | publisher=Image Books | contribution=Consummated Marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious, cultural, or legal significance of consummation may arise from theories of marriage as having the purpose of producing legally recognized descendants of the partners, or of providing sanction to their sexual acts together, or both, and its absence may amount to treating a marriage ''ceremony'' as falling short of ''completing'' the state of being married, or as creating a marriage which may later be repudiated. Thus in some legal systems a marriage may be [[annulled]] if it has not been consummated. Consummation is also relevant in the case of a [[common law marriage]]. The importance of consummation has led to the development of various [[bedding ritual]]s.

In addition to these formal and literal usages, the term also exists in informal and less precise usage to refer to a sexual landmark in relationships of varying intensity and duration.

==Legislation==

===Civil marriage===

The relevance of consummation in a [[civil marriage]] varies by jurisdiction. For example, under section 12 of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]], a refusal or inability to consummate a marriage is a ground of [[Annulment#Annulment in England and Wales|annulment in England and Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18?view=extent#section-12 Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (c. 18), s. 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511201916/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18?view=extent |date=2018-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this only applies to heterosexual marriage, because Paragraph 4 of schedule 4 of the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]] specifically excludes non-consummation as a ground for the annulment of a [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/30/schedule/4/paragraph/4|title=Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315132422/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/30/schedule/4/paragraph/4|archivedate=2016-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[common law]] jurisdictions, such as [[Australia]], have abolished the legal concept of consummation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Publications/Family+Court+of+Australia+publications/FCOA_Applying_decree_nullity |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527114938/http://familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Publications/Family+Court+of+Australia+publications/FCOA_Applying_decree_nullity |archivedate=2015-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Note''': in Australia non-consummation as ground of annulment was abolished in 1975; see Dickey, A. (2007) ''Family Law'' (5th Ed) Also in 1975, Australia introduced no-fault divorce, so specific grounds of divorce such as adultery, cruelty, desertion, have all been abolished.{{cite web |url=http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Family+Law+Principles/No+fault+divorce/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316232908/http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Family+Law+Principles/No+fault+divorce/ |archivedate=2015-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law marriage===

{{Main article|Common-law marriage|Common-law marriage in the United States}}
In this case, usually, consummation, as well as cohabitation, are important, they are needed - together with the presentation of the parties to society as spouses - in order to create the marriage itself.

===Religious marriage===

A religious marriage without civil registration may or may not be legally binding. However, in some (mostly [[Muslim]]-majority) countries such as Israel, Egypt, Syria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = UNHCR | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,464db4f52,465161be2,3ae6ad796b,0.html | title = Syria: Social repercussions of a marriage between a male Druze and a Muslim woman | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121019190012/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,464db4f52,465161be2,3ae6ad796b,0.html | archivedate = 2012-10-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html |title=Marriage in Jordan |publisher=Jordan embassy |place=USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006030656/http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; UAE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.dubaifaqs.com/marriage-in-dubai.php | title = Marriage and weddings | publisher = Dubai, UAE FAQs | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110903010415/http://www.dubaifaqs.com/marriage-in-dubai.php | archivedate = 2011-09-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Libya, Mauritania and Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://bccvisalaw.com/marriage/marriage_in_indonesia.php | title = Marriage in Indonesia | publisher = BCC Visa Law | deadurl = no | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110920040604/http://bccvisalaw.com/marriage/marriage_in_indonesia.php | archivedate = 2011-09-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  religious marriage is the only legally binding marriage.

Consummation is in particular relevant in a [[Marriage in  the Catholic Church|Catholic marriage]]. Within the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]], if a matrimonial celebration takes place (ratification) but the spouses have not yet engaged in intercourse (consummation), then the marriage is said to be a marriage ''[[ratum sed non consummatum]]''. Such a marriage, regardless of the reason for non-consummation, can be dissolved by the [[pope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P6R.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105060902/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P6R.HTM|archivedate=2007-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an inability or an intentional refusal to consummate the marriage is probable grounds for an [[Declaration of nullity|annulment]]. [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] defines a marriage as consummated when the "spouses have performed between themselves in a human fashion a conjugal act which is suitable in itself for the procreation of offspring, to which marriage is ordered by its nature and by which the spouses become one flesh."&lt;ref&gt;canon 1061 §1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus some theologians, such as [[John Hardon|Fr. John A. Hardon, S.J.]], state that intercourse with [[contraception]] does not consummate a marriage.&lt;ref name="pcd"/&gt;

==Traditions==
Traditionally, in many cultures, for example in Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures (where Islam and Hinduism is followed and sex before marriage is not allowed), consummation was an important act because it was the act which proved the bride's [[virginity]]; the presence of blood was erroneously taken as definitive confirmation that the woman was indeed a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;''Marriage Customs of the World: From Henna to Honeymoons'', by George Monger, pp 82-84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In the [[family law]] defining [[civil marriage]] in some jurisdictions, particularly those where the civil [[marriage law]]s remain influenced by [[religion]] (albeit they are officially secular) non-consummation of a marriage may be a ground for [[annulment]] (an annulment is different from a [[divorce]] because it usually acts retrospectively). This stipulation has been in recent years heavily criticized on a wide variety of grounds, ranging from the mixing of religious doctrine into secular law, to being degrading to women given its negative historical connotations of ownership of the wife.&lt;ref name="Family Law pp. 96-99"&gt;''Family Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'', by Sonia Harris-Short, Joanna Miles, pp. 96-99&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the purpose of this ground is not clear: it is neither procreation (the act need not end in pregnancy, and neither is there a need of the ''possibility'' of it, given the fact the consummation is legally valid even if one or both parties is sterile), neither is it the expectation of sexual satisfaction in marriage (one single act of sexual intercourse is sufficient, even if the spouse following the consummation says he/she will never again engage in intercourse).&lt;ref&gt;''Body Lore and Laws Essays on Law and the Human Body'', edited by: Andrew Bainham, Shelley Day Sclater, Martin Richards, pp 171- 182&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Bainham argues that this law (in [[England and Wales]]) is outdated and must be abolished "in a modern society committed to equality and human rights in personal relationships".&lt;ref&gt;''Body Lore and Laws Essays on Law and the Human Body'', edited by: Andrew Bainham, Shelley Day Sclater, Martin Richards, pp 175&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 report, the Law Society’s Law Reform Committee of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] advocated abolishing the concept of a [[voidable marriage]] altogether (since divorce had been introduced in 1996) and criticized the consummation ground, writing the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawsociety.ie/Documents/committees/lawreform/Nullity2.pdf|title=Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=www.lawsociety.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092125/https://www.lawsociety.ie/Documents/committees/lawreform/Nullity2.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The rationale behind this ground is not immediately apparent. It is not concerned with the capacity of either or both parties to procreate, still less with the ability of the parties to satisfy each other sexually during the marriage. [...] It remains a rather curious anomaly in the law, a relic perhaps of medieval times, when the first act of intercourse was thought to 'mark' a new bride as the 'property' of her husband. Whatever its origins, it is not entirely clear what modern purpose this ground serves and it is suggested that it should be dispensed with.

Another concern is [[sexual violence]], especially since in most countries the criminalization of [[marital rape]] is recent, having occurred from the 1970s onwards; the maintaining in law of the concept of consummation is argued to foster cultural and societal attitudes and understandings of marriage that make it more difficult to acknowledge these violations; and to be a remainder of an oppressive tradition.&lt;ref name="Family Law pp. 96-99"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/blog/case-point-consummation-legal-oddity|title=Case in point - Is consummation a legal oddity? - Solicitors Journal|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100405/http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/blog/case-point-consummation-legal-oddity|archivedate=2015-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the case of ''R v R'', which criminalised marital rape in England and Wales, Harris-Short and Miles write:

:[A] historical view again throws useful light on the matter: until 1991, husbands were permitted to have sexual intercourse with their wives regardless of whether they were then actually consenting, the husband to sexual relations thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''Family Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'', by Sonia Harris-Short, Joanna Miles, pp. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html|title=R. v R [1991] UKHL 12 (23 October 1991)|website=Bailii.org|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cooperative Web''' or Co-Web refers to a browser-based platform that promises to replicate the power of face-to-face communications via web-touch without sacrificing the quality of human interactions. A Co-Web enabled
situational application exploits direct high-definition video mixed with web based telepresence to further increase conversational productivity. The objective of the Cooperative Web is to enrich collaborative web meetings with a browser metaphor that supports simultaneous interactions between meeting participants.

== Overview ==
A convergence is occurring between various technologies associated with the notion of live web meetings. The phrase [[Web conferencing]] has been used to describe group discussions over the internet. These discussions are often implemented using [[Synchronous conferencing]] protocols and are commonly used for webinars, where one meeting participant lectures to other participants while presenting some information that is rendered to all participants by a common client application (web or [[fat client]]). The term [[Telepresence]] refers to a set of [[technologies]] which allow a person to
feel as if they were present, to give the appearance that they were present, or to have an effect, at a location other than their true location. Telepresence requires that the [[sense]]s of the user, or users, are provided with such
[[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] as to give the feeling of being in that other location. Additionally, the user(s) may be given the ability to affect the remote location.  As the analysts at [http://www.idc.com IDC] describe, the goal is to create a sensory experience that communicates the full range of human interactions in a live meeting.  

While many Telepresence solutions have focused on the ambiance aspects of remote meeting environments and while
most web conferencing solutions have focused on the integration of webinar and telephony features into collaboration software offerings/services, little has been done to simulate or reflect the asynchronous or simultaneous aspects of 
live meetings over the internet. Ideally what is required is a set of technologies that enrich communications with sensory elements that provide a ''just-like-being-there'' experience for live meetings. The sensory experience should  
include a range of sight, sound, and touch interactions. However, the current state of web conferencing and 
telepresence solutions focus mainly on the sight and sound aspects of a meeting and fall short on the interaction capabilities of participants. Moreover, web conferencing and telepresence solutions are typically not vendor neutral and tend to be pricey.

Users have the ability to incorporate webinar capabilities into an Immersive or Adaptive Telepresence solution to extend meeting attendance. Yet this injection of Telepresence Lite capabilities all along the Telepresence solution spectrum still does not address support for simultaneous interactions with the material being presented in a meeting. 

Orthogonal to this convergence in the technologies that support live web meetings, the [[web browser]] platform has evolved to a point whereby the mediation of user interactions amongst meeting attendees is possible. The common browser has raised the bar of expectation by users. Regardless of your browser of choice, your ability to access web applications simply and efficiently has become the norm. The overall browser experience has improved due in part by the broad adoption of web standards by browser providers and by the sheer economics and reach of the [[web browser]] platform. Essentially, the browser has evolved into the ubiquitous application container for the web.

== Solution Concepts ==
People meet, gather, huddle for business and personal endeavors. The majority of the discussions associated with these conferencing activities tend to be associated with decisions. Typically, the decision making process incorporates the analysis of one or more visualizations of data. The Cooperative Web pertains to a set of technologies and associated architectures that promise to empower decision agility with respect to information available for evaluation
via web-based applications.

While Cooperative Web solutions can incorporate digital components (audio, video) to replicate the face-face meeting experience with the human sensory elements of sight and sound, the interactive sensory element is a differentiating factor.  A core value proposition of this technology is that it provides all meeting participants with the ability to manipulate data and drive web centric applications that are used in the decision making process.

In consideration to [http://www.idc.com IDC's] call for the ability to develop a low-cost plug-and-play Telepresence solution that can be easily adopted by medium-sized companies to extend the reach and promise of Telepresence, the
Cooperative Web offers solution vendors and composite web application developers the ability to develop standards based web applications that can be used in collaborative communication-oriented meetings.

== Sample Solution Scenarios Characteristics ==
* Webinar whereby Audio, Video and Co-Web enabled applications are combined
* Traditional teleconference or phone conversations aided by a Co-Web enabled application (this would be useful when broadband limitations exists or when video cameras are not present)
* ''Ad hoc'' just-in-time web conference
* Video conferencing meeting whereby a remote mobile attendee is required

== Solution Scenarios ==
* TeleMedicine: Remote health care or diagnosis
* E-Learning or Distance Learning
* Call Center Support
* Financial Analyst Briefing

== Conceptual Architecture ==
The maturity of service-oriented-architectures has fueled an ecosystem of ajax-based gadgets (widgets) that encapsulate content services (REST, WSDL). These gadgets, standalone fragments of a web page, make up the information rich web palette that can be assembled, wired and shared in composite web applications.

Lets assume that the gadgets used in a given web page all publish the events associated with user-interactions to a predefined mediation server whereby all participants in a managed web meeting were notified of the interactions. Now,
each instance of the gadgets in the web page (running in each meeting participants browser) would receive these remote interaction events as if they were locally triggered. The result would be that each meeting participant would broadcast his/her web page interactions and also subscribe to the results associated with interactions of other meeting participants.

== Comparison with Telepresence ==
The following attributes most common associated with Telepresence solutions are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvetelepresence.com/files/eyeGazeStudy.pdf|title=Telepresence|publisher=dvetelepresence.com|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Quality of Image
* True Eye Contact
* Life Size Image
* Proximity of image
* Sound quality
* Full complement of content presentation capabilities

the reality is that many of top selling solutions focus more on the features associated with sight and sound and complementary ambiance aspects like high-end furniture. However, few focus on extending the Telepresence experience with interactive presentation capabilities. ''Cooperative Web'' enabled applications are complementary to the spectrum of Telepresence solutions as they extend the scope of the browser-based platform to allow all meeting participants to share browser applications in a live online meeting.

As described by [http://www.gartner.com/ Gartner], the spectrum of Telepresence solutions can range from Lite to Adaptive to Immersive. Cooperative Web enabled applications can be leveraged along all points on the solution spectrum to help enrich the ''just-like-being-there'' aspects of the Telepresence experience.

Typically, sophisticated technologies are required for a user to be given a convincing telepresence experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9781558606432|title=Sophistication|publisher=sciencedirect.com|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, one of the benefits of Cooperative Web solutions is the ubiquity of the technology dependencies. The cost of entry for adoption has been reduced to a common browser, a few JavaScript libraries and some browser plug-ins. The net result is that the Cooperative Web not only extends the reach of Telepresence solutions, this technology also improves the overall experience of remote communications. 

However, in its raw state, a Co-Web enabled application does not require a Telepresence environment nor a hosted  Web Conferencing solution. The minimum requirement is a mediation server and a co-web enabled application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6975">[[Cultural identity]] refers to a person's sense of belonging to a particular [[culture]] or group.  This process involves learning about and accepting [[traditions]], [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[language]], [[religion]], [[ancestry]], [[aesthetics]], thinking patterns, and [[social structure]]s of a culture.  Normally, people internalize the beliefs, values, norms, and social practices of their culture and identify themselves with that culture.  The culture becomes a part of their [[self-concept]] (Lustig, 2013).  However, some studies have noted that existing cultural identity theory may not account for the fact that different individuals and groups may not react to or interpret events, happenings, attitudes, etc. in the same ways as other individuals or groups.

Myron Lustig notes that cultural identities are central to a person’s sense of self.  That is because cultural identities “are central, dynamic, and multifaceted components of one’s self concept” (Lustig, 133).  Lustig also points out that cultural identities are dynamic, and they exist within a changing social context.  As a result, a person’s identity changes as do one’s ongoing experiences in life (Lustig, 135).  Other researchers describe cultural identity as referring to the content of values as guiding principles, to meaningful symbols, and to life styles that individuals share with others, though not necessarily within recognizable groups (Boski et al., 2004).  In addition, Boski et al. point out that most books and studies have ignored cultural identity as a theoretical construct in the field of [[cross-cultural psychology]].  Instead, books and journals report works on the theme of social identity.  [[Social identity]] is described as a sense of “We-ness,” or attachment to a group that one is a member of, and by comparison to others.  The sense of “We-ness” remains culturally empty, however.  Even with natural groups, it is portrayed in trait-attributes, “which is not different from those used to characterize individuals” (Boski et al., 2004).  There is, however, research evidence about the social (ethnic) vs. cultural distinction (Sanchez-Burks et al., 2000).  This study found that the task-oriented cultural style was generally more favored than the task-plus interpersonal alternative, particularly among Anglo-American participants, for whom ethnicity did not matter.  Mexican and Latino participants, however, showed some degree of favoritism toward ethnically similar participants (Sanchez-Burks et all, 2000).

It seems that there are different viewpoints regarding cultural and social identities.  Cultural identity is defined as the identity of a group or culture or of an individual as far as one is influenced by one’s belonging to a group or culture.  Further, Cultural identity is similar to, and overlaps with, [[identity politics]].  New forms of identification have been suggested to break down the understanding of the individual as a whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers.  Such identifiers can result from various conditions including: location, gender, race, history, nationality, language, sexuality, religious beliefs, ethnicity, aesthetics, and even food.  In places like the U.S. and Canada, where the people are ethnically diverse, social unity is primarily based on common social values and beliefs.  However, some critics of cultural identity declare that cultural identity based upon difference is a divisive force in society.  In addition, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the social norms as presented by the media.  Therefore, instead of learning behavior and knowledge from cultural or religious groups, people may be learning social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.  Language may also be an important factor in culture identity.  The communication that comes with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories.

	When young people are severed from the ideals and positively sanctioned statuses, feelings of alienation or social isolation may develop.  These feelings can result in undesired treatment and status.  This process results in personal marginalization, and it may lead to social marginalization which includes that person’s relative economic, employment, educational, and cultural loss compared to those around him.  This provides a second source of alienation from mainstream society.  This can cause an individual to experience extreme discomfort called ego identity discomfort.  Because external sources have too much control, the individual cannot construct a personal definition of him/her self.  The person is then motivated to identify with an alternative social group such as a drug subcultural group.  Such groups provide opportunities to resolve identity problems.   Identification with such a group reduces the person’s ego identity discomfort, or it helps to solve identity problems.  Scholars today are focusing on the basic elements of social organization (race, ethnicity, gender, and social class) in their theory and research.  In the case of drug subcultures, it is reported that Anderson (1998) discovered that the composition of the drug subcultural groups differed between blacks and whites.  Blacks described neighborhood and school based groups as securing an improved social status and reputation.  On the other hand, Anderson (1998) found that the drug subcultural groups reported by whites differed.  These groups were located at nightclubs, bars, colleges, high schools and around the neighborhood.  Some of these groups were “other” activity oriented, such as college groups or the entertainment industry, and these groups had a “very strong” interest in drugs.  Whites reported using many different drugs, from alcohol and cocaine to marijuana and heroin.  These differences are significant, and such differences could alter the cultural identity theory. This is because different groups, such as blacks and whites, perceive events and problems in different ways.

'''Environmental anthropology''' is a sub-specialty&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|pages=23|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time.

== Philosophies ==

===Adaptation: environment over culture===
The sixties was a breakthrough decade for environmental anthropology, with functionalism and system theories prevalent throughout.&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"/&gt; The rudiments of the system theories can be seen in [[Marcel Mauss]]' ''Seasonal Variation of Eskimo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Mauss|title=''Seasonal variations of the Eskimo: a study in social morphology''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRbl6DmN8vkC|accessdate=3 April 2011|date=30 April 2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33035-0|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoed later in Julian Steward's work.&lt;ref&gt;Steward JH. 1938. The Great Basin Shoshonean Indians: An Example of A Family Level Of Sociocultural Integration. ''Environmental Anthropology: A Historical Read''. 168–180.
&lt;/ref&gt; Although later, system theories were later harshly criticized for narrowly assuming the state of societies as static.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vayda|first1=Andrew P.|author1-link=Andrew P. Vayda|last2=McCay|first2=Bonnie J.|author2-link= Bonnie McCay |title=New Directions in Ecology and Ecological Anthropology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=4|pages=293|year=1975|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.04.100175.001453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of system theories in the sixties, as conveyed by [[Julian Steward]],&lt;ref name="Steward JH 1955"&gt;Steward JH. 1955. Theory of Cultural Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution. Urbana: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was acknowledgment of recurrence, cultural patterns or "laws." Steward's [[ecological anthropology]]&lt;ref name="Steward JH 1955"/&gt; was based on topography, climate, and resources and their accessibility to define culture. While [[Marvin Harris]]' cultural materialism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marvin Harris|title=Cultural materialism: the struggle for a science of culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Xc9DMbB5KQC|accessdate=3 April 2011|year=2001|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7591-0135-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; observed and gauged social units by means of material production. Both focused on culture as a malleable contingent to the environment; a social unit's characteristics (technology, politics, modes of subsistence, to name a few) have adaptive limitations. Importantly, those limitations are not considered determinants.

=== Diversity, history and associations ===
The new focus of environmental anthropology was cultural variation and diversity. Such factors like environmental disasters (floods, earthquakes, frost), migrations, cost &amp; benefit ratio, contact/ associations, external ideas (trade/ latent capitalism boom),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Richard B.|doi=10.1525/aa.1992.94.1.02a00030|title=Art, Science, or Politics?

This perspective was based on general equilibriums and criticized for not addressing the variety of responses an organisms can have, such as "loyalty, solidarity, friendliness, and sanctity" and possible "incentives or inhibitors" in relations to behavior.&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biersack|first1=Aletta|title=Introduction: From the "New Ecology" to the New Ecologies|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|pages=5|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rappaport, often referred to as a reductionist in his cultural studies methods,&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"/&gt; acknowledges, "The social unit is not always well defined&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GCcgMi40WkC|accessdate=3 April 2011|date=August 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;" exhibiting another flaw in this perspective, obfuscation of aspects of analyze and designated terms.&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"/&gt;

=== Policy and activism: politics versus environmentalism ===
The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]]. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more.&lt;ref name="Pyke G 1984"/&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"/&gt;

Critiques on this modern perspective and non-governmental organizations' (NGOs) influences and effects on social groups is usually that they "generalize" and "obscure" local discourse and message.&lt;ref name="Brosius JP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/200019|author=Brosius JP|year= 1999|title= Analyses And Interventions; Anthropological Engagements With Environmentalism|journal= Current Anthropology|jstor=200019|volume= 40|pages= 277–309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often resulting in environmentalism by bureaucrats, PR firms, governments, and industry.&lt;ref name="Brosius JP 1999"/&gt; An example of negative effects can be ascertained in the Malaysian Rainforest, in which NGOs and other outsider activist deflected the issue, ignoring the locality of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peter Brosius|first1=J.|title=Green Dots, Pink Hearts: Displacing Politics from the Malaysian Rain Forest|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|issue=1|pages=36–57|year=1999|pmid=19280759|jstor=683340|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins and pioneers ===

Environmental anthropology enters the field as an applied dimension built on the primary approaches within contemporary ecological anthropology.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"&gt;Sponsel L. (2004, May). [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Ecological_anthropology Ecological Anthropology]. Encyclopedia of Earth.&lt;/ref&gt;
It focuses on how culture promotes connections between humans and their occupied ecosystems.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt; American anthropologist Julian Steward (1902–1972), is the anthropological originator of cultural ecology.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt; A troubled childhood led to Steward's fascination of the natural world. In 1918 Steward attended a California College, found inspiration from the natural environment and gained insight which promoted a future passion toward ecological studies.
Steward contributions to theories of cultural ecology and cultural evolution are renowned.&lt;ref name="Grinker R.R 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grinker|first1=ROY Richard|title=The Politics of Knowledge: Julian Steward, Leslie White, Melville Herskovits, and L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza|journal=Reviews in Anthropology|volume=37|pages=259|year=2008|doi=10.1080/00938150802038935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformations ===
Steward officially formulated the basic theoretical and methodological framework for cultural ecology in the 1950s–60s. The transformation of cultural ecology into ecological anthropology took place in the 1960s through the 1980s by anthropologists [[John Bennett (anthropologist)|John Bennett]], [[Roy A. Rappaport]], [[Andrew P. Vayda]], and others. Two additional theoretical and methodological frameworks surfaced in the 1980s and 90s which attempted to cast ecological anthropology in a more scientific light. The first of which, was when Marvin Harris actively and systematically worked to develop "cultural materialism" as an approach to research. Harris's intention was to expose and analyze the ecological logic underlying multiple facets of culture. The cultural system was split into three parts by Harris; infrastructure, structure and superstructure. [[Eric Alden Smith]] and [[Bruce Winterhalder]] laid the blueprints for the second groundbreaking structure of evolutionary ecology. This would shift attention to the individual as the origin of adaptation, stressing choice when utilizing natural resources. A further expansion of ecological anthropology occurred in the 1990s when historical, political, and spiritual focused areas of research were incorporated into facets of human ecology and adaptation.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt;

== Purpose ==
Anthropology is a field concerned specifically with the human condition and its relation to the natural world (i.e. the capacity of a human to manipulate the world around them). This can be seen through human interactions between each other as well as the flora and fauna present in a person's particular region and how they can be utilized. Humans everywhere have changed their environment and for better or for worse, taking a step back to the previous state of things would be a long arduous process. So how can people erase the mistakes of the past? How can they bring old, outdated things new life through innovation? These questions can provide insight into the development of a subfield of anthropology called environmental anthropology.

Environmental anthropology is a subfield of anthropology with roots in activism. The main focus of this particular perspective focuses on a discourse of activism. Agents operating within this sphere of thought have noticed aversive effects from human related manipulation, and are driven to try and force changes in the system which can eventually lead to replenishment of the region in question. The discipline itself if ever-changing because it must evolve to satiate the needs and appropriately address issues from the state and region level all the way down to complex communities, hence must uses a multitude of different approaches when considering a problem. According to the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] (SfAA),

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Environmental anthropology is particularly effective in relating to and gaining understanding of cultural diversity in community settings, and intercultural/intersect oral conflict, thus lending itself to applied endeavors that involve collaboration among diverse interest groups for the common good."&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"&gt;The Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA). [http://www.sfaa.net/eap/ea.html “What is Environmental Anthropology?”] Accessed March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This means that a problem up stream of two separate cultural groups that affects them both can be resolved through a discourse of environmental anthropology, and although the two groups may not speak the same language, they can both activate to prompt change. Necessity can potentially quell conflict between two cultural groups if they must work together to combat an even bigger enemy (environmental injustice). Applied anthropology utilizes these understandings to work with people on a local basis as well as trying to satisfy share holders working to gain a resolution for problems related to health, education, social welfare, development and environmental protection.&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"/&gt;

Environmental anthropologists use a multitude of tools and orientations to best address the variance in different problems. According to SfAA,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Important among them are observation techniques, qualitative and survey interviews, systematic data collection techniques for accessing core values or areas of cultural consensus, ways of identifying and interpreting social networks and a variety of participatory cultural, social and environmental assessment techniques designed to improve intersect oral understanding of demographic composition, social/political dynamics, cultural and other forms of diversity, and capacity for planning and development."&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Environmental anthropologists aim to utilize their understanding of the culture at hand in order to gain as [[emic]] (an insider's understanding of the culture in question) a perspective as possible when dealing with these situations. These type of situations are ideal within the field and sheds positive light on a field that is criticized for refusing to accept this perspective.{{according to whom|date=April 2013}}

'''Fauvism''' is the style of '''''les Fauves''''' ([[French language|French]] for "the wild beasts"), a group of early twentieth-century [[modern art]]ists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities and strong color over the [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] values retained by [[Impressionism]]. While Fauvism as a style began around 1904 and continued beyond 1910, the [[Art movement|movement]] as such lasted only a few years, 1905–1908, and had three exhibitions.&lt;ref name=elderfield13&gt;[[John Elderfield]],  The ''"Wild Beasts" Fauvism and Its Affinities,'' 1976, [[Museum of Modern Art]], p.13, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Judi, et al., ''The Fauve Landscape'', 1990, Abbeville Press, p. 13, {{ISBN|1-55859-025-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the movement were [[André Derain]] and [[Henri Matisse]].

Besides Matisse and [[André Derain|Derain]], other artists included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Louis Valtat]], [[Jean Puy]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Henri Manguin]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Kees van Dongen]] and [[Georges Braque]] (subsequently Picasso's partner in [[Cubism]]).&lt;ref name=elderfield13/&gt;

The paintings of the Fauves were characterized by seemingly wild brush work and strident colors, while their subject matter had a high degree of simplification and [[Abstract art|abstraction]].&lt;ref name=tate-fauvism&gt;Tate (2007).

Other key influences were [[Paul Cézanne]]&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 1990, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Gauguin]], whose employment of areas of saturated color—notably in paintings from Tahiti—strongly influenced Derain's work at [[Collioure]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Teitel, Alexandra J.

Fauvism has been compared to [[Expressionism]], both in its use of pure color and unconstrained brushwork.&lt;ref name=tate-fauvism/&gt; Some of the Fauves were among the first avant-garde artists to collect and study African and Oceanic art, alongside other forms of non-Western and folk art, leading several Fauves toward the development [[Cubism]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua I.

==Origins==
[[File:Derain CharingCrossBridge.png|thumb|[[André Derain]], 1906, ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'', [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, DC.]]
[[Gustave Moreau]] was the movement's inspirational teacher;&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; a controversial professor at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris and a [[Symbolist painters|Symbolist painter]], he taught Matisse, Marquet, Manguin, Rouault and Camoin during the 1890s, and was viewed by critics as the group's philosophical leader until Matisse was recognized as such in 1904.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; Moreau's broad-mindedness, originality and affirmation of the expressive potency of pure color was inspirational for his students.&lt;ref name=dempsey&gt;Dempsey, Amy (2002). ''Styles, Schools and Movements: An Encyclopedic Guide to Modern Art'', pp. 66-69, London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Matisse said of him, "He did not set us on the right roads, but off the roads.  He disturbed our complacency."&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; This source of empathy was taken away with Moreau's death in 1898, but the artists discovered other catalysts for their development.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

In 1896, Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited the artist [[John Peter Russell]] on the island of [[Belle Île]] off the coast of [[Brittany]].&lt;ref name=abc&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/booktalk/stories/s1430343.htm "Book talk: The Unknown Matisse..."], [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]], interview with [[Hilary Spurling]], 8 June 2005. Retrieved 1 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter; Matisse had never previously seen an Impressionist work directly, and was so shocked at the style that he left after ten days, saying, "I couldn't stand it any more."&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; The next year he returned as Russell's student and abandoned his earth-colored palette for bright Impressionist colors, later stating, "Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained color theory to me."&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Russell had been a close friend of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and gave Matisse a Van Gogh drawing.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

In 1901, [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] encountered the work of [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] for the first time at an exhibition, declaring soon after that he loved Van Gogh more than his own father; he started to work by squeezing paint directly onto the canvas from the tube.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; In parallel with the artists' discovery of contemporary avant-garde art came an appreciation of pre-[[Renaissance]] French art, which was shown in a 1904 exhibition, ''French Primitives''.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; Another aesthetic influence was African sculpture, of which [[Vlaminck]], [[Derain]] and Matisse were early collectors.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

Many of the Fauve characteristics first cohered in [[Matisse]]'s painting, ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]'' ("Luxury, Calm and Pleasure"), which he painted in the summer of 1904, whilst in [[Saint-Tropez]] with [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]].&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

After viewing the boldly colored canvases of [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Albert Marquet]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Charles Camoin]], and [[Jean Puy]] at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905, the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] disparaged the painters as "''fauves''" (wild beasts), thus giving their movement the name by which it became known, ''Fauvism''. The artists shared their first exhibition at the 1905 Salon d'Automne. The group gained their name after [[Louis Vauxcelles|Vauxcelles]] described their show of work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"), contrasting their "orgie of tones" with a [[Renaissance]]-style sculpture that shared the room with them.&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

[[Henri Rousseau]] was not a Fauve, but his large jungle scene ''[[The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope]]'' was exhibited near Matisse's work and may have had an influence on the pejorative used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith|Smith, Roberta]] (2006).

Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental ''[[Le Bonheur de Vivre]] (The Joy of Life)''.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt; Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of ''Le Bonheur de Vivre''.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=salle+VII,+salon+d'automne+de+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=alVRJahAml&amp;sig=6SkzgOftNxhpsdYdDNKbJjzqXUY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Russell T.

'''Fisheries Research Services''' (FRS) was an [[List of Scottish Executive agencies|Executive Agency]] of the [[Scottish Government]]. FRS was responsible for scientific and technical research into the marine and freshwater [[Scottish fisheries|fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]], and the protection of the aquatic [[Ecosystem|environment]] in [[Scotland]]. For these purposes, the agency had two fishery [[laboratories]], allowing specialisation in both marine and freshwater fisheries. The FRS also maintained two research vessels. 

On 1 April 2009, Fisheries Research Services was merged with the [[Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency]] and the Scottish Government Marine Directorate to form Marine Scotland, part of the core Scottish Government. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.frs-scotland.gov.uk/ Former FRS website] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The [[FRS Marine Laboratory|marine laboratory]] is based in Victoria Road, Aberdeen; and the freshwater laboratory is based in [[Pitlochry]], [[Perth and Kinross]]. The Agency also maintained other temporary research sites throughout Scotland. The Agency also had two [[research vessel]]s, {{ship|FRV|Scotia}} and {{ship|FRV|Alba-Na-Mara}}.

The Agency was directly funded by the Scottish Government, which made up around 60% of income. The other 40% was derived from research income for projects carried out in conjunction with other [[government bodies]] in [[Europe]]. The Agency also worked with private firms.

'''Forest glass'''  ('''''Waldglas''''' in German) is late [[medieval]] [[glass]] produced in northwestern and central Europe from approximately 1000&amp;ndash;1700 AD using wood ash and sand as the main raw materials and made in factories known as '''glasshouses''' in forest areas.&lt;ref name="Tait"&gt;Tait, H., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by a variety of greenish-yellow colors, the earlier products often being of crude design and poor quality, and was used mainly for everyday vessels and increasingly for ecclesiastical [[stained glass]] windows. Its composition and manufacture contrast sharply with [[Roman glass|Roman]] and pre-Roman glassmaking centered on the Mediterranean and contemporaneous Islamic glass making to the east.

==History==
While under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, the raw materials and manufacturing methods of northern Europe were those of the Roman tradition, using the mineral [[Natron]]. For several centuries after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], around 450 AD, recycling of Roman glass formed the major part of the local industry and glassmaking skills declined. With the rise of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in northwestern Europe approximately 800 AD, increasing demand for glass and problems with supply of traditional raw materials, together with an imperial desire to emulate the more sophisticated culture of the [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] (which was producing high quality glass) led to experimentation with new raw materials and the development of a totally new glassmaking technology.&lt;ref name="Tait"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wedepohl 2000"&gt;Wedepohl 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
Archaeologically, numerous  medieval glasshouses have been found in western and central Europe, particularly in the mountains of Germany. Due to later reuse of the building material, most are poorly preserved, but there is evidence that both glassmaking and working were often done on the same site.&lt;ref name="Seibel"&gt;Seibel 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glassmaking==

It is important to distinguish between glassmaking from raw materials and glass working, which is the production of finished articles by melting pieces of raw glass or [[cullet]] which may have been made elsewhere or by recycling old glass. 
Glass consists of four principal components: 
# A former – to provide the network of atoms forming the matrix of the glass.&lt;ref name= "P&amp;H"&gt;Pollard and Heron 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  This is [[Silica]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which in ancient times was added as crushed [[quartz]],&lt;ref name="Rehren"&gt;Rehren 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and from Roman times onwards in the form of sand.
# An [[alkali]] [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] – to lower the temperature at which the silica melts, making it achievable using currently available working temperatures. In ancient times, the ash of sodium-rich plants growing in arid areas around the eastern Mediterranean provided [[sodium carbonate|soda]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as flux. In Roman times the mineral [[natron]] was used, a naturally occurring mixture of alkaline [[sodium]] salts, sourced from the [[Wadi El Natrun]] area of Egypt. Post-Roman Islamic glassmakers reverted to using sodium-rich plant ash,&lt;ref name="Sch"&gt;Schalm et al. 1994&lt;/ref&gt; while in Northern Europe, a method using ash from wood was developed to provide [[potash]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as flux. [[Calcium oxide]] (lime, CaO) can also act as a flux.&lt;ref name="P&amp;H"/&gt;
# A stabiliser – to stop the glass dissolving in water and increase corrosion resistance.  The most effective is lime (CaO) but [[alumina]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[Magnesium oxide|magnesia]] (MgO) can achieve this to some effect.&lt;ref name="P&amp;H"/&gt; These minerals may already be present in varying quantities in sand.
# A colourant or [[opacifier]] – These can be naturally present in the glass due to impurities in the raw materials or can be deliberately added to the melted glass as minerals or as [[slag heap|slag]] from metalworking processes. The most important contributions are from [[iron]], [[copper]], [[cobalt]], [[manganese]], [[tin]], [[antimony]], and [[lead]]. Opacity can be due to bubbles in the glass or the inclusion of opacifying agents such as tin and antimony. The resulting colour and opacity from a given composition also may be controlled by the temperature and [[redox]] conditions inside the furnace.&lt;ref name= "Sch"&gt;Schalm et al. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freestone 1991"&gt;Freestone 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
In post-Roman times political problems in the Wadi El Natrun area disrupted the supply of [[natron]] so alternatives had to be developed.&lt;ref name="Shortland"&gt;Shortland et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern glassmakers reverted to using sodium-rich plant ash and for a while supplied southern Europe, using existing Roman trade routes,&lt;ref name="Tait"/&gt; however, the [[Venetian glass]]makers, who had inherited the Roman glassmaking skills, monopolised the trade in plant ash and banned craftsmen from working outside the city.&lt;ref name="Freestone 1991"/&gt; The rest of Europe, north of the Alps, had to find another way of producing glass. The former and stabiliser components of glass occur in all regions as sand or quartz and as lime of various forms. The northern Europeans experimented with using ash from wood, ferns, and bracken as a source of the alkali flux.&lt;ref name="Wedepohl 2005"&gt;Wedepohl 2005&lt;/ref&gt; At its height the Roman glass industry was producing high quality, thin, colourless, and clear glass of consistent composition.&lt;ref name="Tait"/&gt; The earlier surviving Forest glass vessels are characterised by a wide variety of compositions and lower quality, often being greenish to brownish in colour, thick-walled, and with inclusions and bubbles in the fabric. This suggests that using wood-ash was not just a case of changing the raw material, but necessitated a whole new technology with attendant development problems.

Whereas Roman and earlier glass (of Si/Na/Ca composition) was of a marked uniformity over a wide area and centuries of time,&lt;ref name="Rehren"/&gt; the medieval glass (of Si/K/Ca composition) is characterised by a variety of compositions.This may be explained to some extent by examining how the melting temperature of glass depends on the relative proportions of its components, which for simplicity, are reduced to three.&lt;ref name="Rehren"/&gt; In practice glass contains many more components that complicate the system. The study of such [[Glass databases|ternary systems]], together with analysis of [[trace elements]] is useful to archaeologists for establishing the [[provenance]] of glass.

In pre-Medieval times it is believed that the batch of raw materials was heated to a temperature where it partially melted, the unmelted parts removed and washed of non-reactive components, and added to the next batch.&lt;ref name="Rehren"/&gt; Because of the strong way that the Si/Na/Ca compositions affect the melting temperature, the resulting glass was of a fairly uniform composition regardless of the recipe of raw materials used.&lt;ref name="Rehren"/&gt; The melting temperatures of the Si/K/Ca glasses are not so strongly affected by composition, resulting in glasses of more varied composition, so the self-limiting features of the Na system that allowed the traditional partial-batch method to produce consistent compositions, ceased to apply, and a new way of controlling consistency had to be developed.&lt;ref name="Rehren"/&gt; The wide variety of compositions, together with historical accounts of glassmaking,&lt;ref name="Theo"&gt;Theophilus writing in the early 12th century AD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ag"&gt;Agricola writing in the mid-16th century&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the new method involved melting a complete batch of raw materials, removing the unreactive components as scum.&lt;ref name="Rehren"/&gt;

From approximately 1400 AD, in an effort to compete with the quality of Venetian glass, it was found that calcium oxide (CaO) added as flux to the sand-potash mix in the form of shells, [[limestone]], or marble gave a clearer glass, by virtue of reducing the amount of potash required along with its attendant colorants.&lt;ref name="Wedepohl 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S&amp;G"&gt;Stern and Gerber 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical compositions of some historical and ancient glasses - the components are given in weight per cent; in addition to those listed the ancient glasses also would have contained up to one per cent [[iron oxide]] and up to three per cent aluminium oxide, in addition to any colorants and opacifiers &lt;ref name="Freestone 1991"/&gt;

==Control of colour==
Experimenting with the new technology, the forest glassmakers found it difficult to achieve the high standards of clarity and colour of the Roman methods, due mainly to the great variability of colour-controlling elements in the raw materials. European sand and soil is generally higher in iron and manganese. Iron gives a blue-green tinge to glass under usual furnace atmosphere conditions, but also may give a yellow colour. Manganese has its own purple colour which may balance out the iron colour to make colourless glass.&lt;ref name="Freestone Th"&gt;Freestone 1992&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, glass made from beech wood grown on meagre lime-rich soil (e.g. [[Kleinlutzel]], Jura) is high in manganese and thus, nearly colourless while that in a clay-rich area (e.g. Court-Chalvet, Jura) is olive green.&lt;ref name="S&amp;G"/&gt; Thus, a variety of colours may be produced and experimentation allowed the glassmakers to progress from the early muddy green-yellow-brown colours toward clear-coloured and colourless glass. Local conditions allowed some areas to produce finer glass at an earlier stage. In [[Bohemia]] at the end of the sixteenth century the decolourising powers of manganese were used to produce a clear glass suitable for [[engraving#History and usage|engraving]].&lt;ref name="Tait"/&gt; The amount of carbon left in the wood ash also may affect the colour of the glass by modifying the furnace atmosphere.&lt;ref name="S&amp;G"/&gt; The glass in [[York Minster#Stained glass|York Minster]] has been shown to be 90% naturally coloured, without added colorants.&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;Newton 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Other clear colours were produce by deliberate addition of metal oxides, often the byproducts of local metalworking; [[Copper(II) oxide|copper oxide]] to give green or turquiose, cobalt for strong blue. Red was particularly difficult to produce, using particles of copper under delicately-controlled [[redox]] conditions.&lt;ref name="P&amp;H"/&gt; There is little evidence  of antimony- or tin-based opacifiers being used,&lt;ref name="Freestone Th"/&gt; or the use of lead to modify other colours.

==Operation of the glasshouse==
There are only two historical descriptions of European glassmaking in medieval times. In 1120 [[Theophilus Presbyter]], writing in Germany, gave detailed recipes and instructions and in 1530 [[Georgius Agricola]] wrote about current glassmaking.&lt;ref name="Theo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ag"/&gt; Other useful information comes from archaeological finds and experimental and theoretical reconstructions.

===Sourcing and collection of raw materials===
The sand likely was collected from river beds, where it was relatively clean and of more uniform particle size.&lt;ref name="Cable"&gt;Cable 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The felling, transporting, drying, and storage of wood both for ash production and as fuel for the furnaces was labour-intensive and required a high level of organization.&lt;ref name="Cable"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cr"&gt;Crossley 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sm"&gt;Smedley et al. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation of ash===
Theophilus recommends the use of [[beech]] logs,&lt;ref name="Theo"/&gt; which analysis has shown has a high proportion of CaO when grown on [[calcareous]] soil.&lt;ref name = "Sm"/&gt;  Whatever wood is used, the amount of potash and CaO it provides, as well as other components that might affect colour and opacity, varies considerably with the age and part of the tree, soil chemistry, climate, the time of year when the tree was cut and the dryness of the wood when burned, factors over which the glassmaker had little control.&lt;ref name="S&amp;G"/&gt; This variability explains the problems that glassmakers had in trying to produce glass of a consistent quality. Large amounts of ash would have to be prepared and mixed together to give the homogeneity needed to give a predictable glass composition.&lt;ref name="S&amp;G"/&gt; A typical yield of ash from beech is only about 1%, so using Theophilus' recipe of two parts of sand to one part of ash means it would take 63&amp;nbsp;kg of beech wood to produce one kilo of glass.&lt;ref name="Sm"/&gt; It has been estimated that, including fuel, 150–200&amp;nbsp;kg of wood would be needed per kilo of glass.&lt;ref name="Cable"/&gt;

===Fritting===
Then the prepared ash and sand were heated together, but not melted, at a relatively low temperature (up to about 900&amp;nbsp;°C or 1650&amp;nbsp;°F) in a process known as [[frit]]ting. Theophilus specifies 'for the space of a day and night.'&lt;ref name="Theo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sm"/&gt; This process, which could be monitored by changes in colour as temperature increased, caused a decrease in volume, prior to charging [[crucibles]] for the final melting stage, thus minimising the number of times the furnace would need to be opened, and also, consolidating the light powdery ash that might blow about in the furnace causing contamination.&lt;ref name="Sm"/&gt;

===Melting===
The final stage was to melt the fritted material in crucibles in a covered furnace to give molten glass. The furnace needed to operate at as high a temperature as possible since quick melting and the need for less flux improved the quality of glass. The change from natron to potash required an increase in melting temperature of about 200&amp;nbsp;°C to around 1350&amp;nbsp;°C, necessitating a fundamental change in furnace technology and the development of [[Refractory ceramic|high-temperature ceramics]].&lt;ref name="Rehren"/&gt; At this higher temperature, normal clay would react chemically with the glass.&lt;ref name="Eramo"&gt;Eramo 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working===
Once melted, the glass would be [[glassblowing|blown]] into vessels or into cylinders which then were opened into sheets for [[stained glass|window glass]].The final stage is to [[Annealing (glass)|anneal]] the finished glass to avoid damage from shrinkage stresses.&lt;ref name="Tait"/&gt;

==Furnace design==
[[Image:Plate 27 10 26.jpeg|thumb|left|Butterfly design furnace]]
[[Image:Agricola-3.png|thumb|right|Beehive design furnace]]
Besides the descriptions of Theophilus and Agricola, the only depiction of an early forest glasshouse is from Bohemia in abpproximately 1380 ([[The Mandeville Miniature]]).&lt;ref name="Seibel"/&gt; This shows a furnace where all the high temperature processes of glassmaking were performed in the one structure containing several ovens whose varying temperatures might be controlled to the necessary extent by constant attention. The raw materials are mixed at a pit nearby and carried down in pans to be fritted in one of the ovens, optimum temperature up to 1100&amp;nbsp;°C. The frit is melted at high temperature up to 1400&amp;nbsp;°C in crucibles in a second oven, and when ready, the glass is being [[Glassblowing|blown]] into objects. These are placed in the annealing oven to cool. The whole structure is enclosed in a wooden building, and it is likely that wood was stored and dried above the furnace.&lt;ref name="Cable"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cr"/&gt; Remains of a similar structure from the late fifteenth century have been found in [[Eichsfeld]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Seibel"/&gt; Another design found archaeologically from the seventeenth century is the 'butterfly furnace'. These furnaces were made from stone and the crucibles from imported, highly-[[refractory ceramic|refractory]] clay.&lt;ref name="Cable"/&gt; They differ in style from the Islamic furnaces of the east, and those of southern Europe, the 'beehive' style where the annealing chamber is above the main oven rather than on the same level.&lt;ref name="Tait"/&gt;

The furnace firing cycle would be optimised for fuel consumption, output, and humanpower, and, as the technology improved, larger glasshouses operated on an almost continuous basis.&lt;ref name="Cable"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cr"/&gt; It has been estimated that a large glasshouse typically, might use 67 tonnes of wood a week operating for 40 weeks a year.&lt;ref name="Cable"/&gt;

==Location of glasshouses==
[[Image:Plate 27 10 24.jpeg|thumb|left|Forest glasshouse of eighteenth century]]
[[Image:St Denis North a.jpg|thumb|right|Cathedral of St. Denis, Paris]]
The vast amounts of wood needed to produce glass in this way dictated that glasshouses be located in forest areas and that the woodland be managed carefully by [[coppicing]] and [[pollarding]] to maximise the wood resource and to optimise the size of wood pieces used.&lt;ref name="Cable"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cr"/&gt; Even so, periodically the glasshouse would have to relocate, as the woodland was depleted. The glass industry had to compete for wood supplies with other industries such as mining, and domestic demand. In sixteenth-century England, an embargo was placed on the use of wood for fuel for glassmaking.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Hammersley 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Glasshouses often were located in forests owned by the church. One of the main uses of forest glass was for ecclesiastical [[stained glass]] windows.

==Biography==
Barton was born in [[East Farnham]], [[Quebec]], Canada. After attending [[Oakwood Friends School|Oakwood Seminary]] in [[Union Springs, New York]]. Barton became a minister in the [[Religious Society of Friends]] and continued his education at [[Haverford College]], completing a M.A. in 1885. He taught in [[Rhode Island]] from 1884–1889, then earned a Ph.D. at [[Harvard]] and became a professor of [[Semitic languages]] at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1891.

In 1922 Barton moved to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was professor of Semitic languages and the history of religion. He retired in 1931 and held the title of professor [[emeritus]] until his death. He specialized in many subjects, particularly in Semitic languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21686">'''German studies''' is the field of [[humanities]] that researches, documents, and disseminates [[German language]] and [[German literature|literature]] in both its historic and present forms. Academic departments of German studies often include classes on [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], [[German history]], and [[German politics]] in addition to the language and literature component. Common German names for the field are {{lang|de|Germanistik}}, {{lang|de|Deutsche Philologie}}, and {{lang|de|Deutsche Sprachwissenschaft und Literaturwissenschaft}}. In English the terms '''Germanistics''' or '''Germanics''' are sometimes used (mostly by Germans), but the subject is more often referred to as ''German studies'', ''German language and literature'', or ''German philology''.

Modern German studies is usually seen as a combination of two sub-disciplines:  German linguistics and Germanophone literature studies.

==German linguistics==

German linguistics is traditionally called [[philology]] in Germany, as there is something of a difference between philologists and linguists{{vague|date=September 2012}}. It is roughly divided as follows:
* [[Old High German]] (''Althochdeutsch'') 8th – 11th centuries
* [[Middle High German]] (''Mittelhochdeutsch'') 11th – 14th centuries
* [[Early New High German]] (''Frühneuhochdeutsch'') 14th – 17th centuries
* [[Modern German]] ([[Standard German]], [[German dialectology]]) 18th – 21st centuries

In addition, the discipline examines German under various aspects: the way it is spoken and written, i.e., spelling; declination; vocabulary; sentence structure; texts; etc. It compares the various manifestations such as social groupings (slang, written texts, etc.) and geographical groupings (dialects, etc.).

==German literature studies==

The study [[German literature]] is divided into two parts: {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ''Ältere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft'' deals with the period from the beginnings of German in the early Middle Ages up to post-Medieval times around AD 1750, while the modern era is covered by ''Neuere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft''. The field systematically examines German literature in terms of [[genre]], [[wikt:form|form]], [[Content (media and publishing)|content]], and [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s as well as looking at it historically by author and epoch.  Important areas include [[edition philology]], [[history of literature]], and [[textual interpretation]].  The relationships of German literature to the literatures of other languages (e.g. reception and mutual influences) and historical contexts are also important areas of concentration. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory: Fourth Edition'' ({{ISBN|0-14-051363-9}}) is printed in English but contains many [[German-language]] literary terms that apply cross-culturally in the field of [[literary criticism]]; quite a few of the in terms in the book originated in German but have since been adopted by [[English-language]] critics and scholars.

== German teacher education ==
At least in Germany and Austria, German studies in academia play a central role in the education of German school teachers. Their courses usually cover four fields:&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the left navigation at the web page of one of the [[Cologne University]] German studies institutes at http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Linguistics]] of [[German language|German]] (''{{lang|de|Sprachwissenschaft}}'')
* German language and literature of up to about 1750 (''{{lang|de|Ältere Sprache und Literatur}}'')
* German language and literature since approximately 1750 (''{{lang|de|Neuere Literaturwissenschaft}}'')
* Specifics of the [[didactics]] of teaching German (''{{lang|de|Fachdidaktik}}'')
Several universities offer specialized curriculae for school teachers, usually called "''{{lang|de|Deutsch (Lehramt)}}''". In Germany, they are leading to a two step exam and certificate by the [[federal states of Germany]] cultural authorities, called the ''{{lang|de|[[Staatsexamen]]}}'' ("state exam").

==German media studies==
In recent years{{when|date=September 2012}}, German{{who|date=September 2012}} has looked for links with the fields of [[communication]]s, [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]].  In addition, the sub-branch of [[film studies]] has established itself.

==History==

As an unsystematic field of interest for individual scholars, German studies can be traced back to [[Tacitus]]' ''Germania''. The publication and study of legal and historical source material, such as Medieval [[Bible]] translations, were all undertaken during the [[German Renaissance]] of the sixteenth century, truly initiating the field of German studies.  As an independent university subject, German studies was introduced at the beginning of the nineteenth century by  [[Georg Friedrich Benecke]], the [[Brothers Grimm]], and [[Karl Lachmann]].

&lt;/score&gt;|width=110|caption=[[Acciaccatura]] notation}}A '''grace note''' is a kind of [[music notation]] denoting several kinds of musical [[ornament (music)|ornaments]]. It is usually printed smaller to indicate that it is melodically and harmonically nonessential. When occurring by itself, a single grace note normally indicates the intention of an [[ornament (music)#Acciaccatura|acciaccatura]]. When they occur in groups, grace notes can be interpreted to indicate any of several different classes of ornamentation, depending on interpretation.

==Notation==
In notation, a grace [[Musical note|note]] is distinguished from a regular note by print size.  A grace note is indicated by printing a note much smaller than a regular note, sometimes with a slash through the note stem (if two or more grace notes, there might be a slash through the note stem of the first note but not the subsequent grace note). The presence or absence of a slash through a note stem is often interpreted to indicate the intention of an acciaccatura or an appoggiatura, respectively.

The works of some composers, especially [[Frédéric Chopin]], may contain long series of notes printed in the small type reserved for grace notes simply to show that the amount of time to be taken up by those notes as a whole unit is a subjective matter to be decided by the performer. Such a group of small printed notes may or may not have an accompanying principal note, and so may or may not be considered as grace notes in analysis.

==Function==
A grace note represents an [[ornament (music)|ornament]], and distinguishing whether a given singular grace note is to be played as an appoggiatura or acciaccatura in the [[performance practice]] of a given historical period (or in the practice of a given [[composer]]) is usually the subject of lively debate. This is because we must rely on literary, interpretative accounts of performance practice in those days before such time as [[audio recording]] was implemented, and even then, only a composer's personal or sanctioned recording could directly document usage.

As either an [[ornament (music)#Appoggiatura|appoggiatura]] or an [[ornament (music)#Acciaccatura|acciaccatura]], grace notes occur as notes of short duration before the sounding of the relatively longer-lasting note which immediately follows them. This longer note, to which any grace notes can be considered harmonically and melodically subservient (except in the cases of certain appoggiaturas, in which the ornament may be held for a longer duration than the note it ornaments), is called the ''principal'' in relation to the grace notes.

A Grace note or notes is always noted in terms of exactly half of its principal note, but may be double or more. Where they are multiple, their proper notation must always equal exactly half of the principal note. (i.e. If the principal note is a quarter-note the grace note must be notated as an eighth- note, two sixteenth notes, four thirty-second notes, or eight sixty-fourth notes, if we are to set aside the concept of unnatural subdivisions of the beat such as the triplet, etc.) Grace notes, unlike what are referred to as [[cue-note]]s, never affect the rhythmic subdivision, or musical "count" of the bar in which they are contained - and therefore, do not require other notes to be dropped from the bar to keep the time signature intact.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dummies.com/art-center/music/piano/playing-grace-notes-trills-and-glissandos-on-the-piano/ , et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in music==
In [[bagpipe]] music there is extensive use of grace notes. Indeed, because the [[chanter]] is not tongued but supplied by a continuous air source from the bag, grace notes are sometimes the only way to differentiate between notes. For example, inserting a grace note between two [[Quarter note|crotchet]]s (quarter notes) played at the same pitch is the only way to indicate them as opposed to them sounding like a single [[Half note|minim]] (half note). Various multiple grace note ornaments are formalised into distinct types, such as ''doublings'', ''throws'', and ''birls''. A single grace note is played on the beat as is the first grace note of a complex ornament such as a doubling. Some complex ornaments, such as ''taorluath'' can be played starting or ending on the beat. Grace notes are typically played as short as possible by lifting the fingers quickly and a short distance off the [[chanter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aVehSJE4P4 BagpipeLessons.com Secrets of Top Pipers: Gracenotes by Jori Chisholm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern editions of [[European classical music|Western classical]] works, editors often seek to eliminate the potential for different interpretations of ornamental symbology, of which grace notes are a prime example, by converting a composer's original ornamental notation into literal notation, the interpretation of which is far less subject to variation. Most modern composers, although by no means all of them, have followed this trend in the ''prima facie'' notation of their works.

In the context of [[Indian classical music]] ([[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] (North Indian), [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] (South Indian)) some specific forms of notes ([[Swara|swara-s]]) fulfill the technique of playing a note ([[swara]]). Such [[Ornament (music)|ornamentic]]  in Indian Classical Music is important for the proper rendition and essential to create the beauty of a [[raga]]. Some notes are linked with its preceding and succeeding note; these linked notes are called '''Kan-swars''' (= ''grace notes'').{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Kan-swars deal with so called ''touch notes''. ''sparsh'' means "touch" in [[Hindi]] ([[Devanagari]]). These ''grace notes'' ([[Ornament (music)#Acciaccatura|acciaccatura]]) are often referred to as '''sparsh-swars'''. ''Kan-swars'' or ''sparsh-swars'' can be executed vocally and on instruments in three ways: 
# using a swift short ''glide'' ([[meend]] or [[ghaseet]]),
# as a ''Sparsh'' (technique of playing a note on a plucked stringed instrument, the movement of notes is ascending) and
# as a ''Krintan'' (the opposite of a Sparsh, movement of notes is descending).
In a book on Sitar compositions, Kan has been defined as 'fast deflection which can be approached while descending or ascending'. The act of Kaṇ being repeated twice, thrice or four times in a single stroke of mizrāb is called Krintan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omenad.net/articles/omeswarlipi.htm Sitar Compositions in Ome Swarlipi.

'''Hau''' is a notion made popular by the French anthropologist [[Marcel Mauss]] in his 1925 book ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss M., ''The gift; forms and functions of exchange in archaic societies'', Translated by Ian Gunnison with an Introduction by . E. [[Evans-Pritchard]], London: Cohen and West, 1966: [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying the practice of gifting, he came to the conclusion that it involved belief in a force binding the receiver and giver. The term 'Hau', used by the [[Māori people|Maori]], became a paradigmatic example for such a view.&lt;ref&gt;MacCormack G., Mauss and the 'Spirit'of the Gift, Oceania,  Vol. 52, No. 4, Jun., 1982 p.286 [[Jstor]]&lt;/ref&gt; Writing at the turn of the century{{when?|date=August 2014}}, Mauss relied on limited sources but his analysis has been expanded and refined.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Godelier]], ''The enigma of the gift''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4812">The '''Hoboken catalogue''' is a catalogue of the musical compositions by [[Joseph Haydn]] compiled by [[Anthony van Hoboken]]. It is intended to cover the composer's entire oeuvre and includes over 750 entries. Its full title in the original German is ''Joseph Haydn, Thematisch-bibliographisches Werkverzeichnis'' ("Joseph Haydn, thematic-bibliographic catalog of works"). The Haydn catalog that now bears Hoboken's name was begun in card format in 1934; work continued until the publication of the third and final book volume in 1978.

Works by Haydn are often indicated using their Hoboken catalogue number, typically in the format "[[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Haydn)|Violin Concerto No. 1]] in C major, Hob. VIIa:1".

==The catalog==
The catalog is a massive work; a currently available version runs to 1936 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Available in pdf format from [https://archive.org/details/JosephHaydnThematisch-bibliographischesWerkverzeichnis].&lt;/ref&gt; Each work is given with an identifying [[incipit]], printed on a single musical line. There is discussion of manuscript sources, early editions, listing in previous catalogs (including the two Haydn prepared), and critical commentary.

==Organization==

Catalogs of composers' works typically follow either a chronological arrangement (sorting by date of composition) or a sorting by musical genre.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of the chronological type are [[Köchel catalogue]] of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s works, or [[Schubert Thematic Catalogue|Otto Erich Deutsch's catalogue]] of [[Franz Schubert]]'s works. Another example of the genre-arranged type is [[Wolfgang Schmieder]]'s catalogue of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s works.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoboken's catalogue is of the latter type; thus the [[Symphony|symphonies]], for example, are in category I, all [[string quartet]]s are in category III, [[piano sonata]]s are in category XVI, and so on.

The institute is financially supported by various media organizations including [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], [[ZDF]], [[RTL Television|RTL]], [[Sky Germany]], [[Axel Springer AG]], the publishing groups [[Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck]], [[Der Spiegel]] and the [[Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg]] (the regional Berlin Media and Film funding organization) among others.
The Institute’s scientific advisory council consists of 25 reputable scholars,&lt;ref&gt;[http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=14 Wissenschaftlicher Beirat, IfM.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720164651/http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=14 |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom gained recognition in the field through media and communication policy-related publications. 
[[Lutz Hachmeister]], a journalist and media scholar, is the founding director of the Institute. The institute has been established as a non-profit, limited liability company ([[gGmbH]]) operates independently, and has no political, party, or economic ties.

==Functions==
According to its mission statement the IfM is “a forum for the media industry, research into communication and current politics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=56 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415231919/http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=56 |archivedate=2010-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to offer “concrete models and options for the solution of mediapolitical challenges” as well as a framework for discussing these with representatives from the political sphere. Its aim is to gain recognition for the economic and public relevance as well as the strategic significance of media policies in modern politics.
The principal task of the Institute is the continuous maintenance of an online media industry database (print-, radio-, TV- and online-media) compiling, amongst other, an annual ranking of the world’s most influential and successful media companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediadb.eu/en.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Further research tasks include:
-	Establishing the theoretical and empirical foundation for a basic understanding of mediapolitical ideas and positions, as well as its specific terminologies
-	Research into the shifting correlation of print- and online media  
-	Publication and editorial supervision of the “Jahrbuch Fernsehen” (German television yearbook).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jahrbuch-fernsehen.de&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute established its good reputation by hosting high ranking colloquiums on media policy. Among the speakers were guests such as: [[Greg Dyke]] ([[British Film Institute]]),  [[Alan Rusbridger]] (Chief Editor of [[The Guardian]]), [[Norman Pearlstine]] (chief content officer of [[Bloomberg L.P.]]), [[Tyler Brûlé]] (founder of the [[Wallpaper*]] magazine), [[Mathias Müller von Blumencron]] and [[Georg Mascolo]] (Chief Editors of [[Der Spiegel]]), [[Ernst Uhrlau]] (President of the German Intelligence Service), [[Viviane Reding]] (EU-commissioner for information society and media), [[David Weinberger]] (fellow at the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]] at [[Harvard Law School]]), and technology scholars [[Evgeny Morozov]] and [[Geert Lovink]].
The IfM was elected one of the most important non-university institutes of media research within the framework of the programme “Germany thinks”,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/prj/for/med/deindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative of the [[Goethe-Institut]].

== Cologne Futures ==
Since 2012 the Institute annually organizes the Cologne Futures, until 2015 by the name Cologne Conference Futures. The conference discusses changes within the media-system - described as Media-evolution - and deals with [[Technology assessment]] in theory and practice. [[Richard Barbrook]], [[Nick Bostrom]], [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]], [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], [[Kathrin Passig]] and [[Tim Wu]] and other experts in the field gave talks on these topics.&lt;ref&gt;http://medienpolitik.eu/cologne-futures/&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015 the conference is hosted in cooperation with the Academy of Media Arts Cologne. Main sponsor is the [[Deutsche Telekom]]. The talks are published and documented by the journal [http://www.medienkorrespondenz.de/ Medienkorrespondenz.]

'''Intercrural sex''' (from inter- and [[Latin]] ''crura'', "legs"), also known as '''femoral'''/'''interfemoral''' '''sex'''/'''intercourse''', is a type of [[non-penetrative sex]], in which a male places the penis between the receiving partner's thighs (often with lubrication)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/interfemoral%20intercourse "interfemoral intercourse"], Dictionary of Sexual Terms, Sex-Lexis.com.&lt;/ref&gt; and thrusts to create friction.

==Male homosexuality==
{{see also|Homosexuality in ancient Greece}}

Intercrural intercourse was a common outlet for [[pederasty in ancient Greece]],{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} because [[anal sex]] was considered demeaning to the receiving partner.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, ''Sex and Social Justice'', pp. 268, 335; Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greek]] term for this practice was διαμηρίζειν ''{{transl|grc|diamērizein}}'' ("to do [something] between the thighs").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dover |first=K. J. |authorlink=Kenneth Dover |title=[[Greek Homosexuality (book)|Greek Homosexuality]] |chapter=The Prosecution of Timarkhus |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=fstPVlTPBRQC&amp;pg=PA98 |accessdate=10 December 2012 |year=1978 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn=0674362616 |oclc=3088711 |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Kenneth Dover]] wrote about this extensively in his book ''[[Greek Homosexuality (book)|Greek Homosexuality]]'' (1978), whence current theories on the subject of sex between men in [[Ancient Greece]] derive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dover |first=K.J.|title=Greek Homosexuality |year=1977 |publisher=MJF Books |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Roughgarden]] refers to standing, face-to-face intercrural intercourse as the "gay male [[missionary position]]" of Ancient Greece in a section of her book ''Evolution's Rainbow'' (2004), which draws heavily on Dover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roughgarden |first=Joan |authorlink=Joan Roughgarden |title=Evolution's Rainbow |year=2004 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intercrural sex among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) is sometimes known as the "[[Princeton University|Princeton]] First-Year", the "[[Oxford University|Oxford]] Style", the "Oxford rub", or the "[[Ivy League]] rub", and is a form of same-gender frottage, or colloquially "[[frot]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50188730?/ The Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. "Princeton"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Piepenburg"&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik|last=Piepenburg|title=What's rub got to do with it?|publisher=''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]''|date=February 2006|accessdate=2011-02-18|pages=74 and 76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2IEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synonyms that refer to schools describe activities of "horny young men during the long, cold winters, away at all-boys schools", especially in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="Piepenburg"/&gt;

Intercrural sex has been proposed as an important part of the sexual lives of a handful of notable historical figures known or thought to have been homosexual or bisexual. According to his biographer Richard Ellmann, [[Oscar Wilde]] was introduced to intercrural sex by [[Robert Baldwin Ross]], and it appears to have been his preferred activity, even over [[oral sex]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/11/30/wilde/index1.html Salon.com Sex | The Oscar Wilde centenary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929160335/http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/11/30/wilde/index1.html |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shaka Zulu]] is speculated to have encouraged intercrural sex among his troops to "create intimacy and loyalty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gevisser |first=Mark |title=Homosexuality in Africa: An Interpretation |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Ovitas Books |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quotes attributed to the Cynic philosophers regarding [[Alexander the Great]], made both during and after his lifetime, seem to presume intercrural sex between Alexander and [[Hephaestion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Robin Lane |title= Alexander the Great |year=1994 |publisher=Penguin Books |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, comments made by a bedmate about [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s thighs led to speculation of intercrural sex between the two in C. A. Tripp's 2005 novel ''[[The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tripp |first=C.A. |authorlink= |author2=Jean Baker|title=The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln |year=2005 |publisher= |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been subject to various historical [[sodomy laws]] and religious restrictions enacted mostly by Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v011/11.2karras01.html Project MUSE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Intercrural sex appears to have been common during the medieval era; for example, a contemporary document titled the "Altercatio Ganimedis et Helene" (The Debate of Helen and Ganymede) depicts Greco-Roman mythical figure [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] describing the "slippery thighs of a boy" as superior to the "stink and gaping looseness of the female cave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boswell |first=John |title=Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century |year=2005 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=[[Chicago]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/europe_medieval,3.html |title=Europe: Medieval |date=2004 |work=glbtq |editor-first=Claude J. |editor-last=Summers |editorlink=Claude J. Summers |publisher=glbtq, Inc. |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1997 report on the sexual health needs of males who have sex with males in the Calcutta suburbs found that 73% of men asked engaged in intercrural sex, though the frequency varied based on demographic factors: only 54% of sex workers, 50% of lower income men and 40% of Muslims reported intercrural sex; while 82% of Hindus and 88% of middle income men reported engaging in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfi.net/downloads/knowledge_centre/NFI%20publications/Situational%20assessments/1997_Calcutta%20Rpt.pdf|title=needs assessment of males who have sex with males in Calcutta and its suburbs|year=1997|publisher=Naz Foundation International|accessdate=26 October 2009|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5863">The '''Klimisch score''' is a method of assessing the [[:wikt:reliability|reliability]] of [[toxicological]] studies, mainly for regulatory purposes, that was proposed by H.J. Klimisch, M. Andreae and U. Tillmann of the chemical company [[BASF]] in 1997 in a paper entitled ''A Systematic Approach for Evaluating the Quality of Experimental Toxicological and Ecotoxicological Data'' which was published in ''[[Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Klimisch, M. Andreae and U. Tillmann (1997): ''A Systematic Approach for Evaluating the Quality of Experimental Toxicological and Ecotoxicological Data'', [[Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]] Vol 25, pp 1–5, {{DOI|10.1006/rtph.1996.1076}}, {{PMID|9056496}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It assigns studies to one of four categories as follows:

{|class="wikitable"
!Score
!Description
!Details (quoted from paper)
|-
|1
| Reliable without restriction
|"This includes studies or data from the literature or reports which were carried out or generated according to generally valid and/or internationally accepted testing guidelines (preferably performed according to GLP) or in which the test parameters documented are based on a specific (national) testing guideline (preferably performed according to GLP) or in which all parameters described are closely related/comparable to a guideline method"
|-
|2
| Reliable with restriction
| "This includes studies or data from the literature, reports (mostly not performed according to GLP), in which the test parameters documented do not totally comply with the specific testing guideline, but are sufficient to accept the data or in which investigations are described which cannot be subsumed under a testing guideline, but which are nevertheless well documented and scientifically acceptable."
|-
|3
| Not reliable
| "This includes studies or data from the literature/reports in which there are interferences between the measuring system and the test substance or in which organisms/test systems were used which are not relevant in relation to the exposure (e.g., unphysiologic pathways of application) or which were carried out or generated according to a method which is not acceptable, the documentation of which is not sufficient for an assessment and which is not convincing for an expert judgment."
|-
|4
| Not assignable
| "This includes studies or data from the literature, which do not give sufficient experimental details and which are only listed in short abstracts or secondary literature (books, reviews, etc.)."
|}

The applicable guidelines are the ([[OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals]], [[EU Test Methods]]), and other such methods.  Often studies are performed to more than one test guideline where they are in agreement as to the requirements.  GLP is [[Good Laboratory Practice]].

The scoring system is the standard method used in both the EU regulatory schemes (e.g. [[REACH Regulation]]).  Generally, only Klimisch scores of 1 or 2 can be used by themselves to cover an endpoint. However, Klimisch score 3 and 4 data can still be used as supporting studies or as part of a [[weight of evidence]] approach. The Klimisch score can be found as a standard field within the [[IUCLID]] database.

[[European Chemicals Agency|ECHA]] has produced guidance on how to assess the reliability of data&lt;ref&gt;http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13632/information_requirements_r4_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Klimisch score has been criticized for favoring studies conducted under [[Good Laboratory Practice]] guidelines, which are mostly industry-funded studies.&lt;ref name="Molander2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Molander | first=Linda | last2=Ågerstrand | first2=Marlene | last3=Beronius | first3=Anna | last4=Hanberg | first4=Annika | last5=Rudén | first5=Christina | title=Science in Risk Assessment and Policy (SciRAP): An Online Resource for Evaluating and ReportingIn Vivo(Eco)Toxicity Studies | journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal | publisher=Informa UK Limited | volume=21 | issue=3 | date=2014-09-30 | issn=1080-7039 | doi=10.1080/10807039.2014.928104 | pages=753–762}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reliable study according to the Klimisch score can actually be highly flawed.&lt;ref name="Kase2016"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1186/s12302-016-0073-x| issn = 2190-4715| volume = 28| pages = 7| last1 = Kase| first1 = Robert| last2 = Korkaric| first2 = Muris| last3 = Werner| first3 = Inge| last4 = Ågerstrand| first4 = Marlene| title = Criteria for Reporting and Evaluating ecotoxicity Data (CRED): comparison and perception of the Klimisch and CRED methods for evaluating reliability and relevance of ecotoxicity studies| journal = Environmental Sciences Europe| date = 2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klimisch score does not assess a number of study design criteria: [[randomization]], [[Blinded experiment|blinding]], [[sample size]] calculation, ….&lt;ref name="Krauth2013"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1289/ehp.1206389| issn = 0091-6765| volume = 121| issue = 9| pages = 985–992| last1 = Krauth| first1 = David| last2 = Woodruff| first2 = Tracey J.| last3 = Bero| first3 = Lisa| title = Instruments for Assessing Risk of Bias and Other Methodological Criteria of Published Animal Studies: A Systematic Review| journal = Environmental Health Perspectives| date = 2013-09 | pmid = 23771496| pmc = 3764080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kozma Petrovich Prutkov''' ({{lang-ru|Козьма́ Петро́вич Прутко́в}}) is a fictional author invented by  [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy]] and his cousins, three Zhemchuzhnikov brothers, [[Alexei Zhemchuzhnikov|Alexei]], [[Vladimir Zhemchuzhnikov|Vladimir]] and [[Alexander Zhemchuzhnikov|Alexander]], during the later part of the rule of [[Nicholas I of Russia]].

The four distinguished satirical poets used this [[pseudonym]] as a collective [[pen name]] to publish [[aphorism]]s, [[fable]]s, [[epigram]]s, [[satire|satiric]], [[humor]]ous and [[nonsense verse]]s in the 1850s&amp;ndash;1860s, most notably in the literary magazine "[[Sovremennik]]" (''The Contemporary'').

According to the ''Biographical data on Kozma Prutkov'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://az.lib.ru/p/prutkow_k_p/text_0010.shtml Биографические сведения о Козьме Пруткове], (Biographical data on Kozma Prutkov), first printed in the ''Full Collection of Works'', 1884 (lib.ru)&lt;/ref&gt; Prutkov was born on April 11, 1803 and died on January 13, 1863. He worked for the government of the [[Russian Empire]] his entire adult life, and in 1820 entered military service as a [[Hussar]] only for the uniform. He worked at the Assay Office (Пробирная Палата) from 1823 until his death, ending up as its director.

The '''LMS Scientific Research Laboratory'''  was set up following the formation of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] in 1923.

In 1929, the Company President, [[Josiah Stamp|Lord Stamp]] read a paper ''Scientific Research in Transport'' to the Institute of  Transport, and, in 1930 he founded the Advisory Committee on Scientific Research for Railways.

The Scientific Research Laboratory was formed by the Vice-President and Director of Scientific Research, [[Sir Harold Hartley]]. Purpose-built accommodation was provided on the west side of London Road, [[Derby]] which opened in December 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=L.M.S. Problems to be solved at Derby |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000521/19351209/030/0004 |newspaper=Derby Daily Telegraph |location=England |date=9 December 1935 |access-date=17 June 2017 |via=British Newspaper Archive |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The various paint and varnish laboratories were amalgamated and brought there, joining the textile research from Calvert Street and the metallurgy and general engineering research in the locomotive works. In addition the laboratory liaised with various university departments, its remit covering all areas of railway operation.

In 1936 an aerodynamics laboratory was formed, located in the locomotive works, using 1/24 scale models. It was involved in the design work for [[William Stanier|Stanier]]'s [[LMS Princess Coronation Class|Coronation]] locomotives, and went on to assess smoke deflectors, carriage ventilation and the effect of passing trains on structures and passengers in stations. This passed to the Derby College of Technology in 1960. The [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] Testing Station was opened in 1948 as a joint venture with the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]].

Work continued into the nationalised era, when a decision was made to concentrate various headquarters functions, particularly that of the Chief Mechanical and Electrical Engineer, in one national centre. This produced the [[Railway Technical Centre]] (RTC) on the opposite side of London Road, on a site which had formerly been part of the Way and Works sidings. Part of the RTC would be occupied by a new [[British Rail Research Division]], reporting directly to the [[British Railways Board|Board]], under the Chief Civil Engineer's Department. This went on, in addition to its other work into all aspects of the railway, to design the experimental version of the [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT-E).  The Scientific Research Laboratory was renamed Hartley House, and formed the Scientific Services department of the Research Division.

Later, after British Rail privatisation and the sale of the Research Division to [[AEA Technology]], the Scientific Services department was separately privatised to form the company "Scientifics Ltd".

This is a '''list of [[liberal arts colleges in the United States]]'''. [[Liberal arts college]]s in the United States are usually four-year colleges which lead students to a [[bachelor's degree]]; some such as [[Augsburg University]] and [[Point Loma Nazarene University]] lead students to obtaining a [[master's degree|master's]] or [[doctoral degree]].

These schools are [[higher education in the United States|American institutions of higher education]] which have traditionally emphasized interactive instruction (although research is still a component of these institutions). They are known for being [[Residential college|residential]] and for having smaller enrollment, class size, and teacher-student ratios than [[universities]]. These colleges also encourage a high level of teacher-student interaction at the center of which are classes taught by full-time faculty, rather than graduate student [[teaching assistant]]s who often teach classes at large research-oriented [[universities]]. The colleges may be [[coeducational]] or [[Single-sex education#United States|single-sex]], [[Private university#United States|private]] or [[Public university#United States|public]], and either [[secular]] or affiliated with a [[religious body]]. Some are [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black colleges]]. Some – such as [[Beloit College]], [[Bard College at Simon's Rock]], [[Hampshire College]], [[Reed College]], [[Bard College]], [[Pitzer College]], [[Sarah Lawrence College]], [[Bennington College]], [[Oberlin College]], [[Shimer College]] and [[New College of Florida]] – offer [[alternative education|experimental curricula]].

Library science (often termed library studies or library and information science) is an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary field that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools of management, information technology, education, and other areas to libraries; the collection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of information resources; and the political economy of [[information]]. Most professional library jobs require a professional [[Postgraduate education|post-baccalaureate degree]] in library science as a basic credential but this varies widely in different countries. There are also bachelor's, associate, and certificate programs in library science, which provide formal training of [[paraprofessional]] library workers, library technicians, and clerks—as well as preparation for graduate study in library science. A [[library school]] is an [[higher education|institution of higher learning]] specializing in the professional training of librarians. {{as of|2012|April|}} there are 63 [[American Library Association]]-accredited [[Library science]] programs in Canada and the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/directory/alphalist ALA | Alphabetical List of Institutions with ALA-accredited Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; and {{as of|2014|July|lc=y}}, 16 UK institutions offering [[CILIP]]-accredited programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cilip.org.uk/cilip/jobs-careers/starting-library-and-information-career/how-become-librarian-or-information |title=CILIP List of Accredited Qualifications |access-date=2014-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709141658/http://www.cilip.org.uk/cilip/jobs-careers/starting-library-and-information-career/how-become-librarian-or-information |archive-date=2014-07-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of printing}}
'''Lithography''' ({{ety|grc|''[[wikt:λίθος|λίθος]]'', lithos|stone||''[[wikt:γράφειν|γράφειν]]'', graphein|to write}})&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lithography |volume=16 |pages=785–789 |first=Frederick Vincent |last=Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of [[printing]] originally based on the [[miscibility|immiscibility]] of oil and water.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Peter. (1964) ''The Technique of Lithography''. London: [[B.T. Batsford]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The printing is from a stone ([[lithographic limestone]]) or a metal plate with a smooth surface. It was invented in 1796 by German author and actor [[Alois Senefelder]] as a cheap method of publishing theatrical works.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. (1998) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 146 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carterpage11"&gt;Carter, Rob, Ben Day, Philip Meggs. Typographic Design: Form and Communication, Third Edition. (2002) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Lithography can be used to print text or [[artwork (graphic arts)|artwork]] onto paper or other suitable material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lithography and Lithographers |publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Publisher |place=London |year=1915 |editor=Pennel ER |url=https://archive.org/details/lithographylitho00penn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithography originally used an image drawn with oil, fat, or wax onto the surface of a smooth, level [[lithographic limestone]] plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and [[gum arabic]], ''[[etching]]'' the portions of the stone that were not protected by the grease-based image. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these etched areas retained water; an [[offset ink|oil-based ink]] could then be applied and would be repelled by the water, sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a blank [[paper]] sheet, producing a [[printing|printed page]]. This traditional technique is still used in some [[fine art]] printmaking applications.

In modern lithography, the image is made of a [[polymer]] coating applied to a flexible plastic or metal plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk/digital-photographic.html|title=Digital &amp; Photographic|first=James|last=Hill|website=www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image can be printed directly from the plate (the orientation of the image is reversed), or it can be [[offset printing|offset]], by transferring the image onto a flexible sheet (rubber) for printing and publication.

As a printing technology, lithography is different from [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]] (gravure), wherein a plate is either [[engraving|engraved]], [[etching|etched]], or [[mezzotint|stippled]] to score cavities to contain the printing ink; and [[woodblock printing]] or [[letterpress]] printing, wherein ink is applied to the raised surfaces of letters or images. Today, most types of high-volume books and magazines, especially when illustrated in colour, are printed with [[offset lithography]], which has become the most common form of printing technology since the 1960s.

The related term "[[photolithography]]" refers to when photographic images are used in lithographic printing, whether these images are printed directly from a stone or from a metal plate, as in offset printing. "Photolithography" is used synonymously with "offset printing".  The technique as well as the term were introduced in Europe in the 1850s. Beginning in the 1960s, photolithography has played an important role in the fabrication and [[mass production]] of [[integrated circuit]]s  in the [[microelectronics industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannavy, John. editor. ''Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century photography: A-I, index, Volume 1.'' Taylor &amp; Francis (2008). {{ISBN|9780415972352}}. page 865.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansuripur, Masud. ''Classical Optics and Its Applications''. Cambridge University Press (2002) {{ISBN|9780521804998}}. page 416&lt;/ref&gt;

==The principle of lithography==
Lithography uses simple chemical processes to create an image.  For instance, the positive part of an image is a water-repelling ("[[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]") substance, while the negative image would be water-retaining ("[[hydrophilic]]").  Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible printing ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image.  This allows a flat print plate to be used, enabling much longer and more detailed print runs than the older physical methods of printing (e.g., [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]], [[letterpress printing]]).

Lithography was invented by [[Alois Senefelder]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] in 1796.  In the early days of lithography, a smooth piece of [[limestone]] was used (hence the name "lithography": "lithos" (λιθος) is the ancient Greek word for stone).  After the oil-based image was put on the surface, a solution of [[gum arabic]] in water was applied, the gum sticking only to the non-oily surface. During printing, water adhered to the gum arabic surfaces and was repelled by the oily parts, while the oily ink used for printing did the opposite.

===Lithography on limestone===
[[Image:Litography negative stone and positive paper.jpg|thumb|Lithography stone and [[mirror image]] print of a map of Munich]]

Lithography works because of the mutual [[Hydrophobe|repulsion of oil and water]]. The image is drawn on the surface of the print plate with a fat or oil-based medium (hydrophobic) such as a wax crayon, which may be pigmented to make the drawing visible. A wide range of oil-based media is available, but the durability of the image on the stone depends on the [[lipid]] content of the material being used, and its ability to withstand water and acid. After the drawing of the image, an aqueous [[solution]] of [[gum arabic]], weakly acidified with nitric acid {{chem|HNO|3}} is applied to the stone. The function of this solution is to create a hydrophilic layer of [[calcium nitrate]] salt, {{chem|Ca(NO|3|)|2}}, and gum arabic on all non-image surfaces.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The gum solution penetrates into the pores of the stone, completely surrounding the original image with a hydrophilic layer that will not accept the printing ink. Using lithographic [[turpentine]], the printer then removes any excess of the greasy drawing material, but a hydrophobic molecular film of it remains tightly bonded to the surface of the stone, rejecting the gum arabic and water, but ready to accept the oily ink.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hoen &amp; Co.|A. B. Hoen]], Discussion of the Requisite Qualities of Lithographic Limestone, with Report on Tests of the Lithographic Stone of Mitchell County, Iowa, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBIMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA339&amp;pg=RA1-PA339 Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1902], Des Moines, 1903; pages 339–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gascoigne|first1=Bamber|title=How to Identify Prints: a complete guide to manual and mechanical processes from woodcut to ink jet|date=1988|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=Spain|page=1c}}&lt;/ref&gt; When printing, the stone is kept wet with water. Naturally the water is attracted to the layer of gum and salt created by the acid wash. [[Printing ink]] based on drying oils such as [[linseed oil]] and varnish loaded with [[pigment]] is then rolled over the surface. The water repels the greasy ink but the hydrophobic areas left by the original drawing material accept it. When the hydrophobic image is loaded with ink, the stone and paper are run through a press that applies even pressure over the surface, transferring the ink to the paper and off the stone.

Senefelder had experimented during the early 19th century with multicolor lithography; in his 1819 book, he predicted that the process would eventually be perfected and used to reproduce paintings.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; Multi-color printing was introduced by a new process developed by [[Godefroy Engelmann]] (France) in 1837 known as [[chromolithography]].&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; A separate stone was used for each color, and a print went through the press separately for each stone. The main challenge was to keep the images aligned (''[[Printing registration|in register]]''). This method lent itself to images consisting of large areas of flat color, and resulted in the characteristic poster designs of this period.

"Lithography, or printing from soft stone, largely took the place of engraving in the production of English commercial maps after about 1852. It was a quick, cheap process and had been used to print British army maps during the [[Peninsula War]]. Most of the commercial maps of the second half of the 19th century were lithographed and unattractive, though accurate enough."&lt;ref&gt;Lynam, Edward. 1944. British Maps and Map Makers. London: W. Collins. Page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern lithographic process===
{{main|Offset printing}}
[[Image:Gubernie zachodnie krolestwo polskie 1902.jpg|thumb|A 1902 lithograph map (original size 33×24 cm)]]

High-volume lithography is used presently to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging—just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using [[Offset printing|offset lithography]].

For offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used instead of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive [[emulsion]].  A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created by direct laser imaging in a CTP ([[Computer to plate|Computer-To-Plate]]) device known as a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. Non-image portions of the emulsion have traditionally been removed by a chemical process, though in recent times plates have come available that do not require such processing.

[[Image:Litography press with map of Moosburg 02.jpg|thumb|left|Lithography press for printing maps in Munich]]
[[Image:Lithography machine in Bibliotheca Alexandrina.jpg|thumb|right|Lithography machine in [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
The plate is affixed to a cylinder on a printing press. Dampening rollers apply water, which covers the blank portions of the plate but is repelled by the emulsion of the image area. Hydrophobic ink, which is repelled by the water and only adheres to the emulsion of the image area, is then applied by the inking rollers.

If this image were transferred directly to paper, it would create a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber ''blanket'', which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or ''offset'' to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as ''offset lithography'' or ''[[offset printing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see diagram at [http://www.compassrose.com/static/Offset.jpg compassrose.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many innovations and technical refinements have been made in printing processes and presses over the years, including the development of [[Printing press|presses]] with multiple units (each containing one printing plate) that can print multi-color images in one pass on both sides of the sheet, and presses that accommodate continuous rolls (''webs'') of paper, known as web presses. Another innovation was the continuous dampening system first introduced by Dahlgren, instead of the old method (conventional dampening) which is still used on older presses, using rollers covered with molleton (cloth) that absorbs the water. This increased control of the water flow to the plate and allowed for better ink and water balance. Current dampening systems include a "delta effect or vario," which slows the roller in contact with the plate, thus creating a sweeping movement over the ink image to clean impurities known as "hickies".

The process of lithography printing is illustrated by [http://www.istc.illinois.edu/info/library_docs/manuals/printing/images/offsetlitho.gif this simplified diagram]. This press is also called an ink pyramid because the ink is transferred through several layers of rollers with different purposes. Fast lithographic 'web' printing presses are commonly used in newspaper production.

The advent of [[desktop publishing]] made it possible for type and images to be modified easily on personal computers for eventual printing by desktop or commercial presses. The development of digital [[imagesetter]]s enabled print shops to produce negatives for platemaking directly from digital input, skipping the intermediate step of photographing an actual page layout. The development of the digital [[platesetter]] during the late 20th century eliminated film negatives altogether by exposing printing plates directly from digital input, a process known as [[computer to plate]] printing.

==Microlithography and nanolithography==
{{Main|Photolithography}}
Microlithography and [[nanolithography]] refer specifically to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 [[micrometers]] are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 [[nanometers]] are considered nanolithographic. [[Photolithography]] is one of these methods, often applied to [[semiconductor]] manufacturing of [[integrated circuit|microchips]]. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated [[photomask]] or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.

Although photolithographic technology is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example [[electron beam lithography]], are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes as small as a few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of [[maskless lithography]], in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a [[resist]]-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.

In addition to these commercially well-established techniques, a large number of promising microlithographic and [[nanolithography|nanolithographic]] technologies exist or are being developed, including [[nanoimprint lithography]], [[interference lithography]], [[X-ray lithography]], [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]], [[magnetolithography]] and [[scanning probe lithography]]. Some of these new techniques have been used successfully for small-scale commercial and important research applications.
Surface-charge lithography, in fact [[Plasma desorption mass spectrometry]] can be directly patterned on polar dielectric crystals via pyroelectric effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grilli | first1 = S. | last2 = Vespini | first2 = V. | last3 = Ferraro | first3 = P. | year = 2008 | title = Surface-charge lithography for direct pdms micro-patterning | url = | journal = Langmuir | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 13262–13265 | doi = 10.1021/la803046j | pmid=18986187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lithography as an artistic medium==
[[File:Redon smiling-spider.jpg|thumb|left|''Smiling Spider'' by [[Odilon Redon]], 1891]]
During the first years of the 19th century, lithography had only a limited effect on [[printmaking]], mainly because technical difficulties remained to be overcome. Germany was the main center of production in this period. [[Godefroy Engelmann]], who moved his press from [[Mulhouse]] to Paris in 1816, largely succeeded in resolving the technical problems, and during the 1820s lithography was adopted by artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] and [[Géricault]]. After early experiments such as ''Specimens of Polyautography'' (1803),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=''Specimens of Polyautography, Consisting of Impressions taken from Original Drawings, Made on Stone purposely for this Work’' | date=1803|  publisher=Philipp André| location=London|  url=http://primo.getty.edu/GRI:GETTY_ALMA21118663020001551}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had experimental works by  a number of British artists including [[Benjamin West]], [[Henry Fuseli]],  [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], [[Thomas Barker of Bath]],  [[Thomas Stothard]],   [[Henry Richard Greville]], [[Richard Cooper Jr.|Richard Cooper]],   [[Henry Singleton (painter)|Henry Singleton]], and  [[William Henry Pyne]], London also became a center, and some of Géricault's prints were in fact produced there. [[Goya]] in Bordeaux produced his last series of prints by lithography—''The Bulls of Bordeaux'' of 1828. By the mid-century the initial enthusiasm had somewhat diminished in both countries, although the use of lithography was increasingly favored for commercial applications, which included the prints of [[Daumier]], published in newspapers. [[Rodolphe Bresdin]] and [[Jean-François Millet]] also continued to practice the medium in France, and [[Adolf Menzel]] in Germany. In 1862 the publisher Cadart tried to initiate a portfolio of lithographs by various artists, which was not successful but included several prints by [[Manet]]. The revival began during the 1870s, especially in France with artists such as [[Odilon Redon]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]] and [[Degas]] producing much of their work in this manner. The need for strictly limited [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]s to maintain the price had now been realized, and the medium became more accepted.

[[File:Edvard Munch - Self-Portrait (1895) G0192-59 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self Portrait with Skeleton Arm'' by [[Edvard Munch]]]]
In the 1890s, color lithography gained success in part by the emergence of [[Jules Chéret]], known as the ''father of the modern poster'', whose work went on to inspire a new generation of poster designers and painters, most notably [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], and former student of Chéret, [[Georges de Feure]]. By 1900 the medium in both color and monotone was an accepted part of printmaking.

During the 20th century, a group of artists, including [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]], [[Chagall]], [[Dufy]], [[Léger]], [[Matisse]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], and [[Picasso]], rediscovered the largely undeveloped artform of lithography thanks to the [[Mourlot Studios]], also known as ''Atelier Mourlot'', a Parisian printshop founded in 1852 by the Mourlot family. The Atelier Mourlot originally specialized in the printing of wallpaper; but it was transformed when the founder's grandson, [[Fernand Mourlot]], invited a number of 20th-century artists to explore the complexities of fine art printing. Mourlot encouraged the painters to work directly on lithographic stones in order to create original artworks that could then be executed under the direction of master printers in small editions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/36544351/PICASSO_LITHOGRAPHER_AND_ACTIVIST|title=Picasso lithographer and activist|last=Orozco|first=Miguel|publisher=Academia.edu|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The combination of modern artist and master printer resulted in lithographs that were used as posters to promote the artists' work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot History of 20th century lithography by Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Braque, Leger at Atelier Mourlot, French Institute Alliance Française] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723085822/http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot |date=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mourlot, Fernand. ''Twentieth Century Posters.'' Wellfleet Press: Secaucus, New Jersey, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grant Wood]], [[George Bellows]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Max Kahn]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Eleanor Coen]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[David Hockney]], [[Susan Dorothea White]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] are a few of the artists who have produced most of their prints in the medium. [[M. C. Escher]] is considered a master of lithography, and many of his prints were created using this process. More than other printmaking techniques, [[printmaker]]s in lithography still largely depend on access to good [[Printer (publishing)|printer]]s, and the development of the medium has been greatly influenced by when and where these have been established.
{{Further|List of printmakers}}
As a special form of lithography, the serilith process is sometimes used. Seriliths are mixed media original prints created in a process in which an artist uses the [[lithograph]] and [[serigraph]] processes. The separations for both processes are hand-drawn by the artist. The serilith technique is used primarily to create fine art limited print editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrysideart.com/serigraphy.htm|title=What is a Serilith?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Malthusian trap''' or '''population trap''' is a condition whereby excess population would stop growing due to shortage of food supply leading to starvation. It is named for [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], who suggested that while technological advances could increase a society's supply of resources, such as food, and thereby improve the standard of living, the resource abundance would enable [[population growth]], which would eventually bring the per capita supply of resources back to its original level.  Some economists contend that since the [[industrial revolution]], mankind has broken out of the trap.&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Galor |first=Oded |year=2005 |chapter=From Stagnation to Growth: Unified Growth Theory |title=Handbook of Economic Growth |volume=1 |pages=171–293 |publisher=Elsevier |chapterurl=https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/grochp/1-04.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Gregory |year=2007 |title=A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-12135-2 |title-link=A Farewell to Alms }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the continuation of [[extreme poverty]] indicates that the Malthusian trap continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Zinkina &amp; [[Andrey Korotayev]].

''World Futures'' 70/2 (2014): 120–39].&lt;/ref&gt; Others further argue that due to lack of food availability coupled with excessive pollution, developing countries show more evidence of the trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/197551/2/WP59.pdf|title=The Malthusian Trap and Development in Pre-Industrial Societies: A View Differing from the Standard One|last=Tisdell|first=Clem|date=1 January 2015|website=University of Queensland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malthus' theoretical argument==
Malthus argued that society has a natural propensity to increase its population, a propensity that causes population growth to be the best measure of the happiness of a people: "The happiness of a country does not depend, absolutely, upon its poverty, or its riches, upon its youth, or its age, upon its being thinly, or fully inhabited, but upon the rapidity with which it is increasing, upon the degree in which the yearly increase of food approaches to the yearly increase of an unrestricted population."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus, Essay on the Principle of Population, Ch. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the propensity for population increase also leads to a natural cycle of abundance and shortages:
{{quote|We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population...increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions, must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease; while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great, that population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land; to turn up fresh soil, and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened; and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.|Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', Chapter II.}}

Malthus faced opposition from economists both during his life and since. A vocal critic several decades later was [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 |last=Engels |first=Fredrick |authorlink= |year=1892 |publisher= Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co |location= London |isbn= |url= http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1844engels.html }} Engels wrote that poverty and poor living conditions in 1844 had largely disappeared.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0521808781 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence to support the theory===
Research indicates that technological superiority and higher land productivity had significant positive effects on population density but insignificant effects on the standard of living during the time period 1–1500 AD.&lt;ref name="Ashraf and Galor, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ashraf |first=Quamrul |first2=Oded |last2=Galor |year=2011 |title=Dynamics and Stagnation in the Malthusian Epoch |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=2003–41 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.5.2003 |pmid=25506082 |pmc=4262154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, scholars have reported on the lack of a significant trend of wages in various places over the world for very long stretches of time.&lt;ref name="Clark2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=R. C. |title=The Great Divergence in European Wages and Prices from the Middle Ages to the First World War |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=411–47 |year=2001 |doi=10.1006/exeh.2001.0775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Babylonia during the period 1800 to 1600 BC, for example, the daily wage for a common laborer was enough to buy about 15 pounds of wheat.  In Classical Athens in about 328 BC, the corresponding wage could buy about 24 pounds of wheat.  In England in 1800 AD the wage was about 13 pounds of wheat.&lt;ref name="Clark2007"/&gt;{{rp|50}} In spite of the technological developments across these societies, the daily wage hardly varied. In Britain between 1200 and 1800, only relatively minor fluctuations from the mean (less than a factor of two) in real wages occurred.  Following depopulation by the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics, real income in Britain peaked around 1450–1500 and began declining until the [[British Agricultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] posits that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death throughout Europe had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labor, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making employers and landowners less well off while improving the economic prospects and living standards of workers. He says that "the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations." This leveling effect was reversed by a "demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292–93, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fogel]] published a study of lifespans and nutrition from about a century before Malthus to the 19th century that examined European birth and death records, military and other records of height and weight that found significant stunted height and low body weight indicative of chronic hunger and malnutrition.  He also found short lifespans that he attributed to chronic malnourishment which left people susceptible to disease.  Lifespans, height and weight began to steadily increase in the UK and France after 1750.  Fogel's findings are consistent with estimates of available food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0-521-80878-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Malthusian view==
{{See also|Malthusianism}}
The rapid increase in the global population since 1900 exemplifies Malthus's predicted population patterns, whereby expansion of food supply has encouraged population growth. "Neo-Malthusianism" may be used as a label for those who are concerned that [[human overpopulation]] may increase [[resource depletion]] or [[environmental degradation]] to a degree that is not [[sustainability|sustainable]]. Many in [[environmentalism|environmental movements]] express concern over the potential dangers of population growth.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Post War Intellectual Roots of the Population Bomb |author1=Pierre Desrochers |author2=Christine Hoffbauer |journal=[[International Policy Network|The Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development]] |url=http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |year=2009 |volume=1 |issue=3 |accessdate=2010-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302185414/http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |archivedate=March 2, 2012 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- maybe highlight in text that opinions are from fake journal from pressure group, no CiteSeerX cite --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, ecologist [[Garrett Hardin]] published an influential essay in ''Science'' that drew heavily from Malthusian theory. His essay, [[Tragedy of the commons|"The Tragedy of the Commons,"]] argued that "a finite world can support only a finite population" and that "freedom to breed will bring ruin to all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardin|first=Garrett|year=1968|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|journal=Science|volume=162|issue=3859|pages=1243–1248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Club of Rome]] published a famous book entitled ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UOcUZ9uquhEC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Taking Nature Into Account: A Report to the Club of Rome |editor=Wouter van Dieren |year=1995 |publisher=Springer Books |isbn=978-0-387-94533-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] is a prominent neo-Malthusian who first raised concerns in 1968 with the publication of ''[[The Population Bomb]]''.

On the other hand, in 2011 [[Andrey Korotayev]] and his colleagues suggested that the emergence of major sociopolitical upheavals at the escape from the Malthusian trap is not an abnormal, but a regular phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Korotayev"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=A. |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/79t737gt |title=A Trap At The Escape From The Trap?

==Theory that society has overcome the trap==
{{See also|Industrial Revolution#Causes|British Agricultural Revolution}}
The view that a "breakout" from the Malthusian trap has led to an era of sustained economic growth is explored by "[[unified growth theory]]".&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)" /&gt; One branch of unified growth theory is devoted to the interaction between human evolution and economic development. Some argue that natural selection during the Malthusian epoch selected beneficial traits to the growth process and brought about the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Galor |first=Oded |first2=Omer |last2=Moav |year=2002 |title=Natural Selection and The Origin of Economic Growth |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=1133–91 |doi=10.1162/003355302320935007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.199.2634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers contend that a British breakout occurred due to technological improvements and structural change away from agricultural production, while coal, capital, and trade played a minor role.&lt;ref&gt;Tepper, Alexander and Karol J. Borowiecki. Accounting for Breakout in Britain: The Industrial Revolution through a Malthusian Lens (2013). Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report 639. Available at: https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fednsr/639.html&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] has argued, in his book ''[[A Farewell to Alms]]'', that a British breakout may have been caused by differences in reproduction rates among the rich and the poor (the rich were more likely to marry, tended to have more children, and, in a society where disease was rampant and childhood mortality at times approached 50%, upper-class children were more likely to survive to adulthood than poor children.) This in turn led to sustained "downward mobility": the descendants of the rich becoming more populous in British society and spreading [[middle-class values]] such as hard work and literacy.

A '''mating call''' is the auditory signal used by animals to attract mates. It can occur in males or females, but literature is abundantly favored toward researching mating calls in males. In addition, mating calls are often the subject of [[mate choice]], in which the preferences of one gender for a certain type of mating call can drive sexual selection in a species. This can result in [[sympatric speciation]] of some animals, where two species diverge from each other while living in the same environment.

There are many different mechanisms to produce mating calls, which can be broadly categorized into vocalizations and mechanical calls. Vocalizations are considered as sounds produced by the [[larynx]] and are often seen in species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and insects. Mechanical calls refer to any other type of sound that the animal produces using unique body parts and/or tools for communication with potential mates. Examples include crickets that vibrate their wings, birds that flap their feathers, and frogs that use an air sac instead of lungs.

== Vocalizations ==

=== Birds ===
[[File:Song Sparrow (8381415679).jpg|thumb|Song sparrow]]
[[File:SND 4458a.ogg|thumb|Mating call of Japanese bush warbler,  ''Horornis diphone'']]The use of vocalizations is widespread in avian species and are often used to attract mates. Different aspects and features of bird song such as structure, amplitude and frequency have evolved as a result of sexual selection.&lt;ref name=nemeth2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nemeth|first=E|author2=Kempenaers, B |author3=Matessi, G |author4= Brumm, H |title=Rock sparrow song reflects male age and reproductive success.|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=8|pages=e43259|pmid=22927955|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0043259 |pmc=3426517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large song repertoires are preferred by females of many avian species.&lt;ref name=pfaff2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pfaff|first=JA|author2=Zanette, L |author3=MacDougall-Shackleton, SA |author4= MacDougall-Shackleton, EA |title=Song repertoire size varies with HVC volume and is indicative of male quality in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia).|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|date=Aug 22, 2007|volume=274|issue=1621|pages=2035–40|pmid=17567560|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0170 |pmc=2275172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One hypothesis for this is that song repertoire is positively correlated with the size of the brain's [[HVC (avian brain region)|song control nucleus]] (HVC). A large HVC would indicate developmental success. In [[song sparrow]]s, males with large repertoires had larger HVCs, better body condition and lower heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios indicating better immune health. This supports the idea that song sparrows with large song repertoires have better lifetime fitness and that song repertoires are honest indicators of the male's "quality". Possible explanations for this adaptation include direct benefits to the female, such as superior parental care or territory defense, and indirect benefits, such as good genes for their offspring.&lt;ref name=pfaff2007 /&gt;

[[Japanese bush warbler]] songs from island populations have an acoustically simple structure when compared to mainland populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamao|first=Shoji|title=Acoustic structure of songs in island populations of the Japanese bush warbler, Cettia diphone, in relation to sexual selection|journal=Journal of Ethology|year=2012|volume=31|issue=1|pages=9–15|doi=10.1007/s10164-012-0341-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Song complexity is correlated with higher levels of sexual selection in mainland populations, showing that a more complex song structure is advantageous in an environment with high levels of sexual selection. Another example is in [[purple-crowned fairywren]]s; larger males of this species sing advertising songs at a lower frequency than smaller rival males. Since body size is a characteristic of good health, lower frequency calls are a form of honest signaling. Negative correlation between body size and call frequency is supported across multiple species within the taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=ML|author2=Kingma, SA |author3=Peters, A |title=Male songbird indicates body size with low-pitched advertising songs.|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2013|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e56717|pmid=23437221|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0056717|pmc=3577745}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[rock sparrow]], song frequency is positively associated with reproductive success. Slower song rate is associated with age and is preferred by females. Reproductive status of the individual is communicated through higher maximum frequency. There was also positive correlation between age and extra pair copulation frequency.&lt;ref name=nemeth2012/&gt;[[File:Red deer stag 2009 denmark.jpg|thumb|Red deer stag during rut]]

Bird calls are also known to continue after pair formation in several socially [[Monogamous pairing in animals|monogamous]] bird species. In one experimental population of [[zebra finch]]es, there was increased singing activity by the male after breeding.&lt;ref name="bolund2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolund|first=Elisabeth|author2=Schielzeth, Holger |author3=Forstmeier, Wolfgang |title=Singing activity stimulates partner reproductive investment rather than increasing paternity success in zebra finches|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2012|volume=66|issue=6|pages=975–984|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1346-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase is positively correlated with the partner's reproductive investment. The female finches were bred in cages with two subsequent males that differed with varying amounts of song output. Females produced larger [[Bird egg|eggs]] with more orange yolks when paired with a male with a high song output. This suggests that the relative amount of song production in paired zebra finch males might function to stimulate the partner rather than to attract extra-pair females.&lt;ref name="bolund2012" /&gt;

=== Mammals ===
During the [[breeding season]], mammals will call out to the opposite sex. Male [[koala]]s that are bigger will let out a different sound than smaller koalas. The bigger males which are routinely sought out for are called sires. Females choose sires because of indirect benefits that their offspring could inherit, like larger bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlton | first1 = B.

Acoustic signaling is a type of call that can be used from a significant distance encoding an organism's location, condition and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkins | first1 = M.

When females hear these songs, named a 'whistle', they call onto the males to breed with a screech of their own. This action is termed 'calling of the sexes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = SONGS , SCENTS , AND SENSES : SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE GREATER SAC-WINGED BAT , SACCOPTERYX BILINEATA | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 1401–1410 | doi=10.1644/08-mamm-s-060.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Red deer]] and [[spotted hyena]]s along with other mammals also perform acoustic signaling.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, C.

[[File:Tungara Frog (Engystomops pustulosus) Calling.jpg|thumb|Tungara frog]]

=== Amphibians ===
Most frogs use an air sac located under their mouth to produce mating calls. Air from the lungs channels to the air sac to inflate it, and the air sac resonates to produce a mating call. The larynx is larger and more developed in males, which causes their call to be louder and stronger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilczynski | first1 = W. | last2 = McClelland | first2 = B. E. | last3 = Rand | first3 = A.

In the [[Tungara frog|túngara frog]], males use a whining call followed by up to seven clucks. Males who have a whine-cluck call are more successful in attracting females than males whose call is a whine alone. The ability to produce clucks is due to a specialized fibrous mass attached to the frog's vocal folds, creating an unusual vocalization similar to the two-voiced songs found in some birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Animal communication: Complex call production in the túngara frog|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7089/full/441038a.html|journal = Nature|date = 2006-05-04|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 38-38|volume = 441|issue = 7089|doi = 10.1038/441038a|first = M.|last = Gridi-Papp|first2 = A. S.|last2 = Rand|first3 = M. J.|last3 = Ryan|pmid=16672962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common toad]], sexual competition is driven in large part by fighting—successful males often physically displaced other males from the backs of a female in order to gain access to mating with that female. Larger males were more successful in such takeovers, and had higher reproductive success as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Competitive mate searching in male common toads, Bufo bufo|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347279900708|journal = Animal Behaviour|pages = 1253–1267|volume = 27|doi = 10.1016/0003-3472(79)90070-8|first = N.B.|last = Davies|first2 = T.R.|last2 = Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vocalizations of these toads provide a reliable signal of body size and thus fighting ability, allowing contests for possession of females to be settled without risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deep croaks and fighting assessment in toads Bufo bufo|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v274/n5672/abs/274683a0.html|journal = Nature|date = 1978-08-17|pages = 683–685|volume = 274|issue = 5672|doi = 10.1038/274683a0|first = N. B.|last = Davies|first2 = T. R.|last2 = Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insects ===
While mating calls in insects are usually associated with mechanical mating calls, such as in crickets, several species of insects use vocalizations to attract mates. In the [[Ostrinia furnacalis|Asian corn borer]], males emit clicking sounds that mimic the echolocation of bats which prey on the moths. They then take advantage of the female's "freezing" response to mate with the female.

In the [[Arctiinae (erebid moths)|Japanese lichen moth]], however, the female is able to distinguish between the sounds made by males and those made by bats and other predators.As a result, the males use ultrasonic clicking as a more conventional mating signal, compared to the "deceptive" courtship song used in the Asian Corn Bearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evolution of deceptive and true courtship songs in moths|url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02003|journal = Scientific Reports|date = 2013-06-20|pmc = 3687589|pmid = 23788180|volume = 3|doi = 10.1038/srep02003|first = Ryo|last = Nakano|first2 = Takuma|last2 = Takanashi|first3 = Annemarie|last3 = Surlykke|first4 = Niels|last4 = Skals|first5 = Yukio|last5 = Ishikawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical calls==
Mating calls also take form through mechanical processes. Animals that are unable to vocalize their call may use their body to attract mates.

=== Crickets ===
[[File:Field cricket Gryllus pennsylvanicus.ogg|thumb|Mating call of field cricket, ''Gryllus pennsylvanicus'']]

In the field cricket, ''Gryllus integer'', males rub their wings together to create a rapid trill that produces sound.&lt;ref name="Hedrick, A. V. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = A. V. | year = 2000 | title = Crickets with extravagant mating songs compensate for predation risk with extra caution | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 267 | issue = 1444| pages = 671–675 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1054 | pmid=10821611 | pmc=1690585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males individually vary in the durations of their trilling or, what is more sophisticatedly called, bout length. The bout length of each male is heritable and passed on to his future offspring. Also, females prefer to mate with males that have longer bout lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = AV | year = 1986 | title = Female preferences for male calling bout duration in a field cricket | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 73–77 | doi=10.1007/bf00303845}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result is that males with longer bout lengths produce more offspring than males with shorter bout lengths.

Other factors that influence the formation of these bout lengths include temperature and predation. In field crickets, males prefer warmer sites for mating as shown by an increase in the frequency of their mating calls when they were living in warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = A. | last2 = Perez | first2 = D. | last3 = Lichti | first3 = N. | last4 = Yew | first4 = J. | year = | title = Temperature preferences of male field crickets (Gryllus integer) alter their mating calls | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00359-002-0368-9 | journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology A| volume =  188| issue = | pages =  799–805| doi=10.1007/s00359-002-0368-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predation also affects the mating calls of field crickets. When in a potentially dangerous environment, males cease calling for longer periods of time when interrupted by a predator cue.&lt;ref name="Hedrick, A. V. 2000"/&gt; This suggests that there is an interplay between intensity of mating call and risk of predation.

=== Sonation ===
{{main|Sonation}}
As described in [[Sonation]], "the term sonate is described as the deliberate production of sounds, not from the throat, but rather from structures such as the bill, wings, tail, feet and body feathers, or by the use of tools". In several amphibian and fish species, other special structures are used to produce different sounds to attract mates. Birds are common users of sonation, although several amphibian and fish species have been shown to use sonation as a form of mating call as well. In general, sonation is one factor that plays into how a female may choose a mate. There are other features of mating such as territory defense or mate defense, which contribute to the cause of finding suitable mates.

As outlined below, each species uses a distinct method to produce a non-vocal mating call in order to be most successful in attracting mates. The examples below represent the most common examples found in the literature, although many more examples may exist in nature that are still currently unknown.
[[File:Feather of male Pavo cristatus (Indian peafowl).jpg|thumb|Feather of male ''Pavo cristatus'' (Indian peafowl). These feathers are used in sonation to create infrasound with intent of mating.]]

==== Birds ====
The feathers, the beak, the feet, and different tools are all used by different bird species to produce mating calls to attract mates. For example, the snipe uses its feathers to produce a [[drumming (snipe)|"drumming"]] sound to attract mates during a special mating dance. Snipes used specialized tail feathers to create a sound described as a "rattle" or "throbbing" noise.&lt;ref&gt;Bahr, P. H. "On the "bleating" or "drumming" of the snipe (Gallinago coelestis)." Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Vol. 77. No. 1. Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; Palm cockatoos use sticks to drum on hollow trees, creating a loud noise to attract the attention of mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = Patricia M. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1915 | title = Enhanced: The Music of Nature and the Nature of Music | url = | journal = Science Online | volume = 291 | issue = | pages = 52–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bustards]] are large, highly terrestrial birds that stamp their feet during mating displays to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alonso | first1 = Juan C. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Correlates of male mating success in great bustard leks: the effects of age, weight, and display effort | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 64 | issue = 10| pages = 1589–1600 | doi=10.1007/s00265-010-0972-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mirafra apiata]]'', commonly known as the Clapper lark, engages in a complex display flight that is characterized by the rattling of the wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maclean | first1 = Gordon L | year = 1970 | title = Breeding behaviour of larks in the Kalahari Sandveld | url = | journal = Annals of the Natal Museum | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 388–401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many species of birds use sonation for mating calls such as manakins and hummingbirds. However, peacocks exhibit a feature of sonation that reveals intrasexual and intersexual properties of this type of mating call.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Infrasound in mating displays: a peacock's tale|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347215000391|journal = Animal Behaviour|date = 2015-04-01|pages = 241–250|volume = 102|doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.01.029|first = Angela R.|last = Freeman|first2 = James F.|last2 = Hare}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males move their feathers to produce low-frequency sonations ([[infrasound]]) and sonate more frequently in response to sonations by other males. This is attributable to a male's desire to advertise its presence above other males looking for mates, suggesting that sonation carries an intrasexual function. In addition, females show increased alertness when hearing the infrasound signals produced by males' wing-shaking, which highlights how the two sexes use sonation to interact with each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Fish ====

While most bird species use their feathers, tools, or feet to produce sounds and attract mates, many fish species use specialized internal organs to sonate. In [[Gadidae|Gadoid fish]], special muscles attached to the swimbladder assist in the production of knocking or grunting sounds to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Just Rasmussen | first2 = Knud | year = 1978 | title = The calls of gadoid fish | url = | journal = Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom | volume = 58 | issue = 04| pages = 891–911 | doi=10.1017/s0025315400056848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lepidoptera ====
In many lepidoptera species including the adzuki bean borer ([[Ostrinia scapulalis]]), ultrasonic mating calls are used to attract females and keep them motionless during copulation. These pulses have an average frequency of 40&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takanashi|first=Takuma|last2=Nakano|first2=Ryo|last3=Surlykke|first3=Annemarie|last4=Tatsuta|first4=Haruki|last5=Tabata|first5=Jun|last6=Ishikawa|first6=Yukio|last7=Skals|first7=Niels|date=2010-10-04|title=Variation in Courtship Ultrasounds of Three Ostrinia Moths with Different Sex Pheromones|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013144|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=5|issue=10|pages=e13144|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013144|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speciation due to mating call differences ==

Differences in mating calls can lead to the separation of different populations within a species. These differences can be due to several factors, including body size, temperature, and other ecological factors.These can arise in the form of tonal, temporal, or behavioral variations in mating calls that subsequently lead to the separation of populations. The separation of these populations due to differences in mating call and mating call preferences can lead to the evolution and creation of new, unique species.

This type of speciation is most often sympatric speciation: where two or more species are created from an existing parent species that all live in the same geographic location. Although there is an absence of research on mammals and birds, this phenomenon has been heavily researched in several frog species around the world. The examples below illuminate speciation due to mating call differences in several frog species around the world. These distinct species are included because they are the focus of the majority of current research. 
[[File:Gastrophryne olivacea01a.jpg|thumb|Two ''Microhyla olivacea'' in a mating position]]

=== ''Microhyla olivacea'' and ''Microhyla carolinensis'' ===
These two species of narrow-mouthed frog live in the southern United States and have overlapping ranges in Texas and Oklahoma. Researchers have discovered that these two different species alter the frequencies of their call in the overlap zone of their ranges. For example, the ''Microhyla olivacea'' mating call has a significantly lower midpoint frequency in the overlap zone than the mating call outside this zone. This leads researchers to suggest that the differences in mating call in the overlap zone of ''M. olivacea and M. carolinensis'' act as an isolating mechanism between the two species. They also hypothesize that the evolution of these differences in mating call led to the separation of these two different frog species from one common species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Mating Call in the Speciation of Anuran Amphibians|last = Blair|first = Frank|date = 1958|journal = The American Naturalist|doi = 10.1086/282007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Engystomops petersi 1.jpg|thumb|
''Engystomops petersi''
]]

=== ''Engystomops petersi'' ===
Female preferences for specific male mating calls can lead to sexual selection in mating calls. Females may prefer a specific type of call that certain males possess, in which only those males will be able to mate with females and pass on their genes and specific mating call. As a result, this female preference may lead to divergence of two species.

In Amazonian frogs, sexual selection for different calls has led to the [[Reproductive isolation|behavioral isolation]] and speciation of the túngara frog (''Engystomops petersi)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual selection drives speciation in an Amazonian frog|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1608/399|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2007-02-07|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 1702375|pmid = 17164204|pages = 399–406|volume = 274|issue = 1608|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2006.3736|first = Kathryn E.|last = Boul|first2 = W. Chris|last2 = Funk|first3 = Catherine R.|last3 = Darst|first4 = David C.|last4 = Cannatella|first5 = Michael J.|last5 = Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; From genetic and mating call analysis and, researchers were able to identify that two populations of the túngara frog were almost completely reproductively isolated. From their research, scientists believe that differences in female preferences for mating call type have led to the evolution of this speciation process. Specifically, the Yasuní population females prefer the male mating call that includes a whine, while the other population does not prefer this whine. Subsequently, the Yasuní males include the whine in their call, while the other males do not. For this reason, the differences in call have led to the mechanical separation of this species.

=== ''Pseudacris triseriata'' ===
[[File:Western Chorus Frog (6922520670).jpg|thumb|A Chorus Frog making a mating call]]
Several studies have shown that the species ''Pseudacris triseriata'' (Chorus Frog) can be divided into two subspecies, ''P. t. maculata'' and ''P. t. triseriata,'' due to speciation events from mating call differences. The Chorus Frog has a very large home range, from New Mexico to Southern Canada. These two subspecies have an overlapping range from South Dakota to Oklahoma. In this overlapping range, both the call duration and the calls per second for each species is much different than outside of this range. This means that calls of these two subspecies are more similar outside of this range, and starkly different within the range. For this reason, scientists suggest that these subspecies evolved from differences in mating call type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Speciation within the Chorus Frog Pseudacris triseriata: Morphometric and Mating Call Analyses of the Boreal and Western Subspecies|journal = Copeia|date = 1989-08-08|pages = 704–712|volume = 1989|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/1445498|first = James E.|last = Platz|jstor=1445498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these subspecies are rarely recorded to have hybrid offspring, which further suggests that there is complete speciation due to mating call differences. The differences in mating calls also help to reinforce the speciation process.

{{Judicial interpretation}}
The '''mischief rule'''&lt;ref&gt;http://legal-directory.net/english-law/interpretation-mischief-rule.htm&lt;/ref&gt; is one of three rules of statutory interpretation traditionally applied by English courts.&lt;ref&gt;"The notion has long prevailed that three different rules or approaches may be employed in ascertaining the meaning of a statute. First, there is said to be the "purpose" approach or "mischief rule"... Then there is said to be the "literal" approach or "plain meaning" rule... Finally there is what is called the "golden rule"... Source: Elmer Driedger, ''Construction of Statutes''. Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The other two are the "[[plain meaning rule]]" (also known as the "literal rule") and the "[[golden rule (law)|golden rule]]".

The main aim of the rule is to determine the "mischief and defect" that the statute in question has set out to remedy, and what ruling would effectively implement this remedy. In applying the mischief rule, the court is essentially asking what part of the law did the law not cover, but was meant to be rectified by Parliament in passing the bill.

The rule was first laid out in a 16th-century ruling of the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer Court]].

==Meaning and use==
''Conway v Rimmer'' is a [[rules of construction|rule of construction]] that judges can apply in statutory interpretation in order to discover Parliament's intention. In applying the rule, the court is essentially asking what the mischief was that the previous law did not cover, which Parliament was seeking to remedy when it passed the law now being reviewed by the court.

The mischief rule is of narrower application than the [[golden rule (law)|golden rule]] or the [[plain meaning]] rule, in that it can only be used to interpret a statute and, strictly speaking, only when the statute was passed to remedy a defect in the common law.

Legislative intent is determined by examining secondary sources, such as committee reports, treatises, law review articles and corresponding statutes.

The application of this rule gives the judge more discretion than the literal and the golden rule as it allows him to effectively decide on Parliament's intent. It can be argued that this undermines Parliament's supremacy and is undemocratic as it takes law-making decisions away from the legislature.

The way in which the mischief rule can produce more sensible outcomes than those that would result if the literal rule were applied is illustrated by the ruling in ''Smith v Hughes'' [1960] 2 All E.R. 859. Under the [[Street Offences Act 1959]], it was a crime for prostitutes to "loiter or solicit in the street for the purposes of prostitution". The defendants were calling to men in the street from balconies and tapping on windows. They claimed they were not guilty as they were not in the "street". The judge applied the mischief rule to come to the conclusion that they were guilty as the intention of the act was to cover the mischief of harassment from prostitutes.

==History==
The rule was first set out in ''[[Heydon's Case]]'' [1584] 76 ER 637 3 CO REP 7a&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Exch/1584/J36.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swarb.co.uk/lisc/LitiP12001799.php&lt;/ref&gt; where the court ruled that there were four points to be taken into consideration when interpreting a statute:

{{quote|For the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general (be they penal or beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of the common law), four things are to be discerned and considered:

1st. What was the common law before the making of the Act.

2nd. What was the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide.

3rd. What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the commonwealth.

And, 4th. The true reason of the remedy;

And then the office of all the Judges is to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and ''pro privato commodo'', and to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true intent of the makers of the Act, ''[[pro bono|pro bono publico]]''.}}

==Traditional use==
In the century in which it was created, and for some time thereafter, the mischief rule was used in a legislative environment very different from the one which has prevailed in the past two centuries. As [[Elmer Driedger]] notes,

{{quote|[S]ixteenth-century common law judges ... looked upon statutes as a gloss upon the common law, even as an intrusion into their domain. Hence, statutes were viewed from the point of view of their effect upon the common law, as adding to it, subtracting from it or patching it up....

Then also, in the time of ''Heydon's Case'', the judges paid more attention to the "spirit" of the law than to the letter. Having found the mischief they proceeded to make mischief with the words of the statute. They remodelled the statute, by taking things out and putting things in, in order to fit the "mischief" and "defect" as they had found them.&lt;ref&gt;Elmer Driedger, ''The Construction of Statutes''. Second Edition. Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern use==
Modern courts continue to apply the rule in a more restricted manner, and generally with a greater regard for the integrity of the statutes which they are interpreting. Driedger puts it this way: "[T]o this day, ''Heydon's Case'' is frequently cited. The courts still look for the 'mischief' and 'remedy', but now use what they find as aids to discover the meaning of what the legislature has said rather than to change it."&lt;ref&gt; Elmer Driedger, ''The Construction of Statutes''. Second Edition. Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Driedger goes on to argue that this modern use of the mischief rule ought to be understood as one of the components of what he characterized as the "modern" method of statutory construction, rather than a stand-alone rule serving (as it formerly had), as an alternative to the methods of construction proposed by the plain meaning rule and the golden rule.

== Advantages ==
* In a [[common law]] jurisdiction, the existence of precedent and the knock-on effects of construing a statute prevent misuse of the rule
* The Law Commission sees it as a far more satisfactory way of interpreting acts as opposed to the golden or literal rules
* It usually avoids unjust or absurd results in sentencing
* It is consistent with parliament sovereignty

== Disadvantages ==
* It is seen to be out of date as it has been in use since the 16th century, when common law was the primary source of law and parliamentary supremacy was not established
* It gives too much power to the unelected judiciary which is argued to be undemocratic
* In the 16th century, the judiciary would often draft acts on behalf of the king and were therefore well qualified in what mischief the act was meant to remedy. This is not often the case in modern legal systems.
* The rule can make the law uncertain

Sign Language communication is a system of communication using visual gestures and signs, as used by deaf people. A unique property of [[Sign Language]] is that it is not easy to put on paper due to a lack of formal acceptance, &lt;ref name="written-forms"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language#Written_forms|title=Written Sign Language forms on Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is impossible to be mediated over the phone or in a plain email. Because of its three-dimensional nature, it can only be transferred in the form of timed two or three dimensional snapshots, also known as a video. The video itself has to be large and fast enough to capture sign language movements sufficiently.

In the late 1990s, it became possible for deaf people to use electronic communication tools as another channel for [[Sign Language]]. Initially, there weren't many choices prior to the advent of more interfaces (e.g. APIs like {{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/#dom-navigator-getusermedias|title=getUserMedia}}). With these, however, deaf people can perform electronic sign language exchanges independently without the need for a third person in the middle, i.e. a [[Video relay service]].

'''''My Mom's Having a Baby''''' is an American television teen comedy/documentary that aired as an ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' on February 16, 1977. The program would be historic as it was the first television program of its kind in the [[United States]] to showcase the pregnancy process and conception to young people, using a combination of animation and live action. The program was a co-production between [[Dick Clark Productions]] and [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]].

==Premise==
Upon learning that his mother is pregnant with what will be his brother, 10-year-old Petey Evans begins to wonder (through animated fantasies and flashbacks) about how babies are born, only to realize that those theories are not delivered by storks or popping out of a stomach. So, with help from his friends Oskar and Kelly, they go to a real expert who will be performing the delivery, Dr. [[Lendon Smith]], who uses an animated film that explains in detail (via Smith's narration) of how a pregnancy begins and how the child is conceived.

The remaining portion of this program features an actual live birth being performed in front of the cameras, which was taken from a 1974 [[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment]] special called ''[[David Hartman (TV personality)|David Hartman]]: Birth &amp; Babies''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Ledger]] (Lakeland, Florida): "Actual Birth of Baby to be Televised", February 13, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/20/arts/television-the-quiet-life-as-pursued-by-david-hartman.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Television — The Quiet Life as Pursued by David Hartman"] From New York Times (August 20, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Actress Candace Farrell, who played the mother in this program, was pregnant at the time of filming the 1974 special, which resulted in the producers hiring her for this program.

==Awards==
*This program won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] in 1977 for Outstanding Children's Informational Special.

The model was created in 1976 by [[Jack S. Annon]]. The letters of the name refer to the four different levels of intervention that a sexologist can apply: ''permission'' ('''P'''), ''limited information'' ('''LI'''), ''specific suggestions'' ('''SS'''), and ''intensive therapy'' ('''IT'''). The model is also used outside the field of sexology, especially in fields involving extensive or life-threatening surgery.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Sally |year=2006 |title=Rehabilitation: The Use of Theories and Models in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUUkOKycse8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rehabilitation:+the+use+of+theories+and+models+in+practice&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ABK69D0OqA&amp;sig=6w_ZDQu6ahX0ANFzVPWyWZk8lI4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dsmrTMP4AcqPceC-8L0E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=PLISSIT&amp;f=false |location=[[Amsterdam]] |publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]] |isbn=9780443100246 |accessdate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The model created by Annon has four levels of increasing intervention and interaction related to what kind of and how much help is given to a client. The varying levels largely revolve around what the client is looking for and how comfortable they are in discussing [[sexuality]] and [[sexual health]].&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; 

The first level is '''''permission''''', which involves the sexologist giving the client [[Permission (philosophy)|permission]] to feel comfortable about a topic or permission to change their lifestyle or to get medical assistance. This level was created because many clients only require the permission to speak and voice their concerns about sexual issues in order to understand and move past them, often without needing the other levels of the model. The sexologist, in acting as a receptive, [[Judgemental#Nonjudgmental|nonjudgmental]] listening partner, allows the client to discuss matters that would otherwise be too embarrassing for the individual to discuss.&lt;ref name="Blonna"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blonna |first=Richard |last2=Watter |first2=Daniel |date=2005 |title=Health Counseling: A Microskills Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAM3VZBPGvkC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=PLISSIT+Model&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9TOuUsjnO82vqQHtpoGABQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=PLISSIT%20Model&amp;f=false |location=[[Burlington, Massachusetts]] |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]] |isbn=9780763747619 |accessdate=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second level is '''''limited information''''', wherein the client is supplied with limited and specific information on the topics of discussion. Because there is a significant amount of information available, sexologists must learn what sexual topics the client wishes to discuss, so that information, organizations, and [[support groups]] for those specific subjects can be provided.&lt;ref name="Blonna"/&gt; 

The third level is '''''specific suggestions''''', where the sexologist gives the client suggestions related to the specific situations and assignments to do in order to help the client fix the [[Mental health|mental]] or [[health problem]]. This can include suggestions on how to deal with sex related diseases or information on how to better achieve [[sexual satisfaction]] by the client changing their sexual behavior. The suggestions may be as simple as recommending exercise or can involve specific regimens of activity or medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Comprehensive Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-hrqLpelEgC&amp;dq |location=[[Shelton, Connecticut]] |publisher=[[PMPH-USA]] |pages=278-279 |date=2002 |isbn=9781550091748 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth and final level is '''''intensive therapy''''', which has the sexologist refer the client to other [[Mental health professional|mental]] and medical health professionals that can help the client deal with the deeper, underlying issues and concerns being expressed. This level, with the onset of the [[internet age]], may also refer to a sexologist suggesting professional online resources for the client to browse about their specific issue in a more private setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fagan |first=Peter J. |date=2004 |title=Sexual Disorders: Perspectives on Diagnosis and Treatment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2VO1ew4uDYC&amp;dq |location=[[Baltimore]] |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |pages=34 |isbn=9780801875267 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EX-PLISSIT model===
The ''PLISSIT model'' was extended in 2006 by [[Sally Davis (nurse)|Sally Davis]] and [[Bridget Taylor (nurse)|Bridget Taylor]] because of concerns that practitioners often bypass permission-giving and go straight to providing information (sometimes merely in the form of a leaflet), without giving patients the opportunity to express any concerns they might have. The extended model, named the ''EX-PLISSIT model'', places permission-giving at the core. By giving people explicit permission to discuss any concerns they have about their sexuality, the healthcare professional affirms the individual as a sexual being. Any information or suggestions that follow, are then specific to the needs of that person.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

The EX-PLISSIT model also requires further permission-giving in the form of 'review', whereby the healthcare professional asks the patient to review the interaction and is given the opportunity to express any further worries or concerns. In addition, this model requires the professional to reflect on their interactions, challenging assumptions and extending their knowledge.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

[[File:Pathetic dot theory.png|thumb|right|The basic illustration of the pathetic dot theory]]
The '''pathetic dot theory''' or the '''New Chicago School theory''' was introduced by [[Lawrence Lessig]] in a 1998 article and popularized in his 1999 book, ''[[Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace]]''. It is a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] theory of [[regulation]]. It discusses how lives of individuals (the pathetic dots in questions) are regulated by four forces: the [[law]], [[Norm (social)|social norms]], the [[Market (economics)|market]], and architecture (technical infrastructure).

==Theory==
Lessig identifies four forces that constrain our actions: the law, social norms, the market, and architecture.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrew D.|last=Murray|chapter=Internet regulation|editor=David Levi-Faur|title=Handbook on the Politics of Regulation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOKtKzEyQlYC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=March 19, 2013|date=January 1, 2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-0-85793-611-0|pages=272–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law threatens sanction if it is not obeyed. Social norms are enforced by the community.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt; Markets through [[supply and demand]] set a price on various items or behaviors.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt; The final force is the (social) architecture.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt; By that Lessig means "features of the world, whether made, or found"; noting that facts like biology, geography, technology and others constrain our actions.&lt;ref name=lessig1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|title=The New Chicago School|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|date=June 1, 1998|volume=27|issue=S2|pages=661–691|doi=10.1086/468039|jstor=10.1086/468039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, those four forces are the totality of what constrains our action, in fashion both direct and indirect, ''[[ex post]]'' and ''[[ex ante]]''.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt;

The theory has been formally called by Lessig in 1998 "The New Chicago School", and can be seen as a theory of regulation.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lessig1998/&gt;

The theory can be applied to many aspects of life (such as how [[smoking]] is regulated), but it has been popularized by Lessig's subsequent usage of it in the context of the [[Internet regulation|regulation of the Internet]].&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt; Lessig noted that the key difference in regulation of the Internet ([[cyberspace]]), compared to regulation of the "real world" ("realspace"), is the fact that the architecture of the internet&amp;nbsp;– the [[computer code]] that underlies all [[software]]&amp;nbsp;– is created by humans, whereas in the real world much of the architecture, based on laws of physics, biology, and major social and cultural forces, is beyond our control.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt; Lessig sees code as an important force that should be of interest to the wider public, and not only to the programmers.&lt;ref name="Marsden2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher T.|last=Marsden|title=Regulating the Global Information Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qj3ZWI4VPEC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=March 19, 2013|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-24217-2|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes the importance of how technology-mediated architecture, such as coded software, can affect and regulate our behavior.&lt;ref name="KorpelaMontealegre2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Mikko|last1=Korpela|first2=Ramiro|last2=Montealegre|first3=Angeliki|last3=Poulymenakou|title=Organizational Information Systems in the Context of Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9TpR5A188oC&amp;pg=PA360|accessdate=March 19, 2013|date=May 31, 2003|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-7488-2|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig wrote:

'''Psychoneuroimmunology''' ('''PNI'''), also referred to as '''psychoendoneuroimmunology''' ('''PENI''') or '''psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology''' ('''PNEI'''), is the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/775894214|title=The Oxford handbook of psychoneuroimmunology|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Segerstrom, Suzanne C.|isbn=9780195394399|location=New York|oclc=775894214}}&lt;/ref&gt; PNI takes an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[immunology]], [[physiology]], [[genetics]], [[pharmacology]], [[molecular biology]], [[psychiatry]], [[behavioral medicine]], [[infectious diseases]], [[endocrinology]], and [[rheumatology]].

The main interests of PNI are the interactions between the [[central nervous system|nervous]] and [[immune]] systems and the relationships between mental processes and [[health]]. PNI studies, among other things, the [[physiology|physiological]] functioning of the neuroimmune system in health and disease; disorders of the neuroimmune system ([[autoimmune diseases]]; [[hypersensitivity|hypersensitivities]]; [[immune deficiency]]); and the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the neuroimmune system [[in vitro]], [[in situ]], and [[in vivo]].

==History==
Interest in the relationship between psychiatric syndromes or symptoms and immune function has been a consistent theme since the beginning of modern medicine.
[[File:Claude Bernard and his pupils. Oil painting after Léon-Augus Wellcome V0017769.jpg|thumbnail|Claude Bernard, the father of modern physiology, with his pupils]]
[[Claude Bernard]], a French physiologist of the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]], formulated the concept of the ''[[milieu interieur]]'' in the mid-1800s. In 1865, Bernard described the perturbation of this internal state: "... there are protective functions of organic elements holding living materials in reserve and maintaining without interruption humidity, heat and other conditions indispensable to vital activity. Sickness and death are only a dislocation or perturbation of that mechanism" (Bernard, 1865). [[Walter Cannon]], a professor of physiology at [[Harvard University]] coined the commonly used term, [[homeostasis]], in his book ''The Wisdom of the Body'', 1932, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ''homoios'', meaning similar, and ''stasis'', meaning position. In his work with animals, Cannon observed that any change of emotional state in the beast, such as [[anxiety]], [[Distress (medicine)|distress]], or [[rage (emotion)|rage]], was accompanied by total cessation of movements of the stomach (''Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage'', 1915). These studies looked into the relationship between the effects of emotions and perceptions on the [[autonomic nervous system]], namely the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] responses that initiated the recognition of the [[fight or flight response|freeze, fight or flight response]]. His findings were published from time to time in professional journals, then summed up in book form in ''The Mechanical Factors of Digestion'', published in 1911.
[[File:Hans Selye.JPG|thumbnail|left|Bust of Hans Selye at [[Selye János University]], [[Komárno]], [[Slovakia]]]]
[[Hans Selye]], a student of [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[McGill University]], and a researcher at [[Université de Montréal]], experimented with animals by putting them under different physical and mental adverse conditions and noted that under these difficult conditions the body consistently [[Adaptation|adapted]] to heal and recover. Several years of experimentation that formed the empiric foundation of Selye's concept of the [[General Adaptation Syndrome]]. This syndrome consists of an enlargement of the [[adrenal]] gland, atrophy of the [[thymus]], [[spleen]], and other [[lymphoid]] tissue, and gastric [[Peptic ulcer|ulcerations]].

Selye describes three stages of adaptation, including an initial brief alarm reaction, followed by a prolonged period of resistance, and a terminal stage of exhaustion and death. This foundational work led to a rich line of research on the biological functioning of [[glucocorticoids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neylan Thomas C | year = 1998 | title = Hans Selye and the Field of Stress Research | url = | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 230 | doi=10.1176/jnp.10.2.230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-20th century studies of psychiatric patients reported immune alterations in psychotic individuals, including lower numbers of [[lymphocytes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freeman H, Elmadjian F | year = 1947 | title = The relationship between blood sugar and lymphocyte levels in normal and psychotic subjects | url = | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 226–33 | doi=10.1097/00006842-194707000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Phillips L, Elmadjian F | year = 1947 | title = A Rorschach tension score and the diurnal lymphocyte curve in psychotic subjects | url = | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 364–71 | doi=10.1097/00006842-194711000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poorer [[antibody]] response to [[pertussis vaccination]], compared with nonpsychiatric control subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vaughan WT, Sullivan JC, Elmadjian F | year = 1949 | title = Immunity and schizophrenia | url = | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 327–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, George F. Solomon, from the [[University of California in Los Angeles]], and his research team coined the term "psychoimmunology" and published a landmark paper: "Emotions, immunity, and disease: a speculative theoretical integration."&lt;ref&gt;Solomon GF, Moos RH.

Psychiatry 1964; 11: 657–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
In 1975, [[Robert Ader]] and [[Nicholas Cohen]], at the [[University of Rochester]], advanced PNI with their demonstration of [[Classical conditioning|classic conditioning]] of immune function, and they subsequently coined the term "psychoneuroimmunology".&lt;ref&gt;R Ader and N Cohen. [http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/abstract/37/4/333 Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression.] Psychosomatic Medicine, Vol 37, Issue 4 333-340&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roch2"&gt;{{cite news|title = Robert Ader, Founder of Psychoneuroimmunology, Dies|url = http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=3370|work = [[University of Rochester Medical Center]]|publisher = |date = 2011-12-20|accessdate = 2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ader was investigating how long conditioned responses (in the sense of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s conditioning of dogs to drool when they heard a bell ring) might last in laboratory rats. To condition the rats, he used a combination{{clarify|date=July 2013}} of [[saccharin]]-laced water (the conditioned stimulus) and the drug [[Cytoxan]], which unconditionally induces [[nausea and taste aversion]] and suppression of immune function. Ader was surprised to discover that after conditioning, just feeding the rats saccharin-laced water was associated with the death of some animals and he proposed that they had been immunosuppressed after receiving the conditioned stimulus. Ader (a psychologist) and Cohen (an immunologist) directly tested this hypothesis by deliberately immunizing conditioned and unconditioned animals, exposing these and other control groups to the conditioned taste stimulus, and then measuring the amount of antibody produced.  The highly reproducible results revealed that conditioned rats exposed to the conditioned stimulus were indeed immuno suppressed. In other words, a signal via the nervous system (taste) was affecting immune function. This was one of the first scientific experiments that demonstrated that the nervous system can affect the immune system.

In the 1970s, [[Hugo Besedovsky]], [[Adriana del Rey]] and [[Ernst Sorkin]], working in Switzerland, reported multi-directional immune-neuro-endocrine interactions, since they show that not only the brain can influence immune processes but also the immune response itself can affect the brain and neuroendocrine mechanisms. They found that the immune responses to innocuous antigens triggers an increase in the activity of hypothalamic neurons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=H.|last2=Sorkin|first2=E.|last3=Felix|first3=D.|last4=Haas|first4=H.|date=May 1977|title=Hypothalamic changes during the immune response|journal=European Journal of Immunology|volume=7|issue=5|pages=323–325|doi=10.1002/eji.1830070516|issn=0014-2980|pmid=326564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=H.|last2=del Rey|first2=A.|last3=Sorkin|first3=E.|last4=Da Prada|first4=M.|last5=Burri|first5=R.|last6=Honegger|first6=C.|date=1983-08-05|title=The immune response evokes changes in brain noradrenergic neurons|journal=Science|volume=221|issue=4610|pages=564–566|issn=0036-8075|pmid=6867729|doi=10.1126/science.6867729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hormonal and autonomic nerve responses that are  relevant for immunoregulation  and are integrated at brain levels (see review&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=Hugo O.|last2=Rey|first2=Adriana Del|date=January 2007|title=Physiology of psychoneuroimmunology: a personal view|journal=Brain, Behavior, and Immunity|volume=21|issue=1|pages=34–44|doi=10.1016/j.bbi.2006.09.008|issn=0889-1591|pmid=17157762}}&lt;/ref&gt;). On these bases, they proposed that the immune system acts as a sensorial receptor organ that, besides its peripheral effects, can communicate to the brain and associated neuro-endocrine structures its state of activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These investigators also identified products from immune cells, later characterized as cytokines, that mediate this immune-brain communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=H.|last2=del Rey|first2=A.|last3=Sorkin|first3=E.|last4=Dinarello|first4=C.

In 1981, [[David L. Felten]], then working at the [[Indiana University]] School of Medicine, discovered a network of nerves leading to blood vessels as well as cells of the immune system. The researcher, along with his team, also found nerves in the [[thymus]] and [[spleen]] terminating near clusters of [[lymphocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s, and [[mast cell]]s, all of which help control immune function. This discovery provided one of the first indications of how neuro-immune interaction occurs.

Ader, Cohen, and Felten went on to edit the groundbreaking book ''Psychoneuroimmunology'' in 1981, which laid out the underlying premise that the [[brain]] and immune system represent a single, integrated system of defense.

In 1985, research by [[neuropharmacology|neuropharmacologist]] [[Candace Pert]], of the [[National Institutes of Health]] at [[Georgetown University]], revealed that [[neuropeptide]]-specific receptors are present on the cell walls of both the brain and the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;Pert CB, Ruff MR, Weber RJ, Herkenham M. "Neuropeptides and their receptors: a psychosomatic network" ''J Immunol'' 1985 Aug;135(2 Suppl):820s-826s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruff M, Schiffmann E, Terranova V, Pert CB |date = Dec 1985|title = Neuropeptides are chemoattractants for human tumor cells and monocytes: a possible mechanism for metastasis|url = |journal = Clin Immunol Immunopathol|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 387–96|doi = 10.1016/0090-1229(85)90108-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery that neuropeptides and neurotransmitters act directly upon the immune system shows their close association with [[emotions]] and suggests mechanisms through which emotions, from the [[limbic system]], and immunology are deeply interdependent. Showing that the immune and [[endocrine]] systems are modulated not only by the brain but also by the [[central nervous system]] itself affected the understanding of emotions, as well as disease.

Contemporary advances in [[psychiatry]], immunology, [[neurology]], and other integrated disciplines of medicine has fostered enormous growth for PNI. The mechanisms underlying behaviorally induced alterations of immune function, and immune alterations inducing behavioral changes, are likely to have clinical and therapeutic implications that will not be fully appreciated until more is known about the extent of these interrelationships in normal and pathophysiological states.

==The immune-brain loop==
{{further|Cell signaling networks|Signal transduction}}

PNI research looks for the exact mechanisms by which specific neuroimmune effects are achieved. Evidence for nervous-immunological interactions exist at multiple biological levels.

The immune system and the brain communicate through signaling pathways. The brain and the immune system are the two major adaptive systems of the body. Two major pathways are involved in this cross-talk: the [[Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis), and the [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS), via the [[sympathoadrenal system|sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis]] (SAM axis). The activation of SNS during an immune response might be aimed to localize the inflammatory response.

The body's primary stress management system is the HPA axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the body's [[cortisol]] level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases, with evidence from meta-analyses indicating that different types/duration of stressors and unique personal variables can shape the HPA response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Gregory E.|author2=Chen, Edith |author3=Zhou, Eric S. |title=If it goes up, must it come down? Chronic stress and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in humans|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=January 2007|volume=133|issue=1|pages=25–45|pmid=17201569|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HPA axis activity and cytokines are intrinsically intertwined: inflammatory cytokines stimulate [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and cortisol secretion, while, in turn, [[glucocorticoids]] suppress the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines.

Molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which include [[interleukin-1]] (IL-1), [[Interleukin-2]] (IL-2), [[interleukin-6]] (IL-6), [[Interleukin-12]] (IL-12), [[Interferon-gamma]] (IFN-Gamma) and [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]] (TNF-alpha) can affect brain growth as well as neuronal function. Circulating immune cells such as [[macrophages]], as well as [[glial]] cells ([[microglia]] and [[astrocytes]]) secrete these molecules. Cytokine regulation of hypothalamic function is an active area of research for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders.&lt;ref name = Covelli&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16029148 | volume=12 | issue=15 | title=Drug targets in stress-related disorders | year=2005 |vauthors=Covelli V, Passeri ME, Leogrande D, Jirillo E, Amati L | pages=1801–9 | journal=Curr. Med. Chem. | doi=10.2174/0929867054367202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytokines mediate and control [[immune]] and [[inflammation|inflammatory]] responses. Complex interactions exist between cytokines, inflammation and the adaptive responses in maintaining [[homeostasis]]. Like the stress response, the inflammatory reaction is crucial for survival. Systemic inflammatory reaction results in stimulation of four major programs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Elenkov IJ | authorlink5 = Chrousos GP., Iezzoni DG, Daly A, Harris AG, Chrousos GP. | year = 2005 | title = Cytokine dysregulation, inflammation and well-being | url = | journal = Neuroimmunomodulation | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 255–69 | doi=10.1159/000087104 | pmid=16166805}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the acute-phase reaction
* [[sickness behavior]]
* the pain program
* the stress response

These are mediated by the HPA axis and the SNS. Common human diseases such as [[allergy]], autoimmunity, chronic infections and [[sepsis]] are characterized by a dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory and [[T helper]] (Th1) versus (Th2) cytokine balance.

Recent studies show pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]] processes take place during [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[mania]] and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] disease, in addition to autoimmune hypersensitivity and chronic infections.

Chronic secretion of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] [[hormones]], [[glucocorticoids]] (GCs) and [[catecholamines]] (CAs), as a result of disease, may reduce the effect of [[neurotransmitters]], including [[serotonin]]{{mcn|date=November 2016}}, [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]], or other receptors in the brain, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones. Under stimulation, norepinephrine is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in organs, and the target immune cells express [[adrenergic receptors|adrenoreceptors]]. Through stimulation of these receptors, locally released norepinephrine, or circulating catecholamines such as [[epinephrine]], affect [[lymphocyte]] traffic, circulation, and proliferation, and modulate cytokine production and the functional activity of different [[lymphoid]] cells.

Glucocorticoids also inhibit the further secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone from the [[hypothalamus]] and ACTH from the [[pituitary]] ([[negative feedback]]). Under certain conditions stress hormones may facilitate inflammation through induction of signaling pathways and through activation of the [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone]].

These abnormalities and the failure of the adaptive systems to resolve inflammation affect the well-being of the individual, including behavioral parameters, quality of life and sleep, as well as indices of [[metabolic]] and cardiovascular health, developing into a "systemic anti-inflammatory feedback" and/or "hyperactivity" of the local pro-inflammatory factors which may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease.

This systemic or neuro-inflammation and neuroimmune activation have been shown to play a role in the [[etiology]] of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as [[Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], pain, and [[AIDS]]-associated dementia. However, [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s also modulate central nervous system (CNS) function in the absence of overt immunological, physiological, or psychological challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/pa-05-054.html Functional Links between the Immune System, Brain Function and Behavior]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoneuroimmunological effects==
There are now sufficient data to conclude that immune modulation by psychosocial stressors and/or interventions can lead to actual health changes. Although changes related to [[infectious disease]] and [[wound]] healing have provided the strongest evidence to date, the clinical importance of immunological dysregulation is highlighted by increased risks across diverse conditions and diseases. For example, stressors can produce profound health consequences. In one epidemiological study, all-cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor – the death of a spouse.&lt;ref name="Kaprio, J. 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kaprio J. |author2=Koskenvuo M. |author3=Rita H. | year = 1987 | title = Mortality after bereavement: a prospective study of 95,647 widowed persons | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 283–7 | doi=10.2105/ajph.77.3.283|pmc=1646890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists propose that stressful events trigger cognitive and affective responses which, in turn, induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes, and these ultimately impair immune function.&lt;ref name="Chrousos, G.

===Understanding stress and immune function===

[[Stress (medicine)|Stress]] is thought to affect immune function through emotional and/or behavioral manifestations such as [[anxiety]], [[fear]], [[Stress (biology)|tension]], [[anger]] and [[sadness]] and physiological changes such as [[heart rate]], [[blood pressure]], and [[sweating]]. Researchers have suggested that these changes are beneficial if they are of limited duration,&lt;ref name="Chrousos, G. P 1992"/&gt; but when stress is chronic, the system is unable to maintain equilibrium or [[homeostasis]]; the body remains in a state of arousal, where digestion is slower to reactivate or does not reactivate properly, often resulting in indigestion. Furthermore, blood pressure stays at higher levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Psychoneuroimmunology, Mind-Body Psychology and the Fight or Flight Response|last=Chapman|first=Cathy|date=Dec 27, 2010|website=|access-date=Oct 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the earlier PNI studies, which was published in 1960, subjects were led to believe that they had accidentally caused serious injury to a companion through misuse of explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McDonald RD, Yagi K | year = 1960 | title = A note on eosinopenia as an index of psychological stress | url = | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 2 | issue = 22| pages = 149–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then decades of research resulted in two large meta-analyses, which showed consistent immune dysregulation in healthy people who are experiencing stress.

In the first meta-analysis by Herbert and Cohen in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herbert TB, Cohen S | year = 1993 | title = Stress and immunity in humans: a meta-analytic review | url = | journal = Psychosom. Med. | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 364–379 | doi=10.1097/00006842-199307000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; they examined 38 studies of stressful events and immune function in healthy adults. They included studies of acute laboratory stressors (e.g. a speech task), short-term naturalistic stressors (e.g. medical examinations), and long-term naturalistic stressors (e.g. divorce, bereavement, caregiving, unemployment). They found consistent stress-related increases in numbers of total [[white blood cells]], as well as decreases in the numbers of [[helper T cells]], [[suppressor T cells]], and [[cytotoxic T cells]], [[B cells]], and [[natural killer cell]]s (NK). They also reported stress-related decreases in NK and T cell function, and T cell proliferative responses to [[phytohaemagglutinin]] [PHA] and [[concanavalin A]] [Con A]. These effects were consistent for short-term and long-term naturalistic stressors, but not laboratory stressors.

In the second meta-analysis by Zorrilla et al. in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zorrilla E. P. |author2=Luborsky L. |author3=McKay J. R. |author4=Rosenthal R. |author5=Houldin A. |author6=Tax A. |author7=McCorkle R. |author8=Seligman D. A. |author9=Schmidt K. | year = 2001 | title = The relationship of depression and stressors to immunological assays: a meta-analytic review | url = | journal = Brain Behavior and Immunity | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 199–226 | doi=10.1006/brbi.2000.0597}}&lt;/ref&gt; they replicated Herbert and Cohen's meta-analysis. Using the same study selection procedures, they analyzed 75 studies of stressors and human immunity. Naturalistic stressors were associated with increases in number of circulating [[neutrophils]], decreases in number and percentages of total [[T cells]] and helper T cells, and decreases in percentages of natural killer cell (NK) cells and [[cytotoxic T cell]] lymphocytes. They also replicated Herbert and Cohen's finding of stress-related decreases in NKCC and T cell [[mitogen]] proliferation to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A).

More recently, there has been increasing interest in the links between interpersonal stressors and immune function. For example, marital conflict, loneliness, caring for a person with a chronic medical condition, and other forms on interpersonal stress dysregulate immune function.&lt;ref name = "Ja_review"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Jaremka, L.M. |title=Synergistic relationships among stress, depression, and troubled relationships: Insights from Psychoneuroimmunology |journal=Depression and Anxiety|volume= |pages= |year=in press|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.22078/full |accessdate=2013-04-08|doi=10.1002/da.22078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication between the brain and immune system===
* Stimulation of brain sites alters immunity (stressed animals have altered immune systems).
* Damage to brain hemispheres alters immunity (hemispheric lateralization effects).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sumner R.C. |author2=Parton A. |author3=Nowicky A.N. |author4=Kishore U. |author5=Gidron Y. | year = | title = Hemispheric lateralisation and immune function: A systematic review of human research | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572811002347 | journal = Journal of Neuroimmunology | volume = 240 -241| issue = | pages = 1–12 | doi=10.1016/j.jneuroim.2011.08.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Immune cells produce cytokines that act on the CNS.
* Immune cells respond to signals from the CNS.

===Communication between neuroendocrine and immune system===
* Glucocorticoids and catecholamines influence immune cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Papanicolaou DA, Wilder RL, Manolagas SC, Chrousos GP|title=The pathophysiologic roles of interleukin-6 in human disease|journal=Ann Intern Med|year=1998|volume=128|issue=2|pages=127–137|pmid=9441573|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-128-2-199801150-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Neil R.|title=Physiology of behavior|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston|isbn=0205239390|page=611|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Endorphins from [[pituitary]] and [[adrenal medulla]] act on immune system.
* Activity of the immune system is correlated with neurochemical/neuroendocrine activity of brain cells.

===Connections between glucocorticoids and immune system===
* Anti-inflammatory hormones that enhance the organism's response to a stressor.
* Prevent the overreaction of the body's own defense system.
* Regulators of the immune system.
* Affect cell growth, proliferation and differentiation.
* Cause immunosuppression.
* Suppress [[cell adhesion]], [[antigen]] presentation, chemotaxis and cytotoxicity.
* Increase [[apoptosis]].

===Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)===
Release of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH) from the [[hypothalamus]] is influenced by stress.
* CRH is a major regulator of the HPA axis/stress axis.
* CRH Regulates secretion of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH).
* CRH is widely distributed in the brain and periphery
* CRH also regulates the actions of the [[Autonomic nervous system]] ANS and immune system.

Furthermore, stressors that enhance the release of CRH suppress the function of the immune system; conversely, stressors that depress CRH release potentiate immunity.
* Central mediated since peripheral administration of CRH antagonist does not affect immunosuppression.

[[Glutamate|Glutamate agonists]], cytokine inhibitors, [[TRPV1|vanilloid-receptor agonists]], catecholamine modulators, [[Ion channel|ion-channel blockers]], [[anticonvulsants]], [[GABA|GABA agonists]] (including [[opioids]] and [[cannabinoids]]), [[Cyclooxygenase|COX inhibitors]], [[Acetylcholine|acetylcholine modulators]], [[melatonin]] analogs (such as [[Rozerem|Ramelton]]), [[Adenosine receptor|adenosine receptor antagonists]] and several miscellaneous drugs (including biologics like [[Passiflora edulis]]) are being studied for their psychoneuroimmunological effects.

For example, [[SSRI]]s, [[SNRI]]s and [[tricyclic]] [[antidepressants]] acting on [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]] and [[cannabinoid receptor]]s have been shown to be immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory against pro-inflammatory cytokine processes, specifically on the regulation of IFN-gamma and IL-10, as well as TNF-alpha and IL-6 through a psychoneuroimmunological process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kubera M, Lin AH, Kenis G, Bosmans E, van Bockstaele D, Maes M | date = Apr 2001 | title = Anti-Inflammatory effects of antidepressants through suppression of the interferon-gamma/interleukin-10 production ratio | url = | journal = J Clin Psychopharmacol | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 199–206 | doi=10.1097/00004714-200104000-00012 | pmid=11270917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Maes M."The immunoregulatory effects of antidepressants".

Extrapolating from the observations that positive emotional experiences boost the immune system, Roberts speculates that intensely positive emotional experiences —sometimes brought about during mystical experiences occasioned by psychedelic medicines—may boost the immune system powerfully. Research on salivary IgA supports this hypothesis, but experimental testing has not been done.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Thomas B. (2006).

==History==
[[File:PymantuningCanoe.jpg|thumb|right|Canoeing near the lab]]
The University of Pittsburgh established a biological field station at [[Presque Isle, Pennsylvania]] on the shores of [[Lake Erie]] in 1926. However, the creation of [[Presque Isle State Park]] crowded out the modest field station, and in 1949 the field station moved to [[Pymatuning State Park (Pennsylvania)|Pymatuning State Park]].&lt;ref name="Trib2009" /&gt; The University of Pittsburgh obtained a lease from the state for a {{convert|13|acre|adj=on}} wooded peninsula adjacent to the Pennsylvania State Fish Hatchery which became known as the Sanctuary Lake Site. The first building was constructed on this site in 1952. Over time more research buildings were erected on the site in order to satisfy the educational and research needs of the University of Pittsburgh and visiting faculty and students from other colleges and universities in Western Pennsylvania.

By 1965, the university had outgrown the Sanctuary Lake Site facilities and it obtained a second lease from the [[Pymatuning State Park (Pennsylvania)|Pymatuning State Park]] for a dedicated housing site.
As the Housing Site expanded and developed, the Sanctuary Lake Site was dedicated to maintaining modern research and teaching facilities. Today, this site has modern facilities for housing instructors, researchers, and students as well as a Dining Hall, Kitchen, and Recreation Hall.

Major renovations and building projects were undertaken in the mid-1990s that resulted in a 30% increase in space and included the installation of numerous pieces of equipment and lab renovations. Among the projects was a new $81,000 {{convert|1700|sqft|m2}} administration building with a library and a $102,000 faculty housing unit that was completed in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sajna  | first = Mike |url=http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;-lay=a&amp;-format=d.html&amp;storyid=7121&amp;-Find| title=Pitt's Pymatuning lab moves into modern age of ecology research | newspaper = University Times |publisher=University of Pittsburgh | date= 1997-07-24| accessdate=2009-05-14 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2000, the University of Pittsburgh has renovated and expanded the facilities, as well as adding a significant increase in land. This has included the acquisition of three research properties, Wallace Woods, Beagle Road, and the Livingston Farm, that total {{convert|360|acre}}. In addition, the university has constructed five additional labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/Frame/pymabouthistory.htm| title=History of the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the lab has been awarded a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to construct a new $1.2 million, {{convert|3600|sqft|m2|sing=on}} laboratory building to be completed in 2014 that will contain three new research labs including new animal care space for bird researches and sterile lab space for molecular and microbial biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biology.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/facilities-images/NSF%20announcement.pdf | first=Rick | last=Relyea| title=New Lab for PLE! NSF Grant Awarded | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | date=September 2012 | accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This facility will also be open to K-12 public school students when the universities are on hiatus.&lt;ref name="Trib2013"/&gt;

==Facilities==
[[File:DSC 0996 (5097506993).jpg|thumb|right]]
The lab and teaching facilities of the Pymatuning Laboratory are located within public lands consisting of an {{convert|11000|acre|sing=on}} Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation area owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In addition, the Pymatuning Laboratory owns 360 acres of research sites that includes tracts of forest, successional field, and [[wetland]] along Linesville Creek in the Pymatuning [[Drainage basin|watershed]], and another tract of successional meadow, designated for experimental plantings and manipulations, a few miles from the laboratory site. An [[old-growth forest]] preserve of the [[Western Pennsylvania Conservancy]] also is managed by the Lab. Facilities include 10 research labs, cabins, dormitories, a dining hall, and lecture rooms. The lab is also stocked with a variety of equipment for research as well as recreational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/Frame/pymresfacilities.htm| title=Research Facilities at Pymatuning |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctuary Lake Site===
[[File:PymatuningPittSancLake.jpg|thumb|right|Lab buildings at the Sanctuary Lake Site]]
The Sanctuary Lake Site is the original research site for the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology since 1949 and is situated on Sanctuary Lake, a protected waterway, which several of the original classrooms overlook. This 13 acre site contains eight research laboratories, a stockroom, environmental chambers, a -40 °C freezer, wireless internet, a computer lab, and 24-hour emergency power back-up. There is also a library and a large lecture hall that can accommodate more than 100 people.

===Livingston Road Laboratory===
The Livingston Road Laboratory, affectionately called "the farm", is the newest facility at PLE and contains {{convert|134|acre}} of field and forest, offering a variety of venues for observation or experimentation. In addition, there is a newly constructed {{convert|3000|sqft|m2}} building containing aquatic and terrestrial research laboratories, a large garage for storage, two water wells, temperature controlled rooms, offices, restrooms, dsl internet access, and a modern security system.

===Beagle Road Site===
The Beagle Road Site is a {{convert|23|acre|sing=on}} site that supports an old-field community and is currently the location for a variety of old-field and aquatic mesocosm experiments.

===Wallace Woods===
Wallace Woods is a {{convert|26|acre|sing=on}} site that contains a fairly mature second-growth forest. It also includes a stretch of Linesville Creek for aquatic study. The vegetation of this site has been particularly well studied over the years, allowing providing significant potential for future research projects.

===Tryon-Weber Woods===
Tryon-Weber Woods is an {{convert|84|acre|sing=on}} site of forested land that is stewarded by Pymatuning Lab and owned by the Western Pennsylvania Nature Conservancy. It contains a mature [[Beech-maple forest|American beech-sugar maple woods]] and is considered to be one of the finest examples of such an old-growth forest in northwestern Pennsylvania.

===Janette Rose Tryon Reserve===
The Janette Rose Tryon Reserve contains {{convert|80|acre}} of forested land that was selectively logged in recent decades. The land contains second-growth timber and a substantial number of wetlands located within the forest mosaic.

===Residences===
Various on-site and off-site residences exist at the Pymatuning Lab to house up to 120 students and researchers.&lt;ref name="Trib2013"/&gt;

====Housing Site====
[[File:PittPymatuninglabRecBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|Inside Recreation Hall at the Housing Site]]
The Housing Site, located on the shores of Pymatuning Lake, contains most of the residential opportunities for students and researchers.  The site is composed of ten residence structures and also includes on-site equipped kitchens, a laundry facility, dining hall, and Recreational Hall that features a fireplace, satellite television, [[pool table]], [[foosball]] table, and [[ping-pong]] table. The entire lake-shore housing site is served by high-speed, wireless internet. The Housing Site also maintains a supply of recreation equipment including [[canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, a [[volleyball]] court, and a [[Horseshoes|horseshoe]] pit, and is nearby are beaches for swimming and trails for hiking, biking, bird watching, and running.

Undergraduate and graduate student housing is provided in three [[Dormitory|dormatories]]: the Mountain Laurel Men's Dorm, White-tailed Deer Women's Dorm, and the Bald Eagle Dorm.  The dorms consist of a large room with 4 single beds and attached bath. A lounge area in each dorm serves as a social center and contains desktop computers that are connected to the internet. Residents take meals in the Dining Hall or use a communal kitchen in the Pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/Frame/pymcourseliving.htm| title=Courses at the PLE - Living at the Field Station |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers can obtain housing in the two-story Ruffled grouse Apartments or in one of six cabins.  The apartments consist of 2 bedrooms that share bath and a kitchen which is equipped with microwaves, stoves, refrigerators, dishes, utensils and cookware. Each bedroom has a private entrance and has either one double bed or 2 single beds and, if available, can be rented as a unit to provide family housing. The cabins which each have a living room, equipped kitchen, bath and 1, 2, or 3 bedrooms. Cabin bedrooms may contain either one double or two single beds. If space is available, 2 and 3 bedroom cabins may be rented to provide family housing.&lt;ref name="researchhousing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/Frame/pymreshousing.htm| title=Housing for PLE Researchers |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Off-site housing====
The Hartman House is located about a mile north of Linesville. It is a two-story house with living room, kitchen, bath, one large bedroom and three small bedrooms. The Hartman House also may be rented to provide housing for a family. Another off-site housing location exists at the Sanctuary Lake Site in the Former Director's House, also called the Hatchery House, which is a two-story, three bedroom facility with a living room, kitchen and bathroom that can also provide family housing.&lt;ref name="researchhousing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/Frame/pymaboutdirections.htm |title=Directions to Pymatuning &amp; Maps |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14748">'''Quantum social science''' is an emerging field of interdisciplinary research which draws parallels between [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] and the [[social science|social sciences]]. Although there is no settled consensus on a single approach&lt;ref name="hone"&gt;{{cite web | last= Höne | first= K.E. |date=27 April 2017 |title= Quantum Social Science | website = Oxford Bibliographies |url= http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199743292/obo-9780199743292-0203.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt;, a unifying theme is that, while the social sciences have long modelled themselves on mechanistic science, they can learn much from quantum ideas such as [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] and [[quantum entanglement| entanglement]]. Some authors are motivated by [[quantum mind]] theories that the brain, and therefore human interactions, are literally based on quantum processes, while others are more interested in taking advantage of the quantum toolkit to simulate social behaviours which elude classical treatment. Quantum ideas have been particularly influential in psychology, but are starting to affect other areas such as [[international relations]] and [[diplomacy]] in what one 2018 paper called a “quantum turn in the social sciences.”&lt;ref name="freitas"&gt;{{cite journal | last= de Freitas | first= E. | last2=Sinclair | first2= N. | date=2018 |title= The Quantum Mind: Alternative Ways of Reasoning with Uncertainty |journal= Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=271-283}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== History ==

The idea that quantum physics might play an important role in living systems has long been considered by physicists. [[Niels Bohr]] for example believed that his principle of complementarity extended into both biology and psychology&lt;ref name="bohr"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Bohr | first= N. |date=1933 |title= Light and Life |journal= Nature |volume=131 |pages=421–423}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while [[Erwin Schrödinger]] wrote in his 1944 book [[What is Life?]] of a “quantum theory of biology” that saw genetic mutations in terms of quantum leaps. In his 1989 book [[The Emperor's New Mind]], [[Roger Penrose]] hypothesized that quantum mechanics plays an essential role in human consciousness. His 1994 follow-up book [[Shadows of the Mind]] speculated that these quantum processes take place in [[microtubule |microtubules]] inside neurons. 

Some physicists have also been willing to consider an even more direct connection between mind and quantum matter, in a quantum version of [[panpsychism]]. In his 1975 book &lt;i&gt;Disturbing the Universe&lt;/i&gt;, [[Freeman Dyson]] wrote that “mind is already inherent in every electron, and the processes of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from the processes of choice between quantum states.”&lt;ref name="dyson"&gt;{{cite book |last= Dyson |first= F. |date= 1979 |title= Disturbing the Universe |publisher= Basic Books | pages=168–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bohm]]’s 1951 book &lt;i&gt;Quantum Theory&lt;/i&gt; included a chapter on “Analogies to Quantum Processes” where he considered applications including the understanding of thought processes&lt;ref name="bohm"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bohm |first= D. |date= 1951|title= Quantum Theory |publisher= Prentice Hall }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1990 he published a paper named "A New theory of the relationship of mind and matter" which asserts that consciousness permeates all forms of matter.&lt;ref name="bohm2"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Bohm | first= D. | date= 1990 | title= A new theory of the relationship of mind and matter |journal= Philosophical Psychology |volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=271-286}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were popularised and extended by [[Danah Zohar]] in books including &lt;i&gt;The Quantum Self&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref name="zohar1"&gt;{{cite book |last= Zohar |first= D. |date= 1990|title= The Quantum Self: Human Nature and Consciousness Defined by the New Physics | publisher= William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (with Ian Marshall) &lt;i&gt;The Quantum Society&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;ref name="zohar2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Zohar |first1= D. |last2= Marshall |first2= I. |date= 1993|title= The Quantum Society: Mind, Physics, and a New Social Vision |publisher= Bloomsbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Barad]]’s 2007 book &lt;i&gt;Meeting the Universe Halfway&lt;/i&gt; took “Niels Bohr’s philosophy-physics” as a starting point to develop her theory of [[Karen Barad#Agential realism |agential realism]].&lt;ref name="barad"&gt;{{cite book |last= Barad |first= K. |date= 2007|title= Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning | page=24 |publisher= Duke University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in the 1990s, a separate approach to quantum social science was taken by a number of interdisciplinary researchers, working in what became known as [[quantum cognition]], who argued that quantum probability theory was better than classical probability theory at accounting for a range of cognitive effects of the sort studied in [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref name="aerts"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aerts | first= D. | last2=Aerts | first2= S. | date=1994 |title= Applications of quantum statistics in psychological studies of decision processes |journal= Foundations of Science |volume=1 |pages=85–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="khrennikov"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Khrennikov | first= A. | date=1999| title= Classical and Quantum Mechanics on Information Spaces with Applications to Cognitive, Psychological, Social, and Anomalous Phenomena |journal= Foundations of Physics |volume=29 | issue=7 | pages=1065–1098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="busemeyer"&gt;{{cite book |last= Busemeyer |first= J.R. | editor-last=Rudolph | editor-first=L. |date= 2013|chapter= Introduction to Quantum Probability for Social and Behavioural Scientists | pages=75-103 | title = Qualitative Mathematics for the Social Sciences: Mathematical Models for Research on Cultural Dynamics |publisher= Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others worked on developing “weak” or “generalised” versions of quantum theory which extended concepts such as complementarity and entanglement to the social domain.&lt;ref name="atmanspacher"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Atmanspacher | first= H. | last2= Römer | first2= H. |  last3= Walach | first3= H. | date=2002|title= Weak Quantum Theory: Complementarity and Entanglement in Physics and Beyond |journal= Foundations of Physics |volume=32 | issue=3 |pages=379–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walach"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Walach | first= H. | last2= von Stillfried | first2= N. | date=1994 |title= Generalised Quantum Theory: Basic Idea and General Intuition; A Background Story and Overview |journal= Axiomathes |volume=21 | issue=2 |pages=185–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2013 book &lt;i&gt;Quantum Social Science&lt;/i&gt;, Emmanuel Haven and Andrei Khrennikov developed mathematical formalisms for the application of quantum models to topics including psychology, economics, finance, and brain science.&lt;ref name="haven"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Haven |first1= E. |last2= Khrennikov |first2= A. |date= 2013 |title= Quantum Social Science |publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most researchers in areas such as [[quantum cognition]] view the quantum formalism solely as a mathematical toolbox, and do not assume that human cognition is physically based on quantum mechanics. Separately however, researchers in [[quantum biology]] have uncovered evidence of quantum effects being exploited in processes such as photosynthesis and avian navigation; and some authors, notably political scientist [[Alexander Wendt]], have argued that human beings are literally what he calls “walking wave functions”.&lt;ref name="wendt"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wendt |first= A. |date= 2015 |title= Quantum Mind and Social Science: Unifying Physical and Social Ontology |publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core ideas ==

While quantum social scientists are divided on the question of whether social processes are physically quantum in nature, or just happen to be amenable to a quantum approach, there are a number of common ideas, themes, and concerns. The most fundamental is that, since its inception, social science has been based on a classical worldview, which needs to be updated in accordance with the teachings of quantum physics. In particular, quantum theory disputes the key tenets or assumptions of [[materialism]], [[reductionism]], [[determinism]], and [[Mechanism (sociology)|mechanism]].&lt;ref name="wendtchapter"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wendt |first= A. | editor1-last= Guzzini | editor1-first=S. | editor2-last= Leander | editor2-first=A. |date= 2006|chapter= Social Theory as Cartesian Science: An Auto-Critique from a Quantum Perspective | pages=181-219 | title = Constructivism and International Relations: Alexander Wendt and his Critics |publisher= Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is the notion of entanglement. In mechanistic or pre-quantum science, particles are seen as individual entities that interact only in a mechanistic sense. In quantum mechanics, particles such as electrons can become entangled so that a measurement on one instantly affects the state of the other. In quantum social science, people are similarly entangled, whether through shared institutions such as language, or (according to some interpretations) through actual physical processes.&lt;ref name="wendt"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An implication is that people are never completely separable, but are entangled elements of society.

Another example is the idea of wave function collapse. In standard interpretations of quantum physics, a particle is described by a [[wave function]], and attributes such as position or momentum are only discovered through a measurement procedure which collapses the wave function to one of a number of allowed states. In quantum social science, mental states are best described as potentialities that “collapse” only when a judgement or decision is made.&lt;ref name="busemeyerbruza"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Busemeyer |first1= J.R. |last2= Bruza |first2= P. |date= 2012 |title= Quantum Models of Cognition and Decision |publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; One consequence of wave function collapse in physics is that a measurement affects the system being studied, and therefore any future measurement. A corresponding phenomenon in social science is the so-called order effect, where responses to survey questions depends on the order in which they are asked.&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Wang | first= Z. | last2= Solloway | first2= T. |  last3= Shiffrin | first3= R.S.  | last4= Busemeyer | first4= J.R.  | date=2014|title= Context effects produced by question orders reveal quantum nature of human judgments |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=111 | issue=26 |pages=9431–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Ideas from quantum physics have long inspired thinkers in areas such as politics, diplomacy, and [[international relations]]. The journalist [[Flora Lewis]] spoke of the “Quantum Mechanics Of Politics” in 1975.&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite web | last= Lewis | first= F. |date=6 November 1983 |title= The Quantum Mechanics Of Politics | website = New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/magazine/the-quantum-mechanics-of-politics.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1997 lecture on "Diplomacy in the Information Age", former US Secretary of State [[George P. Schultz]] credits the physicist [[Sidney Drell]] for coining the term "quantum diplomacy" to describe how diplomats need to account for uncertainty and the fact that “the process of observation itself is a cause of change.”&lt;ref name="shultz"&gt;{{cite web | last= Shultz | first= G.P. |date=30 January 1998 |title= Diplomacy, Wired | website = Hoover Digest |url= https://www.hoover.org/research/diplomacy-wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 paper, [[James Der Derian]] proposed quantum diplomacy as a way to understand the entanglements brought about by a globalized media and a multiplicity of actors operating at different levels.&lt;ref name="derderian"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Der Derian | first= J. | date=2011| title= Quantum Diplomacy, German-US Relations and the Psychogeography of Berlin |journal= The Hague Journal of Diplomacy |volume=6 | issue=3-4 | pages=373–392}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have been a theme of Der Derian’s annual Q2-Symposium since 2014. In a 2018 address to the [[Trilateral Commission]], Danah Zohar argued that a mechanistic worldview has led to problems from inequality to climate change, and that we need to shift to a quantum perspective which incorporates effects such as uncertainty and entanglement.&lt;ref name="zohartalk"&gt;{{cite web | last= Zohar | first= D. |date=16 November 2018|title= Talk at the David Rockefeller Fellows Lunch - 42nd European Meeting of the Trilateral Commission |url= https://soundcloud.com/user-918856622/talk-at-david-rockefeller-fellows-42nd-european-meeting-of-the-trilateral-commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Wendt’s 2015 book &lt;i&gt;Quantum Mind and Social Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref name="wendt"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; does not focus on political science, it does discuss the applicability of quantum theory to social systems in general, and its publication led to a great deal of analysis and discussion on this topic.&lt;ref name="fuller"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Fuller | first= S. | date=2018| title= A quantum leap for social theory |journal= Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour |volume=48 | issue=2 | pages=177-182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arfikessler"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Arfi | first= B. | last2= Kessler | first2= O. | date=2018 |title= Forum Introduction: Social Theory Going Quantum-Theoretic?

== Realism ==

A topic of controversy is whether quantum science should be applied to social systems only in a metaphorical sense, or whether it should be taken as a physical description of those systems.&lt;ref name="arfi"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Arfi | first= B. | date=2018 |title= Challenges to a Quantum-Theoretic Social Theory |journal= Millennium: Journal of International Studies |volume= 47 |issue=1 |pages=99–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relates to a broader debate in the sciences about [[scientific realism]], which applies also to quantum physics.&lt;ref name="hone"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reasonable doubt''' is a term used in [[jurisdiction]] of [[common law]] countries. Evidence that is beyond reasonable doubt is the [[Legal burden of proof|standard of evidence]] required to validate a criminal conviction in most [[adversarial system|adversarial legal systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Grechenig, Nicklisch &amp; Thoeni, Punishment Despite Reasonable Doubt - A Public Goods Experiment with Sanctions under Uncertainty, Journal of Empirical Legal Studies (JELS) 2010, vol. 7 (4), p. 847-867 [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1733792 (ssrn).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, prosecutors bear the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] and are required to prove their version of events to this standard. This means that the proposition being presented by the prosecution must be proven to the extent that there could be no "reasonable doubt" in the mind of a "[[reasonable person]]" that the defendant is guilty. There can still be a doubt, but only to the extent that it would ''not'' affect a reasonable person's belief regarding whether or not the defendant is guilty.  Beyond "the shadow of a doubt" is sometimes used interchangeably with beyond reasonable doubt, but this extends beyond the latter, to the extent that it may be considered an impossible standard. The term "reasonable doubt" is therefore used.

If doubt ''does'' affect a "reasonable person's" belief that the defendant is guilty, the jury is not satisfied beyond "reasonable doubt".  The precise meaning of words such as "reasonable" and "doubt" are usually defined within [[jurisprudence]] of the applicable country.  A related idea is [[Blackstone's formulation]] "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer".

Beyond a reasonable doubt is the highest burden of proof in any court in the United States. Criminal cases must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

==By jurisdiction==

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
In English common law prior to the "reasonable doubt" standard, passing judgment in criminal trials had severe religious repercussions for jurors.  According to judicial law prior to the 1780s: "the Juryman who finds any other person guilty, is liable to the Vengeance of God upon his Family and Trade, Body and Soul, in this world and that to come."&lt;ref name="What Are the Origins"&gt;James Q. Whitman [http://hnn.us/articles/47018.html ''What Are the Origins of Reasonable Doubt?''], History News Network, George Mason University, February 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also believed "In every case of doubt, where one's salvation is in peril, one must always take the safer way....A judge who is in doubt must refuse to judge."&lt;ref name="What Are the Origins"/&gt;  It was in reaction to these "religious fears"&lt;ref name="What Are the Origins"/&gt; that "reasonable doubt" was introduced in the late 18th century to English common law, thereby allowing jurors to more easily convict.  Therefore, the original use of the "reasonable doubt" standard was opposite to its modern use of limiting a juror's ability to convict.

However, juries in criminal courts in England are no longer customarily directed to consider whether there is "reasonable doubt" about a defendant's guilt.  Indeed, a 2008 conviction was appealed after the judge had said to the jury "You must be satisfied of guilt beyond all reasonable doubt." The conviction was upheld but the [[Appeal Court]] made clear their unhappiness with the judge's remark, indicating that the judge should instead have said to the jury simply that before they can return a verdict of guilty, they "must be sure that the defendant is guilty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2009/2563.html R v Majid] [2009] EWCA Crim 2563 (12 October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of 'beyond reasonable doubt' was expounded in ''Woolmington v DPP [1935] UKHL 1'':&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1935/1.html Woolmington v DPP] [1935] UKHL 1 (23 May 1935)''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Juries are always told that, if conviction there is to be, the prosecution must prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. This statement cannot mean that in order to be acquitted the prisoner must "satisfy" the jury. This is the law as laid down in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Davies 29 Times LR 350; 8 Cr App R 211, the headnote of which correctly states that where intent is an ingredient of a crime there is no onus on the defendant to prove that the act alleged was accidental. '''Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt''' subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the expression "beyond a reasonable doubt" requires clarification for the benefit of the jury.&lt;ref name=Brydon&gt;{{Cite court

  |reporter = SCR

  |url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1997/1997canlii319/1997canlii319.html
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading decision is ''[[R. v. Lifchus]]'',&lt;ref name=Lifchus/&gt; where the Supreme Court discussed the proper elements of a [[jury instructions|charge to the jury]] on the concept of "reasonable doubt" and noted that "[t]he correct explanation of the requisite burden of proof is essential to ensure a fair criminal trial." While the Court did not prescribe any specific wording that a trial judge must use to explain the concept, it recommended certain elements that should be included in a jury charge, as well as pointing out comments that should be avoided.

The Supreme Court suggested that the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt should be explained to juries as follows:&lt;ref name=Lifchus/&gt;
* The standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably intertwined with that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the [[presumption of innocence]].
* The burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts to the accused.
* A reasonable doubt is not a doubt based upon sympathy or prejudice, and instead, is based on reason and common sense.
* Reasonable doubt is logically connected to the evidence or absence of evidence.
* Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not involve proof to an absolute certainty. It is not proof beyond any doubt, nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt. 
* More is required than proof that the accused is probably guilty. A jury which concludes only that the accused is probably guilty must acquit.

The Court also warned trial judges that they should avoid explaining the concept in the following ways:&lt;ref name=Lifchus/&gt; 
* By describing the term "reasonable doubt" as an ordinary expression which has no special meaning in the criminal law context.
* By inviting jurors to apply to the task before them the same standard of proof that they apply to important, or even the most important, decisions in their own lives.
* By equating proof "beyond a reasonable doubt" to proof "to a moral certainty".
* By qualifying the word "doubt" with adjectives other than "reasonable", such as "serious",  "substantial", or "haunting", which may mislead the jury.
* By instructing jurors that they may convict if they are "sure" that the accused is guilty, before providing them with a proper definition as to the meaning of the words "beyond a reasonable doubt".

The Supreme Court of Canada has since emphasized in ''[[R. v. Starr]]''&lt;ref name=Starr&gt;{{Cite court
  |litigants = R. v. Starr

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that an effective way to explain the concept is to tell the jury that proof beyond a reasonable doubt "falls much closer to absolute certainty than to proof on a balance of probabilities." It is not enough to believe that the accused is probably guilty, or likely guilty. Proof of probable guilt, or likely guilt, is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref name=Layton&gt;{{Cite court

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, jurors are typically told throughout a trial that the offence must be proved "beyond reasonable doubt", and judges usually include this in the summing-up.&lt;ref name=Juries1999/&gt; There is no absolute prescription as to how judges should explain reasonable doubt to juries. Judges usually tell jurors that they will be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt if they "feel sure" or "are sure" that the defendant is guilty.&lt;ref name=CrimLR665/&gt; In line with appellate court direction, judges do little to elaborate on this or to explain what it means.&lt;ref name=Juries1999&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Warren |last2=Cameron |first2=Neil |author3=Tinsley, Yvette |title=Juries in Criminal Trials: Part Two |url=http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/1999/11/Publication_76_159_PP37Vol2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=14 April 2012 |series=Preliminary Paper 37 |volume=2 |date=November 1999 |publisher=Law Commission |location=Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=1-877187-42-9 |page=54 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209183448/http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/1999/11/Publication_76_159_PP37Vol2.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CrimLR665&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=William |authorlink1=William Young (judge) |year=2003 |title=Summing-up to juries in criminal cases – what jury research says about current rules and practice |journal=Crim LR |volume=665 |pages=674 |url=http://www.canberra.edu.au/ncf/events/williamyoung.pdf |accessdate=14 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103091947/http://www.canberra.edu.au/ncf/events/williamyoung.pdf |archivedate=3 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 1999 found that many jurors were uncertain what "beyond reasonable doubt" meant. "They generally thought in terms of percentages, and debated and disagreed with each other about the percentage certainty required for 'beyond reasonable doubt', variously interpreting it as 100 per cent, 95 per cent, 75 per cent and even 50 per cent. Occasionally this produced profound misunderstandings about the standard of proof."&lt;ref name=Juries1999/&gt;

In ''[[R v Wanhalla]]'', President [[William Young (judge)|Young]] of the Court of Appeal set out a model jury direction on the standard of proof required for a criminal conviction.

===United States===
In the United States, juries must be [[jury instructions|instructed]] to apply the reasonable doubt standard when determining the guilt or innocence of a criminal defendant, but there is much disagreement as to whether the jury should be given a definition of "reasonable doubt."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Reasonable doubt: to define, or not to define |first=H. A. |last=Diamond |journal=[[Columbia Law Review]] |year=1990 |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=1716–1736 |doi=10.2307/1122751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Victor v. Nebraska]]'' (1994), the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] expressed disapproval of the unclear reasonable doubt instructions at issue, but stopped short of setting forth an exemplary jury instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Victor v. Nebraska, {{ussc|511|1|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Supreme Court first discusses the term in ''[[Miles v. United States]]'' (1880): "The evidence upon which a jury is justified in returning a verdict of guilty must be sufficient to produce a conviction of guilt, to the exclusion of all reasonable doubt."  ''[[In re Winship]]'' (1970) establishes that the doctrine also applies to juvenile criminal proceedings, and indeed to all the essential facts necessary to prove the crime:  "[W]e explicitly hold that the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged."

===Japan===
Since 1945, Japan has also operated by a "reasonable doubt" standard, including the doctrine of ''[[in dubio pro reo]]'', which was instituted by the Supreme Court during a controversial murder trial in 1975 (the Shiratori case brought before the Supreme Court of Japan, see for example notes on [[Shigemitsu Dandō]]). However, this is not considered an essential standard in Japan and lower level judges sometimes disregard it.&lt;ref name="Goodman2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Carl F|title=Rule of Law in Japan : A Comparative Analysis - What You See May Not Be What You Get|date=2003|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041189035|page=253&lt;!--|accessdate=1 September 2016--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Sinyangwe''' (born c. 1990) is an American [[Policy analysis|policy analyst]] and [[Racial equality|racial justice]] [[Activism|activist]]. Sinyangwe is a member of the [[Movement for Black Lives]] and a co-founder of We the Protestors, a group of digital tools that include Mapping Police Violence, a database of police killings in the [[United States]], and [[Campaign Zero]], a policy platform to end police violence. Sinyangwe is a co-host the [[Pod Save the People|''Pod Save the People'']] podcast, where he discusses the week's news with a panel of other activists.

== Early life ==
Sinyangwe was born circa 1990.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He grew up in [[College Park (Orlando)|College Park]] neighborhood of [[Orlando, Florida]] and attended [[Winter Park High School]] in the [[International Baccalaureate|International Baccalaureat]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e program.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cordeiro|first1=Monivette|title=How an Orlando data scientist is helping #BlackLivesMatter make the case against police violence|url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/how-an-orlando-data-scientist-is-helping-the-blacklivesmatter-movement-make-the-case-against-police-violence/Content?oid=2478826|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=Orlando Weekly|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has discussed the influence of his upbringing in Florida, where he was a black child often surrounded by white peers, on his eventual career trajectory; he was shaken and moved to action after the 2013 [[Trial of George Zimmerman|acquittal of George Zimmerman]] in the shooting death of [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|Trayvon Martin]] in [[Sanford, Florida]], where Sinyangwe had regularly attended soccer practice: "I was that kid. I could have been Trayvon. That’s why it hit me so personally and that’s why I realized that needed to be something that took the priority in terms of my focus."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Sinyangwe graduated from [[Stanford University]], where he studied how race intersects with American politics, economics, and class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marusic|first1=Kristina|title=This Map Of Police Violence Aims To Create A Path To Justice|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2133351/map-police-violence/|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=MTV News|date=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

The '''Sarajevo Music Academy''' or '''Music Academy | University of Sarajevo'''({{lang-bs|Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu}} or '''MAS''') is a [[Faculty of Music]] of [[University of Sarajevo]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unsa.ba/en/org-jedinica/music-academy&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Sarajevo Music  Academy  was founded by the Decision of the National Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 20, 1955 as the fourth such higher education institution in the former joint state, and the first established after the  [[World War II]]. This Decision was published in the official Gazette of the [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] No. 12/55, on June 8, 1955. The establishment of the Sarajevo Music  Academy preceded a number of favorable prerequisites, such as the establishment of a network of music schools, the founding of the [[Sarajevo National Theater]], Sarajevo Opera House, Symphony Orchestra RTV Sarajevo, the Institute for the study of folklore and the continuity of the [[Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra]].
At the founding of the Academy, the founders of this institution were:
*Milenko Živković, rector of the Academy of Music in Belgrade
*Dr. [[Dragotin Cvetko]], professor of the [[Academy of Music (Ljubljana)]]
*[[Natko Devčić]], professor at the [[Academy of Music, University of Zagreb]]
*Cvjetko Rihtman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proleksis.lzmk.hr/43975/|title=Rihtman, Cvjetko - Proleksis enciklopedija|website=proleksis.lzmk.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; director of the Folklore Research Institute in Sarajevo
*Miroslav Špiler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=59839|title=Špiler, Miroslav - Hrvatska enciklopedija|website=www.enciklopedija.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor of the Higher Pedagogical Academy in Sarajevo
*Strahinja Dramušić, in front of the Council for Education, Science and Culture of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a scorer
After the formation of the first pedagogical core at the Sarajevo Music Academy the first Rector was elected, prof. Cvetko Rihtman. In the first year of the Academy's work, 42 students were enrolled. Teaching at the Sarajevo Music Academy began on 19 December 1955 in seven sections:

*I   -  Department of Composition and Conducting
*II  -  Department of solo singing
*III -  Department of Piano 
*IV  -  Department of string Instruments
*V   -  Department of wind instruments
*VI  -  Department of Musicology
*VII -  Theoretical-pedagogical section

The fateful and tragic events that affected the former joint state in the nineties, made the Academy without a large number of teachers and associates, and the building was badly damaged on six occasions. One of the "holes" in the wall between the concert hall and the hallway, was inscribed and preserved the Academy's management, as a symbol of these difficult times. A large number of students left Sarajevo. Out of 45 permanently hired teachers and assistants at the Academy, only fifteen remained. The Academy has lost two-thirds of the collective. The only staff were teachers from other institutions that had been hired from time to time, and the number of students was about 50. Difficulties were  also reflected in the organization of the teaching itself and in the absence of a functional work space.
In spite of all that, the training was interrupted only once for a short time, in May 1995, due to a more intensive bombing. Teachers of the instrumental sections often held classes in their own apartments due to the unsuccessful working space, but also the safety. Regardless of the difficult circumstances of life and work, the rest of the Academy has preserved human and professional enthusiasm. Apart from the efforts to preserve the teaching process, the Academy's teachers played a major role in establishing the Orchestra of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, restarting the work of the Sarajevo Philharmonic, and the academic choir "Gaudeamus". Thanks to efforts from then dean, Osman-Faruk Sijarić&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/movies/stunned-by-war-the-arts-of-sarajevo-are-reawakening.html&lt;/ref&gt;, significant support and assistance from music academies and conservatories from Vienna, Bern, Graz, Karlsruhe, Madrid, Stockholm, was given and the Sarajevo Music Academy was registered unanonimuosly in the membership of the European Association of Music Conservatories and Academies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec-music.eu/members/our-members|title=Our Members|website=AEC|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[European Association of Conservatoires]]). In the war period, 15 students graduated ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]), 2 graduated ([[Master of Arts|MA]]) and one doctorate ([[PhD]]) was defended at the Academy. With huge difficulty, the Academy accomplished its basic function for almost the last decade of the 20th century.

In more than 62 years of existence and work of the Academy, there graduated over 2500 students, mastered them around 200, and about 24 doctorates were defended. About 300 teachers and associates were taking care about everything. Regardless of the great political, social and any other turbulence that strongly influenced all aspects of existence and work, the Academy had an upward developmental line. Today it is an internationally recognizable artistic and educational institution with developed departments, academic degrees, expressed artistic and scientific activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.unsa.ba/historijat|title=Historijat - Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu|website=www.mas.unsa.ba|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''skin flora''' (also commonly referred to as '''skin microbiota''') refers to the microorganisms which reside on the skin, typically human skin.

Many of them are [[bacterium|bacteria]] of which there are around 1000 species upon human skin from nineteen  [[Phylum|phyla]].&lt;ref name="Grice"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grice EA, Kong HH, Conlan S | year = 2009 | title = Topographical and Temporal Diversity of the Human Skin Microbiome | url = | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5931| pages = 1190–1192 | doi = 10.1126/science.1171700 | pmid = 19478181 | pmc=2805064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pappas"&gt;Pappas S. (2009). [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2009/05/your-body-wonderland-bacteria Your Body Is a Wonderland ... of Bacteria]. ScienceNOW Daily News&lt;/ref&gt;  Most are found in the superficial layers of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and the upper parts of [[hair follicle]]s.

Skin flora is usually non-pathogenic, and either [[commensalism|commensal]] (are not harmful to their host) or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] (offer a benefit). The benefits bacteria can offer include preventing transient [[pathogenic]] organisms from [[Infection#Colonization|colonizing]] the skin surface, either by competing for nutrients, secreting chemicals against them, or stimulating the skin's [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="Cogen"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cogen AL, Nizet V, Gallo RL | year = 2008 | title = Skin microbiota: a source of disease or defence? | url = | journal = Br J Dermatol | volume = 158 | issue = 3| pages = 442–55 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08437.x | pmid = 18275522 | pmc=2746716}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, resident microbes can cause [[skin disease]]s and enter the [[blood system]], creating life-threatening diseases, particularly in [[immunosuppressed]] people.&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt;

A major non-human skin flora is ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'', a [[chytrid]] and non-hyphal zoosporic fungus that causes [[chytridiomycosis]], an infectious disease thought to be responsible for the [[decline in amphibian populations]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

==Species variety==
===Bacteria===
[[image:Staphylococcus epidermidis 01.png|thumb|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope]] image of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' one of roughly a thousand [[bacteria]] species present on human [[skin]]. Though usually not [[pathogenic]], it can cause [[skin infection]]s and even life-threatening illnesses in those that are [[immunocompromised]].]]

The estimate of the number of species present on skin bacteria has been radically changed by the use of [[16S ribosomal RNA]] to identify bacterial species present on skin samples direct from their genetic material. Previously such identification had depended upon [[microbiological culture]] upon which many varieties of bacteria did not grow and so were hidden to science.&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' were thought from cultural based research to be dominant. However [[16S ribosomal RNA]] research finds that while common, these species make up only 5% of skin bacteria.&lt;ref name="Grice08"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grice EA, Kong HH, Renaud G, Young AC, Bouffard GG, Blakesley RW, Wolfsberg TG, Turner ML, Segre JA | year = 2008 | title = A diversity profile of the human skin microbiota | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2493393&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Genome Res | volume = 18 | issue = 7| pages = 1043–50 | pmid = 18502944 | doi=10.1101/gr.075549.107 | pmc=2493393}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, skin variety provides a rich and diverse habitat for [[bacteria]]. Most come from four phyla: [[Actinobacteria]] (51.8%), [[Firmicutes]] (24.4%), [[Proteobacteria]] (16.5%), and [[Bacteroidetes]] (6.3%).
[[File:Skin Microbiome20161-300.jpg|thumb|ecology of the 20 sites on the skin studied in the Human Microbiome Project]]

There are three main ecological areas: sebaceous, moist, and dry. ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' and ''[[Staphylococci]]'' species were the main species in [[sebaceous]] areas. In moist places on the body ''[[Corynebacteria]]'' together with ''[[Staphylococci]]'' dominate. In dry areas, there is a mixture of species but b-[[Proteobacteria]] and [[Flavobacteriales]] are dominant. Ecologically, sebaceous areas had greater species richness than moist and dry one. The areas with least similarity between people in species were the spaces between [[finger]]s, the spaces between [[toe]]s, [[axillae]], and [[umbilical cord]] stump. Most similarly were beside the [[nostril]], [[nare]]s (inside the nostril), and on the back.&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

===Fungal===
A study of the area between toes in 100 young adults found 14 different genera of fungi. These include [[yeast]]s such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Rhodotorula|Rhodotorula rubra]]'', ''[[Torulopsis]]'' and ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', [[dermatophytes]] (skin living fungi) such as ''[[Microsporum gypseum]]'',  and ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' and [[nondermatophyte]] fungi (opportunistic fungi that can live in skin) such as ''[[Rhizopus stolonifer]]'', ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Scopulariopsis brevicaulis]]'', ''[[Curvularia]]'', ''[[Alternaria alternata]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'', ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' and ''[[Penicillium]]'' species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oyeka CA, Ugwu LO | year = 2002 | title = Fungal flora of human toe webs | url = | journal = Mycoses | volume = 45 | issue = 11–12| pages = 488–91 | pmid = 12472726 | doi=10.1046/j.1439-0507.2002.00796.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], researched the DNA of human skin fungi at 14 different locations on the body. These were the ear canal, between the eyebrows, the back of the head, behind the ear, the heel, toenails, between the toes, forearm, back, groin, nostrils, chest, palm, and the crook of the elbow. The study showed a large fungal diversity across the body, the richest habitat being the heel, which hosts about 80 species of fungi. By way of contrast, there are some 60 species in toenail clippings and 40 between the toes. Other rich areas are the palm, forearm and inside the elbow, with from 18 to 32 species. The head and the trunk hosted between 2 and 10 each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22622689 BBC News item]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belly Button Biodiversity Project began at North Carolina State University in early 2011 with two initial groups of 35 and 25 volunteers.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  Volunteers were given sterile cotton swabs and were asked to insert the cotton swabs into their navels, to turn the cotton swab around three times and then return the cotton swab to the researchers in a vial &lt;ref name="Parker-Pope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker-Pope|first=Tara|title=What's in Your Belly Button|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/whats-in-your-belly-button/?_r=1|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   that contained a 0.5 ml 10% phosphate saline buffer.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;   Researchers at North Carolina State University, led by Jiri Hulcr,&lt;ref name="Nierenberg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nierenberg|first=Cari|title=New meaning to 'navel-gazing': Scientists study Belly Button Bacteria|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/new-meaning-navel-gazing-scientists-study-belly-button-bacteria-1C6437445?franchiseSlug=healthmain|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  then grew the samples in a culture until the bacterial colonies were large enough to be photographed and then these pictures were posted on the Belly Button Biodiversity Project’s  website (volunteers were given sample numbers so that they could view their own samples online).&lt;ref name="Parker-Pope"/&gt;  These samples then were analyzed using 16S rDNA libraries so that strains that did not grow well in cultures could be identified.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;

The researchers at North Carolina State University discovered that while it was difficult to predict every strain of bacteria in the microbiome of the navel that they could predict which strains would be prevalent and which strains of bacteria would be quite rare in the microbiome.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  It was found that the navel microbiomes only contained a few prevalent types of bacteria (Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Actinobacteria, Clostridiales, and Bacilli) and many different types of rare bacteria.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt; Other types of rare organisms were discovered inside the navels of the volunteers including three types of Archaea (an organism that usually lives in only extreme environments){{Clarification needed|date=October 2018}} and two of the three types of Archaea were found in one volunteer who claimed not to have bathed or showered for many years.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;

''Staphylococcus'' and ''Corynebacterium'' were among the most common types of bacteria found in the navels of this project’s volunteers and these types of bacteria have been found to be the most common types of bacteria found on the human skin in larger studies of the skin microbiome  &lt;ref name="Callewaert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Callewaert|first=Chris|author2=Frederiek-Maarten Kerckhof |author3=Michael S.

According to the Belly Button Biodiversity Project &lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  at North Carolina State University, there are two types of microorganisms found in the navel and surrounding areas. Transient bacteria (bacteria that does not reproduce) &lt;ref name="Kong"/&gt;    forms  the majority of the organisms found in the navel, and an estimated 1400 various strains were found in 95% of participants of the study.&lt;ref name="saunders-blog"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Saunders| first = Chris| title = Navel gazing at NC State leads to important discovery| work = Red &amp; White for Life :: NC State University Alumni Association| accessdate = 2013-04-20| date = 2011-07-12| url = http://www.alumniblog.ncsu.edu/2011/07/12/navel-gazing-at-nc-state-leads-to-important-discovery/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to host ==
Skin microflora can be [[commensalism|commensal]]s, [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or [[pathogen]]s. Often they can be all three depending upon the strength of the person's [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt; Research upon the immune system in the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] and [[lungs]] has shown that microflora aids immunity development: however such research has only started upon whether this is the case with the skin.&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt; ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is an example of a mutualistic bacterium that can turn into a pathogen and cause disease: if it gains entry into the blood system it can result in infections in bone, joint, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. It can also cause [[dermatitis]]. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces antimicrobial substances such as pseudomonic acid (that are exploited commercially such as [[Mupirocin]]). This works against  [[staphylococcal]] and [[streptococcal]] infections.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa also produces substances that inhibit the growth of [[fungus]] species such as ''[[Candida krusei]]'', ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Torulopsis glabrata]]'', ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kerr JR | year = 1994 | title = Suppression of fungal growth exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=263067&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 525–7 | pmid = 8150966 | pmc=263067}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also inhibit the growth of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krausse R, Piening K, Ullmann U | year = 2005 | title = Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori | url = | journal = Lett Appl Microbiol | volume = 40 | issue = 1| pages = 81–6 | doi = 10.1111/j.1472-765X.2004.01632.x | pmid = 15613007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So important is its antimicrobial actions that it has been noted that "removing ''P. aeruginosa'' from the skin, through use of oral or topical antibiotics, may inversely allow for aberrant yeast colonization and infection."&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt;

Another aspect of bacteria is the generation of [[body odor]]. [[Sweat]] is odorless however several bacteria may consume it and create byproducts which may be considered putrid by man (as in contrast to flies, for example, that may find them attractive/appealing).
Several examples are:
* ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' in  adolescent and adult sebaceous glands can turn its [[amino acid]]s into [[propionic acid]].
* ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' creates body odor by breaking sweat into [[isovaleric acid]] (3-methyl butanoic acid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ara K, Hama M, Akiba S, etal |title=Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control |journal=Can. J. Microbiol. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=357–64 |year=2006 |pmid=16699586 |doi=10.1139/w05-130 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' creates strong foot odor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ara K, Hama M, Akiba S, Koike K, Okisaka K, Hagura T, Kamiya T, Tomita F | year = 2006 | title = Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control | url = | journal = Can J Microbiol | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 357–64 | pmid = 16699586 | doi=10.1139/w05-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skin defenses==
===Antimicrobial peptides===
The skin creates [[antimicrobial peptides]] such as [[cathelicidin]]s  that control the proliferation of skin microbes. Cathelicidins not only reduce microbe numbers directly but also cause the secretion of [[cytokine]] release which induces [[inflammation]], [[angiogenesis]], and [[reepithelialization]]. Conditions such as [[atopic dermatitis]] have been linked to the suppression in cathelicidin production. In [[rosacea]] abnormal processing of cathelicidin cause inflammation. [[Psoriasis]] has been linked to self-DNA created from cathelicidin peptides that causes [[Autoimmunity|autoinflammation]]. A major factor controlling cathelicidin is [[vitamin D3|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schauber J, Gallo RL | year = 2008 | title = Antimicrobial peptides and the skin immune defense system | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2639779&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = J Allergy Clin Immunol | volume = 122 | issue = 2| pages = 261–6 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2008.03.027 | pmid = 18439663 | pmc=2639779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acidity===
The superficial layers of the skin are naturally acidic ([[pH]] 4-4.5) due to lactic acid in [[sweat]] and produced by skin bacteria.&lt;ref name="Lambers"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lambers H, Piessens S, Bloem A, Pronk H, Finkel P | year = 2006 | title = Natural skin surface pH is on average below 5, which is beneficial for its resident flora | url = | journal = Int J Cosmet Sci. | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 359–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-2494.2006.00344.x | pmid = 18489300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this pH mutualistic flora such as ''[[Staphylococci]]'', ''[[Micrococci]]'', ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' and ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' grow but not transient bacteria such as [[Gram negative bacteria]] like ''[[Escherichia]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or [[Gram positive]] ones such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt; Another factor affecting the growth of pathological bacteria is that the antimicrobial substances secreted by the skin are enhanced in acidic conditions.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt; In alkaline conditions, bacteria cease to be attached to the skin and are more readily shed. It has been observed that the skin also swells  under alkaline conditions and opens up allowing move to the surface.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt;

===Immune system===
If activated, the [[immune system]] in the skin produces [[cell-mediated immunity]] against microbes such as [[dermatophyte]]s (skin fungi).&lt;ref name="Dahl"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dahl MV | year = 1993 | title = Suppression of immunity and inflammation by products produced by dermatophytes | url = | journal = J Am Acad Dermatol | volume = 28 | issue = 5 Pt 1| pages = S19–S23 | pmid = 8496406 | doi=10.1016/s0190-9622(09)80303-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction is to increase [[stratum corneum]] turnover and so shed the fungus from the skin surface. Skin fungi such as ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' have evolved to create substances that limit the immune response to them.&lt;ref name="Dahl"/&gt; The shedding of skin is a general means to control the buildup of flora upon the skin surface.

==Skin diseases==
Microorganisms play a role in noninfectious [[Bacterial skin disease|skin disease]]s such as [[atopic dermatitis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Bruce Baker (geneticist) | author = Baker BS | year = 2006 | title = The role of microorganisms in atopic dermatitis | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1809642&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Clin Exp Immunol | volume = 144 | issue = 1| pages = 1–9 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2005.02980.x | pmid = 16542358 | pmc=1809642}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[rosacea]], [[psoriasis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paulino LC, Tseng CH, Strober BE, Blaser MJ |authorlink4=Martin Blaser | year = 2006 | title = Molecular analysis of fungal microbiota in samples from healthy human skin and psoriatic lesions | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1594634&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 44 | issue = 8| pages = 2933–41 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.00785-06 | pmid = 16891514 | pmc=1594634}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[acne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holland KT, Cunliffe WJ, Roberts CD | year = 1977 | title = Acne vulgaris: an investigation into the number of anaerobic diphtheroids and members of the Micrococcaceae in normal and acne skin | url = | journal = Br J Dermatol | volume = 96 | issue = 6| pages = 623–6 | pmid = 141301 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.1977.tb05206.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damaged skin can cause nonpathogenic bacteria to become [[pathogenic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roth RR, James WD | year = 1988 | title = Microbial ecology of the skin | url = | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 42 | issue = 1| pages = 441–64 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.42.100188.002301 | pmid = 3144238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of species on the skin is related to later development of dermatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Michael R.|last2=Gallo|first2=Richard L.|title=Evidence that Human Skin Microbiome Dysbiosis Promotes Atopic Dermatitis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022202X17329603|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=137|issue=12|pages=2460–2461|doi=10.1016/j.jid.2017.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acne vulgaris===
[[Acne vulgaris]] is a common skin condition characterised by excessive sebum production by the [[sebaceous gland|pilosebaceous unit]] and inflammation of the skin.&lt;ref name="Fitz-Gibbon2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitz-Gibbon|first1=S|last2=Shuta|first2=T|last3=Bor-Han|first3=C|last4=Nguyen|first4=L|last5=Du|first5=C|last6=Minghsun|first6=L|last7=Elashoff|first7=D|last8=Erfe|first8=MC|last9=Loncaric|first9=A|last10=Kim|first10=J|last11=Modlin|first11=RL|last12=Miller|first12=JF|last13=Sodergren|first13=E|last14=Craft|first14=N|last15=Weinstock|first15=GM|last16=Li|first16=H|title=''Propionibacterium acnes'' Strain Populations in the Human Skin Microbiome Associated with Acne|journal=J Invest Dermatol|date=2013|volume=133|issue=9|pages=2152–2160|doi=10.1038/jid.2013.21|pmid=23337890|url=http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v133/n9/full/jid201321a.html|pmc=3745799}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affected areas are typically colonised by ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]''; a member of the [[Commensalism|commensal]] microbiota even in those without acne.&lt;ref name="Grice2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grice|first1=EA|title=The skin microbiome: potential for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to cutaneous disease|journal=Semin Cutan Med Surg.|date=2014|volume=33|issue=2|pages=98–103|pmid=25085669|pmc=4425451|url=http://www.edermatologynews.com/scms-journal/volume-33/june-precision-medicine/single-view/the-skin-microbiome-potential-for-novel-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-approaches-to-cutaneous-disease/9077f05398694bf23b88073641fcfa8d.html|doi=10.12788/j.sder.0087}}&lt;/ref&gt; High populations of ''P. acnes'' are linked to acne vulgaris although only certain strains are strongly associated with acne while others with healthy skin. The relative population of ''P. acnes'' is similar between those with acne and those without.&lt;ref name="Fitz-Gibbon2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt;

Current treatment includes topical and systemic antibacterial drugs which result in decreased ''P. acnes'' colonisation and/or activity.&lt;ref name="Hannigan2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hannigan|first1=GD|last2=Grice|first2=EA|title=Microbial ecology of the skin in the era of metagenomics and molecular microbiology|journal=Cold Spring Harb Perpect Med|date=2013|volume=3|issue=12|page=a015362|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a015362|pmid=24296350|pmc=3839604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential probiotic treatment includes the use of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' to inhibit ''P. acnes'' growth.

It was also shown to be effective in reducing acne lesion size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muizzuddin|first1=N|last2=Maher|first2=W|last3=Sullivan|first3=M|last4=Schnittger|first4=S|last5=Mammone|first5=T|title=Physiological effect of probiotic on skin.|journal=J Cosmet Sci|date=2012|volume=63|issue=6|pages=385–95|pmid=23286870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atopic Dermatitis===
Individuals with [[atopic dermatitis]] have shown an increase in populations of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in both [[lesion]]al and nonlesional skin.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt; Atopic dermatitis flares are associated with low bacterial diversity due to colonisation by ''S. aureus'' and following [[Atopic dermatitis#Treatments|standard treatment]], bacterial diversity has been seen to increase.

[[Atopic dermatitis#Treatments|Current treatments]] include combinations of topical or systemic antibiotics, [[corticosteroids]], and diluted bleach baths.&lt;ref name="Kong2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kong|first1=HH|last2=Oh|first2=J|last3=Deming|first3=C|last4=Conlan|first4=S|last5=Grice|first5=EA|last6=Beatson|first6=MA|last7=Nomicos|first7=E|last8=Polley|first8=EC|last9=Komarow|first9=HD|last10=NISC Comparative Sequence Program|last11=Murray|first11=PR|last12=Turner|first12=ML|last13=Segre|first13=JA|title=Temporal shifts in the skin microbiome associated with disease flares and treatment in children with atopic dermatitis|journal=Genome Res|date=2012|volume=22|issue=5|pages=850–9|doi=10.1101/gr.131029.111|pmid=22310478|pmc=3337431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential probiotic treatments include using the commensal skin bacteria, ''S. epidermidis'', to inhibit ''S. aureus'' growth. During atopic dermatitis flares, population levels of ''S. epidermidis'' has been shown to increase as an attempt to control ''S. aureus populations''.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kong2012" /&gt;

Low [[Gut flora|gut microbial]] diversity in babies has been associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahamsson|first1=TR|last2=Jakobsson|first2=HE|last3=Andersson|first3=AF|last4=Björkstén|first4=B|last5=Engstrand|first5=L|last6=Jenmalm|first6=MC|title=Low diversity of the gut microbiota in infants with atopic eczema|journal=J Allergy Clin Immunol|date=2012|volume=129|issue=2|pages=434–40, 440.e1–2|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2011.10.025|pmid=22153774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants with atopic eczema have low levels of ''[[Bacteroides]]'' and high levels of [[Firmicutes]]. ''Bacteroides'' have anti-inflammatory properties which are essential against dermatitis.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson2012" /&gt; (See [[gut microbiota]])

===Psoriasis vulgaris===
[[Psoriasis|Psoriasis vulgaris]] typically affects drier skin sites such as elbows and knees. Dry areas of the skin tend to have high microbial diversity and fewer populations than sebaceous sites.&lt;ref name="Hannigan2013" /&gt; A study using [[Cotton swab#Usage|swab sampling techniques]] show areas rich in [[Firmicutes]] (mainly ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'') and [[Actinobacteria]] (mainly ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' and ''[[Propionibacterium]]'') are associated with psoriasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alekseyenko|first1=AV|last2=Perez-Perez|first2=GI|last3=De Souza|first3=A|last4=Strober|first4=B|last5=Gao|first5=Z|last6=Bihan|first6=M|last7=Li|first7=K|last8=Methé|first8=BA|last9=Blaser|first9=MJ|title=Community differentiation of the cutaneous microbiota in psoriasis|journal=Microbiome|date=2013|volume=1|issue=1|page=31|doi=10.1186/2049-2618-1-31|pmid=24451201|pmc=4177411}}&lt;/ref&gt; While another study using [[biopsy|biopsies]] associate increased levels of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria with healthy skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahlén|first1=A|last2=Engstrand|first2=L|last3=Baker|first3=BS|last4=Powles|first4=A|last5=Fry|first5=L|title=Comparison of bacterial microbiota in skin biopsies from normal and psoriatic skin.|journal=Arch Dermatol Res|date=2012|volume=304|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.1007/s00403-011-1189-x|pmid=22065152}}&lt;/ref&gt; However most studies show that individuals affected by psoriasis have a lower microbial diversity in the affected areas.

Treatments for psoriasis include topical agents, phototherapy, and systemic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menter|first1=A|last2=Griffiths|first2=CE|title=Current and future management of psoriasis.|journal=Lancet|date=2007|volume=370|issue=9583|pages=272–84|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61129-5|pmid=17658398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research on the skin microbiota's role in psoriasis is inconsistent therefore there are no potential probiotic treatments.

===Rosacea===
[[Rosacea]] is typically connected to [[sebaceous gland|sebaceous]] sites of the skin. The skin [[mite]] ''[[Demodex folliculorum]]'' produce [[lipases]] that allow them to use sebum as a source of food therefore they have a high affinity for sebaceous skin sites. Although it is a part of the commensal skin microbiota, patients affected with rosacea show an increase in ''D. folliculorum'' compared to healthy individuals, suggesting [[pathogenicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casas|first1=C|last2=Paul|first2=C|last3=Lahfa|first3=M|last4=Livideanu|first4=B|last5=Lejeune|first5=O|last6=Alvarez-Georges|first6=S|last7=Saint-Martory|first7=C|last8=Degouy|first8=A|last9=Mengeaud|first9=V|last10=Ginisty|first10=H|last11=Durbise|first11=E|last12=Schmitt|first12=AM|last13=Redoulès|first13=D|title=Quantification of ''Demodex folliculorum'' by PCR in rosacea and its relationship to skin innate immune activation.|journal=Exp Dermatol|date=2012|volume=21|issue=12|pages=906–10|doi=10.1111/exd.12030|pmid=23171449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bacillus oleronius]]'', a ''[[Demodex]]'' associated microbe, is not typically found in the commensal skin microbiota but initiates inflammatory pathways whose starting mechanism is similar to rosacea patients.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt; Populations of ''S. epidermidis'' have also been isolated from pustules of rosacea patients. However it is possible that they were moved by ''Demodex'' to areas that favour growth as ''Demodex'' has shown to transport bacteria around the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarmuda|first1=S|last2=O'Reilly|first2=N|last3=Zaba|first3=R|last4=Jakubowicz|first4=O|last5=Szkaradkiewicz|first5=A|last6=Kavanagh|first6=K|title=Potential role of Demodex mites and bacteria in the induction of rosacea.|journal=J Med Microbiol|date=2012|volume=61|issue=Pt 11|pages=1504–10|doi=10.1099/jmm.0.048090-0|pmid=22933353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current treatments include topical and oral antibiotics and laser therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=AF|last2=Tiemstra|first2=JD|title=Diagnosis and treatment of rosacea|journal=J Am Board Fam Pract.|date=2002|volume=15|issue=3|pages=214–7|pmid=12038728}}&lt;/ref&gt; As current research has yet to show a clear mechanism for ''Demodex'' influence in rosacea, there are no potential probiotic treatments.

==Clinical==
===Infected devices ===
Skin microbes are a potential source of infected medical devices such as [[catheters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martín-Rabadán P, Gijón P, Alcalá L, Rodríguez-Créixems M, Alvarado N, Bouza E | year = 2008 | title = Propionibacterium acnes is a common colonizer of intravascular catheters | url = | journal = J Infect | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 257–60 | doi = 10.1016/j.jinf.2008.01.012 | pmid = 18336916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hygiene==
It is important to note that the human skin is host to numerous bacterial and fungal species, some of which are known to be harmful, some known to be beneficial and the vast majority unresearched. The use of bactericidal and fungicidal soaps will inevitably lead to bacterial and fungal populations which are resistant to the chemicals employed. (see [[Drug resistance]])

===Contagion===
Skin flora do not readily pass between people: 30 seconds of  moderate friction and dry hand contact results in a transfer of only  0.07% of natural hand flora from naked with a greater percentage from gloves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lingaas E, Fagernes M | year = 2009 | title = Development of a method to measure bacterial transfer from hands | url = | journal = J Hosp Infect | volume = 72 | issue = 1| pages = 43–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhin.2009.01.022 | pmid = 19282052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal===
The most effective (60 to 80% reduction) antimicrobial washing is with [[ethanol]], [[isopropanol]], and [[n-propanol]]. [[Viruses]] are most affected by high (95%) concentrations of ethanol, while bacteria are more affected by  n-propanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kampf G, Kramer A | year = 2004 | title = Epidemiologic background of hand hygiene and evaluation of the most important agents for scrubs and rubs | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=523567&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 863–93 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.17.4.863-893.2004 | pmid = 15489352 | pmc=523567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unmedicated soaps are not very effective as illustrated by the following data. Health care workers washed their hands once in nonmedicated liquid soap for 30 seconds. The students/technicians for 20 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borges LF, Silva BL, Gontijo Filho PP | year = 2007 | title = Hand washing: changes in the skin flora | url = | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 417–20 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajic.2006.07.012 | pmid = 17660014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important use of [[hand washing]] is to prevent the [[Nosocomial infection#Transmission|transmission]] of [[antibiotic resistant]] skin flora that cause [[hospital-acquired infection]]s such as [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]. While such flora have become antibiotic resistant due to antibiotics there is no evidence that recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms when used in hand washing.&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weber DJ, Rutala WA |title=Use of germicides in the home and the healthcare setting: is there a relationship between germicide use and antibiotic resistance? |journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=1107–19 |year=2006 |pmid=17006819 |doi=10.1086/507964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many strains of organisms are resistant to some of the substances used in antibacterial soaps such as [[Triclosan]].&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt;

One survey of [[soap|bar soaps]] in dentist clinics found they all had their own flora and on average from two to five different genera of microorganisms with those used most more likely to have more species varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hegde PP, Andrade AT, Bhat K | year = 2006 | title = Microbial contamination of "in use" bar soap in dental clinics | url = http://www.ijdr.in/article.asp?issn=0970-9290;year=2006;volume=17;issue=2;spage=70;epage=3;aulast=Hegde | journal = Indian J Dent Res | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 70–3 | pmid = 17051871 | doi=10.4103/0970-9290.29888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey of bar soaps in public toilets found even more flora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kabara JJ, Brady MB | year = 1984 | title = Contamination of bar soaps under "in-use" conditions | url = | journal = J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol | volume = 5 | issue = 4–5| pages = 1–14 | pmid = 6394740 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that very dry soaps are not infected while all are that rest in pools of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Afolabi BA, Oduyebo OO, Ogunsola FT | year = 2007 | title = Bacterial flora of commonly used soaps in three hospitals in Nigeria | url = | journal = East Afr Med J | volume = 84 | issue = 10| pages = 489–95 | pmid = 18232270 | doi=10.4314/eamj.v84i10.9567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, research upon soap that was specially infected found that soap flora do not transmit to the hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinze JE, Yackovich F | year = 1988 | title = Washing with contaminated bar soap is unlikely to transfer bacteria | url = | journal = Epidemiol Infect | volume = 101 | issue = 1| pages = 135–42 | pmid = 3402545 | pmc=2249330 | doi=10.1017/s0950268800029290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damaged skin===
Washing skin repeatedly can damage the protective external layer and cause transepidermal loss of water. This can be seen in roughness characterized by scaling and dryness, itchiness, [[dermatitis]] provoked by microorganisms and [[allergen]]s penetrating the corneal layer and redness. Wearing gloves can cause further problems since it produces a humid environment favoring the growth of microbes and also contains irritants such as [[latex]] and [[talcum powder]].&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Larson EL, Hughes CA, Pyrek JD, Sparks SM, Cagatay EU, Bartkus JM | year = 1998 | title = Changes in bacterial flora associated with skin damage on hands of health care personnel | url = | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 26 | issue = 5| pages = 513–21 | pmid = 9795681 | doi=10.1016/s0196-6553(98)70025-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand washing can damage skin because the [[stratum corneum]] top layer of skin consists of 15 to 20 layers of [[keratin]] disks, [[corneocyte]]s, each of which is each surrounded by a thin film of skin [[lipid]]s which can be removed by [[alcohol]]s and [[detergent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kownatzki E | year = 2003 | title = Hand hygiene and skin health | url = | journal = J Hosp Infect | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 239–45 | pmid = 14629966 | doi=10.1016/j.jhin.2003.08.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damaged skin defined  by extensive cracking of skin surface, widespread reddening or occasional bleeding has also been found to be more frequently colonized by ''[[Staphylococcus hominis]]'' and these were more likely to be [[methicillin]] resistant.&lt;ref name="Larson" /&gt; Though not related to greater antibiotic resistance, damaged skin was also more like to be colonized by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', [[gram-negative bacteria]], ''[[Enterococci]]'' and ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]''.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;

==Comparison with other flora==
The skin flora is different from that of the gut which is  predominantly [[Firmicutes]] and [[Bacteroidetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eckburg PB, Bik EM, Bernstein CN, Purdom E, Dethlefsen L, Sargent M, Gill SR, Nelson KE, Relman DA | year = 2005 | title = Diversity of the human intestinal microbial flora | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1395357&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5728| pages = 1635–8 | doi = 10.1126/science.1110591 | pmid = 15831718 | pmc=1395357}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also low level of variation between people that is not found in gut studies.&lt;ref name="Grice08"/&gt; Both gut and skin flora however lack the diversity found in [[soil flora]].&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10141">'''Sociotherapy''' is a [[social science]] and form of [[social work]], and [[sociology]]  that involves the study of groups of people, its constituent individuals and their behavior, using learned information in case and care management towards holistic life enrichment or improvement of social and life conditions.  

The professional practitioner of the field, who may be called a '''sociotherapist''' or '''life enrichment therapist''', sometimes called a '''clinical sociologist''', is usually concurrently a member of another relevant profession: [[medical doctor]], [[psychiatrist]], [[psychologist]], [[nurse]], [[social worker]], [[sociologist]], [[criminologist]], activity and recreational professionals, among others.  Clinical sociotherapy usually targets groups of [[children]], [[youth]]s or [[elderly]], employed in various settings such as treatment facilities or lifecare communities like [[nursing home]]s and are directly involved in case management and [[nursing care plan|care planning]].

==Professional definition==
Still in its infancy as a social science and profession, sociotherapy is ill-defined and thus takes many forms, according to the respective definitions created by the individual [[therapist]]s, firms and institutions that employ sociotherapists and life enrichment therapists.&lt;ref name=multiple&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12861370&amp;dopt=Abstract|title=[Sociotherapy in German social law. Indication, contents, and aspects of public health]|first=R.-M.|last=Frieboes|date=1 July 2003|publisher=|journal=Nervenarzt|volume=74|issue=7|pages=596–600|via=PubMed|doi=10.1007/s00115-002-1459-0|pmid=12861370}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Society for the Furtherance of Sociotherapy defines sociotherapy as "the methodical management of the living environment of a group of clients, directed towards reaching the treatment targets of this group—and conceived as a means of achieving the treatment targets of the individual client—within a functional unit, usually in a clinical treatment setting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc1.htm#def Sociotherapy in the clinic of Foundation Centrum '45, definition of Sociotherapy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222092444/http://centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc1.htm |date=2008-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition is most accepted especially in lifecare communities such as nursing homes.

The Sociotherapy Association in the United States describes a sociotherapy that emphasizes the support of awareness, relationship, and the integration of life and the environment. Its main focus is the process of interpersonal relationships as a method of facilitating healthier living, rather than diagnosing intrapsychic psychopathology, and attempting to change it through coercion and analysis (psychology and psychotherapy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociotherapyassociation.com Sociotherapy Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for the Furtherance of Sociotherapy says: "Sociotherapy operates through a holistic vision of mankind. That is to say that the human being is seen as a somatic, psychic, social and spiritual unity, which is unique because of his own history of growth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc2.htm#gen Sociotherapy in the clinic of Foundation Centrum '45, general methods of approach of Sociotherapy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928214003/http://www.centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc2.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition of sociotherapy as a social science and profession is also based on regional dicta.  For example, the public health insurance system of [[Germany]] offered a uniquely German definition in order to subsidize treatment by sociotherapeutic professionals.  It said that sociotherapy "designates non-medical, social, and work-related components of the care process".&lt;ref name=multiple/&gt; 

Sociotherapy has been used in the treatment and education of adolescents at Kanner Academy and Community Schools in Sarasota Florida US. In These settings the working definition of sociotherapy is the practice of promoting healthy growth and living by facilitating therapeutic communities, personal relationships and positive peer culture. It is better known as the "relationship therapy".&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Lee Ph.D, Kanner, C. (2004) The Value of Connection: A Relational Approach to Ethics. (Chapter 5 The Relational Ethic in the Treatment of Adolescents)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand L. Kannenberg wrote, "Sociotherapy for Sociopaths: Resocial Group". Designed by the author to help prevent relapse and rearrest of parolees and probationers at a community mental health center in 1986, this text outlines an evidence-based, twenty-four session group program created for adult clients with coexisting Substance Use Disorders and the persistent problems of aggressiveness, breaking rules and laws, carelessness, dishonesty, impulsivity, indifference, irresponsibility and irritability. The book examines the importance of sociotherapy or sociological counseling in the corrections and substance abuse fields.

==Credentialing professionals==
The Sociotherapy Association is certifying sociotherapists and support companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sociotherapyassociation.com/sociotherapy-certification/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411202505/http://www.sociotherapyassociation.com/sociotherapy-certification/ |archivedate=2013-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing methods and theories==

===Practice===

The foundation of any sociotherapeutic relationship include the practice of dialogical relationship, the phenomenological method, field-theoretical strategies, experimental freedom, countertransference (CT) management.

Support Companionship is a time tested method for helping people, who for one reason or another, are struggling in their lives. Support Companions provide wrap-around support to adults, adolescents, families, the elderly, children, and service providers, when the support is needed! The foundation of support companion services is relationship, and the methodology of contact is sociotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supportcompanions.com|title=Support Companions - SUPPORTING HEALTHY LIVING ONE RELATIONSHIP AT A TIME|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociotherapists are constantly involved in creating and refining theories in group and socialization dynamics.  For example, a sociotherapist in a nursing home may experiment on the various methods one might employ to lure an introverted resident to activities and thus reduce the resident's risk of social isolation, which may be linked to the continued progression of that resident's [[dementia]].  In this example, the sociotherapist would also use activities like games and exercises to monitor an individual's [[mental health]] and use interaction with other residents as a tool to improve that mental health.

===Phenomenological method===

The goal of a phenomenological exploration is awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Yontef, G. (1993) Awareness, Dialogue, and Process, essays on Gestalt therapy. Highland, NY: The Gestalt Journal Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sociotherapy awareness and integration are central to healthy living. Much of the practice is centered around ways to support and improve a sense of awareness in our fields of experience. This is accomplished with relationship, experimentation and phenomenological exploration.

The phenomenological method comprises three steps: (1) the rule of epoché, (2) the rule of description, and (3) the rule of horizontalization.&lt;ref&gt;Spinelli, E. (2005) The interpreted world, an introduction to phenomenological psychology, 2nd edition. London, UK: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the rule of epoché we sets aside our personal initial biases and prejudices in order to suspend expectations and assumptions. Applying the rule of description, one occupies oneself with describing instead of explaining. Applying the rule of horizontalization one treats each item of description as having equal value or significance.

When it comes to a socio-therapeutic relationship the rule of epoché sets aside any initial theories with regard to what is presented in the meeting between therapist and client. The rule of description implies immediate and specific observations, abstaining from interpretations or explanations, especially those formed from the application of any clinical theory superimposed over the circumstances of experience. The rule of horizontalization avoids any hierarchical assignment of importance such that the data of experience become prioritized and categorized as they are received. 

As envisioned by Husserl, phenomenology is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since [[Plato]] in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's "lived experience".&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intersubjectivity===

Intersubjectivity emphasizes that shared understanding and consensus is essential in the shaping of our ideas, experiencing, and relations. Language, quintessentially, is viewed as communal rather than private. Therefore, it is problematic to view the individual as partaking in a private world, one which has a meaning defined apart from any other subjects. But in our shared divergence from a commonly understood experience, these private worlds naturally emerge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sociotherapyassociation.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''symbol grounding problem''' is related to the problem of how [[word]]s  ([[symbol]]s) get their [[Meaning (psychology)|meanings]], and hence to the problem of what meaning itself really is. The problem of meaning is in turn related to the problem of [[consciousness]], or how it is that [[mental state]]s are meaningful.

==Background==

===Referents===
[[Gottlob Frege]] distinguished a referent (the thing that a word refers to) and the word's meaning. This is most clearly illustrated using the proper names of concrete individuals, but it is also true of names of kinds of things and of abstract properties: (1) "Tony Blair", (2) "the prime minister of the UK during the year 2004", and (3) "Cherie Blair's husband" all have the same referent, but not the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Although this article draws in places upon Frege's view of semantics,  it is very anti-Fregean in stance. Frege was a fierce critic of psychological accounts that attempt to explain meaning in terms of mental states.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the meaning of a (referring) word is the rule or features that one must use in order to successfully pick out its referent. In that respect, (2) and (3) come closer to wearing their meanings on their sleeves, because they are explicitly stating a rule for picking out their referents: "Find whoever was prime minister of the UK during the year 2004", or "find whoever is Cherie's current husband". But that does not settle the matter, because there's still the problem of the meaning of the components of that rule ("UK," "during", "current", "PM", "Cherie", "husband"), and how to pick ''them'' out.

The phrase "Tony Blair" (or better still, just "Tony") does not have this recursive component problem, because it points straight to its referent, but how? If the meaning is the rule for picking out the referent, what is that rule, when we come down to non-decomposable components like proper names of individuals (or names of ''kinds'', as in "an unmarried man" is a "bachelor")?

===Referential process===

Humans are able to pick out the intended referents of words{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, such as "Tony Blair" or "bachelor," but this process need not be explicit.  It is probably an unreasonable expectation to know the explicit [[Philosophical Investigations#Rules|rule]] for picking out the intended referents{{why|date=October 2016}}.

So if we take a word's meaning to be the means of picking out its referent, then meanings are in our brains. That is meaning in the ''narrow'' sense. If we use "meaning" in a ''wider'' sense, then we may want to say that meanings include both the referents themselves and the means of picking them out. So if a word (say, "Tony-Blair") is located inside an entity (e.g., oneself) that can use the word and pick out its referent, then the word's wide meaning consists of both the means that that entity uses to pick out its referent, and the referent itself: a wide causal nexus between (1) a head, (2) a word inside it, (3) an object outside it, and (4) whatever "processing" is required in order to successfully connect the inner word to the outer object.

But what if the "entity" in which a word is located is not a head but a piece of paper (or a computer screen)? What is its meaning then? Surely all the (referring) words on this screen, for example, have meanings, just as they have referents.

In the 19th century, the semiotician [[Charles Saunders Peirce]] suggested what some think is a similar model: according to his triadic sign model, meaning requires (1) an interpreter, (2) a sign or representamen, (3) an object, and is (4) the virtual product of an endless regress and progress called [[Semiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles S. The philosophy of Peirce: selected writings. New York: AMS Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have interpreted Peirce as addressing the problem of grounding, feelings, and intentionality for the understanding of semiotic processes.&lt;ref&gt;Semeiosis and Intentionality T. L. Short Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Vol. 17, No. 3 (Summer, 1981), pp. 197-223&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Peirce's theory of signs has been rediscovered by an increasing number of artificial intelligence researchers in the context of symbol grounding problem.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Peirce and artificial intelligence: historical heritage and (new) theoretical stakes; Pierre Steiner; SAPERE - Special Issue on Philosophy and Theory of AI 5:265-276 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grounding process ===

{{expand section|date=October 2016}}

There would be no connection at all between written symbols and any intended referents if there were no minds mediating those intentions, via their own internal means of picking out those intended referents.

So the meaning of a word on a page is "ungrounded."&lt;ref&gt;Or, "imputed" as read below the dotted baseline of the [[triangle of reference]] since 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor would looking it up in a dictionary help: If one tried to look up the meaning of a word one did not understand in a [[dictionary]] of a language one did not already understand, one would just cycle endlessly from one meaningless definition to another. One's search for meaning would be ungrounded.

In contrast, the meaning of the words in one's head—those words one ''does'' understand—are "grounded"{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. That mental grounding of the meanings of words mediates between the words on any external page one reads (and understands) and the external objects to which those words refer.&lt;ref&gt;This is the [[causal theory of reference|causal]], [[contextual theory of reference]] that [[C. K. Ogden|Ogden]] &amp; [[I. A. Richards|Richards]] packed in ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[semantic externalism]] as claimed in "The Meaning of 'Meaning'" of ''Mind, Language and Reality'' (1975) by [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] who argues: "Meanings just ain't in the head." Now he and [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] seem to favor [[anti-realism]] in favor of [[intuitionism]], [[psychologism]], [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] and [[contextualism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements for symbol grounding===

Another symbol system is [[natural language]] (Fodor 1975). On paper or in a computer, language, too, is just a formal symbol system, manipulable by rules based on the arbitrary shapes of words. But in the brain, meaningless strings of squiggles become meaningful thoughts. Harnad has suggested two properties that might be required to make this difference:

*capacity to pick referents
*consciousness

====Capacity to pick out referents====
One property that static paper or, usually, even a dynamic computer lack that the brain possesses is the capacity to pick out symbols' referents. This is what we were discussing earlier, and it is what the hitherto undefined term "grounding" refers to. A symbol system alone, whether static or dynamic, cannot have this capacity (any more than a book can), because picking out referents is not just a computational (implementation-independent) property; it is a dynamical (implementation-dependent) property.

To be grounded, the symbol system would have to be augmented with nonsymbolic, sensorimotor capacities—the capacity to interact autonomously with that world of objects, events, actions, properties and states that its symbols are systematically interpretable (by us) as referring to. It would have to be able to pick out the referents of its symbols, and its sensorimotor interactions with the world would have to fit coherently with the symbols' interpretations.

The symbols, in other words, need to be connected directly to (i.e., grounded in) their referents; the connection must not be dependent only on the connections made by the brains of external interpreters like us. Just the symbol system alone, without this capacity for direct grounding, is not a viable candidate for being whatever it is that is really going on in our brains when we think meaningful thoughts (Cangelosi &amp; Harnad 2001).

Meaning as the ability to recognize instances (of objects) or perform actions is specifically treated in the paradigm called "Procedural Semantics", described in a number of papers including "Procedural Semantics" by Philip N.  Johnson-Laird &lt;ref&gt;Philip N.  Johnson-Laird  "Procedural Semantics" (Cognition, 5  (1977) 189; see http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/courses/mindsandmachines/Papers/procedural.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded by William A. Woods in "Meaning and Links".&lt;ref&gt;William A. Woods. "Meaning and Links" (AI Magazine Volume 28 Number 4 (2007); see http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2069/2056)&lt;/ref&gt;  A brief summary in Woods' paper reads: "The idea of procedural semantics is that the semantics of natural language sentences can be characterized in a formalism whose meanings are defined by abstract procedures that a computer (or a person) can either execute or reason about. In this theory the meaning of a noun is a procedure for recognizing or generating instances, the meaning of a proposition is a procedure for determining if it is true or false, and the meaning of an action is the ability to do the action or to tell if it has been done."

====Consciousness====
The necessity of groundedness, in other words, takes us from the level of the pen-pal [[Turing test]], which is purely symbolic (computational), to the robotic Turing test, which is hybrid symbolic/sensorimotor (Harnad 2000, 2007). Meaning is grounded in the robotic capacity to detect, categorize, identify, and act upon the things that words and sentences refer to (see entries for [[Affordance]] and for [[Categorical perception]]). On the other hand, if the symbols (words and sentences) refer to the very bits of '0' and '1', directly connected to their electronic implementations, which a (any?) computer system can readily manipulate (thus detect, categorize, identify and act upon), then even non-robotic computer systems could be said to be "sensorimotor" and hence able to "ground" symbols in this narrow domain. 

To categorize is to do the right thing with the right ''kind'' of thing. The categorizer must be able to detect the sensorimotor features of the members of the category that reliably distinguish them from the nonmembers. These feature-detectors must either be inborn or learned. The learning can be based on trial and error induction, guided by feedback from the consequences of correct and incorrect categorization; or, in our own linguistic species, the learning can also be based on verbal descriptions or definitions. The description or definition of a new category, however, can only convey the category and ground its name if the words in the definition are themselves already grounded category names (Blondin-Massé et al. 2008). So ultimately grounding has to be sensorimotor, to avoid infinite regress (Harnad 2005).

But if groundedness is a necessary condition for meaning, is it a sufficient one? Not necessarily, for it is possible that even a robot that could pass the Turing test, "living" amongst the rest of us indistinguishably for a lifetime, would fail to have in its head what Searle has in his: It could be a [[Philosophical zombie|zombie]], with no one home, feeling feelings, meaning meanings (Harnad 1995). However, it is possible that different interpreters (including different intelligent species of animals) would have different mechanisms for producing meaning in their systems, thus one cannot require that a system different from a human "experiences" meaning in the same way that a human does, and vice-versa. 

Harnad thus points at consciousness as a second property. The problem of discovering the causal mechanism for successfully picking out the referent of a category name can in principle be solved by cognitive science. But the problem of explaining how consciousness could play an "independent" role in doing so is probably insoluble, except on pain of [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. Perhaps symbol grounding (i.e., robotic TT capacity) is enough to ensure that conscious meaning is present, but then again, perhaps not. In either case, there is no way we can hope to be any the wiser—and that is Turing's methodological point (Harnad 2001b, 2003, 2006).

==Formulation==
To answer this question we have to formulate the symbol grounding problem itself [http://cogprints.org/3106/ (Harnad 1990)]:

{{expand section|date=October 2016}}

==Functionalism==

There is a school of thought according to which the computer is more like the brain—or rather, the brain is more like the computer: According to this view (called "[[Computational theory of mind|computationalism]]", a variety of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]), the future theory explaining how the brain picks out its referents (the theory that cognitive neuroscience may eventually arrive at) will be a purely computational one (Pylyshyn 1984). A computational theory is a theory at the software level. It is essentially a computer algorithm: a set of rules for manipulating symbols. And the algorithm is "implementation-independent." That means that whatever it is that an algorithm is doing, it will do the same thing no matter what hardware it is executed on. The physical details of the [[dynamical system]] implementing the computation are irrelevant to the computation itself, which is purely formal; any hardware that can run the computation will do, and all physical implementations of that particular computer algorithm are equivalent, computationally.

A computer can execute any computation. Hence once computationalism finds a proper computer algorithm, one that our brain could be running when there is meaning transpiring in our heads, meaning will be transpiring in that computer too, when it implements that algorithm.

How would we know that we have a proper computer algorithm? It would have to be able to pass the [[Turing test]]. That means it would have to be capable of corresponding with any human being as a pen-pal, for a lifetime, without ever being in any way distinguishable from a real human pen-pal.

==Searle's Chinese room argument==
{{main|Chinese room}}
[[John Searle]] formulated the "[[Chinese room]] argument" in order to disprove computationalism{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. The Chinese room argument is based on a thought experiment: in it, Searle stated that if the Turing test were conducted in Chinese, then he himself, Searle (who does not understand Chinese), could execute a program that implements the same algorithm that the computer was using without knowing what any of the words he was manipulating meant. 

At first glance, it would seem that if there's no meaning going on inside Searle's head when he is implementing that program, then there's no meaning going on inside the computer when it is the one implementing the algorithm either, computation being implementation-independent. But on a closer look, for a person to execute the same program that a computer would, at very least it would  have to have access to a similar bank of memory that the computer has (most likely externally stored). This means that the new computational system that executes the same algorithm is no longer just Searle's original head, but that plus the memory bank (and possibly other devices). 
In particular, this additional memory could store a digital representation of the intended referent of different words (like images, sounds, even video sequences), that the algorithm would use as a model of, and to derive features assotiated with, the intended referent. The "meaning" then is not to be searched in just Searle's original brain, but in the overall system needed to process the algorithm. (Just like when Searle is reading English words, the meaning is not to be located in isolated logical processing areas of the brain, but probably in the overall brain, likely including specific long-term memory areas). 
Thus, Searle's not perceiving any meaning in his head alone when simulating the work of a computer, does not imply lack of meaning in the overall system, and thus in the actual computer system passing an advanced Turing test.

=== Implications ===
How does Searle know that there is no meaning going on in his head when he is executing such a Turing-test-passing program? Exactly the same way he knows whether there is or is not meaning going on inside his head under any other conditions: He ''understands'' the words of English, whereas the Chinese symbols that he is manipulating according to the algorithm's rules mean nothing whatsoever to him (and there is no one else in his head for them to mean anything to). However, the complete system that is manipulating those Chinese symbols - which is not just Searle's brain, as explained in the previous section - may have the ability to extract meaning from those symbols, in the sense of being able to use  internal (memory) models of the intended referents, pick out the intended referents of those symbols, and generally identifying and using their features appropriately.

Note that in pointing out that the Chinese words would be meaningless to him under those conditions, Searle has appealed to consciousness. Otherwise one could argue that there ''would'' be meaning going on in Searle's  head under those conditions, but that Searle himself would simply not be conscious of it. That is called the [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/#4.1 "Systems Reply"] to Searle's Chinese Room Argument, and Searle [http://cogprints.org/4023/ rejects] the Systems Reply as being merely a reiteration, in the face of negative evidence, of the very thesis (computationalism) that is on trial in his thought-experiment: "Are words in a running computation like the ungrounded words on a page, meaningless without the mediation of brains, or are they like the grounded words in brains?"

In this either/or question, the (still undefined) word "ungrounded" has implicitly relied on the difference between inert words on a page and consciously meaningful words in our heads. And Searle is asserting that under these conditions (the Chinese Turing test), the words in his head would not be consciously meaningful, hence they would still be as ungrounded as the inert words on a page.

So if Searle is right, that (1) both the words on a page and those in any running computer program (including a Turing-test-passing computer program) are meaningless in and of themselves, and hence that (2) whatever it is that the brain is doing to generate meaning can't be just implementation-independent computation, then what ''is'' the brain doing to generate meaning [http://cogprints.org/4023/ (Harnad 2001a)]?

==Brentano's notion of intentionality==
"[[Intentionality]]" has been called the "mark of the mental" because of some observations by the philosopher [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] to the effect that mental states always have an inherent, intended (mental) object or content toward which they are "directed": One sees something, wants something, believes something, desires something, understands something, means something etc., and that object is always something that one has ''in mind''. Having a mental object is part of having anything in mind. Hence it is the mark of the mental. There are no "free-floating" mental states that do not also have a mental object. Even hallucinations and imaginings have an object, and even feeling depressed feels like something. Nor is the object the "external" physical object, when there is one. One may see a real chair, but the "intentional" object of one's "intentional state" is the mental chair one has in mind. (Yet another term for intentionality has been "aboutness" or "representationality": thoughts are always ''about'' something; they are (mental) "representations" ''of''  something; but that something is what it is that the thinker has in mind, not whatever external object may or may not correspond to it.)

If this all sounds like skating over the surface of a problem rather than a real break-through, then the foregoing description has had its intended effect: No, the problem of intentionality is not the symbol grounding problem; nor is grounding symbols the solution to the problem of intentionality. The symbols inside an autonomous dynamical symbol system that is able to pass the robotic Turing test are grounded, in that, unlike in the case of an ungrounded symbol system, they do not depend on the mediation of the mind of an external interpreter to connect them to the external objects that they are interpretable (by the interpreter) as being "about"; the connection is autonomous, direct, and unmediated. But ''grounding is not meaning''. Grounding is an input/output performance function. Grounding connects the sensory inputs from external objects to internal symbols and states occurring within an autonomous sensorimotor system, guiding the system's resulting processing and output.

Meaning, in contrast, is something mental. But to try to put a halt to the name-game of proliferating nonexplanatory synonyms for the mind/body problem without solving it (or, worse, implying that there is more than one mind/body problem), let us cite just one more thing that requires no further explication: ''feeling''. The only thing that distinguishes an internal state that merely has grounding from one that has meaning is that it ''feels like something'' to be in the meaning state, whereas it does not feel like anything to be in the merely grounded functional state. Grounding is a functional matter; feeling is a felt matter. And that is the real source of Brentano's vexed peekaboo relation between "intentionality" and its internal "intentional object":  All mental states, in addition to being the functional states of an autonomous dynamical system, are also feeling states: Feelings are not merely "functed," as all other physical states are; feelings are also felt.

Hence feeling ([[sentience]]) is the real mark of the mental. But the symbol grounding problem is not the same as the mind/body problem, let alone a solution to it. The mind/body problem is actually the feeling/function problem: Symbol-grounding touches only its functional component.  This does not detract from the importance of the symbol grounding problem, but just reflects that it is a keystone piece to the bigger puzzle called the mind.

The neuroscientist [[Antonio Damasio]] investigates this marking function of feelings and emotions in his [[Somatic marker hypothesis]]. Damasio adds the notion of biologic [[homeostasis]] to this discussion, presenting it as an automated bodily regulation process providing intentionality to a mind via emotions. Homeostasis is the mechanism that keeps all bodily processes in healthy balance. All of our actions and perceptions will be automatically "evaluated" by our body hardware according to their contribution to homeostasis. This gives us an implicit orientation on how to survive. Such bodily or somatic evaluations can come to our mind in the form of conscious and non-conscious feelings ("gut feelings") and lead our decision-making process. The meaning of a word can be roughly conceptualized as the sum of its associations and their expected contribution to homeostasis, where associations are reconstructions of sensomotor perceptions that appeared in contiguity with the word. Yet, the Somatic marker hypothesis is still hotly debated and critics claim that it has failed to clearly demonstrate how these processes interact at a psychological and evolutionary level. The recurrent question that the Somatic marker hypothesis does not address remains: how and why does homeostasis (as in any [[servomechanism]] such as a thermostat and furnace) become ''felt'' homeostasis?

'''''Views of the Biblical World''''' (Library of Congress Catalogue Number 59-7767) is a five-volume set of reference books published in 1959 by the International Publishing Company J-M, of Israel.&lt;ref name=IPC&gt;International Publishing Company J-M:  http://www.mbendi.com/orgs/1416/e846.htm  http://www.jewishusedbooks.com/prodview.asp?idProduct=42239&lt;/ref&gt; Also published under the name ''World of the Bible'', the series was acclaimed at the time as a landmark. It was the first publication dedicated exclusively to the correlation of archaeological and historical discoveries in Palestine with biblical texts.

The volumes included contributions from biblical scholars and archaeologists including [[Benjamin Mazar]], [[William F. Albright|William Albright]], [[Yigael Yadin]] and [[Michael Avi-Yonah]]. The books' Editorial Manager was biblical historian Prof. Ory Mazar.

==Landmark publication==
"''Views of the Biblical World''... was the first reference book series to take each chapter, and in some cases even each verse, of the biblical narrative and publish a detailed commentary on the geographical, historical and archaeological discoveries in the Bible Lands related to those passages,” says Jerusalem historian Michael Leon. “The last volume, number 5, was dedicated exclusively to discoveries related to the New Testament.” 

According to a commentary by Ivan Caine, the book series included, “pictures and text [which are even today] invaluable for personal enrichment and... for teachers and preachers in college or clerical classes.” Indeed, some fifty years after its release, the series is still found in most major libraries, Universities and Bible schools.

[[Martin Buber]] wrote that the book series was the first to show, “a comprehensive view of the countries and civilizations amid which the people of the Bible lived and developed.”  Israel's president, [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] wrote that the volumes, “provide students of the Bible throughout the world with a clear picture, based on the most recent scientific conclusions, of the physical, ethnic and historical surroundings in which... the biblical stories [took place].”  &lt;ref name=VBW&gt;Views of the Biblical World: http://www.onenewspage.com/news/Press+Releases/20110722/24229970/Dan-Mazar-Named-To-Chair-Reprint-of-Historic.htm  https://www.amazon.com/Views-Biblical-World-Editorial-Avi-Yonah/product-reviews/B0014NFES0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Updated edition==
Jerusalem historian Dan Mazar has been named by the publishers as the head of the editorial board for the book's reprint.  Mazar has authored numerous works on Christian-Israel relations and Second Temple archaeology and is a former Chairman of the political action group, the Christian Mid-East Conference.  He is the third generation in his family to be involved in this book series: his grandfather [[Benjamin Mazar]] was the original Chairman of the Editorial Board of ''Views of the Biblical World'' in 1959, and his father Ory was the Editorial Manager of the publication.&lt;ref name=Mazars&gt;Benjamin Mazar and Dan Mazar:  https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/11/obituaries/benjamin-mazar-89-israeli-biblical-archaeologist.html http://www.briefingwire.com/pr/dan-mazar-named-to-head-historic-bible-book-release&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vision span''' or '''perceptual span''' is a controversial concept referring to the angular span (vertically and horizontally), within which  the [[human eye]] has sharp enough [[Visual perception|vision]] to perform an action accurately (reading or face recognition). The [[visual field]] of the human eye spans approximately 120&amp;nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees of arc]].  However, most of that arc is [[peripheral vision]]. The human eye has much greater [[Optical resolution|resolution]] in the [[macula]], where there is a higher density of [[cone cell]]s. The [[field of view]] that is observed with sufficient resolution to read text typically spans about 6&amp;nbsp;degrees of arc, which is wide enough to allow a clear view of about five words in a row when printed text at ordinary size is held about 50&amp;nbsp;centimeters from the eyes. Regarding face processing, the [[field of view]] with a sufficient amount of information in order to recognise faces accurately spans about 7° which represents about 45% of a face.&lt;ref name=FS&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1167/17.5.16 |pmid=28549354 |title=The Facespan—the perceptual span for face recognition |journal=Journal of Vision |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=16 |year=2017 |last1=Papinutto |first1=Michael |last2=Lao |first2=Junpeng |last3=Ramon |first3=Meike |last4=Caldara |first4=Roberto |last5=Miellet |first5=Sébastien }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain creates the illusion of having a greater visual span by automatically and unconsciously moving the center of vision into any area of interest in the field of view.

==Application to speed reading==

While reading, readers will fail to recognize a word unless they are fixating within three to four character spaces of the word.&lt;ref name=Rayner1975&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(75)90005-5 |title=The perceptual span and peripheral cues in reading |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=65–81 |year=1975 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith |bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true for [[speed reading|speed readers]] and [[Skimming (reading)|skimmers]].  Speed readers cannot answer questions about a main point or detail, if they did not fixate directly on it or within three character spaces of it (Just and Carpenter 1987).  When a text is removed whilst reading, readers can only accurately report upon the word they were fixating upon or the next one to the right (McConkie and Hogaoam 1985).  There is no evidence from eye movement research that individuals are making predictions of text based upon hypotheses about the words in the periphery so that they can skip over or spend less time on unimportant or redundant words.&lt;ref name=Rayner1975/&gt;

Most speed reading courses claim that the peripheral vision can be used to read text. This has been suggested impossible because the text is blurred out through lack of visual resolution.  At best the human brain can only ''guess'' at the content of text outside the macular region. There simply are not enough cone cells away from the center of the visual field to identify words in the periphery of the field.

It has been suggested that the fixation span can be stretched through training ([[meta guiding]]) to take in as much as a line for the purpose of skimming or speed reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 2729064|year = 2007|last1 = Legge|first1 = G. E|title = The case for the visual span as a sensory bottleneck in reading|journal = Journal of Vision|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 9.1–915|last2 = Cheung|first2 = S. H|last3 = Yu|first3 = D|last4 = Chung|first4 = S. T|last5 = Lee|first5 = H. W|last6 = Owens|first6 = D. P|pmid = 18217824|doi = 10.1167/7.2.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However other sources suggest that using this method can result in a severely reduced comprehension rate in comparison to normal reading ("[[rauding]]").

Some speed reading courses stress that the human eye has to move very quickly.  They also stress that the human eye should move in a pattern to fill in the information that was not properly perceived.  The effective limit for [[wikt:scan|scan]]ning speeds based upon the limit of the human eye's resolution is about 300 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;http://skepdic.com/speedreading.html{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that such speeds also require great practice, and extremely rapid eye movements, although research suggests that such training is not possible.  It has been suggested by some speed reading promoters that the readers who achieve such speeds are on the [[autism spectrum]].  Research into reading rate suggests that study strategies, rather than speed reading, explains why expert readers, such as professors and editors, are more efficient than others.

==Application to face processing==

Face recognition system requires several fixation on different location (typically in a triangular pattern) for a face to be recognised. The same is true for the so-called Super Recognisers who are persons with high face recognition capabilities. Similarly to the reading span, the Facespan might be modulated by difficulty,&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1990-18858-001{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; expertise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3758/PBR.17.6.834 |pmid=21169577 |title=Eye movements, the perceptual span, and reading speed |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=834 |year=2010 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith |last2=Slattery |first2=Timothy J |last3=Bélanger |first3=Nathalie N |pmc=3075059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(86)90037-8 |pmid=3701249 |title=Eye movements and the perceptual span in beginning and skilled readers |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=211–36 |year=1986 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith }}&lt;/ref&gt; disorder &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02648003 |title=Eye movements, perceptual span, and reading disability |journal=Annals of Dyslexia |volume=33 |pages=163–173 |year=1983 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other idiosyncratic differences between individuals. The idiosyncratic differences are thus most probably due to differences in Facespan rather than in oculomotor strategy.

'''Visual culture''' is the aspect of [[culture]] expressed in [[image|visual images]]. Many academic fields study this subject, including [[cultural studies]], [[art history]], [[critical theory]], [[philosophy]], [[media studies]], and [[anthropology]].

== Overview ==
Among theorists working within contemporary culture, this field of study often overlaps with [[film theory|film studies]], [[psychoanalytic theory]], [[sex studies]], [[queer theory]], and the [[television studies|study of television]]; it can also include [[video game studies]], [[comics]], [[visual arts|traditional artistic media]], [[advertising]], the [[Internet]], and any other medium that has a crucial [[visual]] component.

The field's versatility stems from the range of objects contained under the term "visual culture", which aggregates "visual events in which information, meaning or pleasure is sought by the consumer in an interface with visual technology".  The term "visual technology" refers any media designed for purposes of perception or with the potential to augment our visual capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mirzoeff|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Mirzoeff|title=What is Visual Culture?|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Mirzoeff-What_is_Visual_Culture.pdf|work= The Visual Culture Reader (2nd ed.)|isbn=978-0-415-14134-5 |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the changing technological aspects of visual culture as well as a scientific method-derived desire to create taxonomies or articulate what the "visual" is, many aspects of Visual Culture overlap with the study of science and technology, including hybrid electronic media, cognitive science, neurology, and image and brain theory.  In an interview with the ''[[Journal of Visual Culture]]'', academic [[Martin Jay]] explicates the rise of this tie between the visual and the technological: "Insofar as we live in a culture whose technological advances abet the production and dissemination of such images at a hitherto unimagined level, it is necessary to focus on how they work and what they do, rather than move past them too quickly to the ideas they represent or the reality they purport to depict. In so doing, we necessarily have to ask questions about ... technological mediations and extensions of visual experience."&lt;ref name="That Visual Turn"&gt;{{cite web|title=That Visual Turn|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Jay-VisualTurn-JVC-2002.pdf|work=[[Journal of Visual Culture]]|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visualism==
The term "Visualism" was developed by the German anthropologist [[Johannes Fabian]] to criticise the dominating role of vision in scientific discourse, through such terms as [[observation]]. He points to an under theorised approach to the use of visual representation which leads to a corpuscular theory of knowledge and information which leads to their atomisation.&lt;ref name=Rarey&gt;{{cite book |last=Rarey |first=Matthew |editor1-first=James |editor1-last=Elkins |editor2-first=Kristi |editor2-last=McGuire |editor3-first=Maureen |editor3-last=Burns |editor4-first=Alicia |editor4-last=Chester |editor5-first=Joel  |editor5-last=Kuennen |title=Theorizing Visual Studies: Writing Through the Discipline |publisher=Routledge |date=2012 |pages= 278–281|chapter=Visualism |isbn=9781136159169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with other areas of study==
It also may overlap with another emerging field, that of [[performance studies]].  As "the turn from art history to visual culture studies parallels a turn from theater studies to performance studies", it is clear that the perspectival shift that both emerging fields embody is comparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Shannon|title=Performing Show and Tell: Disciplines of Visual Culture and Performance Studies|url=http://vcu.sagepub.com/content/4/2/163.abstract|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Visual Culture" goes by a variety of names at different institutions, including Visual and Critical Studies, Visual and Cultural Studies, and Visual Studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
There has appeared analysis which applies method with computational media. For example, in 2008, [[Yukihiko Yoshida]] did a study called&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida,Yukihiko, Leni Riefenstahl and German Expressionism: A Study of Visual Cultural Studies Using Transdisciplinary Semantic Space of Specialized Dictionaries ,Technoetic Arts: a journal of speculative research (Editor Roy Ascott),Volume 8, Issue3,intellect,2008&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Leni Riefenstahl]] and [[German expressionism]]: research in Visual Cultural Studies using the trans-disciplinary semantic spaces of specialized dictionaries."  The study took databases of images tagged with connotative and denotative keywords (a search engine) and found Riefenstahl's imagery had the same qualities as imagery tagged "degenerate" in the title of [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]], Germany at 1937.

== History ==
Early work on visual culture has been done by [[John Berger]] (''[[Ways of Seeing]]'', 1972) and [[Laura Mulvey]] (''[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]'', 1975) that follows on from [[Jacques Lacan]]'s theorization of the unconscious [[gaze]]. Twentieth-century pioneers such as [[György Kepes]] and [[William Ivins, Jr.]] as well as iconic phenomenologists like [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] also played important roles in creating a foundation for the discipline. For the history of art, [[Svetlana Alpers]] published a pioneering study on ''The Art of Describing: Dutch Art in the Seventeenth Century'' (Chicago 1983) in which she took up an earlier implus of [[Michael Baxandall]] to study the visual culture of a whole region of early-modern Europe in all its facets: landscape painting and perception, optics and perspectival studies, geography and topographic measurements, united in a common ''mapping impulse''.

Major works on visual culture include those by [[W. J. T. Mitchell]], [[Griselda Pollock]], [http://www.ves.fas.harvard.edu/bruno.html Giuliana Bruno], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Paul Crowther (philosopher)|Paul Crowther]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. Continuing work has been done by [[Lisa Cartwright]], [[Margaret Dikovitskaya]], [[Nicholas Mirzoeff]], and [[Jackie Stacey]]. The first book titled Visual Culture (Vizuális Kultúra) was written by [[:hu:Miklós Pál|Pál Miklós]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="Vizuális Kultúra"&gt;{{cite book |last=Miklós |first=Pál |title=Vizuális Kultúra: Elméleti és kritikai tanulmányok a képzőművészet köréből |publisher=Magvető |date=1976 |isbn=9632702980}}&lt;/ref&gt; For history of science and technology, [[Klaus Hentschel]] has published a systematic comparative history in which various patterns of their emergence, stabilization and diffusion are identified.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Klaus Hentschel]]: [http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198717874.do ''Visual Cultures in Science and Technology - A Comparative History''], Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the German-speaking world, analogous discussions about "Bildwissenschaft" (image studies) are conducted, a.o., by Gottfried Boehm, [[Hans Belting]], and Horst Bredekamp.

Visual culture studies have been increasingly important in religious studies through the work of [[David Morgan (Art Historian)|David Morgan]], Sally Promey, [[Jeffrey F. Hamburger]], and S. Brent Plate.

==Difference from image studies==

While the image remains a focal point in visual culture studies, it is the relations between images and consumers that are evaluated for their cultural significance, not just the image in and of itself.  [[Martin Jay]] clarifies, "Although images of all kinds have long served as illustrations of arguments made discursively, the growth of visual culture as a field has allowed them to be examined more in their own terms as complex figural artifacts or the stimulants to visual experiences."&lt;ref name="That Visual Turn"/&gt;

Likewise, [[W. J. T. Mitchell]] explicitly distinguishes the two fields in his claim that visual culture studies "helps us to see that even something as broad as the image does not exhaust the field of visuality; that visual studies is not the same thing as image studies, and that the study of the visual image is just one component of the larger field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visual Culture/Visual Studies: Inventory of Recent Definitions|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/VisualCulture/VisualCultureStudies-definitions.html|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
