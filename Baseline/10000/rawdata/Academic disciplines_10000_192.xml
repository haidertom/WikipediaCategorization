      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6324">'''Alan Hywel Jones''', usually ''Hywel Jones'' professionally, is a [[British people|British]] [[materials science|materials scientist]], working on [[Ceramic_engineering#Ceramic_composites|ceramic composites]] and [[body armor|body armour]], [[tribology]], metals, including sustainable use of [[precious metals]] and [[rare-earth elements]], and decorative alloys, wear-resistant coatings, materials analysis and ballistics, and friction-stir methods ([[friction-stir welding|welding]] and processing).&lt;ref name="SHUProfile"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shu.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/staff-profiles/hywel-jones|title=Hywel Jones  - Sheffield Hallam University|website=www.shu.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has appeared on radio and television to discuss some of his areas of interest.&lt;ref name="SHUStaffatMC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www4.shu.ac.uk/mediacentre/dr-hywel-jones|title=Dr Hywel Jones  - Media - Sheffield Hallam University|website=www4.shu.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jones was born in [[Wales]] in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/YuiZYGjrAri7jbENxncPblwarsA/appointments Companies House - Appointments - Alan Hywel Jones], checked 26 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and attended school in [[Ebbw Vale]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://chemicalsj10.imascientist.org.uk/profile/hyweljones I'n a scientist - Profile - HywelJones]&lt;/ref&gt; about {{convert|37|km}} north of Cardiff.

==Education and career==
===Academic career===
Jones studied at the [[University of Warwick]] from 1988 to 1997, receiving a BSc in Physics (1991), an MSc in Materials Characterisation (1993), and a PhD on the &lt;em&gt;Synthesis and Tribology of Sialon / TiB2 Ceramic Composite&lt;/em&gt; (1997).  He then secured a post as a post-doctoral research fellow and worked over three years on an EU-funded project on ultra-hard composites for tribological applications.&lt;ref name="SHUProfile"/&gt;

Jones moved to a post at [[Sheffield Hallam University|Sheffield Hallam University's]] Materials and Engineering Research Institute (MERI) in 2000, and continues to work there.  He became a senior consultant in 2004, then a senior research fellow, and is now a principal research fellow.&lt;ref name="SHUProfile"/&gt;   He coordinates the consultancy activities of the institute, and has been involved in several hundred projects.&lt;ref name="SHUStaffatMC"/&gt;
Jones worked from 2008 to 2012 on UK [[Ministry of Defence]]-funded research into novel light-weight ceramic composite materials for personal armour,&lt;ref name="SHUProfile"/&gt; which in turn extended into armour-piercing ammunition, as well as kiln surfaces and high-wear industrial fittings.

His roles have also included membership in the Education and Skills Working Group of Materials UK, which produced a report on a 20-year strategy for UK materials science,&lt;ref name="SHUProfile"/&gt; the "What's in my stuff" public outreach and education campaign around recycling, and work as an expert witness in civil and criminal cases.&lt;ref name="SHUProfile"/&gt;

====Recognition====
Jones was a joint recipient of the Venture Prize of the [[Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers]], one of the ancient livery companies of London, for work on lightweight ceramic body armour, an award linked to the launch of university spin-off venture XeraCarb.&lt;ref name="SHUMERIProfile"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www4.shu.ac.uk/research/meri/dr-hywel-jones|title=Dr Hywel Jones - Materials and Engineering Research Institute - Sheffield Hallam University|website=www4.shu.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
He was also a recipient of a [[Yorkshire Forward]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/business/success-1400-times-over-1-236016|title=Success 1400 times over|website=www.thestar.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.armourershall.co.uk/venture-prize/previous-venture-prize-winners|title=Previous Venture Prize Winners|website=Armourers' Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaborations====
Jones has worked closely with several fellow scientists and academics, including Anthony Pick, Karen Vernon-Parry, [[Cóilín Ó Dubhghaill]] and Maria Hanson.

===Consultancy and commercialisation===
In 2011, Jones co-founded a university spinoff company, XeraCarb Ltd., with Anthony Pick.  With headquarters and factory in [[Barnsley]], the company works on silicon carbide composite ceramics, suitable for body armour and kiln linings, among other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://relationshipscience.com/sheffield-hallam-university-o584741|title=Sheffield Hallam University - Relationship Science|website=relationshipscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following acquisition, the company has since February 2017 operated as part of Capital Refractories, within the CRL Group, with Jones retained as Chief Scientific Officer.

In 2016, Jones co-founded, with Cóilín Ó Dubhghaill and others, Mikana Innovations Ltd., a spin-off based on joint work between Sheffield Hallam University and Rotary Engineering Ltd.; he is today a director.  This company produces a hybrid alloy, &lt;em&gt;mikana&lt;/em&gt;, based on Japanese craft techniques, suitable for volume production for the making of jewellery and other luxury items, and hollowware.

====Advanced materials====
Jones has worked on a form of "stainless silver" alloy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1508309/Scientists-take-a-shine-to-stainless-silver.html|title=Scientists take a shine to 'stainless' silver|first=David Derbyshire, Consumer Affairs|last=Editor|date=19 February 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as advanced ceramics and the hybrid alloy mikana.&lt;ref name="Mikana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikana.co.uk/|title=Mikana|first=Prototype|last=Creative|website=www.mikana.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceramics work has led to material advances in the making of personal armour and kiln lining, while mikana has properties similar to [[mokume gane]] while being more manageable and affordable.&lt;ref name="Mikana"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Jones lives in the Sheffield suburb of [[Crookes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1651">[[image:Alpha oxidation.svg|Enzymatic steps of alpha oxidation|right|thumb|250px]]
 

==Pathway==
Alpha-oxidation of [[phytanic acid]] is believed to take place entirely within [[peroxisomes]]. 
#[[Phytanic acid]] is first attached to [[Coenzyme A|CoA]] to form [[phytanoyl-CoA]].
#[[Phytanoyl-CoA]] is oxidized by [[phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase]], in a process using Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to yield 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA.
#2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA is cleaved by [[2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase]] in a [[thiamine pyrophosphate|TPP]]-dependent reaction to form pristanal and [[formyl-CoA]] (in turn later broken down into [[formate]] and eventually CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
#Pristanal is oxidized by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] to form [[pristanic acid]] (which can then undergo [[beta-oxidation]]).
(Propionyl-CoA is released as a result of beta oxidation when the beta carbon is substituted)

==Deficiency==
Enzymatic deficiency in alpha-oxidation (most frequently in [[phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase]]) leads to [[Refsum's disease]], in which the accumulation of [[phytanic acid]] and its derivatives leads to neurological damage. Other disorders of [[peroxisome]] biogenesis also prevent alpha-oxidation from occurring.

A '''backdrive''' is a component used in reverse to obtain its input from its output. This extends to many concepts and systems from thought based to practical mechanical applications.

Not every system can be backdriven. A DC [[electrical generator]] can be implemented by backdriving a DC [[electric motor]], however a [[worm drive]] works only in one direction.

Example: A CNC vertical mill has a vertical lead screw on the Z-axis. A low lead screw pitch (i.e. 5 turns per inch or fewer) means when the driving motor power is removed such as by turning the machine off, the weight of the spindle will cause the lead screw to rotate as the spindle motor falls down. Obviously this is a bad thing. The solution to prevent back-driving is to use a finer (higher) lead screw pitch (i.e. 10tpi or greater) or have a locking mechanism.

'''Becta''', originally known as the '''British Educational Communications and Technology Agency''', was a [[non-departmental public body]] (popularly known as a [[Quango]]) funded by the [[Department for Education]] and its predecessor departments, in the United Kingdom. It was a charity and a [[company limited by guarantee]]. The abolition of Becta was announced in the [[Spending Review#2010 Spending Review|May 2010 post-election spending review]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8699522.stm George Osborne outlines detail of £6.2bn spending cuts] BBC News, 24 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Government funding was discontinued in March 2011. Becta went into liquidation in April 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12932140|title=Schools quango closes its doors|last=Simpson|first=Emma|date=2011-04-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/may/24/becta-government-closure|title=Government to close Becta|last=Arthur|first=Charles|date=2010-05-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-24|last2=editor|first2=technology|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Role==
Becta was the lead agency in the United Kingdom for promotion and integration of [[ICT (education)|information and communications technology]] (ICT) in education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Becta was a company limited by guarantee with charitable status. It was established in 1998 through the reconstitution of the [[National Council for Educational Technology]] (NCET), which oversaw the procurement of all ICT equipment and [[e-learning]] strategy for schools. 

== Policy ==
Foremost among the 2005–2008 Becta strategic objectives were "to influence strategic direction and development of national education policy to best take advantage of technology" and "to develop a national digital infrastructure and resources strategy leading to greater national coherence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?page=1748|title=Strategic objectives|accessdate=20 November 2006|date=2005–2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060718110019/http://about.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?page=1748 |archivedate = 18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==National Grid for Learning==
The [[National Grid for Learning]] (NGfL) was managed by Becta and was set up as a gateway to educational resources on to support schools and colleges across the UK. The NGfL portal was launched in November 1998, as one of several new programmes initiated by the new Labour government which took office in May 1997 and had a linked budget of earmarked funds to be spent on schools' internet connections and ICT.

==Purchasing Frameworks==
Becta awarded certain vendors placement on approved "purchasing frameworks":  
{{"|The frameworks are awarded in accordance with EU procurement legislation... against a range of criteria based around quality of provision and service, and against the extent to which they meet the requirements of the functional and technical specifications – specifications that have been developed in conjunction with all stakeholders, including members of the open source community...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessreviewonline.com/os/archives/2006/11/becta_denies_op.html |title=Becta denies open source school barriers |date=23 November 2006 |publisher=Computer Business Review |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206190125/http://www.businessreviewonline.com/os/archives/2006/11/becta_denies_op.html |archivedate=6 February 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The purchasing frameworks were criticised as being outdated, and for effectively denying schools the option of benefiting from both free and open source and the value and experience of small and medium ICT companies.&lt;ref name="osedm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=31752&amp;SESSION=885|title=Software in Schools|date=21 November 2006|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=7 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070218092156/http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=31752&amp;SESSION=885| archivedate= 18 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participating companies had to have a net worth of at least £700,000 to qualify and had to satisfy a list of functional requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A concern was raised about the "over-comfortable relationship the government has with some of the bigger players."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/elearning/story/0,,1985425,00.html|title=Open source argument|date=9 January 2007|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070112052453/http://education.guardian.co.uk/elearning/story/0%2C%2C1985425%2C00.html| archivedate= 12 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Crispin Weston, who had helped Becta draw up the criteria used to select suppliers, asked the EC Competition Commission to investigate his allegation that a significant number of the successful tenders had failed to implement the mandatory functional requirements, including particular aspects of inter-operability.&lt;ref name="euinvest"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/08/becta_ec_complaint/|title=Becta's schools software scheme reported to EC|author=Mark Ballard|date=8 January 2007|publisher=The Register|accessdate=7 February 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070210003910/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/08/becta_ec_complaint/| archivedate= 10 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also added in his letter to the Commission that they should take action on the further issue of: 
{{"|[T]he insistence that many different categories of software within a particular school or Local Authority should all be supplied by a single supplier [which] has serious anti-competitive implications."&lt;ref name="westoneu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alphalearning.co.uk/ojeu.htm|author=Crispin Weston|publisher=Alpha Learning|title=Becta's Learning Platform Procurement|date=5 January 2007|accessdate=7 February 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128193252/http://www.alphalearning.co.uk/ojeu.htm|archivedate=28 January 2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Bioreporter.jpg|thumb|361px|right|'''Anatomy of a bioreporter organism.''' Upon exposure to a specific analyte, the promoter/reporter gene complex is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translated into a reporter protein that is ultimately responsible for generating a signal.]]

'''Bioreporters''' are intact, living [[microbial]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that have been [[genetically engineered]] to produce a measurable signal in response to a specific chemical or physical agent in their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].  Bioreporters contain two essential genetic elements, a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] gene and a [[reporter gene]].  The promoter gene is turned on ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]) when the target agent is present in the cell’s environment.  The promoter gene in a normal bacterial cell is linked to other genes that are then likewise transcribed and then translated into proteins that help the cell in either combating or adapting to the agent to which it has been exposed.  In the case of a bioreporter, these genes, or portions thereof, have been removed and replaced with a reporter gene.  Consequently, turning on the promoter gene now causes the reporter gene to be turned on.  Activation of the reporter gene leads to production of reporter [[proteins]] that ultimately generate some type of a detectable signal.  Therefore, the presence of a signal indicates that the bioreporter has sensed a particular target agent in its environment.

Originally developed for fundamental analysis of factors affecting [[gene expression]], bioreporters were early on applied for the detection of environmental contaminants&lt;ref&gt;King, J.M.H. et al. (1990) Rapid, sensitive bioluminescence reporter technology for naphthalene exposure and biodegradation. Science 249, 778-781.http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/249/4970/778?ck=nck&lt;/ref&gt; and have since evolved into fields as diverse as [[medical diagnosis|medical diagnostics]], [[precision agriculture]], [[food safety]] assurance, process monitoring and control, and bio-[[microelectronic]] computing.  Their versatility stems from the fact that there exist a large number of [[reporter gene]] systems that are capable of generating a variety of signals.  Additionally, reporter genes can be genetically inserted into [[bacterial]], [[yeast]], [[plant]], and [[mammalian]] cells, thereby providing considerable functionality over a wide range of host vectors.

==Reporter gene systems==

Several types of reporter genes are available for use in the construction of bioreporter organisms, and the signals they generate can usually be categorized as either [[colorimetric]], [[fluorescent]], [[luminescent]], [[chemiluminescent]] or [[electrochemical]].  Although each functions differently, their end product always remains the same – a measurable signal that is proportional to the concentration of the unique chemical or physical agent to which they have been exposed.  In some instances, the signal only occurs when a secondary [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] is added to the [[bioassay]] (''luxAB'', Luc, and aequorin).  For other bioreporters, the signal must be activated by an external light source (GFP and UMT), and for a select few bioreporters, the signal is completely self-induced, with no exogenous substrate or external activation being required (''luxCDABE'').  The following sections outline in brief some of the reporter gene systems available and their existing applications.

===Bacterial luciferase (Lux)===

[[Image:Biolumplate.jpg|thumb|180px|right| Bioluminescence emitted from colonies of microbial cells containing the genes for bacterial luciferase.]]

[[Luciferase]] is a generic name for an [[enzyme]] that [[catalyzes]] a light-emitting reaction.  Luciferases can be found in bacteria, algae, fungi, jellyfish, insects, shrimp, and squid, and the resulting light that these organisms produce is termed bioluminescence.  In bacteria, the genes responsible for the light-emitting reaction (the ''lux'' genes) have been isolated and used extensively in the construction of bioreporters that emit a blue-green light with a maximum intensity at 490&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;Meighen, E.A. (1994) Genetics of bacterial bioluminescence. Annu. Rev. Genet. 28, 117-139. http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ge.28.120194.001001&lt;/ref&gt;  Three variants of ''lux'' are available, one that functions at &lt; 30°C, another at &lt; 37°C, and a third at &lt; 45°C.  The ''lux'' genetic system consists of five genes, ''luxA'', ''luxB'', ''luxC'', ''luxD'', and ''luxE''.  Depending on the combination of these genes used, several different types of [[bioluminescent]] bioreporters can be constructed.

===''luxAB'' Bioreporters===

''luxAB'' bioreporters contain only the ''luxA'' and ''luxB'' genes, which together are responsible for generating the light signal.  However, to fully complete the light-emitting reaction, a [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] must be supplied to the cell.  Typically, this occurs through the addition of the chemical [[decanal]] at some point during the bioassay procedure.  Numerous ''luxAB'' bioreporters have been constructed within bacterial, yeast, insect, nematode, plant, and mammalian cell systems.

===''luxCDABE'' Bioreporters===

Instead of containing only the ''luxA'' and ''luxB'' genes, bioreporters can contain all five [[genes]] of the ''lux'' cassette, thereby allowing for a completely independent light generating system that requires no extraneous additions of substrate nor any [[Excited state|excitation]] by an external light source.  So in this bioassay, the bioreporter is simply exposed to a target [[analyte]] and a [[quantitative property|quantitative]] increase in bioluminescence results, often within less than one hour.  Due to their rapidity and ease of use, along with the ability to perform the bioassay repetitively in [[real-time data|real time]] and on-line, makes ''luxCDABE'' bioreporters extremely attractive.  Consequently, they have been incorporated into a diverse array of detection methodologies ranging from the sensing of environmental contaminants to the real-time monitoring of pathogen infections in living mice.

===Nonspecific ''lux'' Bioreporters===

Nonspecific ''lux'' bioreporters are typically used for the detection of chemical toxins.  They are usually designed to continuously bioluminesce.  Upon exposure to a chemical toxin, either the cell dies or its metabolic activity is retarded, leading to a decrease in [[bioluminescent]] light levels.  Their most familiar application is in the Microtox [http://www.modernwater.co.uk/monitoring/toxicity/] assay where, following a short exposure to several concentrations of the sample, the decreased [[bioluminescence]] can be correlated to relative levels of [[toxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermens, J. et al. (1985) Quantitative structure-activity relationships and mixture toxicity of organic chemicals in Photobacterium phosphoreum: the Microtox test. Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf. 9, 17-25. http://www.springerlink.com/content/m67248753tkj1111/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firefly luciferase (Luc)===

[[Firefly luciferase]] catalyzes a reaction that produces visible light in the 550 – 575&amp;nbsp;nm range.  A click-beetle luciferase is also available that produces light at a peak closer to 595&amp;nbsp;nm.  Both luciferases require the addition of an exogenous substrate (luciferin) for the light reaction to occur.  Numerous ''luc''-based bioreporters have been constructed for the detection of a wide array of [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] and [[organic compound]]s of environmental concern.  The most promising applications, however, probably rely on introducing the genetic code of the firefly luciferase into other eukaryotic cells and tissues. 

====Medical diagnostics====
Insertion of the ''luc'' genes into a human cervical carcinoma cell line ([[HeLa]]) illustrated that tumor-cell clearance could be visualized within a living mouse by simply scanning with a charge-coupled device camera, allowing for [[chemotherapy]] treatment to rapidly be monitored on-line and in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;Contag, C.H. et al. (2000) Use of reporter genes for optical measurements of neoplastic disease in vivo. Neoplasia 2 (1-2), 41-52. http://neoreviews.aappublications.org/cgi/content/extract/1/12/e225&lt;/ref&gt;  In another example, the ''luc'' genes were inserted into human breast cancer cell lines to develop a bioassay for the detection and measurement of substances with potential [[estrogenic]] and antiestrogenic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Legler, J. et al. (1999) Development of a stably transfected estrogen receptor-mediated luciferase reporter gene assay in the human T47D breast cancer cell line. Toxicol. Sci. 48 (1), 55-66. http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/48/1/55&lt;/ref&gt;

====Research on gene regulation====
Particular [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] can be placed upstream of the ''luc'' gene, that is, the ''luc'' sequence can be fused to the promoter sequence at DNA level. If such construct is not too large in size, it can simply be introduced into eukaryotic cells using [[plasmids]]. This approach is widely used to study the activity of a given promoter in a given cell/tissue type, since the amount of light produced by the luciferase is directly proportional to the promoter activity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovács KA, Steinmann M, Halfon O, Magistretti PJ, Cardinaux JR | title = C/EBPbeta couples dopamine signalling to substance P precursor gene expression in striatal neurones. | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages = 1390-9 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16771829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03957.x  }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to studying the promoters, firefly luciferase assays offer the option of studying [[transcriptional activators]]: in these experiments typically the [[GAL4/UAS_system]] is used and its Gal4 upstream activating DNA sequence (UAS) is placed upstream the ''luc'' gene while the different activators or the different variants/fragments of the same activator are fused to the GAL4 DNA binding module at protein level. This way the transcriptional activity of the different GAL4 fusion proteins can be directly compared using light as a readout. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovács KA, Steinmann M, Halfon O, Magistretti PJ, Cardinaux JR | title = Complex regulation of CREB-binding protein by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 | journal = Cellular Signalling | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 2252–60 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26247811 | doi = 10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.08.001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Aequorin===

[[Aequorin]] is a photoprotein isolated from the bioluminescent jellyfish ''[[Aequorea victoria]]''.  Upon addition of [[calcium]] ions (Ca2+) and coelenterazine, a reaction occurs whose end result is the generation of blue light in the 460 - 470&amp;nbsp;nm range.  Aequorin has been incorporated into human [[B cell]] lines for the detection of [[pathogenic]] bacteria and viruses in what is referred to as the [[Cell CANARY]] assay (Cellular Analysis and Notification of Antigen Risks and Yields).&lt;ref&gt;Rider, T. et al. (1999) In NASA/NCI Biomedical Imaging Symposium.&lt;/ref&gt;  The B cells are genetically engineered to produce aequorin.  Upon exposure to antigens of different pathogens, the recombinant B cells emit light as a result of activation of an intracellular signaling cascade that releases calcium ions inside the cell.

===Green fluorescent protein (GFP)===

[[Green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) is also a photoprotein isolated and cloned from the jellyfish ''[[Aequorea victoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Misteli, T. and Spector, D.L. (1997) Application of the green fluorescent protein in cell biology and biotechnology. Nat. Biotechnol. 15, 961-964.&lt;/ref&gt;  Variants have also been isolated from the sea pansy ''[[Renilla reniformis]]''.  GFP, like aequorin, produces a blue fluorescent signal, but without the required addition of an exogenous substrate.  All that is required is an [[ultraviolet light]] source to activate the fluorescent properties of the photoprotein.  This ability to autofluoresce makes GFP highly desirable in biosensing assays since it can be used on-line and in to monitor intact, living cells.  Additionally, the ability to alter GFP to produce light emissions besides blue (i.e., cyan, red, and yellow) allows it to be used as a multianalyte detector.  Consequently, GFP has been used extensively in bioreporter constructs within bacterial, yeast, nematode, plant, and mammalian hosts.

===Uroporphyrinogen (urogen) III methyltransferase (UMT)===

[[Uroporphyrinogen (urogen) III methyltransferase]] (UMT) catalyzes a reaction that yields two [[fluorescent]] products which produce a red-orange fluorescence in the 590 - 770&amp;nbsp;nm range when illuminated with [[ultraviolet light]].&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, I. et al. (1995) Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the uroporphyrinogen-III methyltransferase cobA gene of Propionibacterium freudenreichii (shermanii). J. Bacteriol. 177, 1564–1569.http://jb.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/177/6/1564&lt;/ref&gt;  So as with GFP, no addition of exogenous substrates is required.  UMT has been used as a bioreporter for the selection of recombinant [[plasmids]], as a marker for gene [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells, and for the detection of toxic salts such as [[arsenite]] and [[antimonite]].

The '''Bond albedo''', named after the American astronomer [[George Phillips Bond]] (1825–1865), who originally proposed it, is the fraction of [[power (physics)|power]] in the total [[electromagnetic radiation]] incident on an astronomical body that is scattered back out into space.

Because the Bond albedo accounts for all of the light scattered from a body at all [[wavelength]]s and all [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angles]], it is a necessary quantity for determining how much energy a body absorbs.  This, in turn, is crucial for determining the [[equilibrium temperature]] of a body.

Because bodies in the outer Solar System are always observed at very low phase angles from the Earth, the only reliable data for measuring their Bond albedo comes from spacecraft.

==Phase integral==
The Bond albedo (''A'') is related to the [[geometric albedo]] (''p'') by the expression

:&lt;math&gt;A = pq&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' is termed the ''phase integral'' and is given in terms of the directional scattered flux ''I''(''α'') into phase angle ''α'' (averaged over all wavelengths and azimuthal angles) as

:&lt;math&gt;q = 2\int_0^\pi \frac{I(\alpha)}{I(0)} \sin\alpha \, d\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

The phase [[angle]] ''α'' is the angle between the source of the radiation (usually the Sun) and the observing direction, and varies from zero for light scattered back towards the source, to 180° for observations looking towards the source. For example, during opposition or looking at the full moon, α is very small, while backlit objects or the new moon have α close to 180°.

==Examples==
The Bond albedo is a value strictly between 0 and 1, as it includes all possible scattered light (but not radiation from the body itself).  This is in contrast to other definitions of  [[albedo]] such as the geometric albedo, which can be above 1. In general, though, the Bond albedo may be greater or smaller than the geometric albedo, depending on surface and atmospheric properties of the body in question.

[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|300px|right|thumb|Geocentric celestial spheres; [[Petrus Apianus|Peter Apian's]] ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539)]]

The '''celestial spheres''', or '''celestial orbs''', were the fundamental entities of the [[cosmology|cosmological]] models developed by [[Plato]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]], [[Aristotle]], [[Ptolemy]], [[Copernicus]], and others. In these celestial models, the [[diurnal motion|apparent motions]] of the [[fixed stars]] and [[classical planet|planets]] are accounted for by treating them as embedded in rotating spheres made of an aetherial, transparent fifth element ([[aether (classical element)|quintessence]]), like jewels set in orbs.  Since it was believed that the fixed stars did not change their positions relative to one another, it was argued that they must be on the surface of a single starry sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern thought, the [[Orbit#Planetary orbits|orbits of the planets]] are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, considered the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, p. 251"&gt;Lindberg, ''Beginnings of Western Science'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; When scholars applied Ptolemy's [[epicycles]], they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, p. 251"/&gt; By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at the time for the distances to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and to the edge of the universe (about 73 million miles).&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 28–40.&lt;/ref&gt; The nested sphere model's distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances,&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', pp. 437–8.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[size of the universe]] is now known to be inconceivably large and continuously [[Metric expansion of space|expanding]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Van Helden has suggested that from about 1250 until the 17th century, virtually all educated Europeans were familiar with the Ptolemaic model of "nesting spheres and the cosmic dimensions derived from it".&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 37, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even following the adoption of Copernicus's heliocentric model of the universe, new versions of the celestial sphere model were introduced, with the planetary spheres following this sequence from the central Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth-Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

Mainstream belief in the theory of celestial spheres did not survive the [[Scientific Revolution]].  In the early 1600s, Kepler continued to discuss celestial spheres, although he did not consider that the planets were carried by the spheres but held that they moved in elliptical paths described by [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].  In the late 1600s, Greek and medieval theories concerning the motion of terrestrial and celestial objects were replaced by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] and [[Newtonian mechanics]], which explain how Kepler's laws arise from the gravitational attraction between bodies.

==History==
{{details|topic=the causes of the motions of the celestial spheres|Dynamics of the celestial spheres}}

===Early ideas of spheres and circles===

In [[Ancient Greece|Greek antiquity]] the ideas of celestial spheres and rings first appeared in the cosmology of [[Anaximander]] in the early 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 4 of Heath's ''Aristarchus of Samos'' 1913/97 Oxford University Press/Sandpiper Books Ltd; see p.11 of Popper's ''The World of Parmenides'' Routledge 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In his cosmology both the Sun and Moon are circular open vents in tubular rings of fire enclosed in tubes of condensed air; these rings constitute the rims of rotating chariot-like wheels pivoting on the Earth at their centre. The fixed stars are also open vents in such wheel rims, but there are so many such wheels for the stars that their contiguous rims all together form a continuous spherical shell encompassing the Earth. All these wheel rims had originally been formed out of an original [[sphere of fire]] wholly encompassing the Earth, which had disintegrated into many individual rings.&lt;ref&gt;Heath  ''ibid'' pp26–8&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, in Anaximanders's cosmogony, in the beginning was the sphere, out of which celestial rings were formed, from some of which the stellar sphere was in turn composed. As viewed from the Earth, the ring of the Sun was highest, that of the Moon was lower, and the sphere of the stars was lowest.

Following Anaximander, his pupil [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (c. 585–528/4) held that the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets are all made of fire. But whilst the stars are fastened on a revolving crystal sphere like nails or studs, the Sun, Moon, and planets, and also the Earth, all just ride on air like leaves because of their breadth.&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 5 of Heath’s 1913 ''Aristarchus of Samos''&lt;/ref&gt;  And whilst the fixed stars are carried around in a complete circle by the stellar sphere, the Sun, Moon and planets do not revolve under the Earth between setting and rising again like the stars do, but rather on setting they go laterally around the Earth like a cap turning halfway around the head until they rise again. And unlike Anaximander, he relegated the fixed stars to the region most distant from the Earth. The most enduring feature of Anaximenes' cosmos was its conception of the stars being fixed on a crystal sphere as in a rigid frame, which became a fundamental principle of cosmology down to Copernicus and Kepler.

After Anaximenes, [[Pythagoras]], [[Xenophanes]] and [[Parmenides]] all held that the universe was spherical.&lt;ref&gt;For Xenophanes' and Parmenides' spherist cosmologies see Heath ''ibid'' chapter 7 and chapter 9 respectively, and Popper ''ibid'' Essays 2 &amp; 3.&lt;/ref&gt; And much later in the fourth century BC Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' proposed that the body of the cosmos was made in the most perfect and uniform shape, that of a sphere containing the fixed stars.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Cornford, ''Plato's Cosmology: The Timaeus of Plato'', pp. 54–7&lt;/ref&gt;  But it posited that the planets were spherical bodies set in rotating bands or rings rather than wheel rims as in Anaximander's cosmology.

===Emergence of the planetary spheres===

Instead of bands, Plato's student Eudoxus developed a [[Eudoxus of Cnidus#Eudoxan planetary models|planetary model]] using [[concentric spheres]] for all the planets, with three spheres each for his models of the Moon and the Sun and four each for the models of the other five planets, thus making 26 spheres in all.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer, History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy, vol. 2, pp. 677–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd p. 173"&gt;Lloyd, "Heavenly aberrations," p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Callippus]] modified this system, using five spheres for his models of the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars and retaining four spheres for the models of Jupiter and Saturn, thus making 33 spheres in all.&lt;ref name="Lloyd p. 173"/&gt;  Each planet is attached to the innermost of its own particular set of spheres.  Although the models of Eudoxus and Callippus qualitatively describe the major features of the motion of the planets, they fail to account exactly for these motions and therefore cannot provide quantitative predictions.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer, ''History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy,'' vol. 2, pp. 677–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Although historians of Greek science have traditionally considered these models to be merely geometrical representations,&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer, ''History of the Planetary Systems'', pp. 90–1, 121–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, ''Aristotle,'' p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; recent studies have proposed that they were also intended to be physically real&lt;ref&gt;Larry Wright, "The Astronomy of Eudoxus: Geometry or Physics," ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'', 4 (1973): 165–72.&lt;/ref&gt; or have withheld judgment, noting the limited evidence to resolve the question.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. R. Lloyd, "Saving the Phenomena," ''Classical Quarterly,'' 28 (1978): 202–222, at p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [[Aristotle]] developed a physical cosmology of spheres, based on the mathematical models of Eudoxus.  In Aristotle's fully developed celestial model, the spherical Earth is at the centre of the universe and the planets are moved by either 47 or 55 interconnected spheres that form a unified planetary system,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' 1073b1–1074a13, pp. 882–883 in ''The Basic Works of Aristotle'' Richard McKeon, ed., The Modern Library 2001&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the models of Eudoxus and Callippus each planet's individual set of spheres were not connected to those of the next planet.  Aristotle says the exact number of spheres, and hence the number of movers, is to be determined by astronomical investigation, but he added additional spheres to those proposed by Eudoxus and Callippus, to counteract the motion of the outer spheres.  Aristotle considers that these spheres are made of an unchanging fifth element, the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. Each of these concentric spheres is moved by its own god—an unchanging [[Unmoved mover|divine unmoved mover]], and who moves its sphere simply by virtue of being loved by it.&lt;ref&gt;"The final cause, then, produces motion by being loved, but all other things move by being moved" Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 1072b4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PeuerbachSuperioribus2.png|225px|right|thumb|Ptolemaic model of the spheres for Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn with [[epicycle]], eccentric [[deferent]] and [[equant]] point.  [[Georg von Peuerbach]], ''Theoricae novae planetarum'', 1474.]]

In his ''[[Almagest]]'', the astronomer [[Ptolemy]] (fl. ca. 150 AD) developed geometrical predictive models of the motions of the stars and planets and extended them to a unified physical model of the [[cosmos]] in his ''Planetary hypotheses''.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer, ''History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy,''  pp. 111–12, 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, ''[[#Pederson-1993|Early Physics and Astronomy]]'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7M8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA87 p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, ''[[#Reference-Crowe-1990|Theories of the World]]'', pp.45, 49–50, 72,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linton, ''[[#Reference-Linton-2004|From Eudoxus to Einstein]]'', pp.63–64, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  By using eccentrics and [[epicycles]], his geometrical model achieved greater mathematical detail and predictive accuracy than had been exhibited by earlier concentric spherical models of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. Catesby Taliaferro|Taliaferro]], ''[[#taliaferro-1946|Translator's Introduction to the Almagest]]'', p,1; Dreyer, ''[[#dreyer-2007|History of the Planetary Systems]]'', [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/160/mode/1up/ pp.160], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/167/mode/1up/ 167].&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ptolemy's physical model, each planet is contained in two or more spheres,&lt;ref name="Neugebauer, pp. 917"&gt;Neugebauer, ''History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy'', vol. 2, pp. 917–926.&lt;/ref&gt; but in Book 2 of his ''Planetary Hypotheses'' Ptolemy depicted thick circular slices rather than spheres as in its Book 1.  One sphere/slice is the [[deferent]], with a centre offset somewhat from the Earth; the other sphere/slice is an [[epicycle]] embedded in the deferent, with the planet embedded in the epicyclical sphere/slice.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Murschel, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995JHA....26...33M "The Structure and Function of Ptolemy's Physical Hypotheses of Planetary Motion,"] ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 26(1995): 33–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy's model of nesting spheres provided the general dimensions of the cosmos, the greatest distance of Saturn being 19,865 times the radius of the Earth and the distance of the fixed stars being at least 20,000 Earth radii.&lt;ref name="Neugebauer, pp. 917"/&gt;

The planetary spheres were arranged outwards from the spherical, stationary Earth at the centre of the universe in this order: the spheres of the [[Moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Sun]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]].  In more detailed models the seven planetary spheres contained other secondary spheres within them.  The planetary spheres were followed by the stellar sphere containing the fixed stars; other scholars added a ninth sphere to account for the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of the equinoxes]], a tenth to account for the supposed [[Trepidation (astronomy)|trepidation of the equinoxes]], and even an eleventh to account for the changing [[obliquity of the ecliptic]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis  R. Johnson, "Marlowe's "Imperiall Heaven," ''ELH'', 12 (1945): 35–44, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  In antiquity the order of the lower planets was not universally agreed. Plato and his followers ordered them Moon, Sun, Mercury, Venus, and then followed the standard model for the upper spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S. Eastwood, ''Ordering the Heavens: Roman Astronomy and Cosmology in the Carolingian Renaissance,'' (Leiden: Brill) 2007, pp. 36–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his ''De Revolutionibus'' Bk1.10 Copernicus claimed the empirical reason why Plato's followers put the orbits of Mercury and Venus above the Sun's was that if they were sub-solar, then by the Sun's reflected light they would only ever appear as hemispheres at most and would also sometimes eclipse the Sun, but they do neither. (See p521 ''Great Books of the Western World 16 Ptolemy–Copernicus–Kepler'')&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagreed about the relative place of the spheres of Mercury and Venus: Ptolemy placed both of them beneath the Sun with Venus above Mercury, but noted others placed them both above the Sun; some medieval thinkers, such as [[al-Bitruji]], placed the sphere of Venus above the Sun and that of Mercury below it.&lt;ref&gt;al-Biţrūjī.

===Middle Ages===

====Astronomical discussions====
[[File:Mappa Mundi 2 from Bede, De natura rerum.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Earth within seven celestial spheres, from [[Bede]], ''De natura rerum'', late 11th century]]
A series of astronomers, beginning with the Muslim astronomer [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|al-Farghānī]], used the Ptolemaic model of nesting spheres to compute distances to the stars and planetary spheres.  Al-Farghānī's distance to the stars was 20,110 Earth radii which, on the assumption that the radius of the Earth was 3,250 miles, came to 65,357,500 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  An introduction to Ptolemy's ''Almagest'', the ''Tashil al-Majisti'', believed to be written by [[Thābit ibn Qurra]], presented minor variations of Ptolemy's distances to the celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[Zij]]'', [[Muḥammad ibn Jābir al-Ḥarrānī al-Battānī|Al-Battānī]] presented independent calculations of the distances to the planets on the model of nesting spheres, which he thought was due to scholars writing after Ptolemy.  His calculations yielded a distance of 19,000 Earth radii to the stars.&lt;ref name="Van Helden pp. 31-2"&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 31–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the turn of the millennium, the [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Arabic astronomer]] and polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham#Astronomy|Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen)]] presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's ''Planetary Hypotheses'', al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that it has been argued that it reflects an independent development of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Tzvi Langermann (1990), ''Ibn al Haytham's On the Configuration of the World'', p. 11–25, New York: Garland Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In chapters 15–16 of his ''[[Book of Optics]]'', Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of [[solid]] matter.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Rosen (1985), "The Dissolution of the Solid Celestial Spheres", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''46''' (1), p. 13–31 [19–20, 21].&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the twelfth century, the [[Al-Andalus|Spanish Muslim]] astronomer [[Nur Ed-Din Al Betrugi|al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius)]] sought to explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west. This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Goldstein, ''Al-Bitrūjī: On the Principles of Astronomy,'' New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr., 1971, vol. 1, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Goldstein, ''Al-Bitrūjī: On the Principles of Astronomy,'' New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr., 1971, vol. 1, pp. 40–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 563–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the thirteenth century the astronomer, [[Mu'ayyad al-Din al-'Urdi|al-'Urḍi]], proposed a radical change to Ptolemy's system of nesting spheres.  In his ''Kitāb al-Hayáh'', he recalculated the distance of the planets using parameters which he redetermined.  Taking the distance of the Sun as 1,266 Earth radii, he was forced to place the sphere of Venus above the sphere of the Sun; as a further refinement, he added the planet's diameters to the thickness of their spheres.  As a consequence, his version of the nesting spheres model had the sphere of the stars at a distance of 140,177 Earth radii.&lt;ref name="Van Helden pp. 31-2"/&gt;

About the same time, scholars in European [[medieval universities|universities]] began to address the implications of the rediscovered philosophy of Aristotle and astronomy of Ptolemy.  Both astronomical scholars and popular writers considered the implications of the nested sphere model for the dimensions of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', pp. 433–43.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Campanus of Novara]]'s introductory astronomical text, the ''Theorica planetarum'', used the model of nesting spheres to compute the distances of the various planets from the Earth, which he gave as 22,612 Earth radii or 73,387,747 100/660 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', pp. 434–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 33–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Opus Majus]]'', [[Roger Bacon]] cited Al-Farghānī's distance to the stars of 20,110 Earth radii, or 65,357,700 miles, from which he computed the circumference of the universe to be 410,818,517 3/7 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clear evidence that this model was thought to represent physical reality is the accounts found in Bacon's ''Opus Majus'' of the time needed to walk to the Moon&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the popular [[Middle English]] ''[[South English Legendary]]'', that it would take 8,000 years to reach the highest starry heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''The Discarded Image'', pp. 97–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; General understanding of the dimensions of the universe derived from the nested sphere model reached wider audiences through the presentations in Hebrew by [[Moses Maimonides]], in French by Gossuin of Metz, and in Italian by [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 37–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophical and theological discussions====

Philosophers were less concerned with such mathematical calculations than with the nature of the celestial spheres, their relation to revealed accounts of created nature, and the causes of their motion.

Adi Setia describes the debate among Islamic scholars in the twelfth century, based on the commentary of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] about whether the celestial spheres are real, concrete physical bodies or "merely the abstract circles in the heavens traced out… by the various stars and planets." Setia points out that most of the learned, and the astronomers, said they were solid spheres "on which the stars turn… and this view is closer to the apparent sense of the Qur'anic verses regarding the celestial orbits." However, al-Razi mentions that some, such as the Islamic scholar Dahhak, considered them to be abstract. Al-Razi himself, was undecided, he said: "In truth, there is no way to ascertain the characteristics of the heavens except by authority [of divine revelation or prophetic traditions]." Setia concludes: "Thus it seems that for al-Razi (and for others before and after him), astronomical models, whatever their utility or lack thereof for ordering the heavens, are not founded on sound rational proofs, and so no intellectual commitment can be made to them insofar as description and explanation of celestial realities are concerned."&lt;ref name=Setia&gt;{{citation|title=Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi on Physics and the Nature of the Physical World: A Preliminary Survey|author=Adi Setia|journal=Islam &amp; Science|volume=2|year=2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QYQ/is_2_2/ai_n9532826/|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian and Muslim philosophers modified Ptolemy's system to include an unmoved outermost region, the [[empyrean]] heaven, which came to be identified as the dwelling place of [[God]] and all the elect.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 382–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Christians identified the sphere of stars with the Biblical [[firmament]] and sometimes posited an invisible layer of water above the firmament, to accord with [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, ''Beginnings of Western Science'', pp. 249–50.&lt;/ref&gt; An outer sphere, inhabited by [[angels]], appeared in some accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, ''Beginnings of Western Science'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Grant]], a historian of science, has provided evidence that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid in the sense of three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid in the sense of hard. The consensus was that the celestial spheres were made of some kind of continuous fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 328–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century, the [[mutakallim]] Adud al-Din al-Iji (1281–1355) rejected the principle of uniform and circular motion, following the [[Ash'ari]] doctrine of [[atomism]], which maintained that all physical effects were caused directly by God's will rather than by natural causes.&lt;ref name=Huff-175&gt;{{Cite book |first=Toby |last=Huff |year=2003 |title=The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China, and the West |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-52994-8 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He maintained that the celestial spheres were "imaginary things" and "more tenuous than a spider's web".&lt;ref name=Ragep&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;55–57 of {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1086/649338| issn = 0369-7827| last = Ragep| first = F.

Medieval astronomers and philosophers developed diverse theories about the causes of the celestial spheres' motions. They attempted to explain the spheres' motions in terms of the materials of which they were thought to be made, external movers such as celestial intelligences, and internal movers such as motive souls or impressed forces. Most of these models were qualitative, although a few  incorporated quantitative analyses that related speed, motive force and resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the Middle Ages, the common opinion in Europe was that celestial bodies were moved by external intelligences, identified with the [[angel]]s of [[revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Primum Mobile|outermost moving sphere]], which moved with the daily motion affecting all subordinate spheres, was moved by an [[unmoved mover]], the [[Cosmological argument#History|Prime Mover]], who was identified with God. Each of the lower spheres was moved by a subordinate spiritual mover (a replacement for Aristotle's multiple divine movers), called an intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 526–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===

[[Image:ThomasDiggesmap.JPG|225px|right|thumb|Thomas Digges' 1576 Copernican heliocentric model of the celestial orbs]]

Early in the sixteenth century [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] drastically reformed the model of astronomy by displacing the Earth from its central place in favour of the Sun, yet he called his great work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres''). Although Copernicus does not treat the physical nature of the spheres in detail, his few allusions make it clear that, like many of his predecessors, he accepted non-solid celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Jardine, "The Significance of the Copernican Orbs," ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 13(1982): 168–194, esp. pp. 177–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Copernicus rejected the ninth and tenth spheres, placed the orb of the Moon around the Earth and moved the Sun from its orb to the center of the world.  The planetary orbs circled the center of the world in the order Mercury, Venus, the great orb containing the Earth and the orb of the Moon, then the orbs of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.  Finally he retained the eighth starry sphere, which he held to be unmoving.&lt;ref&gt;Hilderich von Varel ([[:de:Edo Hildericus|Edo Hildericus]]), ''Propositiones Cosmographicae de Globi Terreni Dimensione,'' (Frankfurt a. d. Oder, 1576), quoted in Peter Barker and Bernard R. Goldstein, "Realism and Instrumentalism in Sixteenth Century Astronomy: A Reappraisal, ''Perspectives on Science'' 6.3 (1998): 232–258, pp. 242–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English almanac maker, [[Thomas Digges]], delineated the spheres of the new cosmological system in his ''Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes…'' (1576).  Here he arranged the "orbes" in the new Copernican order, expanding one sphere to carry "the globe of mortalitye", the Earth, the [[Classical element#Classical elements in Greece|four elements]], and the Moon; and expanding the starry sphere infinitely upward to encompass all the stars, and also to serve as "the court of the Great God, the habitacle of the elect, and of the coelestiall angelles."&lt;ref&gt;Koyre, ''From the Closed World'', pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kepler Celestial Spheres.jpg|thumb|left|Johannes Kepler's diagram of the celestial spheres, and of the spaces between them, following the opinion of Copernicus (''Mysterium Cosmographicum'', 2nd ed., 1621)]]
In the course of the sixteenth century, a number of philosophers, theologians, and astronomers—among them [[Franciscus Patricius|Francesco Patrizi]], Andrea Cisalpino, [[Petrus Ramus|Peter Ramus]], [[Robert Bellarmine]], [[Giordano Bruno]], Jerónimo Muñoz, [[Michael Neander]], Jean Pena, and [[Christoph Rothmann]]—abandoned the concept of celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Granada, "Did Tycho Eliminate the Celestial Spheres before 1586?" ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 37 (2006): 126–145, pp. 127–9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rothmann argued from the observations of the comet of 1585 that the lack of observed parallax indicated that the comet was beyond Saturn, while the absence of observed refraction indicated the celestial region was of the same material as air, hence there were no planetary spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Goldstein and Peter Barker, "The Role of Rothmann in the Dissolution of the Celestial Spheres," ''The British Journal for the History of Science'', 28 (1995): 385–403, pp. 390–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tycho Brahe]]'s investigations of a series of comets from 1577 to 1585, aided by Rothmann's discussion of the comet of 1585 and [[Michael Maestlin]]'s tabulated distances of the comet of 1577, which passed through the planetary orbs, led Tycho to conclude&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Granada, "Did Tycho Eliminate the Celestial Spheres before 1586?" ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 37 (2006): 126–145, pp. 132–8.&lt;/ref&gt; that "the structure of the heavens was very fluid and simple." Tycho opposed his view to that of "very many modern philosophers" who divided the heavens into "various orbs made of hard and impervious matter." Edward Grant found relatively few believers in hard celestial spheres before Copernicus, and concluded that the idea first became common sometime between the publication of Copernicus's ''De revolutionibus'' in 1542 and Tycho Brahe's publication of his cometary research in 1588.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, "Celestial Orbs," 2000, pp. 185–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 345–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Johannes Kepler]]'s early ''Mysterium cosmographicum'', he considered the distances of the planets, and the consequent gaps required between the planetary spheres implied by the Copernican system, which had been noted by his former teacher, Michael Maestlin.&lt;ref&gt;Grasshoff, "Michael Maestlin's Mystery".&lt;/ref&gt;  Kepler's Platonic cosmology filled the large gaps with the five Platonic polyhedra, which accounted for the spheres' measured astronomical distance.&lt;ref&gt;See Judith Field, ''Kepler's geometric cosmology'' for details of Kepler's cosmology&lt;/ref&gt;  In his mature celestial physics, the spheres were regarded as the purely geometrical spatial regions containing each planetary orbit rather than as the rotating physical orbs of the earlier Aristotelian celestial physics. The eccentricity of each planet's orbit thereby defined the lengths of the radii of the inner and outer limits of its celestial sphere and thus its thickness. In Kepler's [[Celestial mechanics#Johannes Kepler|celestial mechanics]] the cause of planetary motion became the rotating Sun, itself rotated by its own motive soul.&lt;ref&gt;See p514–5 of Kepler's 1630 ''Epitome of Copernican Astronomy'' Vol.1 Bk4.2.3 for his arguments that the Sun has a driving soul on p896 of the Encyclopædia Britannica edition&lt;/ref&gt; However, an immobile stellar sphere was a lasting remnant of physical celestial spheres in Kepler's cosmology.

[[Image:Oresme Spheres crop.jpg|right|thumb|Nicole Oresme, ''Le livre du Ciel et du Monde,'' Paris, BnF, Manuscrits, Fr. 565, f. 69, (1377)]]
Some late medieval figures noted that the celestial spheres' physical order was inverse to their order on the spiritual plane, where God was at the center and the Earth at the periphery. Near the beginning of the fourteenth century [[Dante]], in the ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' of his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', described God as a light at the center of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature,'' Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1964, p. 116. {{ISBN|0-521-09450-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the poet ascends beyond physical existence to the [[Empyrean]] Heaven, where he comes face to face with God himself and is granted understanding of both divine and human nature. Later in the century, the illuminator of [[Nicole Oresme]]'s ''Le livre du Ciel et du Monde'', a translation of and commentary on Aristotle's [[On the Heavens|''De caelo'']] produced for Oresme's patron, [[Charles V of France|King Charles V]], employed the same motif. He drew the spheres in the conventional order, with the Moon closest to the Earth and the stars highest, but the spheres were concave upwards, centered on God, rather than concave downwards, centered on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Oreseme, "Le livre du Ciel et du Monde", 1377, retrieved 2 June 2007.[http://expositions.bnf.fr/ciel/grand/1-025.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Below this figure Oresme quotes the [[Psalms]] that "The heavens declare the Glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork."&lt;ref&gt;Ps. 18: 2; quoted in Nicole Oresme, ''Le livre du ciel et du monde,'' edited and translated by A, D. Menut and A. J. Denomy, Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1968, pp. 282–3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

The late-16th-century Portuguese epic ''[[The Lusiads]]'' vividly portrays the celestial spheres as a "great machine of the universe" constructed by God.&lt;ref&gt;Luiz vaz de Camões, ''The Lusiads,'' translated by Landeg White. Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The explorer Vasco da Gama is shown the celestial spheres in the form of a mechanical model. Contrary to Cicero's representation, da Gama's tour of the spheres begins with the Empyrean, then descends inward toward Earth, culminating in a survey of the domains and divisions of earthly kingdoms, thus magnifying the importance of human deeds in the divine plan.

'''Cellosaurus''' is an on-line knowledge resource on cell lines &lt;ref name=Bairoch2018&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bairoch Amos|title=The Cellosaurus, a cell-line knowledge resource |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Techniques |volume=29 |pages=1-14 |year=2018 |pmid=29805321 |doi=10.7171/jbt.18-2902-002 |issue=[Epub ahead of print |pmc=5945021}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is provided by the [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]] (SIB) as one of its contribution &lt;ref&gt;https://www.elixir-europe.org/services/cellosaurus&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=July 2018}} to [[ELIXIR]]. It is the contributing resource for cell lines on the Resource Identification Portal &lt;ref&gt;https://scicrunch.org/resources/Cell%20Lines/source/SCR_013869-1/search?q=%2A&amp;l=&lt;/ref&gt;.

Its scope includes [[immortalised cell line]]s, naturally immortal cell lines (example: [[embryonic stem cell]]s) and finite life cell lines when those are distributed and used widely.
The Cellosaurus provides a wealth of manually curated information;
for each cell line it lists a recommended name, synonyms and the species of origin. 
Other types of information include standardised disease terminology (for [[cancer]] or [[genetic disorder]] cell lines),
the transformant used to immortalise a cell line, transfected or knocked-out genes, microsatellite instability, doubling time, gender and age of donor (patient or animal), important sequence variations, web links, publication references and cross-references to more than 70 different databases, ontologies, cell collections and other relevant resources.

Since many cell lines used in research have been misidentified or [[Cell culture#Cell line cross-contamination|contaminated]],
the Cellosaurus keeps track of problematic cell lines, including all those listed in the
International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) &lt;ref&gt;http://iclac.org/wp-content/uploads/Cross-Contaminations-v8_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; tables.

For human as well as some dog cell lines, it provides [[short tandem repeat]] (STR) profile information.

Since July 2018, all cell lines in the Cellosaurus are represented as items in [[Wikidata]].

It is developed by [[Amos Bairoch]] at the CALIPHO group &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sib.swiss/bairoch-amos-lane-lydie/amos-bairoch-lydie-lane-sub CALIPHO group], on the web site of the SIB&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=July 2018}} of the [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]] (SIB).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6041">'''Cerebral perfusion pressure''', or '''CPP''', is the net [[pressure]] gradient causing [[cerebral blood flow]] to the brain (brain [[perfusion]]).  It must be maintained within narrow limits because too little pressure could cause brain tissue to become [[ischemic]] (having inadequate blood flow), and too much could raise [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP).

==Definitions==
The [[cranium]] encloses a fixed-volume space that holds three components: [[blood]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), and very soft tissue (the [[brain]]).  While both the blood and CSF have poor compression capacity, the brain is easily compressible.  

Every increase of ICP can cause a change in tissue perfusion and an increase in stroke events.
 
===From resistance===
CPP can be defined as the pressure gradient causing [[cerebral blood flow]] (CBF) such that

: &lt;math&gt;CBF = CPP/CVR &lt;/math&gt;
where:
:CVR is cerebrovascular resistance

===By intracranial pressure===
An alternative definition of CPP is:&lt;ref name="Steiner"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;CPP=MAP-ICP&lt;/math&gt;

where: 
:MAP is [[mean arterial pressure]]
:ICP is [[intracranial pressure]]
:JVP is [[jugular venous pressure]]

This definition may be more appropriate if considering the circulatory system in the brain as a [[Starling resistor]], where an external pressure (in this case, the intracranial pressure) causes decreased blood flow through the vessels. In this sense, more specifically, the cerebral perfusion pressure can be defined as either:
: &lt;math&gt; CPP = MAP - ICP &lt;/math&gt; (if ICP is higher than JVP)
or
: &lt;math&gt; CPP = MAP - JVP &lt;/math&gt; (if JVP is higher than ICP).

Physiologically, increased [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP) causes decreased blood perfusion of [[brain cell]]s by mainly two mechanisms:
*Increased ICP constitutes an increased [[interstitial hydrostatic pressure]] that, in turn, causes a decreased [[Starling equation|driving force for capillary filtration]] from intracerebral blood vessels.
*Increased ICP compresses cerebral arteries, causing increased cerebrovascular resistance (CVR).

FLOW
Ranging from 20ml 100g-1 min-1 in white matter to 70ml 100g-1 min-1 in grey matter.

==Autoregulation==

Outside of the limits of autoregulation, raising MAP raises CBF and raising ICP lowers it (this is one reason that increasing ICP in [[traumatic brain injury]] is potentially deadly). In trauma some recommend CPP not go below 70 mmHg.&lt;ref name="Tolias and Sgouros"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tolias |first1=C |last2=Sgouros |first2=S |year=2003 |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3216.htm |title=Initial evaluation and management of CNS injury |work=Emedicine.com |accessdate=2007-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302120819/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3216.htm |archivedate=March 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Czosnyka |first1= M |last2= Pickard |first2= JD |title= Monitoring and interpretation of intracranial pressure |journal= [[Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry]] |volume= 75 |issue= 6 |year= 2004 |pages= 813–21 |url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/75/6/813 |pmid= 15145991 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.033126 |pmc=1739058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recommendations in children is at least 60 mmHg.&lt;ref name="Tolias and Sgouros"/&gt;

Within the autoregulatory range, as CPP falls there is, within seconds, vasodilatation of the cerebral resistance vessels, a fall in cerebrovascular resistance and a rise in cerebral-blood volume (CBV), and therefore CBF will return to baseline value within seconds (see as ref. Aaslid, Lindegaard, Sorteberg, and Nornes 1989: http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/1/45.pdf). These adaptations to rapid changes in blood pressure (in contrast with changes that occur over periods of hours or days) are known as dynamic cerebral autoregulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Chandavaram Buddhist site''' is an ancient [[Buddhist]] site in [[Chandavaram]] village in [[Prakasam district]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About Chandavaram Excavation Site"&gt;{{cite news|title=About Chandavaram Excavation Site|publisher=Holidayiq.com|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://www.holidayiq.com/Chandavaram-Excavation-Site-Ongole-Sightseeing-857-18953.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated on the bank of [[Gundlakamma River]], the site is {{convert|10|km|mi}} northwest of [[Donakonda railway station]].&lt;ref name="Chandavaram monastic cluster"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chandavaram monastic cluster|publisher=Monastic Asia|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://monastic-asia.wikidot.com/chandavaram}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chandavaram Buddhist site was built between the 2nd century [[Before Christ|BCE]] and the 2nd century [[Common Era|CE]] during the [[Satavahana dynasty]] and was discovered by [[Dr. (title)|Dr.]] Veluri Venkata Krishna Sastry in 1964.&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"&gt;{{cite news|title=Easy pickings|work=[[India Today]]|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/series-of-robberies-at-remote-buddhist-sites-in-andhra-pradesh-exposes-neglect-of-excavated-treasures/1/230807.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandavaram Buddhist site"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chandavaram Buddhist site|publisher=Discovered India|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://www.discoveredindia.com/andhra-pradesh/attractions/buddhist-centers/chandavaram-buddhist-site.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first of its kind in the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]], the Chandavaram Buddhist site was constructed between the 2nd century [[Before Christ|BCE]] and the 2nd century [[Common Era|CE]]. It was an active center for [[Buddhist]] religious activities, and was also inhabited at the time.&lt;ref name="About Chandavaram Excavation Site"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandavaram Buddhist site"/&gt; The age of the site was determined by the [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]] of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] discovered during [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. The sculptural panels in the site are of the [[Amarāvatī mahācetiya#Amaravati School|Amaravati school]] which also suggests that the site was built between the 2nd century [[Before Christ|BCE]] and the 2nd century [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt; The Chandavaram Buddhist site was used as a resting place by [[Buddhist monk]]s traveling from [[Varanasi|Kashi]] to [[Kanchipuram|Kanchi]].&lt;ref name="Chandavaram Buddhist site"/&gt; Discovered in 1964, the site was constructed during the [[Satavahana dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"/&gt; [[Ayaka pillars]] are absent from the site, indicating that the [[Hinayana]] form of [[Buddhism]] was prevalent in [[Chandavaram]].&lt;ref name="Chandavaram, Andhra Pradesh"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chandavaram, Andhra Pradesh|publisher=Buddhist tourism|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/chandavaram-andhra-pradesh.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923195013/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/chandavaram-andhra-pradesh.html#|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site houses a double terraced [[Stupa|MahaStupa]] on a hilltop which is next in importance only to [[Sanchi Stupa]]. The hill on which the MahaStupa is located is called Singarakonda.&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandavaram, Andhra Pradesh"/&gt;

==Construction and structure==
Constructed during the [[Satavahana dynasty]], the Chandavaram Buddhist site houses a double terraced [[Stupa|MahaStupa]] built on an elevated platform situated on a hilltop.&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About Chandavaram Excavation Site"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandavaram, Andhra Pradesh"/&gt; The MahaStupa exhibits the characteristics of stupas built under the [[Hinayana]] form of [[Buddhism]]. The main dome (MahaStupa) is {{convert|120|ft|m}} in circumference and {{convert|30|ft|m}} high. It has carved panels that portray the [[Dharmachakra]] (the wheel of ''[[Dharma]]'', one of the [[Ashtamangala]] of [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]). Apart from the main stupa, the site also houses several [[Vihara]]s, [[Brahmi script|Brahmi inscriptions]] and other stupas. In the MahaStupa, there is a [[Chaitya|Maha Chaitya]] which is {{convert|1.6|m|feet}} high and {{convert|60|cm|feet}} wide.&lt;ref name="About Chandavaram Excavation Site"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandavaram Buddhist site"/&gt;

The MahaStupa resembles the [[Dharmarajika|Dharmarajika stupa]] in [[Taxila]], [[Pakistan]]. The panels on the MahaStupa are made of [[limestone]]. The panels and the drum sections of the MahaStupa exhibit the [[Buddha footprint]], Stupas, [[Bodhi tree]]s and also narratives in the form of [[Jataka tales]] along with other stories. Since 1964, the Chandavaram Buddhist site has been excavated four times, and fifteen regular-sized and approximately one hundred small [[stupa]]s have been discovered. The site comprises the following:&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt;

===Monolith statue of Buddha===
In 1985, a project called the "Buddha Poornima Project" was proposed. Under this project, the world's tallest standing [[monolith]] statue of [[Buddha]] was to be erected on the site. Made out of [[granite]], the statue was carved by 200 sculptors in two years and on completion it weighed 440 tonnes with an overall height of {{convert|17|m|feet}}. However, the [[Buddha Statue of Hyderabad|Buddha statue]] was transported to city of [[Hyderabad]] in 1988 instead, where it was erected in 1992 in the [[Hussain sagar lake]] and stands today.&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buddha of the lake bottom"&gt;{{cite news|title=Buddha of the lake bottom|work=Washington Post|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/04/09/buddha-of-the-lake-bottom/342902b7-7025-41d3-a856-c14c1fac3815/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buddha statue consecrated"&gt;{{cite news|title=Buddha statue consecrated|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/article3234728.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeological findings==
One [[Stupa|MahaStupa]], fifteen regular-sized and approximately one hundred small [[Stupa]]s have been discovered in the Chandavaram Buddhist site. Apart from the [[Chaitya|Maha Chaitya]], Silamandapa, [[Vihara]] and the [[Votive offering|Votive Stupas]], more than two dozen "Buddhist slabs" (decorated with designs and inscriptions) have also been discovered.&lt;ref name="Chandavaram Buddhist site"/&gt;

==Pilferage==
Pilferage of artifacts has been reported at the Chandavaram Buddhist site since the year 2000. In Oct 2000, two {{convert|9|feet}} long panels, with engravings of the [[Bodhi tree]] and of the Chaitra were uprooted from a cement platform and stolen from the site's museum.&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"/&gt; In February 2001, three pillars, each measuring {{convert|9|feet}} long and including one in which the [[Buddha]] was represented as fire were stolen.&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"/&gt; In March 2001, three more ornate pillars and a lotus [[medallion]] were stolen.&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"/&gt;

[[File:ExplainingCaseControlSJW.jpg|thumb|Author: Kelidimari]]
In [[statistics]], [[marketing]]  and [[demography]], a '''cohort''' is a group of [[research subject|subjects]] who share a defining characteristic (typically subjects who experienced a common event in a selected time period, such as birth or graduation).

Cohort data can oftentimes be more advantageous to [[Demography|demographers]] than period data. Because cohort data is honed to a specific time period, it is usually more accurate. It is more accurate because it can be tuned to retrieve custom data for a specific study.

In addition, cohort data is not affected by [[tempo effect]]s, unlike period data. On the contrary; cohort data can be disadvantageous in the sense that it can take a long amount of time to collect the data necessary for the [[cohort study]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_CohortStudies/EP713_CohortStudies5.html|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Cohort Studies|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage of cohort studies is that it can be extremely costly to carry out, since the study will go on for a long period of time, demographers often require sufficient funds to fuel the study.

Demography often contrasts [[cohort perspective]]s and [[period perspective]]s. For instance, the total cohort [[fertility rate]] is an index of the average completed family size for cohorts of women, but since it can only be known for women who have finished child-bearing, it cannot be measured for currently fertile women. It can be calculated as the sum of the cohort's age-specific fertility rates that obtain as it ages through time. In contrast, the total period fertility rate uses current age-specific fertility rates to calculate the completed family size for a notional woman, were she to experience these fertility rates through her life.

A study on a cohort is a [[cohort study]].

Two important aspects of cohort studies are: 
# Prospective Cohort Study:  In this type of study, there is a collection of exposure data (baseline data) from the subjects recruited before development of the outcomes of interest. The subjects are then followed through time (future) to record when the subject develops the outcome of interest. Ways to follow-up with subjects of the study include: phone interviews, face-to-face interviews, physical exams, medical/laboratory tests, and mail questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_CohortStudies/EP713_CohortStudies_print.html|title=Cohort Studies|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a prospective cohort study is, for instance, if a demographer wanted to measure all the males births in the year 2018. The demographer would have to wait for the event to be over, the year 2018 must come to an end in order for the demographer to have all the necessary data.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statsref.com/HTML/index.html?cohort_studies2.html|title=Statistical Analysis Handbook|website=www.statsref.com|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Retrospective Cohort Study: Retrospective Studies start with subjects that are at risk to have the outcome or disease of interest and identifies the outcome starting from where the subject is when the study starts to the past of the subject to identify the exposure. Retrospective use records: clinical, educational, birth certificates, death certificates, etc. but that may be difficult because there may not be data for the study that is being initiated. These studies may have multiple exposures which may make this study difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_CohortStudies/EP713_CohortStudies_print.html|title=Cohort Studies|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an example of a retrospective cohort study is, if a demographer was examining a group of people born in year 1970 who have type 1 diabetes. The demographer would begin by looking at historical data. However, if the demographer was looking at ineffective data in attempts to deduce the source of type 1 diabetes, the demographers results would not be accurate.

A '''concordance''' is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a book or body of work, listing every instance of each word with its immediate [[context (language use)#Verbal context|context]]. Only works of special importance have had concordances prepared for them, such as the [[Vedas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Maurice | last = Bloomfield| authorlink = Maurice Bloomfield | title = A Vedic Concordance| year  = 1990| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ| isbn = 81-208-0654-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bible]], [[Qur'an]] or the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[James Joyce]] or classical Latin and Greek authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Roy | last = Wisbey | authorlink = Roy Wisbey | title = Concordance Making by Electronic Computer: Some Experiences with the Wiener Genesis| journal = The Modern Language Review | publisher = Modern Humanities Research Association | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–172 | date = April 1962 | doi=10.2307/3720960}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the time, difficulty, and expense involved in creating a concordance in the pre-[[computer]] era.

A concordance is more than an index; additional material make producing them a labor-intensive process, even when assisted by computers, such as commentary, definitions, and topical cross-indexing.

In the precomputing era, [[search engine technology|search]] technology was unavailable, and a concordance offered readers of long works such as the Bible something comparable to search results for every word that they would have been likely to search for. Today, the ability to combine the result of queries concerning multiple terms (such as searching for words near other words) has reduced interest in concordance publishing. In addition, mathematical techniques such as [[latent semantic indexing]] have been proposed as a means of automatically identifying linguistic information based on word context.

A '''bilingual concordance''' is a concordance based on [[aligned parallel text]].

A '''topical concordance''' is a list of subjects that a book covers (usually The Bible), with the immediate context of the coverage of those subjects. Unlike a traditional concordance, the indexed word does not have to appear in the verse. The best-known topical concordance is [[Nave's Topical Bible]].

The first [[Bible concordance]] was compiled for the [[Vulgate]] Bible by [[Hugh of St Cher]] (d.1262), who employed 500 monks to assist him. In 1448, Rabbi Mordecai Nathan completed a concordance to the Hebrew Bible. It took him ten years. A concordance to the Greek New Testament was published in 1599 by [[Henri Estienne (elder)|Henry Stephens]], and the Septuagint was done a couple of years later by Conrad Kircher in 1602. The first concordance to the English Bible was published in 1550 by Mr Marbeck. According to Cruden, it did not employ the verse numbers devised by [[Robert Estienne|Robert Stephens]] in 1545, but "the pretty large concordance" of Mr Cotton did. Then followed [[Cruden's Concordance]] and [[Strong's Concordance]].

==Use in linguistics==
Concordances are frequently used in [[linguistics]], when studying a text. For example:
* comparing different usages of the same word
* analysing keywords
* analysing [[word frequencies]]
* finding and analysing phrases and [[idioms]]
* finding [[translation]]s of subsentential elements, e.g. [[terminology]], in [[Bitext#Bitexts and translation memories|bitexts and translation memories]]
* creating indexes and word lists (also useful for publishing)

Concordancing techniques are widely used in national [[text corpora]] such as [[American National Corpus]], [[British National Corpus]], and [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] available on-line.  Stand-alone applications that employ concordancing techniques are known as [[Concordancer|concordancers]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexically.net/wordsmith/introduction.htm?gclid=COjFnvGKhakCFVJX4Qod-RqjjQ Introduction to WordSmith]&lt;/ref&gt; or more advanced [[corpus manager|corpus managers]]. Some of them have integrated [[Part of speech tagger|part-of-speech taggers]] and enable the user to create his/her own [[part of speech|POS]]-annotated corpora to conduct various type of searches adopted in corpus linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/linguistic-toobox-a-concordancer.html Linguistic Toolbox]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inversion==

The reconstruction of the text of some of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] involved a concordance.

Access to some of the scrolls was governed by a "secrecy rule" that allowed only the original International Team or their designates to view the original materials. After the death of [[Roland de Vaux]] in 1971, his successors repeatedly refused to even allow the publication of photographs to other scholars. This restriction was circumvented by [[Martin Abegg]] in 1991, who used a computer to "invert" a concordance of the missing documents made in the 1950s which had come into the hands of scholars outside of the International Team, to obtain an approximate reconstruction of the original text of 17 of the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Hawrysch |first= George |title= Dr. George Hawrysch's speech on concordance book launch |work= The Ukrainian Weekly, No. 31, Vol. LXX |publisher= Ukrainian National Association |date= 2002-08-04 |url= http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2002/310217.shtml |accessdate= 2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Jillette |first= Penn |title= You May Already be a "Computer Expert" |url= http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc/deadsea.html |accessdate= 2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by the release of the original text of the scrolls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16087">The term '''contact resistance''' refers to the contribution to the total [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of a system which can be attributed to the contacting interfaces of [[Electrical contact|electrical leads and connections]] as opposed to the intrinsic resistance, which is an inherent property, independent of the measurement method. This effect is often described by the term Electrical Contact Resistance or ECR and may vary with time, most often decreasing, in a process known as [[Contact_resistance#Mechanisms|resistance creep]]. The idea of potential drop on the injection electrode was introduced by [[William Shockley]]&lt;ref name="Shockley_1964"/&gt; to explain the difference between the experimental results and the model of gradual channel approximation. In addition to the term ECR, "Interface resistance", "transitional resistance", or just simply "correction term" are also used. The term "parasitic resistance" has been used as a more general term, where it is usually still assumed that the contact resistance has a major contribution.

[[File:Contact resistance example.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the contact resistance estimation by the transmission line method.]]

==Experimental characterization==
Here we need to distinguish the contact resistance evaluation in two-electrode systems (e.g. diodes) and three-electrode systems (e.g. transistors).

For two electrode systems the specific contact resistivity is experimentally defined as the slope of the [[I-V curve]] at V=0:

:&lt;math&gt;r_c = \left\{ \frac{\partial V}{\partial J} \right\}_{V=0}&lt;/math&gt;

where J is the current density = current/area. The units of specific contact resistivity are typically therefore in &lt;math&gt;\Omega \cdot \text{cm}^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; stands for ohms. When the current is a linear function of the voltage, the device is said to have [[ohmic contact]]s.

The resistance of contacts can be crudely estimated by comparing the results of a [[Four-terminal sensing|four terminal measurement]] to a simple two-lead measurement made with an ohmmeter. In a two-lead experiment, the measurement current causes a potential drop across both the test leads and the contacts so that the resistance of these elements is inseparable from the resistance of the actual device, with which they are in series. In a four-point probe measurement, one pair of leads is used to inject the measurement current while a second pair of leads, in parallel with the first, is used to measure the potential drop across the device. In the four-probe case, there is no potential drop across the voltage measurement leads so the contact resistance drop is not included. The difference between resistance derived from two-lead and four-lead methods is a reasonably accurate measurement of contact resistance assuming that the leads resistance is much smaller. Specific contact resistance can be obtained by multiplying by contact area. It should also be noted that the contact resistance may vary with temperature.

[[Inductive coupling|Inductive]] and [[capacitive coupling|capacitive]] methods could be used in principle to measure an intrinsic [[electrical impedance|impedance]] without the complication of contact resistance. In practice, [[direct current]] methods are more typically used to determine resistance.

The three electrode systems such as transistors require more complicated methods for the contact resistance approximation. The most common approach is the [[transmission line measurement|transmission line model]] (TLM). Here, the total device resistance &lt;math&gt;R_\text{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is plotted as a function of the channel length:

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{tot} = R_\text{c} + R_\text{ch} = R_\text{c} + \frac{L}{W C \mu \left(V_\text{gs} - V_\text{ds}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_\text{ch}&lt;/math&gt; are contact and channel resistances, respectively, &lt;math&gt;L/W&lt;/math&gt; is the channel length/width, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is gate insulator capacitance (per unit of area), &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is carrier mobility, and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{gs}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{ds}&lt;/math&gt; are gate-source and drain-source voltages. Therefore, the linear extrapolation of total resistance to the zero channel length provides the contact resistance. The slope of the linear function is related to the channel transconductance and can be used for estimation of the ”contact resistance-free” carrier mobility. The approximations used here (linear potential drop across the channel region, constant contact resistance,...) lead sometimes to the channel dependent contact resistance.&lt;ref name="Weis_2010"/&gt;

Beside the TLM it was proposed the gated four-probe measurement&lt;ref name="Pesavento_2004"/&gt; and the modified [[time-of-flight]] method (TOF).&lt;ref name="Weis_2009"/&gt; The direct methods able to measure potential drop on the injection electrode directly are the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KFM)&lt;ref name="Bürgi_2002"/&gt; and the electric-field induced second harmonic generation.&lt;ref name="Nakao_2009"/&gt;

==Mechanisms==
For given physical and mechanical material properties, parameters that govern the magnitude of electrical contact resistance (ECR) and its variation at an interface relate primarily to [[surface structure]] and applied load ([[Contact mechanics]]).&lt;ref name="Zhai_2016"/&gt; Surfaces of metallic contacts generally exhibit an external layer of oxide material and [[adsorbtion|adsorbed]] water molecules, which lead to capacitor-type junctions at weakly contacting [[Asperity_(materials_science)|asperities]] and resistor type contacts at strongly contacting asperities. Over time, the contact resistance at an interface relaxes, particularly at weakly contacting surfaces, through current induced welding and dielectric breakdown, in a process also known as resistance creep.&lt;ref name="Zhai_2015"/&gt; The coupling of [[surface chemistry]], contact mechanics and charge transport mechanisms needs to be accounted for in the mechanistic evaluation of ECR phenomena.

==Quantum limit==
When a conductor has spatial dimensions close to &lt;math&gt;2\pi/k_F&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_F&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fermi surface|Fermi wavevector]] of the conducting material, [[Ohm's law]] does not hold anymore. These small devices are called [[quantum point contact]]s. Their conductance must be an integer multiple of the value &lt;math&gt;2e^2/h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge|electronic charge]] and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]]. Quantum point contacts behave more like [[waveguide]]s than the classical wires of everyday life and may be described by the [[Rolf Landauer|Landauer]] scattering formalism.&lt;ref name="Landauer_1976"/&gt; Point-contact [[quantum tunneling|tunneling]] is an important technique for characterizing [[superconductor]]s.

==Other forms of contact resistance==
Measurements of [[thermal conductivity]] are also subject to contact resistance, with particular significance in heat transport through granular media. Similarly, a drop in [[hydrostatic pressure]] (analogous to electrical [[voltage]]) occurs when [[fluid flow]] transitions from one channel to another.

==Significance==
Bad contacts are the cause of failure or poor performance in a wide variety of electrical devices. For example, corroded [[jump start (vehicle)|jumper cable]] clamps can frustrate attempts to start a [[automobile|vehicle]] that has a low [[Lead-acid battery|battery]]. Dirty or [[corrosion|corroded]] contacts on a [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or its holder can give the false impression that the fuse is blown. A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial [[Joule heating|heating]] in a high current device. Unpredictable or noisy contacts are a major cause of the failure of electrical equipment.

'''Cultural Competency Training''' is an instruction to achieve cultural competence and the ability to appreciate and interpret accurately other [[culture]]s.

==Cultural competence==
[[Cultural competence]] refers to an ability to interact effectively with people of different cultures. Cultural competence comprises four components: (a) awareness of one's own cultural worldview, (b) attitude towards cultural differences, (c) knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews, and (d) cross-cultural skills. Developing cultural competence results in an ability to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures and leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Cultural Candor Inc. Cultural Competency Training| accessdate=12 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Competency has a fundamental importance in every aspect of a work field and that includes school and government setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasponline.org/research-and-policy/advocacy-tools-and-resources/communications-strategies-and-resources/school-climate%E2%80%94connectthedots/the-importance-of-cultural-competence|title=The Importance of Cultural Competence|website=www.nasponline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the amalgamation of different cultures in American society, it has become imperative for teachers and government employees to have some form of cultural competency training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/39783.htm|title=Why Cultural Competence?|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
To cater to an increasingly globalized society, many hospitals, organizations, and employers may choose to implement forms of cultural competency training methods to enhance transparency between language, values, beliefs, and cultural differences.  Training in cultural competence often includes careful consideration of how best to approach people's various forms of diversity.  This new found awareness oftentimes allows military members, educators, medical practitioners, workers, and common citizens to establish equity in their environments and enhances interrelationships between one another for increased productivity levels.  There have been numerous developed theories as to how best to conduct cultural competency training, which oftentimes is dependent on the specific environment and type of work.

== Cultural Competence Training &amp; Identity ==

When defining the ideas that surround cultural competence training, defining what culture is can help to understand the ideas that shape the concept. [[Culture]] is defined as the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution or organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of CULTURE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at culture in terms of cultural competence training, certain groups of individuals should be focused on because of their relevance to society. There are many groups that are marginalized and underrepresented; however, four specific areas to look at are:

=== LGBTQIAP ===
[[LGBT|LGBTQIAP]] community, race, and religion. These areas, along with others, represent concepts that make up one’s identity. The approach to identity helps to shape the ideas and themes that go into cultural competence training.
The acronym LGBTQIAP stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Ally, and Pansexual. This particular group of individuals has faced numerous obstacles and has historical events to highlight the inequalities they face such as the Stonewall riots. The [[Stonewall riots]] became a symbol for the gay liberation movement when police attempted a raid at the Stonewall Inn bar to arrest the gay and lesbian patrons and the gay community fought back. Numerous systemic oppressions historically and currently target LGBT individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leyva|first1=Valerie L.|last2=Breshears|first2=Elizabeth M.|last3=Ringstad|first3=Robin|title=Assessing the Efficacy of LGBT Cultural Competency Training for Aging Services Providers in California’s Central Valley|journal=Journal of Gerontological Social Work|volume=57|issue=2-4|pages=335–348|doi=10.1080/01634372.2013.872215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competence training helps professionals develop knowledge and skills on how to address issues and be more aware on the type of language that is politically correct.

=== Race ===
Race is a sensitive aspect of cultural competency training that requires professionals to be able to identify, acknowledge and value cultural differences. Training on this aspect of cultural competence teaches professionals that to ignore racial differences, is a form of microaggression that can help exacerbate racial inequalities.  In order to begin to understand intercultural communications one must understand the historical and social context under which different cultural groups operate.  For example, the history related to the cultural genocide of indigenous peoples in North America, understanding the said group’s value system, their ways of learning, and logic is essential in being able to understand how certain aspects of their culture may be similar or different from our own. Such distinction must be approached with respect and without ascribing superiority or inferiority to the difference.

=== Religion ===
Religious differences can play a role in how professionals interact and communicate with others. [[Religiosity]] refers to the nature and extent of public and private religious activity, including belief in God, prayer, and place of worship attendance. Religiosity is usually linked to formal religious traditions (such as [[Christianity]]), institutions (such as mosques), sacred texts (such as [[Book of Mormon|The Book of Mormon]]), and a definitive moral code (such as the Decalogue). Spirituality can be an important part of religion but can also exist independent of extant faith traditions, involving a variety of more individual subjective beliefs and activities related to the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this aspect of cultural competence training professionals should learn how to have religious competence. Religious competence refers to skills, practices, and orientations that recognize, explore, and harness patient religiosity to facilitate diagnosis, recovery, and healing. Religious competence involves the learning and deployment of generic competencies, including active listening and a nonjudgmental stance. It is also an overarching orientation, providing a safe place for discussion of religious issues and identities received in a humble, respectful, and empathetic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nationality ===
in terms of nationality, particularly for people who are immigrants, the recent increase in global migration make them an increasingly common demographic everywhere. Though they will have varying cultures as well. In this aspect, it is important for those who are trained to understand both similarities and differences between them, and the individual they are helping. With this knowledge, it makes the process of aiding the individual more efficient, and successful. &lt;ref&gt;Schouler-Ocak, Graef-Calliess, Tarricone, Qureshi, Kastrup, &amp; Bhugra. (2015). EPA guidance on cultural competence training. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''30''(3), 431-440.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the past Nation the individual has come from, and their journey of immigration as an experience, can shape their mentality. To have specialists with specific nationalities help explain some differences is a helpful strategy. &lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, D. (2017). Cultural competence training and mental health care in refugees and asylum seekers. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''41''(SS), S35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in School ==
School is considered to be the second learning home for kids. Every year a large number of people come to the United States. These groups of people are often families, including small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics|title=Immigration Data &amp; Statistics {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today’s world, cultural competency plays a very vital role in shaping the kids future. In the United States, there is an underlying difference among parents as to how a kid should be raised, but it is clear that cultural competency should be taught at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/cultural-competence-and-your-child/|title=Cultural Competence and Your Child {{!}} Wendy McElroy|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|date=2007-09-01|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is not the front runner in cultural competency training amongst children, as Canada and Australia are seemingly far more progressive in this sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wehearyou.acecqa.gov.au/2014/07/10/what-does-it-mean-to-be-culturally-competent/|title=What does it mean to be culturally competent?|last=ACECQA|first=Author|date=2014-07-10|website=We Hear You|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competency training can be a huge help for the families who are thinking of adopting a foster child, specifically, if that child was born outside of United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/pressroom/features/issue/diversity.asp|title=Diversity &amp; Cultural Competence|website=www.socialworkers.org|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A school is a mixture of different races and cultures and as an educator, one must be sensitive to everyone’s needs. Different cultures act uniquely to the different situations, and as an educator, one has to not only value diversity, but also have a strategy for everyone to feel welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/30402.htm|title=Diversity Toolkit: Cultural Competence for Educators|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in the Workforce ==
Over the years, there have been new developed ways of practicing cultural competency in the workforce. There are many different methods that would allow assistance in cultural competency such as: Global leadership programs, international team building exercises and specific cross-cultural skills training for special executive positions. Having a good grasp on the many different cultures that exist is increasingly becoming a major principle in the workforce. The techniques for cultural competency training must be practiced more than just in class room lecture. Trainers must be extremely educated in this matter to be able to sufficiently train people.  They must take notice of their own biases perspective and about the different types cultures that receive discrimination.

== Cultural Competence Training for Medical Students and Physicians ==
{{see also|Cultural competence in health care}}
In the medical setting, effective communication between clinicians, patients, families and other health care providers is fundamental.

[[Health disparities]] refer to gaps in the quality of health and health care across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Studies have demonstrated the multiple factors that contribute to health disparities.

Cultural Competence Online for Medical Practice (CCOMP) is an attempt in the United States to address one of the factors - the patient-doctor interaction.  The CCOMP project is funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  CCOMP offers a clinician's guide to reduce cardiovascular disparities, intended to create effective cross-cultural approaches to care for African-American patients with [[cardiovascular disease]], especially [[hypertension]]. Videos with real patient scenarios and case-based modules are aimed at developing this increased awareness.

In [[fluid dynamics]], '''disk loading''' or '''disc loading''' is the average [[pressure]] change across an [[actuator disk]], such as an airscrew. Airscrews with a relatively low disk loading are typically called rotors, including [[helicopter]] [[Helicopter rotor|main rotor]]s and [[tail rotor]]s; [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s typically have a higher disk loading.&lt;ref name="isbn0-486-64647-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Keys, C.

The [[V-22 Osprey]] [[tiltrotor]] aircraft has a high disk loading relative to a helicopter in the hover mode, but a relatively low disk loading in [[fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] mode compared to a [[turboprop]] aircraft.&lt;ref name=VDTR&gt;{{cite conference|title=A Variable Diameter Short Haul Civil Tiltrotor |citeseerx = 10.1.1.45.612 |author1=Wang, James M. |author2=Jones, Christopher T. |author3=Nixon, Mark W. |conference= 55th Annual Forum of the American Helicopter Society| location=[[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada| date=1999-05-27|quote=The variable diameter tiltrotor (VDTR) is a Sikorsky concept aimed at improving tiltrotor hover and cruise performance currently limited by disk loading that is much higher in hover than conventional helicopter, and much lower in cruise than turbo-prop systems.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rotors==
Disc loading of a [[hover (helicopter)|hover]]ing helicopter 
is the ratio of its weight to the
total main rotor disc area. It is determined by dividing
the total helicopter weight by the rotor disc area,
which is the area swept by the blades of a rotor. Disc
area can be found by using the span of one rotor blade
as the radius of a circle and then determining the area
the blades encompass during a complete rotation. When a helicopter is being maneuvered, its disc loading changes.
The higher the loading, the more power needed to
maintain rotor speed.&lt;ref name=FAA&gt;{{cite book

''[[NASA]]'', 2000. Accessed: 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing the weight of a helicopter increases disk loading. For a given weight, a helicopter with shorter rotors will have higher disk loading, and will require more engine power to hover. A low disk loading improves [[Autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]] performance in [[rotorcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Noor, Ahmed Khairy |title=Future Aeronautical and Space Systems (Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics) |publisher=AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics) |location= |year=1996 |pages= 66|isbn=1-56347-188-4 |quote=Reduced disk loading in the vertical mode also results in lower downwash and improved capability for autorotation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leishGyro&gt;Leishman, J.

''[[Hofstra University]]'', New York, 2003.
&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, an [[autogyro]] (or gyroplane) has a lower rotor disc loading than a helicopter, which provides a slower rate of descent in autorotation.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;

==Propellers==
In reciprocating and propeller engines, disk loading can be defined as the ratio between propeller-induced velocity and freestream velocity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Lower disk loading will increase efficiency, so it is generally desirable to have larger propellers from an efficiency standpoint. Maximum efficiency is reduced as disk loading is increased due to the rotating slipstream; using [[contra-rotating propellers]] can alleviate this problem allowing high maximum efficiency even at relatively high disc loadings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Birdsall | first = David | title = Aircraft Performance | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-521-56836-6 | pages=99 |quote=contra-rotating propellers this rotational loss can be eliminated and maximum efficiencies approaching 0.9 can be obtained even with high disc loading }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Airbus A400M]] fixed-wing aircraft will have a very high disk loading on its propellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Reinhard Hilbig |author2=Wagner, Siegfried |author3=Ulrich Rist |author4=Hans-Joachim Heinemann |title=New Results in Numerical and Experimental Fluid Mechanics III |series=Notes on Numerical Fluid Mechanics and Multidisciplinary Design |volume = 3 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2002 |page= 82|isbn=3-540-42696-5|quote = The A400M will be driven by four modern turboprop engines with a high disc loading.... The disc loading of the propellers is significantly higher than realised on former tactical transport aircraft like C130H or Transall C160.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The ''momentum theory'' or ''disk actuator theory'' describes a [[mathematical model]] of an ideal actuator disk, developed by [[William John Macquorn Rankine|W.J.M. Rankine]] (1865), [[Alfred George Greenhill]] (1888) and [[R.E. Froude]] (1889). The [[helicopter]] [[helicopter rotor|rotor]] is modeled as an infinitely thin disc with an infinite number of blades that induce a constant pressure jump over the disk area and along the axis of rotation. For a helicopter that is [[hover (helicopter)|hover]]ing, the aerodynamic force is vertical and exactly balances the helicopter weight, with no lateral force.

The upward action on the helicopter results in a downward reaction on the air flowing through the rotor. The downward reaction produces a downward velocity on the air, increasing its [[kinetic energy]]. This energy transfer from the rotor to the air is the induced power loss of the rotary wing, which is analogous to the [[lift-induced drag]] of a fixed-wing aircraft.

[[Conservation of linear momentum]] relates the induced velocity downstream in the far wake field to the rotor thrust per unit of [[mass flow]]. [[Conservation of energy]] considers these parameters as well as the induced velocity at the rotor disk. [[Conservation of mass]] relates the mass flow to the induced velocity. The momentum theory applied to a helicopter gives the relationship between induced power loss and rotor thrust, which can be used to analyze the performance of the aircraft. [[Viscosity]] and [[compressibility]] of the air, [[friction]]al losses, and rotation of the slipstream in the wake are not considered.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

===Momentum theory===
For an actuator disk of area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, with uniform induced velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; at the rotor disk, and with &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; as the [[density of air]], the [[mass flow rate]] &lt;math&gt;^\dot{m}&lt;/math&gt; through the disk area is:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot m = \rho \, A \, v.&lt;/math&gt;

By conservation of mass, the mass flow rate is constant across the [[slipstream]] both upstream and downstream of the disk (regardless of velocity). Since the flow far upstream of a helicopter in a level hover is at rest, the starting velocity, momentum, and energy are zero. If the homogeneous [[slipstream]] far downstream of the disk has velocity &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, by conservation of momentum the total thrust &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; developed over the disk is equal to the rate of change of momentum, which assuming zero starting velocity is:

:&lt;math&gt; T= \dot m\, w.&lt;/math&gt;

By conservation of energy, the work done by the rotor must equal the energy change in the slipstream:

:&lt;math&gt; T\, v= \tfrac12\, \dot m\, {w^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and eliminating terms, we get:

:&lt;math&gt; v= \tfrac12\, w.&lt;/math&gt;

So the velocity of the wake far downstream is twice the velocity at the disk, which is the same result for an elliptically loaded fixed wing predicted by [[lifting-line theory]].&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book |author=Johnson, Wayne |title=Helicopter theory |chapter=2|publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |year=1994 |pages= 28–34|isbn=0-486-68230-7|quote=In the momentum theory analysis the rotor is modeled as an actuator disk, which is a circular surface of zero thickness that can support a pressure difference and thus accelerate the air through the disk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bernoulli's principle===

To compute the disk loading using [[Bernoulli's principle]], we assume the pressure in the slipstream far downstream is equal to the starting pressure &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;, which is equal to the [[atmospheric pressure]]. From the starting point to the disk we have:

:&lt;math&gt; p_0 =\, p_1 +\ \tfrac12\, \rho\, v^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Between the disk and the distant wake, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; p_2 +\ \tfrac12\, \rho\, v^2 =\, p_0 +\ \tfrac12\, \rho\, w^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining equations, the disk loading &lt;math&gt;T /\, A&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {T}{A} = p_2 -\, p_1 = \tfrac12\, \rho\, w^2&lt;/math&gt;

The total pressure in the distant wake is:

:&lt;math&gt; p_0 + \tfrac12\, \rho\, w^2 =\, p_0 + \frac {T}{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

So the pressure change across the disk is equal to the disk loading. Above the disk the pressure change is:

:&lt;math&gt; p_0 - \tfrac12\, \rho\, v^2 =\, p_0 -\, \tfrac14 \frac {T}{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

Below the disk, the pressure change is:

:&lt;math&gt; p_0 + \tfrac32\, \rho\, v^2 =\, p_0 +\, \tfrac34 \frac {T}{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

The pressure along the slipstream is always falling downstream, except for the positive pressure jump across the disk.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

===Power required===
From the momentum theory, thrust is:
:&lt;math&gt; T = \dot m\, w = \dot m\, (2  v) = 2 \rho\, A\, v^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The induced velocity is:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{A} \cdot \frac{1}{2 \rho}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;T/A&lt;/math&gt; is the disk loading as before, and the power &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; required in hover (in the ideal case) is:

:&lt;math&gt;P = T v = T \sqrt{\frac{T}{A} \cdot \frac{1}{2 \rho}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the induced velocity can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{P}{T} = \left [ \frac{T}{P} \right ] ^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

So, the induced velocity is inversely proportional to the [[power loading]] &lt;math&gt;T/P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-85860-7"&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics (Cambridge Aerospace Series) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-521-85860-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''eggshell''' is the outer covering of a hard-shelled [[egg (biology)|egg]] and of some forms of eggs with soft outer coats.

== Diversity ==

=== Insect eggs ===
[[File:Pararge aegeria egg with embryo.jpg|thumb|Butterfly embryo / caterpillar visible through transparent eggshell]]

[[Insect]]s and other [[arthropod]]s lay a variety of styles and shapes of eggs. Some have gelatinous or skin-like coverings, others have hard eggshells. Softer shells are mostly protein. It may be fibrous or quite liquid. Some arthropod eggs do not actually have shells, rather, their outer covering is actually the outermost embryonic membrane, the '''choroid''', which serves to protect inner layers. The choroid itself can be a complex structure, and it may have different layers within it. It may have an outermost layer called an ''exochorion''. Eggs which must survive in dry conditions usually have hard eggshells, made mostly of dehydrated or mineralized proteins with pore systems to allow [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Arthropod eggs can have extensive ornamentation on their outer surfaces.

=== Fish, amphibian and reptile eggs ===
[[Fish]] and [[amphibian]]s generally lay eggs which are surrounded by the extraembryonic membranes but do not develop a shell, hard or soft, around these membranes. Some fish and amphibian eggs have thick, leathery coats, especially if they must withstand physical force or desiccation. These types of eggs can also be very small and fragile.

While many [[reptile]]s lay eggs with flexible, calcified, eggshells, there are some that lay hard eggs. Eggs laid by snakes generally have leathery shells which often adhere to one another. Depending on the species, turtles and tortoises lay hard or soft eggs. Several species lay eggs which are nearly indistinguishable from bird eggs.

=== Bird eggs ===
[[File:Anatomy of an egg labeled.jpg|frameless|border|upright=1.6|left]]

The [[bird]] egg is a fertilized [[gamete]] (or, in the case of some birds, such as chickens, possibly unfertilized) located on the yolk surface and surrounded by [[albumen]], or egg white. The albumen in turn is surrounded by two shell membranes (inner and outer membranes) and then the eggshell. The chicken eggshell is 95{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}-97%&lt;ref name="Hunton, P. Rev.

Eggshell formation requires gram amounts of calcium being deposited within hours, which must be supplied via the hen’s diet.&lt;ref name="Hunton, P. Rev. Bras. 2005, 7(2), 67-71."/&gt;

The fibrous chicken shell membranes are added in the proximal (white) isthmus of the [[oviduct]].&lt;ref name="Hunton, P. Rev. Bras. 2005, 7(2), 67-71."/&gt;  In the distal (red) isthmus mammillae or mammillary knobs are deposited on the surface of the outer membrane in a regular array pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wyburn |first1=GM |last2=Johnston |first2=HS |last3=Draper |first3=MH |last4=Davidson |first4=MF |title=The ultrastructure of the shell forming region of the oviduct and the development of the shell of Gallus domesticus |journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology and Cognate Medical Sciences |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=143–51 |year=1973 |pmid=4487964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fernandez |first1=MS |last2=Araya |first2=M |last3=Arias |first3=JL |title=Eggshells are shaped by a precise spatio-temporal arrangement of sequentially deposited macromolecules |journal=Matrix Biology |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=13–20 |year=1997 |pmid=9181550 |doi=10.1016/s0945-053x(97)90112-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mammillae are proteoglycan-rich and are thought to control calcification. In the shell gland (similar to a mammalian uterus), mineralization starts at the mammillae. The shell gland fluid contains very high levels of calcium and hydrogen carbonate. The thick calcified layer of the eggshell forms in columns from the mammillae structures, and is known as the palisade layer. Between these palisade columns are narrow pores that traverse the eggshell and allow gaseous exchange. The [[cuticle]] forms the final, outer layer of the eggshell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xray.cz/epdic/abstracts/293.htm |title=The Egg-Shell Microstructure Studied by Powder Diffraction |publisher=Xray.cz |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the bulk of eggshell is made of calcium carbonate, it is now thought that the protein matrix has an important role to play in eggshell strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ict.udg.co.cu/FTPDocumentos/Literatura%20Cientifica/Maestria%20Nutricion%20Animal/6.%20EVENTOS%20RELEVANTES/XVII%20Congreso%20Avicultura/confs/hunton1.htm |accessdate=February 2, 2011 }}{{dead link |date=March 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins affect crystallization, which in turn affects the eggshell structure. Moreover, the concentration of eggshell proteins decreases over the life of the laying hen, as does eggshell strength.

In an average [[chicken|laying hen]], the process of shell formation takes around 20 hours. [[Pigment]]ation is added to the shell by [[wiktionary:papilla|papillae]] lining the oviduct, coloring it any of a variety of colors and patterns depending on species. Since eggs are usually laid blunt end first, that end is subjected to most pressure during its passage and consequently shows the most color.

As they contain mainly [[calcium carbonate]], bird eggshells dissolve in various acids, including the vinegar used in cooking. While dissolving, the calcium carbonate in an eggshell reacts with the acid to form [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=461 |title=Q &amp; A: Eggshells in Vinegar - What happened? &amp;#124; Department of Physics &amp;#124; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |publisher=Van.physics.illinois.edu |date=2007-10-22 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental issues====
The US food industry generates 150,000 tons of shell waste a year.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht J: Eggshells break into collagen market. New Scientist 1999, 161:6-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The disposal methods for waste eggshells are 26.6% as fertilizer, 21.1% as animal feed ingredients, 26.3% discarded in municipal dumps, and 15.8% used in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;Daengprok W, Garnjanagoonchorn W, Mine Y: Fermented pork sausage fortified with commercial or hen eggshell calcium lactate. Meat Science 2002, 62:199-204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many landfills are unwilling to take the waste because the shells and the attached membrane attract vermin.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}  Together the calcium carbonate eggshell and protein rich membrane are useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wei Z |author2=Li B |author3=Xu C |date=2009 |title=Application of waste eggshell as low-cost solid catalyst for biodiesel production |journal=Bioresource Technology |volume=100 |issue=11 |pages=2883–2885 |doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2008.12.039|pmid=19201602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent inventions have allowed for the egg cracking industry to separate the eggshell from the eggshell membrane.   The eggshell is mostly made up of calcium carbonate and the membrane is valuable protein.  When separated both products have an array of uses.

=== Mammal eggs ===

[[Monotreme]]s, egg-laying mammals, lay soft-shelled eggs similar to those of reptiles. The shell is deposited on the egg in layers within the uterus. The egg can take up fluids and grow in size during this process, and the final, most rigid layer is not added until the egg is full-size.

=== Egg teeth ===

Hatching birds, amphibian and egg-laying reptiles have an [[egg tooth|egg-tooth]] used to start an exit hole in the hard eggshell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/poultry/multistate/koelkebeck1.htm |title=What is Egg Shell Quality and How to Preserve It |publisher=Ag.ansc.purdue.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208205657/http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/poultry/multistate/koelkebeck1.htm |archivedate=2012-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nys|first=Yves|last2=Gautron|first2=Joël|last3=Garcia-Ruiz|first3=Juan M.|last4=Hincke|first4=Maxwell T.|title=Avian eggshell mineralization: biochemical and functional characterization of matrix proteins|url=http://hera.ugr.es/doi/15773115.pdf|journal=Comptes Rendus Palevol|volume=3|issue=6–7|pages=549–562|doi=10.1016/j.crpv.2004.08.002|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], a '''feature'''  is the assignment of [[wiktionary:binary|binary]] or [[unary operation|unary]] conditions which act as constraints.{{what|date=January 2015}}

==In phonology==
{{main|distinctive feature}}
In [[phonology]], [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s are categorized into [[natural class]]es on the basis of their [[distinctive feature]]s. Each feature is a quality or characteristic of the natural class, such as [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] or [[manner of articulation|manner]]. A unique combination of features defines a [[phoneme]].

Examples of [[phonemic]] or distinctive features are: [+/- [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] ], [+/- [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] ] (binary features) and [ [[coronal consonant|CORONAL]] ] (a unary feature; also a [[place of articulation|place]] feature).

Surface representations can be expressed as the result of rules acting on the features of the [[underlying representation]]. These rules are formulated in terms of transformations on features.

==In morphology==
In [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]], words are often organized into '''[[lexical category|lexical categories]]''' or '''word classes''', such as "noun", "verb", "adjective", and so on. These word classes have '''[[grammatical category|grammatical feature]]s''' (also called ''categories'' or ''inflectional categories''), which can have one of a set of potential '''values''' (also called the ''property'', ''meaning'', or ''feature'' of the category).&lt;ref&gt;Kibort, Anna &amp; Corbett, Greville G. [http://www.grammaticalfeatures.net/inventory.html Grammatical Features - Feature Inventory]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider the [[pronoun]] in English. Pronouns are a ''lexical category''. Pronouns have the [[grammatical person|person]] ''feature'', which can have a ''value'' of "first", "second", or "third". English pronouns also have the [[grammatical number|number]] ''feature'', which can have a value of either "singular" or "plural". As a result, we can describe the English pronoun "they" as a pronoun with [person:3] and [number:plural].

==In semantics==
{{main|semantic feature}}
In [[semantics]], words are categorized into [[semantic class]]es. Intersecting semantic classes share the same [[semantic feature]]s.

{{ForensicScience}}
'''Forensic Podiatry''' is a subdiscipline of [[forensic science]] in which specialized podiatric knowledge including foot and lower limb anatomy, musculoskeletal function, deformities and [[diseases of the foot]], [[ankle]], lower extremities, and at times, the entire human body is used in the examination of foot-related evidence in the context of a criminal investigation. Forensic Podiatry has been defined as:

:''"The application of sound and researched podiatry knowledge and experience in forensic investigations, to show the association of an individual with a scene of crime, or to answer any other legal question concerned with the foot or footwear that requires knowledge of the functioning foot" (Vernon &amp; McCourt, 1999)''

Those who specialize in this field need to have gained knowledge and experience in podiatry and also in forensic science and practice (Vernon et al., 2009).

Forensic Podiatry is usually used to assist in the process of human identification, but can also be employed to help address issues relating to questions that have arisen within the context of forensic enquiry. Such questions could include whether or not a shoe could have had multiple wearers, what the effects of a shoe not fitting correctly could have been, whether or not someone could have placed their foot into a shoe that was too small for the postulated wearer’s foot and other matters involving the podiatric interpretation of relevant evidential materials.

'''Areas of practice'''

There are currently four areas of forensic podiatry practice. These usually involve the analysis and interpretation in a forensic context of:

Bare footprints (both static and dynamic prints)

Footwear (specifically the consideration of features of wear and fit)

Podiatrists clinical records

Gait analysis (usually covering the examination of the gait forms of persons captured on closed circuity television [CCTV], but also covering the analysis of the sequences of footprints at a crime scene)

(DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017)

'''Methods'''

Forensic podiatry techniques usually follow the ACE-V approach used widely in forensic science and practice (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2011). Here, ACE is the acronym for the Analysis, Comparison and Evaluation of an item of evidence with exemplar or reference material (such as a shoe, bare footprint or recording of a suspect’s gait). Verification is about the independent working through of that same material by a peer forensic specialist to confirm whether or not they reach the same conclusions as the reporting specialist.

Physical evidence is generally understood to exist at two levels which have been described as demonstrating class and identification level characteristics (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017). Class level characteristics demonstrate consistency and compatibility, not uniqueness, which identification level characteristics are those which are understood to be unique (REF). Forensic podiatrists currently work with class level features alone although some of those features can demonstrate high levels of individuality (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017).

Given that forensic podiatrists currently deal with class level characteristics alone, their work would not in itself usually result in the incontrovertible identification of someone unless the situation is one in which a closed population (that is one in which there is a limited number of possible people to consider when considering the possibility of a match or mismatch between two evidential items from a podiatric perspective).

The evidential materials that would be considered by forensic podiatrists can sometimes fall within the specialist understanding of other disciplines. For example, forensic gait analysis case work has been undertaken by human movement scientists and the knowledge involved in forensic gait analysis is that possessed by some physical therapists and orthopedic specialists as well as podiatrists (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017).

Similarly, some evidential material of interest to forensic podiatrists is also of interest to other forensic specialists (particularly forensic marks examiners) although from their own particular perspectives (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017) and forensic podiatrists always need to consider the potential for multidisciplinary considerations/collaborations.

'''Key historic developments'''

In 1972, Dr Norman Gunn DPM, a Podiatric Physician from Canada was the first podiatrist worldwide to undertake forensic podiatry case work (Vernon, 2006).

In 1989, Dr Wesley Vernon PhD, a podiatrist from the UK began to undertake research in forensic podiatry and later began to undertake case work from the mid 1990s.

In the early 1990s, Dr John DiMaggio DPM, a Podiatric Physician began to undertake forensic podiatry case work in the US.

In September 2003, an organization was formed - the American Society of Forensic Podiatry.

In 2007, the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners (CRFP) developed a competency test for forensic podiatrists in the UK. The CRFP is no longer in existence, but this testing process was developed further by the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences (CSFS) in the UK and is available for those practising in this field.

In July 2007, a forensic [[podiatry]] science and practice subcommittee was established within the structure of the [[International Association for Identification]] (IAI).

In 2009, the IAI published a document defining the role and scope of practise for forensic podiatrists (Vernon et al., 2009)

In 2011 a M level course in forensic podiatry was developed at the University of Huddersfield in the UK. This was later developed further into a full MSc course in forensic podiatry at that university.

In 2011, the first forensic podiatry textbook was written (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2011). In 2017, a much more comprehensive, updated 2nd edition of this book was published (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017)

In 2013 a [[Forensic Podiatry]] group was started at the [[New York College of Podiatric Medicine]].

In 2013, a student forensic [[podiatry]] group was started at [[Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine]].

In 2014, the forensic podiatry approach to bare footprint analysis was found to meet the US the United States Supreme Court’s standard of admissibility through a Daubert hearing (Nirenberg, 2016)

'''Contemporary developments'''

In 2016, a Forensic Podiatry Club was started at the Barry University School of Podiatric Medicine.

A formal class covering aspects of [[Forensic Podiatry]] is being held at [[New York College of Podiatric Medicine]] (open to [[Podiatrist]] candidate)s. Students exit the class with an in depth knowledge of [[Forensic Podiatry]] and other legal knowledge applicable to current cases.

In 2017, at the behest of the UK Regulator for Forensic Science, standards of practice for forensic gait analysis are being written and at the time of writing a draft document has been put out for consultation. It is anticipated that these will be completed in early 2018.

[[File:French Kiss.JPG|thumb|Two people French kissing]]

In English informal speech, a '''French kiss''', also known as a '''deep kiss''', is an amorous [[kiss]] in which the participants' [[tongue]]s extend to touch each other's lips or tongue. A "kiss with the tongue" stimulates the partner's lips, tongue and mouth, which are sensitive to the touch and induce physiological sexual arousal.  The oral zone is one of the principal [[erogenous zone]]s of the body. The implication is of a slow, passionate kiss which is considered intimate, [[Romance (love)|romantic]], [[erotic]] or [[Human sexuality|sexual]]. The sensation when two tongues touch, also known as "tongue touching", has been proven to stimulate endorphin release and reduce acute stress levels. French kissing is often described as ‘1st base’, and is used by many as an indicator of what stage a relationship has reached.

== Etymology ==
A French kiss is so called because at the beginning of the 20th century, in the English-speaking world, the [[French people|French]] had acquired a reputation for more adventurous and passionate sex practices. It originated in America and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Petit Robert 2014 French dictionary, released on May 30, 2013, added the French verb "se galocher" — slang for kissing with tongues — making it the first time a single word described the practice (except in Quebec, where the verb "frencher" means French kissing; Australia, where the term "pash" is used; the English verb ”shift” is used in casual conversation in [[Ireland]]; the German verb ''knutschen''; the Italian verbs ''limonare'' and ''pomiciare''; and the Hungarian verb ''megcsókol/csókolózik'').

== Disease risks ==
French kissing carries moderate risk of [[HPV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French kissing ups risk of oral HPV infection|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/12/-idUSTRE54B61920090512|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of contracting [[HIV]] from French kissing is extremely low as transmission would require an open wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV/AIDS 101|url=https://www.cdc.gov/CDCTV/HivAids101/Transcripts/HivAids101.pdf|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man with HIV may have infected partner with a kiss|url=http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9707/10/nfm.aids.kiss/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 May 2015|date=10 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] considers transmission of [[Hepatitis B]] via French kissing to be an unlikely mode of infection.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Turtle entangled in marine debris (ghost net).jpg|thumb|300px|A sea turtle entangled in a ghost net.]]

'''Ghost nets''' are [[fishing net]]s that have been [[marine debris|left or lost in the ocean]] by fishermen. These nets, often nearly invisible in the dim light, can be left tangled on a rocky reef or drifting in the open sea. They can [[Plastic_pollution#Entanglement|entangle]] [[fish]], [[dolphin]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, [[shark]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[seabird]]s, [[crab]]s, and other creatures, including the occasional human diver.&lt;ref&gt;Esteban, Michelle (2002) [http://www.eurocbc.org/page54.html ''Tracking Down Ghost Nets'']&lt;/ref&gt; Acting as designed, the nets restrict movement, causing starvation, laceration and infection, and suffocation in those that need to return to the surface to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6248366.stm |title='Ghost fishing' killing seabirds |accessdate=2008-04-01 |date=28 June 2007 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Marine organisms entangled in a ghost net within the Maldives (Olive Ridley Project).jpg|thumb|300px|Many marine species including [[turtles]], [[sharks]], [[whales]], [[dolphins]], [[dugong]]s become entangled in ghost nets. Most go unnoticed and unrecorded.]]
[[File:Starbuck AKK FishnetFloat.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[glass float]] on the beach. Many of these floats for fish nets wash up on island beaches around the Pacific. The loss of the floats can leave fish nets drifting in the open ocean where they continue to entangle fish, birds, and marine mammals.]]

Some commercial fisherman use [[gillnet]]s. These are suspended in the sea by flotation [[buoy]]s, such as [[glass float]]s, along one edge. In this way they can form a vertical wall hundreds of metres long, where any fish within a certain size range can be caught. Normally these nets are collected by fishermen and the catch removed. 

If this is not done, the net can continue to catch fish until the weight of the catch exceeds the buoyancy of the floats. The net then sinks, and the fish are devoured by bottom-dwelling crustaceans and other fish. Then the floats pull the net up again and the cycle continues. Given the high-quality synthetics that are used today, the destruction can continue for a long time.

The problem is not just nets but '''ghost gear''' in general;&lt;ref name=guard1&gt;Hannah Gould, [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/sep/10/fishing-industry-vows-to-tackle-wildlife-deaths-from-ghost-gear Hidden problem of 'ghost gear': the abandoned fishing nets clogging up oceans], ''Theguardian.com'', 10 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; old-fashioned [[crab trap]]s, without the required "rot-out panel", also sit on the bottom, where they become self-baiting traps that go on catching crabs year after year. Even balled-up [[fishing line]] can be deadly for a variety of creatures, including birds and marine mammals. Over time the nets become more and more tangled. In general, fish are less likely to be trapped in gear that has been down a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Dunagan, Christopher (2000)[[The Sun (Lowell)|''The Sun'']]. [http://web.kitsapsun.com/news/2000/may/0504pugetsoundwa.html The net effect: trouble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404001020/http://web.kitsapsun.com/news/2000/may/0504pugetsoundwa.html |date=2009-04-04 }}, 5 April&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishermen sometimes abandon worn-out nets because it is often the easiest way to get rid of them.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

The French government offered a reward for ghost nets handed in to local coastguards along sections of the Normandy coast between 1980 and 1981. The project was abandoned when people vandalized nets to claim rewards, without retrieving anything at all from the shoreline or ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Andres, Von Brandt (1984) ''Fish catching methods of the world'' {{ISBN|978-0-685-63409-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, the Global Ghost Gear Initiative (GGGI) was created by the [[World Animal Protection]] to give a unique and stronger voice to the cause.

The term ALDFG means "abandoned or lost or discarded fishing gear".

==Environmental impact==
From 2000 to 2012, the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] reported an average of 11 large [[whales]] entangled in ghost nets every year along the US west coast. From 2002 to 2010, 870 nets were recovered in [[Washington (state)]] with over 32,000 marine animals trapped inside. Ghost gear is estimated to account for 10% of all [[marine litter]].&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

According to the SeaDoc Society, each ghost net kills $20,000 worth of [[Dungeness crab]] over 10 years. The [[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]] calculated that ghost crab pots capture 1.25 million [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]]s each year in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] alone.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

In May 2016, the [[Australian Fisheries Management Authority]] (AFMA) recovered 10 tonnes of abandoned nets within the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone and [[Torres Strait]] protected zone perimeters. One protected turtle was rescued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afma.gov.au/ghost-net-busters/ Ghost net busters], ''Afma.gov.au'', 3 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Unlike synthetic fishing nets, [[biodegradable]] fishing nets decompose naturally under water after a certain period of time. Coconut fibre ([[coir]]) fishing nets are commercially made and are hence a practical solution that can be taken by fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2016-02-biodegradable-fishing-nets-marine-animals.html Biodegradable fishing nets: advantages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/economic/futurefibres/fibres/coir/en/ Coir fishing nets]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company Net-works worked out a solution to turn discarded fishing nets into carpet tiles.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Beavis,[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/30/net-works-is-net-gain-for-poor-coastal-community Net-Works is net gain for poor coastal community], ''Theguardian.com'', 30 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the US Fishing for Energy initiative collected 2.8 million pounds of fishing gear, and in partnership with [[Covanta Energy]] turned this into enough electricity to power 182 homes for one year by incineration.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NOAA, [https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/prevention/fishing-energy Fishing for Energy]. Accessed July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan to protect UK seas from ghost fishing was backed by the [http://conservativeeurope.com/news/meps-back-plan-to-end-ghost-fishing European Parliament] Fisheries Committee in 2018. Mr Flack, who led the committee, said: "Abandoned fishing nets are polluting our seas, wasting fishing stocks and indiscriminately killing whales, sea lions or even dolphins. The tragedy of ghost fishing must end.&lt;ref&gt;MEPs back plan to end ‘ghost fishing', [http://conservativeeurope.com/news/meps-back-plan-to-end-ghost-fishing]. 20 June, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glazing''', which derives from the [[Middle English]] for 'glass', is a part of a [[wall]] or [[window]], made of [[glass]].&lt;ref&gt;Definition of ''glazing'' at [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glazing Merriam-Webster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231000931/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glazing |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Definition of ''glazing'' at [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/glazing?q=glazing Cambridge Dictionaries Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930065434/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/glazing?q=glazing |date=2012-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glazing also describes the work done by a professional "[[glazier]]". Glazing is also less commonly used to describe the insertion of ophthalmic lenses into an eyeglass frame.

Common types of glazing that are used in architectural applications include clear and tinted [[float glass]], [[tempered glass]], and [[laminated glass]] as well as a variety of coated glasses, all of which can be glazed singly or as [[Insulated glazing|double, or even triple]], glazing units. Ordinary clear glass has a slight green tinge but special colorless glasses are offered by several manufacturers.

Glazing can be mounted on the surface of a [[window]] [[Sash window|sash]] or [[door]] [[Frame and panel|stile]], usually made of [[wood]], [[aluminium]] or [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. The glass is fixed into a [[rabbet|rabbet (rebate)]] in the frame in a number of ways including triangular glazing points, [[putty]], etc.  Toughened and laminated glass can be glazed by bolting panes directly to a metal framework by bolts passing through drilled holes.

Glazing is commonly used in low temperature solar thermal collectors because it helps retain the collected heat.

'''Governmentality''' is a concept first developed by the French [[philosopher]] [[Michel Foucault]] in the later years of his life, roughly between 1977 and his death in 1984, particularly in his lectures at the [[Collège de France]] during this time.

The concept has been elaborated further from an "Anglo-Neo Foucauldian" perspective in the social sciences, especially by authors such as Peter Miller, [[Nikolas Rose]], and Mitchell Dean. Governmentality can be understood as:
* the way [[government]]s try to produce the citizen best suited to fulfill those governments' policies
* the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, and techniques) through which subjects are governed&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Susan (ed) ''A Dictionary of Geography'' (Article: Governmentality) Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmentality may also be understood as:

==Semantics==
This term was thought by some commentators to be made by the "...linking of governing ("gouverner") and modes of thought ("mentalité")".&lt;ref name="lemke2"&gt;{{cite book|title='The birth of bio-politics: Michael Foucault's lectures at the College de France on neo-liberal governmentality' in ''Economy and Society'' v.30, i.2, p.&amp;nbsp;190-207|author=Lemke, T|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was not coined by uniting words "gouvernement" and "mentalité", but simply by making ''gouvernement'' into ''gouvernementalité'' just like ''musical'' into ''musicalité'' [i.e. government + -al- ''adjective'' + -ité ''abstract noun''] (see Michel Senellart's "Course Context" in Foucault's "Security, territory, population" lectures). To fully understand this concept, it is important to realize that in this case, Foucault does not only use the standard, strictly political definition of "governing" or government used today, but he also uses the broader definition of governing or government that was employed until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 90&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, that in this case, for Foucault, "...'government' also signified problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for our purposes, government is "...the conduct of conduct..."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault in Burchell, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic definition==
{{original research|date=March 2011}}
In his lectures at the [[Collège de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the "art of government" in a wide sense, i.e. with an idea of "government" that is not limited to state politics alone, that includes a wide range of control techniques, and that applies to a wide variety of objects, from one's control of the self to the "biopolitical" control of populations. In the work of Foucault, this notion is indeed linked to other concepts such as [[biopower|biopolitics]] and [[power-knowledge]]. The [[genealogy|genealogical]] exploration of the modern state as "problem of government" does not only deepen Foucault's analyses on sovereignty and biopolitics; it offers an analytics of government which refines both Foucault's theory of power and his understanding of freedom.&lt;ref name="mallette"&gt;{{cite book|title=La "gouvernementalité" chez Michel Foucault. M. A., Faculté de Philosophie|author=Malette S.|year=2006|publisher=Université Laval - Québec|url=http://www.theses.ulaval.ca/2006/23836/23836.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "governmentality" develops a new understanding of power. Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. He widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. Power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. This leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves.

"Governmentality" applies to a variety of historical periods and to different specific power regimes. However, it is often used (by other scholars and by Foucault himself) in reference to "neoliberal governmentality", i.e. to a type of governmentality that characterizes advanced liberal democracies. In this case, the notion of governmentality refers to societies where power is de-centered and its members play an active role in their own self-government, e.g. as posited in [[neoliberalism]]. Because of its active role, individuals need to be regulated from 'inside'. A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge (''"savoir"'' in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves.

In his lecture titled Governmentality, Foucault gives us a definition of governmentality:
{{quote|
"1. The ensemble formed by the institutions, procedures, analyses and reflections, the calculations and tactics that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its target population, as its principal form of knowledge political economy, and as its essential technical means apparatuses of security.&lt;br /&gt;

2. The tendency which, over a long period and throughout the West, has steadily led towards the pre-eminence over all other forms (sovereignty, discipline, etc) of this type of power which may be termed government, resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs.&lt;br /&gt;

3. The process, or rather the result of the process, through which the state of justice of the Middle Ages, transformed into the administrative state during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, gradually becomes 'governmentalized'."&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"&gt;Burchell, Gordon and Miller, 1991: 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Foucault's explicit definition is rather broad, perhaps further examination of this definition would be useful.

We shall begin with a closer inspection of the first part of Foucault's definition of governmentality:

This strand of the three-part definition states that governmentality is, in other words, all of the components that make up a government that has as its end the maintenance of a well-ordered and happy society (population). The government's means to this end is its "apparatuses of security," that is to say, the techniques it uses to provide this society a feeling of economic, political, and cultural well-being. The government achieves these ends by enacting "political economy," and in this case, the meaning of economy is the older definition of the term, that is to say, "economy at the level of the entire state, which means exercising towards its inhabitants, and the wealth and behavior of each and all, a form of surveillance and control as attentive as that of the head of a family over his household and his goods".&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 92&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we see that this first part of the definition states that governmentality is a government with specific ends, means to these ends, and particular practices that should lead to these ends.

The second part of Foucault's definition (the "resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs"&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"/&gt;) presents governmentality as the long, slow development of Western governments which eventually took over from forms of governance like sovereignty and discipline into what it is today: bureaucracies and the typical methods by which they operate.

The next and last part of Foucault's definition of governmentality can be restated as the evolution from the Medieval state, which maintained its territory and an ordered society within this territory through a blunt practice of simply imposing its laws upon its subjects, to the early [[Renaissance]] state, which became more concerned with the "disposing of things",&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and so began to employ strategies and tactics to maintain a content and thus stable society, or in other words to "render a society governable".&lt;ref&gt;Jones 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if one takes these three definitions together, governmentality may be defined as the process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends ("apparatuses of security"&lt;ref name=B102&gt;Burchell, 102&lt;/ref&gt;), and with a particular type of knowledge ("political economy"&lt;ref name=B102/&gt;), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies.

==History of the term==
The concept of governmentality segues from Foucault's [[ethical]], [[political]] and [[historical]] thoughts from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. His most widely known formulation of this notion is his lecture entitled "Security, territory and population" (1978). A deeper and richer reflection on the notion of governmentality is provided in Foucault's course on "The Birth of Biopolitics" at the [[Collège de France]] in 1978-1979. The course was first published in French in 2004 as ''Naissance de la biopolitique: Cours au Collège de France (1978-1979)'' (Paris: Gallimard &amp; Seuil). This notion is also part of a wider analysis on the topic of disciplinary institutions, on [[neoliberalism]] and the "Rule of Law", the "microphysics of power" and also on what Foucault called [[biopower|biopolitics]]. In the second and third volumes of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', namely, ''The Use of Pleasure'' (1984) and ''The Care of the Self'' (1984), and in his lecture on "Technologies of the Self" (1982), Foucault elaborated a distinction between [[subjectivation]] and forms of subjectification by exploring how selves were fashioned and then lived in ways which were both heteronomously and autonomously determined. Also, in a series of lectures and articles, including "The Birth of Biopolitics" (1979), "''Omnes et Singulatim'': Towards a Criticism of Political Reason" (1979), "The Subject and Power" (1982) and "What is Enlightenment?" (1984), he posed questions about the nature of contemporary [[social order]]s, the conceptualization of power, human freedom and the limits, possibilities and sources of human actions, etc. that were linked to his understanding of the notion of "governmentality".

The notion of governmentality (not to confuse with [[governance]]) gained attention in the English-speaking academic world mainly through the edited book ''The Foucault Effect'' (1991), which contained a series of essays on the notion of governmentality, together with a translation of Foucault's 1978 short text on ''"gouvernementalité"''.

==Further developments of the concept==
Hunt and Wickham, in their work ''Foucault and Law'' [1994] begin the section on governmentality with a very basic definition derived from Foucault's work. They state, "governmentality is the dramatic expansion in the scope of government, featuring an increase in the number and size of the governmental calculation mechanisms" [1994:76]. In other words, governmentality describes the new form of governing that arose in the mid-eighteenth century that was closely allied with the creation and growth of the modern bureaucracies. In giving this definition, Hunt and Wickham conceive of the term as consisting of two parts 'governmental' and '–ity' - governmental meaning pertaining to the government of a country; and the suffix –ity meaning the study of. They acknowledge that this definition lacks some of Foucault's finer nuances and try to redress this by explaining some more of Foucault's ideas, including reason of state, the problem of population, modern political economy, liberal securitisation, and the emergence of the human sciences" [1994:77].

Kerr's approach to the term is more complex. He conceives of the term as an abbreviation of "governmental rationality" [1999:174]. In other words, it is a way of thinking about the government and the practices of the government. To him it is not "a zone of critical-revolutionary study, but one that conceptually reproduces capitalist rule" [1999:197] by asserting that some form of government (and power) will always be necessary to control and constitute society. By defining governmentality only in terms of the state, Kerr fails to take account of other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government in this broader sense.

Dean's understanding of the term incorporates both other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government, as well as Hunt and Wickham's, and Kerr's approaches to the term. In line with Hunt and Wickham's approach, Dean acknowledges that in a very narrow sense, governmentality can be used to describe the emergence of a government that saw that the object of governing power was to optimise, use and foster living individuals as members of a population [1999:19]. He also includes the idea of government rationalities, seeing governmentality as one way of looking at the practices of government. In addition to the above, he sees government as anything to do with conducting oneself or others. This is evident in his description of the word in his glossary: "Governmentality: How we think about governing others and ourselves in a wide variety of contexts..." [1999:212]. This reflects that the term government to Foucault meant not so much the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups [Dean, 1999:12].

Dean's main contribution to the definition of the term, however, comes from the way he breaks the term up into 'govern' 'mentality', or mentalities of governing—mentality being a mental disposition or outlook. This means that the concept of governmentality is not just a tool for thinking about government and governing but also incorporates how and what people who are governed think about the way they are governed. He defines thinking as a "collective activity" [1999:16], that is, the sum of the knowledge, beliefs and opinions held by those who are governed. He also raises the point that a mentality is not usually "examined by those who inhabit it" [1999:16]. This raises the interesting point that those who are governed may not understand the unnaturalness of both the way they live and the fact that they take this way of life for granted—that the same activity in which they engage in "can be regarded as a different form of practice depending on the mentalities that invest it" [1999:17]. Dean highlights another important feature of the concept of governmentality—its reflexivity. He explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''On the one hand, we govern others and ourselves according to what we take to be true about who we are, what aspects of our existence should be worked upon, how, with what means, and to what ends. On the other hand, the ways in which we govern and conduct ourselves give rise to different ways of producing truth. [1999:18]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By drawing attention to the 'how and why', Dean connects "technologies of power" [Lemke, 2001:191] to the concept of governmentality. According to Dean any definition of governmentality should incorporate all of Foucault's intended ideas. A complete definition of the term governmentality must include not only government in terms of the state, but government in terms of any "conduct of conduct" [Dean, 1999:10]. It must incorporate the idea of mentalities and the associations that go with that concept: that it is an attitude towards something, and that it is not usually understood "from within its own perspective" [1999:16], and that these mentalities are collective and part of a society's culture. It must also include an understanding of the ways in which conduct is governed, not just by governments, but also by ourselves and others.

The semantic linking of governing and mentalities in governmentality indicates that it is not possible to study technologies of power without an analysis of the mentality of rule underpinning them. The practice of going to the gym, expounded below, is a useful example because it shows how our choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles have been mobilised and shaped by various technologies of power.

===Mentality of rule===
A mentality of rule is any relatively systematic way of thinking about government. It delineates a discursive field in which the exercise of power is 'rationalised' [Lemke, 2001:191]. Thus Neo-liberalism is a mentality of rule because it represents a method of rationalising the exercise of government, a rationalisation that obeys the internal rule of maximum economy [Foucault, 1997:74]. [[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama]] [in Rose, 1999: 63] writes "a liberal State is ultimately a limited State, with governmental activity strictly bounded by the sphere of individual liberty". However, only a certain type of liberty, a certain way of understanding and exercising freedom is compatible with Neo-liberalism. If Neo-liberalist government is to fully realize its goals, individuals must come to recognize and act upon themselves as both free and responsible [Rose, 1999:68]. Thus Neo-liberalism must work to create the social reality that it proposes already exists. For as Lemke states, a mentality of government "is not pure, neutral knowledge that simply re-presents the governing reality" [Lemke, 2001:191] instead, Neo-liberalism constitutes an attempt to link a reduction in state welfare services and security systems to the increasing call for subjects to become free, enterprising, autonomous individuals. It can then begin to govern its subjects, not through intrusive state bureaucracies backed with legal powers, the imposition of moral standards under a religious mandate, but through structuring the possible field of action in which they govern themselves, to govern them through their freedom. Through the transformation of subjects with duties and obligations, into individuals, with rights and freedoms, modern individuals are not merely 'free to choose' but obliged to be free, "to understand and enact their lives in terms of choice" [Rose, 1999:87]. This freedom is a different freedom to that offered in the past. It is a freedom to realize our potential and our dreams through reshaping the way in which we conduct our lives.

=== From governmentality to neoliberal governmentality: cartography ===

==== Governmentality and cartography ====
Cartographic [[Cartography|mapping]] has historically been a key strategy of governmentality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose-Redwood|first=R.B.|title=Governmentality, Geography, and the Geo-Coded World|journal=Progress in Human Geography.|year=2006|volume=30|issue=4|pages=469–486|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph619oa}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brian Harley|Harley]],&lt;ref name ="Harley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B.|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica |year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], affirms that [[Sovereign state|State]]-produced maps "extend and reinforce the legal statutes, territorial imperatives, and values stemming from the exercise of political power". Typically, State-led mapping conforms to [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s concept of a [[panopticon]], in which 'the one views the many'. From a Foucauldian vantage point, this was the blueprint for disciplinary power.&lt;ref name="Hannah 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannah|first=M.G|title=Governmentality and the Mastery of Territory in Nineteenth-Century America|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neoliberal governmentality and cartography ====
Through processes of [[neoliberalism]], the State has "hollowed out" some of its cartographic responsibilities and delegated power to individuals who are at a lower geographical [[scale (map)|scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=B|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing Out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'People's cartography' is believed to deliver a more democratic spatial [[governance]] than traditional [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] State-distribution of cartographic knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Crampton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping Without a Net|journal=Paper Presented as Part of Virtual Seminar in GIScience and Technology|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus subverting Harley's&lt;ref name=Harley /&gt; theory that mapping is uniquely a source of power for the powerful.

===Self-governing capabilities===
Through our freedom, particular self-governing capabilities can be installed in order to bring our own ways of conducting and evaluating ourselves into alignment with political objectives [Rose, 1996:155]. These capabilities are enterprise and [[autonomy]]. Enterprise here designates an array of rules for the conduct of one's everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility. The enterprising self will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape life in order to become what it wishes to be. The enterprising self is thus both an active self and a calculating self, a self that calculates about itself and that acts upon itself in order to better itself [Rose, 1996:154]. Autonomy is about taking control of our undertakings, defining our goals, and planning to achieve our needs through our own powers [Rose, 1996:159]. The autonomy of the self is thus not the eternal antithesis of [[political power]], but one of the objectives and instruments of modern mentalities for the conduct of conduct [Rose, 1996:155].

These three qualities: freedom, enterprise and autonomy are embodied in the practice of going to the gym. It is our choice to go the gym, our choice which gym to go to. By going to the gym we are working on ourselves, on our body shape and our physical fitness. We are giving ourselves qualities to help us perform better than others in life, whether to attract a better mate than others, or to be able to work more efficiently, more effectively and for longer without running out of steam to give us an advantage over our competitors. When we go to the gym, we go through our own discipline, on our own timetable, to reach our own goals. We design and act out our routine by ourselves. We do not need the ideas or support of a team, it is our self that makes it possible. The practice of going to the gym, of being free, enterprising, autonomous, is imbued with particular technologies of power.

===Technologies of power===
Technologies of power are those "technologies imbued with aspirations for the shaping of conduct in the hope of producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones" [Rose, 1999:52]. The two main groups of technologies of power are technologies of the self, and technologies of the market. Foucault defined technologies of the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality of life. Technologies of the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. These two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time.

====Technologies of the self====
[[Technologies of the self]] refer to the practices and strategies by which individuals represent to themselves their own ethical self-understanding. One of the main features of technologies of self is that of expertise. Expertise has three important aspects. First, its grounding of authority in a claim to scientificity and objectivity creates distance between self-regulation and the state that is necessary with liberal democracies. Second, expertise can "mobilise and be mobilised within political argument in distinctive ways, producing a new relationship between knowledge and government. Expertise comes to be accorded a particular role in the formulation of programs of government and in the technologies that seek to give them effect" [Rose, 1996:156]. Third, expertise operates through a relationship with the self-regulating abilities of individuals. The plausibility inherent in a claim to scientificity binds "subjectivity to truth and subjects to experts" [Rose, 1996:156]. Expertise works through a logic of choice, through a transformation of the ways in which individuals constitute themselves, through "inculcating desires for self-development that expertise itself can guide and through claims to be able to allay the anxieties generated when the actuality of life fails to live up to its image [Rose, 1999:88].

The technologies of the self involved in the practice of, for example, going to the gym are the: technology of responsibilisation, technology of healthism, technology of normalisation and technology of self-esteem.

====Responsibilisation====
In line with its desire to reduce the scope of government (e.g. welfare) Neo-liberalism characteristically develops indirect techniques for leading and controlling individuals without being responsible for them. The main mechanism is through the technology of responsibilisation. This entails subjects becoming responsibilised by making them see social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. not as the responsibility of the state, but actually lying in the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of 'self-care' [Lemke, 2001:201] and of 'consumption'.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of going to the gym can be seen as a result of responsibilisation, our responsibility to remain free of illness so as to be able to work and to care for our dependants (children, elderly parents etc.) This technology somewhat overlaps with the technology of healthism.

====Healthism====
[[Healthism]] links the "public objectives for the good health and good order of the social body with the desire of individuals for health and well-being" [Rose, 1999:74]. Healthy bodies and hygienic homes may still be objectives of the state, but it no longer seeks to discipline, instruct, moralise or threaten us into compliance. Rather "individuals are addressed on the assumption that they want to be healthy and enjoined to freely seek out the ways of living most likely to promote their own health" [Rose, 1999:86-87] such as going to the gym. However while the technology of responsibilisation may be argued to be a calculated technique of the state, the wave of Healthism is less likely to be a consequence of state planning, but arising out of the newer social sciences such as nutrition and human movement. Healthism assigns, as do most technologies of the self, a key role to experts. For it is experts who can tell us how to conduct ourselves in terms of safe, precise techniques to improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall health. The borrowing from technologies of the market by technologies of the self can be clearly seen in the area of healthism. The idea of health, the goal of being healthy, the joys brought by good health and the ways of achieving it are advertised to us in the same manner as goods and services are marketed by sales people. By adhering to the principles of healthism, our personal goals are aligned with political goals and we are thus rendered governable.

====Normalisation====
Another technology of power arising from the social sciences is that of [[Normalization (sociology)|normalisation]]. The technology of norms was given a push by the new methods of measuring population. A norm is that "which is socially worthy, statistically average, scientifically healthy and personally desirable".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; The important aspect of normality, is that while the norm is natural, those who wish to achieve normality will do so by working on themselves, controlling their impulses in everyday conduct and habits, and inculcating norms of conduct into their children, under the guidance of others. Norms are enforced through the calculated administration of [[shame]]. Shame entails an anxiety over the exterior behaviour and appearance of the self, linked to an injunction to care for oneself in the name of achieving quality of life [Rose, 1999:73]. Norms are usually aligned with political goals, thus the norm would be fit, virile, energetic individuals, able to work, earn money, and spend it and thus sustain the economy. For instance, the practice of going to the gym allows one to achieve this 'normality'. Through shame we are governed into conforming with the goals of Neo-liberalism.

====Self-esteem====
[[Self-esteem]] is a practical and productive technology linked to the technology of norms, which produces of certain kinds of selves. Self-esteem is a technology in the sense that it is a specialised knowledge of how to esteem ourselves to estimate, calculate, measure, evaluate, discipline, and to judge our selves.&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:273&lt;/ref&gt; The 'self-esteem' approach considers a wide variety of social problems to have their source in a lack of self-esteem on the part of the persons concerned. 'Self-esteem' thus has much more to do with self-assessment than with self-respect, as the self continuously has to be measured, judged and disciplined in order to gear personal 'empowerment' to collective yardsticks.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2001:202&lt;/ref&gt; These collective yardsticks are determined by the norms previously discussed. Self-esteem is a technology of self for "evaluating and acting upon ourselves so that the police, the guards and the doctors do not have to do so".&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:234&lt;/ref&gt; By taking up the goal of self-esteem, we allow ourselves to be governable from a distance. The technology of self-esteem and other similar psychological technologies also borrow from technologies of the market, namely [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. A huge variety of self-help books, tapes, videos and other paraphernalia are available for purchase by the individual.

====Technologies of the market====
The technologies of the market that underlie the practice of going to the gym can be described as the technology of desire, and the technology of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] through consumption. The technology of desire is a mechanism that induces in us desires that we work to satisfy. Marketers create wants and artificial needs in us through advertising goods, experiences and lifestyles that are tempting to us. These advertisements seek to convey the sense of individual satisfaction brought about by the purchase or use of this product.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:86&lt;/ref&gt; We come to desire these things and thus act in a manner that allows us to achieve these things, whether by working harder and earning more money or by employing technologies of the self to shape our lifestyle to the manner we desire . The borrowing of technologies of the self by technologies of the market extends even further in this case. Marketers use the knowledge created by psyche- discourses, especially psychological characteristics as the basis of their market segmentation. This allows them to appeal more effectively to each individual. Thus we are governed into purchasing commodities through our desire.

The technology of identity through consumption utilises the power of goods to shape identities.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; Each commodity is imbued with a particular meaning, which is reflected upon those who purchase it, illuminating the kind of person they are, or want to be. Consumption is portrayed as placing an individual within a certain form of life. The technology of identity through consumption can be seen in the choices that face the gym attendee. To go to an expensive gym because it demonstrates wealth/success or to go to a moderately priced gym so as to appear economical. The range of gym wear is extensive. Brand name to portray the abilities portrayed in its advertising, expensive to portray commitment, or cheap to portray your unconcern for other people's opinions. All of these choices of consumption are used to communicate our identity to others, and thus we are governed by marketers into choosing those products that identify with our identity.

These technologies of the market and of the self are the particular mechanisms whereby individuals are induced into becoming free, enterprising individuals who govern themselves and thus need only limited direct governance by the state. The implementation of these technologies is greatly assisted by experts from the social sciences. These experts operate a regime of the self, where success in life depends on our continual exercise of freedom, and where our life is understood, not in terms of fate or social status, but in terms of our success or failure in acquiring the skills and making the choices to actualise ourself.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:87&lt;/ref&gt; If we engage in the practice of going to the gym, we are undertaking an exercise in self-government. We do so by drawing upon certain forms of knowledge and expertise provided by gym instructors, health professionals, of the purveyors of the latest fitness fad. Depending on why we go to the gym, we may calculate number of calories burned, heart-rate, or muscle size. In all cases, we attend the gym for a specific set of reasons underpinned by the various technologies of the self and the market. The part of ourselves we seek to work upon, the means by which we do so, and who we hope to become, all vary according to the nature of the technology of power by which we are motivated [Dean, 1999:17]. All of these various reasons and technologies are underpinned by the mentality of government that seeks to transform us into a free, enterprising, autonomous individual: Neo-liberalism.  Furthermore, Neo-liberalism seeks to create and disseminate definitions of freedom, autonomy and what it means to be enterprising that re-create forms of behavior amenable to neo-liberal goals.

===Ecogovernmentality===
[[Ecogovernmentality]] (or eco-governmentality) is the application of Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. Timothy W. Luke theorized this as environmentality and green governmentality. Ecogovernmentality began in the mid-1990s with a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies.

Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[Government agency|government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct "The Environment." This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government's larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

===Crises of Governmentality===
According to Foucault, there are several instances where the Western, "liberal art of government" enters into a period of crisis, where the logic of ensuring freedom (which was defined against the background of [[risk society|risk]] or danger) necessitates actions "which potentially risk producing exactly the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978-9).'' Trans. Graham Burchell. Ed. Michael Senellart. 1st Picador Paperback Edition. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherently contradictory logics that lead to such contradictions are identified by Foucault as:

1. Liberalism depends on the socialization of individuals to fear the constant presence of danger, e.g., public campaigns advocating savings banks, public hygiene, and disease prevention, the development of detective novels as a genre and of news stories of crime, and sexual anxieties surrounding "degeneration."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Liberal freedom requires disciplinary techniques that manage the individual's behaviour and everyday life so as to ensure productivity and the increase in profit through efficient labour, e.g., Bentham's [[Panopticon]] surveillance system. Liberalism claims to supervise the natural mechanisms of behaviour and production, but must intervene when it notices "irregularities."&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Liberalism must force individuals to be free: control and intervention becomes the entire basis of freedom. Freedom must ultimately be manufactured by control rather than simply "counterweighted" by it.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

Examples of this contradictory logic which Foucault cites are the policies of the [[Keynesian]] [[welfare state]] under [[F.D. Roosevelt]], the thought of the German liberals in the [[Freiburg school]], and the thought of American [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economists such as the [[Chicago School of Economics|Chicago School]] which attempt to free individuals from the lack of freedom perceived to exist under socialism and fascism, but did so by using state interventionist models.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

These governmental crises may be triggered by phenomena such as a discursive concern with increasing economic capital costs for the exercise of freedom, e.g., prices for purchasing resources, the need for excessive state coercion and interventionism to protect market freedoms, e.g., anti-trust and anti-monopoly legislation that leads to a "legal strait-jacket" for the state,&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; local protests rejecting the disciplinary mechanisms of the market society and state.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"/&gt; and finally, the destructive and wasteful effects of ineffective mechanisms for producing freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research by [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and colleagues at the [[University of Oxford]] has renewed interest in Foucault's exploration of potential resistance to governmentality, and its application to health care, drawing on Foucault's recently published final lectures at the College de France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The courage of truth (the government of self and others II) : lectures at the Collège de France, 1983-1984|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK|isbn=9781403986689 |author2=Ewald, François |author3=Burchell, Alessandro Fontana |editor=Arnold I.

===Beyond the West===
Jeffreys and Sigley (2009)  highlight that governmentality studies have focused on advanced liberal democracies, and preclude considerations of non-liberal forms of governmentality in both western and non-western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. &amp; Sigley, G. 2009, 'Governmentality, governance and China' in Elaine Jeffreys (eds), China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York, USA, pp. 1-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have broken new ground by applying Foucault's concept of governmentality to non-western and non-liberal settings, such as China. Jeffreys (2009) for example provides a collection of essay on China's approach to governance, development, education, the environment, community, religion, and sexual health where the notion of 'Chinese governmentally' is based not on the notion of 'freedom and liberty' as in the western tradition but rather, on a distinct rational approach to planning and administration.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. 2009, China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-415-54744-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such new studies thus use Foucault's Governmentalities to outline the nature of shifts in governance and contribute to emerging studies of governmentality in non-western contexts.

[[File:Regular_hexagon_as_intersection_of_two_triangles.png|thumb|A regular ''hexagram'', [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Two_dimensional_compounds|{6}[2{3}]{6}]], can be seen as a [[compound polygon|compound]] composed of an upwards (blue here) and downwards (pink) facing [[equilateral triangle]], with their intersection as a regular [[hexagon]] (in green).]]
A '''hexagram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]) or '''sexagram''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]) is a six-pointed geometric [[star figure]] with the [[Schläfli symbol]] {6/2}, 2{3}, or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Since there are no true regular continuous hexagrams, the term is instead used to refer to the compound figure of two [[equilateral triangle]]s shown to the right. The intersection is a regular [[hexagon]].

The hexagram is part of an infinite series of shapes which are compounds of two n-dimensional [[simplex|simplices]]. In three dimensions, [[Compound of two tetrahedra|the analogous compound]] is the [[stellated octahedron]], and in four dimensions the [[compound of two 5-cells]] is obtained.

It has been historically used in religious and cultural contexts and as decorative motifs; for example by medieval [[Muslims]], especially [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] dynasties,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Delhi: Adventures in a Megacity]]'' (PB) - Page 91, Sam Miller, Sam - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[Judaism]] and [[occultism]]. The symbol was used merely as a decorative motif in medieval Christian churches many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue.{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=244|ps=:"It is not to be found at all in medieval synagogues or on medieval ceremonial objects, although it has been found in quite a number of medieval Christian churches again, not as a Christian symbol but only as a decorative motif. The appearance of the symbol in Christian churches long before its appearance in our synagogues should warn the overzealous interpreters. "}} It was first used as a religious symbol by Arabs in the medieval period, known as the [[Seal of Solomon]], depicted as either a hexagram or [[pentagram]], and which was later adopted by Jewish [[Kabbalists]].{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=246|ps=:"In the beginning these designs had no special names or terms, and it is only in the Middle Ages that definite names began to be given to some of those most widely used. There is very little doubt that terms like these first became popular among the Arabs, who showed a tremendous interest in all the occult sciences, arranging and ordering them systematically long before the Practical Cabalists thought of doing so.{{pb}}It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that for a long time both the five-pointed and the six-pointed stars were called by one name, the "Seal of Solomon," and that no distinction was made between them. This name is obviously related to the Jewish legend of Solomon's dominion over the spirits, and of his ring with the Ineffable Name engraved on it. These legends expanded and proliferated in a marked fashion during the Middle Ages, among Jews and Arabs alike, but the name, "Seal of Solomon," apparently originated with the Arabs."}}&lt;ref&gt;Leonora Leet, "The Hexagram and Hebraic Sacred Science" in :''The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah'', 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=61hpoogearsC&amp;pg=PA212 pp. 212-217].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group theory==
In [[mathematics]], the [[root system]] for the simple [[Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is in the form of a hexagram, with six long roots and six short roots.&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Root system G2.svg|250px]]

== Construction by compass and a straight edge ==
A six-pointed star, like a [[regular hexagon]], can be created using a compass and a straight edge:
*Make a circle of any size with the compass.
*Without changing the radius of the compass, set its pivot on the circle's circumference, and find one of the two points where a new circle would intersect the first circle.
*With the pivot on the last point found, similarly find a third point on the circumference, and repeat until six such points have been marked.
*With a straight edge, join alternate points on the circumference to form two overlapping equilateral triangles.

== Construction by linear algebra ==
[[File:Hexagram-cube.png|thumb]]
A regular hexagram can be constructed by [[orthographic projection|orthographically projecting]] any [[cube]] onto a plane through three vertices that are all adjacent to the same vertex.  The twelve midpoints to edges of the cube form a hexagram.  For example, consider the projection of the unit cube with vertices at the eight possible binary vectors in three dimensions &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt; onto the plane &lt;math&gt;x+y+z=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The midpoints are &lt;math&gt;(0,0,1/2),(0,1/2,1/2),(0,1,1/2),(1,1,1/2)&lt;/math&gt;, and all points resulting from these by applying a permutation to their entries.  These 12 points project to a hexagram: six vertices around the outer hexagon and six on the inner.

==Origins and shape==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
It is possible that as a simple geometric shape, like for example the triangle, circle, or square, the hexagram has been created by various peoples with no connection to one another.

The hexagram is a [[mandala]] symbol called ''satkona yantra'' or ''sadkona yantra'' found on ancient South [[India]]n [[Hindu]] temples. It symbolizes the [[nara-narayana]], or perfect [[meditative]] state of balance achieved between Man and God, and if maintained, results in "[[moksha]]," or "[[nirvana]]" (release from the bounds of the earthly world and its material trappings).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some researchers have theorized that the hexagram represents the [[astrological]] chart at the time of David's birth or [[anointment]] as king. The hexagram is also known as the "King's Star" in astrological circles.

In antique [[papyri]], [[pentagram]]s, together with stars and other signs, are frequently found on [[amulet]]s bearing the Jewish names of [[God]], and used to guard against fever and other diseases. Curiously the hexagram is not found among these signs. In the [[Greek Magical Papyri]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (Wessely, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;31, 112) at Paris and London there are 22 signs side by side, and a circle with twelve signs, but neither a pentagram nor a hexagram.

==Usage in Dharmic religions==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Jain Cosmology0007small.JPG|thumb|Diagram showing the two mystic syllables Om and Hrim]]
Six-pointed stars have also been found in cosmological diagrams in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. The reasons behind this symbol's common appearance in Indic religions and the West are unknown. One possibility is that they have a common origin. The other possibility is that artists and religious people from several cultures independently created the hexagram shape, which is a relatively simple geometric design.

Within Indic lore, the shape is generally understood to consist of two triangles—one pointed up and the other down—locked in harmonious embrace. The two components are called "Om" and the "Hrim" in Sanskrit, and symbolize man's position between earth and sky. The downward triangle symbolizes [[Shakti]], the sacred embodiment of femininity, and the upward triangle symbolizes [[Shiva]], or [[Agni Tattva]], representing the focused aspects of masculinity. The mystical union of the two triangles represents Creation, occurring through the divine union of male and female. The two locked triangles are also known as 'Shanmukha'—the six-faced, representing the six faces of Shiva &amp; Shakti's progeny [[Kartikeya]]. This symbol is also a part of several yantras and has deep significance in Hindu ritual worship and history.

In [[Buddhism]], some old versions of the [[Bardo Thodol]], also known as The "Tibetan Book of the Dead", contain a hexagram with a [[Swastika]] inside. It was made up by the publishers for this particular publication. In Tibetan, it is called the "origin of phenomenon" (chos-kyi 'byung-gnas). It is especially connected with [[Vajrayogini]], and forms the center part of Her [[mandala]]. In reality, it is in three dimensions, not two, although it may be portrayed either way.

The [[Shatkona]] is a symbol used in [[Hindu]] [[yantra]] that represents the union of both the [[male]] and [[Female|feminine]] form. More specifically it is supposed to represent [[Purusha]] (the supreme being), and [[Prakriti]] (mother nature, or causal matter). Often this is represented as [[Shiva]] - [[Shakti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sivasakti.com/articles/intro-yantra.html sivasakti.com: ''Iintroduction to Yantra'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shatkona is a hexagram and looks exactly like the [[Star of David]].

===Anahata: The Heart Chakra===
{| border="0"
|width=170 valign=top|[[File:Anahata Mandala.svg|center|170px]]
|valign=top|'''[[Anahata]]''' (also known as '''Anahata-puri''', or '''Padma-sundara''') is symbolized by a lotus flower with twelve petals. (See also [[bodhicitta|heartmind]]). Anahata is related to the colors green or pink. Key issues involving Anahata involve complex emotions, compassion, tenderness, unconditional love, equilibrium, rejection and well-being. Physically Anahata governs circulation, emotionally it governs unconditional love for the self and others, mentally it governs passion, and spiritually it governs devotion.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|}
In the [[endocrine system]], [[Anahata]] is associated with the [[thymus]] gland, located in the chest. This gland produces [[T-cells]], that combat disease, and bring equilibrium to the body. The functioning of the [[thymus]] is greatest before [[puberty]] and is impaired by the appearance of [[sex hormones]] in the blood stream from [[puberty]] onwards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Usage by the Abrahamic religions==

===Usage by Jews===
{{Main|Star of David}}
[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]
The ''Magen David'' is a generally recognized symbol of Judaism and Jewish identity and is also known colloquially as the Jewish Star or "Star of David." Its usage as a sign of Jewish identity began in the Middle Ages, though its religious usage began earlier, with the current earliest archeological evidence being a stone bearing the shield from the arch of a 3–4th century synagogue in the Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;"King Solomon's Seal", ''MFA'', [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/King%20Solomon-s%20Seal King Solomon-s Seal].&lt;/ref&gt; A more enduring symbol of Judaism, the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], has been in use since about 1300 BC according to the [[Torah]] {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:31-40|HE}}.

===Usage by Christians===
The hexagram may be found in some Churches and stained-glass windows. In Christianity it is sometimes called the star of creation.  A very early example, noted by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], can be found in [[Winchester Cathedral]], England in one of the canopies of the choir stalls, circa 1308.&lt;ref&gt;Buildings of England: Hampshire and the North (now second edition) {{ISBN|978 0 300 12084 4}}, p.604. &lt;/ref&gt;

In Balkan countries, hexagrams can be found more often in Orthodox Christian churches than in Roman Catholic churches.  
 
====Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====
[[File:Salt Lake Assembly Hall Star of David.jpg|thumb|Star of David on the [[Salt Lake Assembly Hall]]]]
{{Main|Mormonism and Judaism}}
The Star of David is also used less prominently by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]] and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.

====Rastafari====
A black star of David is used to identify the black population, in Africa or otherwise, with one of the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Due to the culture of Rastafari emerging out of the Judeo-Christian Ethiopian history, dating back to Solomonic dynastic rule, the star of David, or the Seal of Solomon is a prevalent symbol amongst its adherents. Rastafari has adherents from every race across the globe, rooted in Christian doctrine, it is not an African or bloodline doctrine.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The symbol is known in Arabic as ''Khātem Sulaymān'' ([[Seal of Solomon]]; {{lang|ar|خاتم سليمان}}) or ''Najmat Dāwūd'' ([[Star of David]]; {{lang|ar|نجمة داوود}}). The "Seal of Solomon" may also be represented by a five-pointed star or [[pentagram]].

In the [[Qur'an]], it is written that David and [[King Solomon]] (Arabic, ''Suliman'' or ''Sulayman'') were prophets and kings, and are figures revered by Muslims. The Medieval pre-Ottoman [[Hanafi]] [[Anatolian beyliks]] of the [[Karamanids]] and [[Jandarids]] used the star on their flag.&lt;ref name="Muwahhidists"&gt;The Muslim Empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, By Stephen F. Dale, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol also used on [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] flag. Today the six-pointed star can be found in [[mosques]] and on other [[Arabic Art|Arabic]] and [[Islamic art]]ifacts.

Professor [[Gershom Sholem|Gershom Scholem]] theorizes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-curious-history-of-the-six-pointed-starhow-the-magen-david-became-the-jewish-symbol/|title=The Curious History of the Six-Pointed Star:How the “Magen David” Became the Jewish Symbol - Commentary Magazine|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the "Star of David" originates in the writings of [[Aristotle]], who used triangles in different positions to indicate the different basic elements. The superposed triangles thus represented combinations of those elements. From Aristotle's writings those symbols made their ways into early, pre-Muslim Arab literature.

==Usage in heraldry==
In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], a hexagram is a fairly common charge employed, though it is rarely called by this name. In Germanic regions it is known simply as a "star." In English and French heraldry, however, the hexagram is known as a "mullet of six points," where ''mullet'' is a French term for a [[spur|spur rowel]] which is shown with five pointed arms by default unless otherwise specified. In [[Albania]]n heraldry and vexillology, hexagram has been used since [[classical antiquity]] and it is commonly referred to as ''sixagram''. [[:File:Coa Kastrioti Family.svg|Coa Kastrioti Family]] of the [[House of Kastrioti]] depicts the hexagram on a '''[[pile (heraldry)|pile]]''' argent over the double headed eagle. A hexagram also appears on the '''Dardania''' Flag, proposed for [[Kosovo]] by the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]].

==Usage in theosophy==
The Star of David is used in the seal and the emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]] (founded in 1875). Although it is more pronounced, it is used along with other religious symbols. These include the [[Swastika]], the [[Ankh]], the [[Om|Aum]], and the [[Ouroboros]]. The star of David is also known as the Seal of Solomon that was its original name until around 50 years ago.

==Usage in occultism==
The hexagram, like the [[pentagram]], was and is used in practices of the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]] and is attributed to the 7 "old" planets outlined in [[astrology]].

The six-pointed star is commonly used both as a [[talisman]]&lt;ref&gt;P299 (and throughout) of ''The Complete Goldendawn'' by Israel Regardie. {{ISBN|978-0875426631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for conjuring spirits and spiritual forces in diverse forms of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult magic]]. In the book [[The History and Practice of Magic, Vol. 2]], the six-pointed star is called the talisman of Saturn and it is also referred to as the Seal of Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;"The History and Practice of Magic" (Secaucus, NJ: University Books, published by arrangement with Lyle Stewart, 1979), Vol. II, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Details are given in this book on how to make these symbols and the materials to use.
[[File:Star of David GGNC grave marker engraving.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Double hexagram.]]
Traditionally, the Hexagram can be seen as the combination of the four elements. Fire is symbolized as an upwards pointing triangle, while Air (its elemental opposite) is also an upwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Water is symbolized as a downwards pointing triangle, while Earth (its elemental opposite) is also a downwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. When you combine the symbols of Fire and Water, a hexagram (six-pointed star) is created. The same follows for when you combine the symbols of Air and Earth.  When you combine both hexagrams, you get the double-hexagram. Thus, a combination of the elements is created.&lt;ref&gt;P315-316 of ''The Wicca Bible'' by Ann-Marie Gallagher. {{ISBN|978-1-84181-250-2}}. Same information also found in many other books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] Magic, the seven Traditional Planets correspond with the angles and the center of the Hexagram as follows, in the same patterns as they appear on the [[Sephiroth]] and on the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. Saturn, although formally attributed to the Sephira of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]], within this frame work nonetheless occupies the position of [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Daath]].&lt;ref&gt;P31 of ''The Ritual Magic Manual: A Complete Course in Practical Magic'' by David Griffin. {{ISBN|978-0965840897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Freemasonry==
{{quote|"The interlacing triangles or deltas symbolize the union of the two principles or forces, the active and passive, male and female, pervading the universe ... The two triangles, one white and the other black, interlacing, typify the mingling of apparent opposites in nature, darkness and light, error and truth, ignorance and wisdom, evil and good, throughout human life." –&amp;nbsp;Albert G. Mackey: ''Encyclopedia of [[Freemason]]ry''}}

The hexagram is featured within and on the outside of many [[Masonic temple]]s as a decoration. It may have been found within the structures of [[King Solomon]]'s temple, from which [[Freemasons]] are inspired in their philosophies and studies. Like many other symbols in Freemasonry, the deciphering of the hexagram is non-dogmatic and left to the interpretation of the individual.

==Other uses==
[[File:Aerial photograph of Heathrow Airport, 1955.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Aerial photograph of [[Heathrow Airport]], London, 1955]]

* A six-point interlocking triangles has been used for thousands of years as an indication a sword was made, and "proved," in the [[Damascus]] area of the [[Middle East]]. Still today, it is a required "proved" mark on all official [[UK]] and [[United States]] [[military]] [[sword]]s though the [[blade]]s themselves no longer come from the [[Middle East]].

* The [[Ulster Banner]] flag of Northern Ireland, used from 1953-1972. The six pointed star, representing the six counties that make up Northern Ireland. The star of the Ulster Banner is not the compound of two equilateral triangles. The intersection is not a regular hexagon.
* A Flag used by rebels during the [[Whiskey_Rebellion|Whiskey Insurrection]] in South-Western Pennsylvania, 1794.
* In [[Unicode]], the "Star of David" symbol ✡ is U+2721.
* There is a plant named Solomon's seal (''[[Polygonatum]] multiflorum'') in the [[lily]] family.
* In [[alchemy]], the two triangles represent the reconciliation of the opposites of fire and water. Non-Jewish Kabbalah (also called Christian or Hermetic Kabbalah) interprets{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} the hexagram to mean the divine union of male and female energy, where the male is represented by the upper triangle and the female by the lower one. Moreover, it derives four triangular symbols from it (two triangles crossed like a capital letter A and two uncrossed) to represent the four elements: water, fire, air, and earth. This use of the symbol was used as an important plot point in [[Dan Brown]]'s popular novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and [[Da Vinci Code (film)|the ''Da Vinci Code'' film]] cites this as the origin of the star.
* It was also used as a sign for [[Aether (classical element)#Fifth element|quintessence]], the fifth element.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* In southern Germany the hexagram can be found as part of tavern anchors. It is symbol for the tapping of beer and sign of the brewer's guild. In German this is called "Bierstern" (beer star) or "[[:de:Brauerstern|Brauerstern]]" (brewer's star).
* A six-point star is used as an identifying mark of the [[Folk Nation]].
* The main runways and taxiways of [[Heathrow Airport]] were arranged roughly in the shape of a hexagram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44490000/gif/_44490901_heathrow_man_4165.gif bbc.co.uk] and see [[:File:Aerial photograph of Heathrow Airport, 1955.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, every year at Christmastime the residents of El Tejar erect a giant fake Christmas tree in front of their municipal building, with a hexagram sitting at its peak.
* The Indian sage and seer [[Sri Aurobindo]] used it—e.g. on the cover of his books—as a symbol of the aspiration of humanity calling to the Divine to descend into life (the triangle with the point at the top), and the descent of the Divine into the earth's atmosphere and all individuals in response to that calling (the triangle with the point at the bottom). (This was explained by the Mother, his spiritual partner in Her 14-volume Agenda and elsewhere by Sri Aurobindo in his writings.){{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* A strange storm on the north pole of Saturn appears to be roughly in the shape of a hexagram.

'''Common User Access''' ('''CUA''') is a standard for [[user interface]]s to [[operating system]]s and [[computer program]]s. It was developed by [[IBM]] and first published in 1987 as part of their [[Systems Application Architecture]]. Used originally in the [[MVS/ESA]], [[VM/CMS]], [[IBM i|OS/400]], [[OS/2]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems, parts of the CUA standard are now implemented in programs for other operating systems, including variants of [[Unix]]. It is also used by [[Java (software platform)|Java]] [[Abstract Window Toolkit|AWT]] and [[Swing (Java)|Swing]].

== Motivations and inspirations ==
IBM wanted a standard way to interact with [[text-based user interface]] software, whether the screen was a [[dumb terminal]] connected to a mainframe or a [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] with [[Video Graphics Array|VGA graphics]].{{r|alsop19880118}} CUA was a detailed specification and set strict rules about how applications should look and function. Its aim was in part to bring about harmony among [[DOS]] applications, which until then had independently implemented different user interfaces.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

Examples:
* In [[WordPerfect]], the command to open a file was {{keypress|F7}}, {{keypress|3}}.
* In [[Lotus 1-2-3]], a file was opened with {{keypress|/}} (to open the menus), {{keypress|F}} (for File), {{keypress|R}} (for Retrieve).
* In [[Microsoft Word]], a file was opened with {{keypress|Esc}} (to open the menus), {{keypress|T}} (for Transfer), {{keypress|L}} (for Load).
* In [[WordStar]], it was {{keypress|D}}.
* In [[emacs]], a file is opened with {{keypress|Ctrl}}+{{keypress|x}} followed by {{keypress|Ctrl}}+{{keypress|f}} (for find-file).

{{keypress|F1}} was often the [[help key]] (such as [[Volkswriter]] (1982)&lt;ref name="shuford198305"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-05/1983_05_BYTE_08-05_The_Electronic_Office#page/n181/mode/2up | title=Word Tools for the IBM Personal Computer | work=BYTE | date=May 1983 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Shuford, Richard S. | pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but in WordPerfect, help was on {{keypress|F3}} instead. Some programs used {{keypress|Esc}} to cancel an action, while some used it to complete one; WordPerfect used it to repeat a character. Some programs used {{keypress|End}} to go to the end of a line, while some used it to complete filling in a form. {{keypress|Ins}} sometimes toggled between overtype and inserting characters, but some programs used it for "paste".

Thus every program had to be learned individually and its complete user interface memorised. It was a sign of expertise to have learned the UIs of dozens of applications, since a novice user facing a new program would find their existing knowledge of a similar application either of no use or actively a hindrance to understanding as learned behavior might need to be unlearned for the new application.

The detailed CUA specification, published in December 1987, is 328 pages long. It has similarities to [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s detailed [[human interface guidelines]] (139 pages).&lt;ref name="alsop19880118"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alsop |first=Stewart II |date=1988-01-18 |title=Microsoft Windows: Eclectism in UI |url=http://vintagecomputer.net/cisc367/PC-Letter_19880118.pdf |journal=P.C. Letter |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Apple HIG is a detailed book specifying how software for the 1984 [[Apple Macintosh]] computer should look and function.{{cn|date=October 2012}}  When it was first written, the Mac was new, and [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) software was a novelty, so Apple took great pains to ensure that programs would conform to a single shared look and feel.{{cn|date=March 2014}} CUA had a similar aim, but it faced the more difficult task of trying to impose this retroactively on an existing, thriving but chaotic industry, with the much more ambitious goal of unifying all UI, from personal computers to minicomputers to mainframes; and supporting both character and GUI modes, and both batch and interactive designs. By comparison, the Apple HIG only supported interactive GUI on a standalone personal computer. CUA also attempted to be a more measurable standard than the Apple HIG and had large sections formatted as checklists to measure compliance.

== Description ==

The CUA contains standards for the operation of elements such as [[dialog box]]es, [[menu (computing)|menus]] and [[keyboard shortcut]]s that have become so influential that they are implemented today by many programmers who have never read the CUA.

Some of these standards can be seen in the operation of Windows itself and DOS-based applications like the MS-DOS 5 full-screen [[text editor]] [[MS-DOS Editor|edit.com]]. CUA hallmarks include:
* All operations can be done with either the [[computer mouse|mouse]] or the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]];
* If applicable to the page/screen in question {{keypress|F5}} provides a refresh function; 
* Menus are activated/deactivated with the {{keypress|F10}} key;
* Menus are opened by pressing the {{keypress|Alt}} key plus the underlined letter of the menu name;
* Menu commands that require parameters to proceed are suffixed with an [[ellipsis]] ("…");
* Options are requested using secondary windows (often called dialog boxes);
* Options are divided into sections using notebook tabs;
* Navigation within fields in dialog boxes is by cursor key; navigation between fields is by pressing the {{keypress|Tab}} key; {{keypress|Shift}}+{{keypress|Tab}} moves backwards;
* Dialog boxes have a 'Cancel' button, activated by pressing the {{keypress|Esc}} key, which discards changes, and an 'OK' button, activated by pressing {{keypress|Return}}, which accepts changes;
* Applications have [[online help]] accessed by a Help menu, which is the last option on the menu bar; context sensitive help can be summoned by {{keypress|F1}};
* The first menu is to be called 'File' and contains operations for handling files (new, open, save, save as) as well as quitting the program; the next menu 'Edit' has commands for undo, redo, cut, copy, delete, paste commands;
* The [[Cut, copy, and paste|Cut]] command is {{keypress|Shift}}+{{keypress|Del}}; [[Cut, copy, and paste|Copy]] is {{keypress|Ctrl}}+{{keypress|Ins}}; [[Cut, copy, and paste|Paste]] is {{keypress|Shift}}+{{keypress|Ins}};
* The size of a window can be changed by dragging one of the 8 segments of the border.

CUA not only covers DOS applications, but is also the basis for the Windows Consistent User Interface standard (CUI), as well as that for OS/2 applications — both text-mode and the [[Presentation Manager]] GUI — and IBM mainframes which conform to the [[Systems Application Architecture]].

CUA was more than just an attempt to rationalise DOS applications — it was part of a larger scheme to bring together, rationalise and harmonise the overall functions of software and hardware across IBM's entire computing range from microcomputers to mainframes. This is perhaps partly why it was not completely successful.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The third edition of CUA took a radical departure from the first two by introducing the [[object-oriented]] [[Workplace Shell|workplace]]. This changed the emphasis of the user's interactions to be the data (documents, pictures, and so on) that the user worked on. The emphasis on applications was removed with the intention of making the computer easier to use by matching users' expectations that they would work on documents using programs (rather than operating programs to work on documents). (See also [[object-oriented user interface]].)

== Influence ==

CUA strongly influenced the early [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system during the period of joint IBM and Microsoft cooperation on OS/2 Presentation Manager. But later releases of IBM's CUA documents were not used for Microsoft products, and so CUA became less significant in the Windows environment. For instance, the [[Start menu]] was introduced. Most of the standard keystrokes and basic GUI widgets specified by the CUA remain available in Windows.

CUA never had significant impact on the design of [[Unix]] terminal (character-mode) applications, which preceded CUA by more than a decade.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, all major Unix GUI environments/toolkits, whether or not based on the [[X Window System]], have featured varying levels of CUA compatibility, with Motif/[[Common Desktop Environment|CDE]] explicitly featuring it as a design goal.  The current major environments, [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]], also feature extensive CUA compatibility. The subset of CUA implemented in [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Motif (software)|OSF/Motif]] is generally considered a [[de facto standard]] to be followed by any new Unix GUI environment.

'''Institute of Chemical Technology''' ('''ICT'''), formerly the '''University Department of Chemical Technology''' ('''UDCT'''), is a [[chemical technology]] research university located in [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. The institute also has campuses at Jalna, Marathwada and Bhubaneshwar (in collaboration with IndianOil Corporation and IIT Kharagpur)  It is focused on training and research in various branches of [[chemical engineering]], [[chemical technology]], and [[pharmacy]]. It was established in 1933 and was granted [[deemed university]] status in 2008, making it the only state-funded deemed university in India.&lt;ref name="ictmumbai.edu.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ictmumbai.edu.in|title=ICT Mumbai|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 12th February 2018 it was given status of Category 1 institute with graded autonomy by MHRD and UGC. It is also an institute with a special status as mentioned in SECTION IV of the Report of the Empowered Expert Committee in 2018.

==History==
The ICT was founded in 1933 as a University Department of Chemical Technology (UDCT) of the [[University of Mumbai]]. Robert Forster was first Head of the Department (1933–38), followed by [[K. Venkataraman]], who continued its development. It was considerably improved under the guidance of [[Man Mohan Sharma]]. The university conferred the autonomous status on the UDCT in 1994, with concurrence from the [[Maharashtra]] State Government and the UGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ictmumbai.edu.in/DisplayPage.aspx?page=c&amp;ItemID=2|title=ICT Mumbai|website=www.ictmumbai.edu.in|access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UDCT was renamed as the Mumbai University Institute of Chemical Technology (Autonomous) (MUICT) on 26 January 2002. In June 2004, in accordance with the Technical Education Quality Improvement Program (TEQIP) of the Government of India, under which the institute was selected as a Lead Institution, the Government of Maharashtra granted complete autonomy to the institute. On 12 September 2008, it was granted the [[deemed university]] status and renamed as the Institute of Chemical Technology.&lt;ref name="ictmumbai.edu.in" /&gt;

Institute of Chemical Technology was the first institute to be granted the elite badge by the government of the state of Maharashtra. This status put the institute on a par with other reputable schools such as the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]], [[Indian Institute of Science]] and the [[Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research]]. It also makes the institute, which has plans to set up a satellite campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_matunga-college-plans-expansion_1504181 |title=Matunga college plans expansion - Mumbai - DNA |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date= |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; eligible for various special grants from the union and the state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TNN |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-21/news/31378492_1_ict-phds-indian-institutes |title=Institute of Chemical Technology becomes 1st institute to get state's elite badge - Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=21 April 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:UDCT Wadala.jpg|thumb|left|The facade of the main building of the Institute]]
ICT is located on a {{convert|16|acre|m2}} campus at {{Coord|19.024|N|72.859|E|display=inline,title}}. The academic building faces Nathalal Parekh Marg and has a beautiful architecture with fine dressed stone.

The '''International POPs Elimination Network''' ('''IPEN''') is a global network of [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s dedicated to the common aim of eliminating [[persistent organic pollutants]].

IPEN is composed of public interest non-governmental organizations who support a common platform for the global elimination of POPs. The Participating Organizations (POs) of IPEN are those NGOs which have endorsed the POPs Elimination Platform and/or the Stockholm Declaration. Because the network is primarily engaged in facilitating information exchange and in supporting activities of its constituents, and because the purpose of the network does not include developing network-wide-policy statements, strategies, or action plans, a formal decision-making process for the network can be simple, flexible, and largely administrative in nature. (IPEN 2005)

The International POPs Elimination Network (IPEN) is a global network of more than 600 public interest non-governmental organizations working together for the elimination of persistent organic pollutants, on an expedited yet socially equitable basis. This mission includes achieving a world in which all chemicals are produced and used in ways that eliminate significant adverse effects on human health and the environment, and where persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and chemicals of equivalent concern no longer pollute our local and global environments, and no longer contaminate our communities, our food, our bodies, or the bodies of our children and future generations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9879">[[File:International Research Center for Japanese Studies.jpg|thumb|300px|Building of Nichibunken]]
The {{nihongo|'''International Research Center for Japanese Studies'''|国際日本文化研究センター|Kokusai Nihon Bunka Kenkyū Sentā}}, or '''Nichibunken''' (日文研), is an inter-university research institute in [[Kyoto]].  Along with the [[National Institute of Japanese Literature]], the [[National Museum of Japanese History]], and the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Japan)|National Museum of Ethnology]], it is one of the [[National Institutes for the Humanities]].  The center is devoted to research related to [[Japanese culture]].

==History of the Center==
The official origins of the institute are traced to an early study carried out by the [[Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture]] in 1982 on "methods of comprehensive research on Japanese culture".  After surveying the field of Japanese studies for several years, the ministry, under the administration of Prime Minister [[Nakasone Yasuhiro]], established the International Research Center for Japanese Studies in 1987 in [[Kyoto]] with the prominent philosopher [[Umehara Takeshi]] as its first Director-General.  Prominent Kyoto academics [[Umesao Nobuo]] and [[Kuwabara Takeo]] also played key roles in the founding of the center. 

In 1990 the center moved to its current site in Oeyama-chō, Nishikyō-ku.  In 1995 [[Kawai Hayao]], a [[Jungian]] analyst of Japanese psychology and religion, was inaugurated as the second director-general of Nichibunken.  In 2001, [[Yamaori Tetsuo]], professor of Japanese religion and folklore, became the center's third director-general.  The current director-general, [[Motoko Katakura|Katakura Motoko]], was inaugurated in 2005.  She is Nichibunken's first female director-general and, as a cultural-anthropologist who specializes in Middle-Eastern Studies, she is also the center's first director-general who is not a Japan specialist.

==Criticisms of the Center==
Nichibunken was established against the backdrop of an increasing trade surplus with the United States in the 1980s.  One of the ostensible impulses behind the founding of the center was a desire to change overseas perceptions of Japan that viewed the country as a faceless economic power.  The cultural-anthropologist [[Ueno Chizuko]] sharply criticized the center as a calculated attempt at national branding.  Ueno claimed that, despite the center's academic pretensions, the real purpose of Nichibunken was to improve the image of Japan in order to prevent criticism of Japanese trading practices and improve sales of Japanese goods abroad.  [[Ian Buruma]] caused considerable outrage at the time for arguing in influential newspapers abroad that the establishment of the Center was part of a project designed to revamp the kind of nationalist ideology current in pre-war Japan. The center has also been criticized for promoting theories of Japanese particularism. 

The appointment of [[Katakura Motoko]] as Nichibunken's fourth director-general may be seen as an attempt by the center to revamp its conservative image and distance itself from associations with theories of Japanese particularism.  Katakura, a specialist in the anthropology of the Middle-East, is a relative outsider to the field of Japanese studies.

==The Nichibunken Library==
A library of Japanese Studies is attached to the center.  The collection primarily consists of books and bibliographic materials pertinent to the academic study of Japan.  As of 2014, the library contains approximately 400,000 volumes of books in Japanese and 97,000 volumes in other languages.  It also houses approximately 4,400 Japanese periodicals and about 1,000 foreign language periodicals. The library has also a significant storage of media materials in form of records, video and other digital forms.

==Publications==
Nichibunken publishes two periodicals in the field of Japanese studies: Japan Review in English and Nihon Kenkyū (in Japanese). Japan Review is a peer-reviewed journal available on JSTOR and on the Nichibunken website. Japan Review, which is published annually, accepts outstanding essays on Japanese culture from scholars across the globe, as well as research notes. It carries reviews of important books on Japanese studies. Japan Review also publishes Special Issues, the first of which was published in 2013 as "Shunga: Sex and Humor in Japanese Art and Literature." The bi-annual Nihon Kenkyū is also peer reviewed and invites contributions from scholars everywhere.

'''La plume de ma tante''' ({{lang-fr|"my aunt's quill"}}) is a phrase in popular culture, attributed to elementary French language instruction (possibly as early as the 19th century&lt;ref name="TeschnerEvans2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard V. Teschner|author2=Eston Earl Evans|title=Analyzing the Grammar of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fij1OwTBS4EC&amp;pg=RA2-PA9|accessdate=30 October 2012|date=15 May 2007|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=978-1-58901-166-3|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and used as an example of grammatically correct phrases with limited practical application that are sometimes taught in introductory foreign language texts. As [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] said in 1958, "As every student knows, the most idiotically useless phrase in a beginner's French textbook is ''la plume de ma tante'' (the pen of my aunt)."&lt;ref name="Inc1958"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Frisky French Fun on Broadway|journal=Life|date=8 December 1958|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is also used to refer to something deemed completely irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Beeby-Lonsdale1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allison Beeby-Lonsdale|title=Teaching Translation from Spanish to English: Worlds Beyond Words|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qW2kiADQhHQC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=30 October 2012|date=1 January 1996|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|isbn=978-0-7766-0399-5|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term lent its name to the musical play ''[[La Plume de Ma Tante]]'', which won a [[Tony Award]] in 1959.

The phrase is also used in teaching and remembering the sounds of the French vowel ''a''; '''La plume de ma tante''' contains three instances of ''a'' that use two different pronunciations. Other limited-use phrases used as pronunciation guides include: '''Le petit bébé est un peu malade''' ({{lang-fr|"the little baby is slightly ill"}}), which contains six variants of ''e'', and '''Un bon vin blanc''' ({{lang-fr|"a good white wine"}}), which contains four nasal vowels.

The phrase's French converse is [[:fr:My tailor is rich|''my tailor is rich'']], the first in the original English [[Assimil]] guide.

In the 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', [[Linda Blair]]'s character utters the phrase as she is possessed. In 1982, [[Del Boy]] from the TV show ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' says it to a policewoman in the first episode of the second season.

'''Letter cutting''' is a form of inscriptional architectural lettering closely related to [[monumental masonry]] and [[stone carving]], often practiced by artists, [[sculpture|sculptors]], and [[typeface designer]]s. Rather than traditional stone carving, where images and symbols are the dominant features, in letter cutting it is the beauty of the stone carver's calligraphy that is the focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.traditionalmasonry.co.uk/TraditionalCraftSkills/LetterCuttingAndCarving.aspx traditionalmasonry.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Notable practitioners include:

In [[mechanical engineering]], '''limits and fits''' are a set of rules regarding the dimensions and tolerances of mating machined parts if they are to achieve the desired ease of assembly, and security after assembly - [[Fit (manufacturing)|sliding fit]], interference fit, rotating fit, non-sliding fit, loose fit, etc.

Tolerances are typically specified in thousandths of an inch or hundredths of a millimetre.

The '''Manú Learning Centre''' ('''MLC''') is located within the [[Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]], a 643 hectare private [[nature reserve]], encompassed within the cultural zone of the [[Manú National Park|Manú Biosphere Reserve]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]] and one of the largest protected areas in [[Peru]]. It is home to a variety of [[tropical rainforest|rainforest types]] including lowland Andean, pre-montane, bamboo and high terrace forests. This geographical complexity creates habitats for a diversity of [[Rainforest#Flora and fauna|flora and fauna]].  The MLC is operated by the [[#CREES|CREES]] group, a non-profit and business collaboration working towards sustainability for the Manú Region.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/pdf/Manu.pdf | title = Manu National Park | accessdate = 2009-03-19 | last = UNEP | first = | date = 2008-09-20 | format = PDF | publisher = http://www.unep-wcmc.org | pages = 1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLC serves local schools and communities as well as international researchers and [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.  It has hosted workshops for the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]], and on behalf of the Manú National Park Guards, as well as research projects from the [[University of Oxford]], [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]], and [[Glasgow University]] in addition to the [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]].  The MLC has also worked alongside schools from the UK including [[Southbank International School]] and [[Tonbridge School]].

==History==
The MLC was built in 2004 on an abandoned [[hacienda]], the first to be developed in the region.  The initial concept was to demonstrate that it was possible to use novel land use techniques to rehabilitate large areas of degraded land and to empower and educate local communities throughout this process.  There is a large body of work that had been completed at the MLC incorporating aspects of [[biology]], [[geography]], [[zoology]], [[anthropology]], [[tropical agriculture]], [[politics]], and [[art]]. Specific projects have focused on [[reforestation]], mammal behaviour patterns, [[ecological footprint|human impact studies]], environmental management, monitoring of the [[blue headed macaw]] ([[CITES|CITES Red listed]]), [[Agricultural soil science#Soil Preservation|soil &amp; agricultural sustainability]], [[forest dynamics]], carbon offsetting, and the legitimacy of local power structures to name a handful.

==CREES==
CREES (Conservation, Research &amp; Education towards Environmental Sustainability) was established in 2003 prior to the construction of the MLC and the creation of Fundo Mascoitania. It is the only organisation to be in operation within the Manú region of Peru who regularly consults with local populations about their development priorities and leads the consequential local development projects.

==Access==
[[Image:Alto Madre from MLC.jpg|thumb|300px|The Alto Madre de Dios River from the Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]]The MLC is accessible from [[Cusco]] by road until Atalaya and then by [[Launch(boat)|lancha]] until the port at the MLC.  During the [[dry season]] boats may not be able to navigate the river from Atalaya in which case transport is needed up until the Aguanos settlement on the opposite side of the [[Madre de Dios River|Alto Madre de Dios River]].  Crossing is then possible by raft or by lancha.

==Biodiversity and wildlife==
[[Image:Tropical Tree frog MLC.JPG|thumb|300px|Frog found in Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]]

'''[[Clay lick#Clay licks|Macaw Collpa]]'''

The MLC reserve attracts an array of parrots and macaws thanks to the spectacular clay mineral lick, or [[Clay lick#Clay licks|Collpa]] carved out by the Alto Madre de Dios river. This collpa is the only one of its type in the zone, and is visited daily by hundreds of colourful and noisy parrots and macaws, the most notable of these being the Blue Headed Macaw. These in turn draw raptors such as the ornate hawk eagle and crested eagle.

'''Mammal Collpa'''

The MLC boasts two large mammal collpas which attracts smaller mammals as well as large groups of white-lipped peccary and their natural Jaguar predators.

'''Wildlife Monitoring Array'''

The MLC's wildlife monitoring array was established in 2005. The array comprises a 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; monitoring grid mapped using GPS.  It provides a quantified area in which researchers can complete research on plants, animals and birds.

The '''Network for Capacity Development in Nutrition''' is a working group of the [[United Nations]] Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unscn.org|title=Home - UNSCN|website=www.unscn.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCN established a set of working groups (WG) on Capacity Development (CD) in close collaboration with [[United Nations University]] (UNU).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu|title=United Nations University|website=www.unu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports are available on the Network's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agrowebcee.net/ncdn/|title=Home - NCDN|website=www.agrowebcee.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Network had an initial meeting in 2005 and five meetings between 2006 and 2010; its results are published in scientific journals.  SCN formed nine WGs, of which NCDN is one. NCDN CD nutrition includes human resource development, organizational, institutional and legal framework development.CD is a long term, continuing process. It gives primacy to national priorities, plans, policies and processes. Participants came from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Macedonia, Hungary, Poland, Republika  Srpska, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and facilitators came from the Netherlands and Norway.

The Network links to multiple [[European Economic Community|European Community]] projects:

The general objective of the NCDN Network is to initiate and support CD activities in research and training in [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries based on country-specific needs. The objectives will be linked to CEE-specific topics of interest. This is to be open for new challenges following the changes in the various countries over time.

The [[European System of Cooperative Research Networks in Agriculture (ESCORENA)]] was established in 1974 by the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and European research institutions. It became an umbrella for cooperation between research institutions focused on food, agriculture and related fields. Since its foundation, ESCORENA has expanded to include 19 networks, including NCDN CEE. In 2009 with the financial support of [http://www.fao.org/europe/en/ FAO REU] and FAO technical support, a new server was set up in Rome to serve as common technical background for the [[AgroWeb Network]], ESCORENA and the Thematic Knowledge Networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4786">'''Neurosecurity''' has been defined as "a version of [[Computer security|computer science security]] principles and methods applied to [[neural engineering]]", or more fully, as "the protection of the [[confidentiality]], [[Data integrity|integrity]], and [[availability]] of [[Neural implant|neural devices]] from malicious parties with the goal of preserving the safety of a person’s neural mechanisms, neural computation, and free will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Denning | first = Tamara | last2 = Matsuoka | first2 = Yoky | last3 = Kohno | first3 = Tadayoshi  | title = Neurosecurity: security and privacy for neural devices | date = July 1, 2009 | journal = Neurosurgical Focus | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | url = http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2009.4.FOCUS0985 | doi = 10.3171/2009.4.FOCUS0985 | pmid = 19569895 | pages = E7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurosecurity also refers to the application of neuroscience to behavioral information security to better understand and improve users' security behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Anderson | first = Bonnie Brinton | last2= Kirwan | first2 = Brock | last3 = Eargle | first3 = David | last4 = Howard | first4 = Seth | last5 = Vance | first5 = Anthony | title = How Polymorphic Warnings Reduce Habituation in the Brain - Insights from an fMRI Study | date = April 18, 2015 | journal = Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurosecurity is a distinct concept from [[neuroethics]]; neurosecurity is effectively a way of enforcing a set of neuroethical principles for a neural device.

* The [[anime]] series ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' (2002–2003) prominently features hackers manipulating neural implants. One example is the [[Laughing Man (Ghost in the Shell)|Laughing Man]]'s use of hacking to interfere with the reports of eyewitnesses. In another example, [[Motoko Kusanagi|Major Kusanagi]] makes a point by taking control of some of [[Batou]]'s implants and forcing him to punch himself.
* [[Neal Stephenson]]'s book ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' (1995) briefly refers to corporations hacking neural implants in order to superimpose advertisements onto a user's field of vision.
* The world in video game ''[[Remember Me (video game)|Remember Me]]'' is set in the world where memory manipulation is commonplace.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">In [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], '''Planck's principle''' is the view that scientific change does not occur because individual scientists change their mind, but rather that successive generations of scientists have different views.

The reason for the name is the statements by [[Max Planck]]:&lt;ref&gt;Planck, Max K. (1950). Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers. New York: Philosophical library.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it|sign=Max Planck|source=Scientific autobiography, 1950, p. 33}}
{{quote|text=An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth.|sign=Max Planck|source=Scientific autobiography, 1950, p. 97}}

Planck's quote has been used by [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[Paul Feyerabend]] and others to argue that [[scientific revolutions]] are arational, rather than spreading through "mere force of truth and fact".&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hull DL, Tessner PD, Diamond AM |title=Planck's Principle |journal=Science |date=17 November 1978 |volume=202 |issue=4369 |pages=717–23 |doi=10.1126/science.202.4369.717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Kuhn. ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. University of Chicago Press, 1970. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Feyrabend, in Criticism and the growth of knowledge, I. Lakatos and A. Musgrave, eds. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1970, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Azoulay, Christian Fons-Rosen, Joshua S. Graff Zivin: Does Science Advance One Funeral at a Time? 2015, {{doi|10.3386/w21788}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as [[Darwinian]] rather than [[Lamarckian]] conceptual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John T.

Whether age influences the readiness to accept new ideas has been empirically criticised. In the case of acceptance of [[evolution]] in the years after Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' age was a minor factor.&lt;ref name="Hull"/&gt; Similarly, it was a weak factor in accepting [[cliometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arthur M.

The SCALE-UP name originally stood for “Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Physics” but since its conception many different institutions have begun teaching a variety of courses of various sizes. The acronym was changed to “Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs.” Now, because of the increasing number of pre-college installations, plus to draw attention to the instruction as well as the space, the name has become "Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies." The basic idea is that students are given something interesting to investigate. While they work in teams on these "tangibles" (hands-on measurements or observations) and "ponderables" (interesting, complex problems), the instructor is free to roam around the classroom–--asking questions, sending one team to help another, or asking why someone else got a different answer. There is no separate lab class and most of the "lectures" are actually class-wide discussions. The groups are carefully structured and give students many opportunities to interact. Three teams (labelled a, b, and c) sit at each round table and have white boards nearby. Each team has a laptop in case they need web access. The [http://scaleup.ncsu.edu/groups/adopters/wiki/056a1/North_Carolina_State_Physics.html  original design] called for 11 round tables of nine students, but many schools have smaller classes while a few have even larger ones. Smaller classes, particularly those in high schools, have also been using D-shaped tables that seat six students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22696">{{Sociology}}
'''Science studies'''  is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] research area that seeks to situate scientific [[expertise]] in broad social, historical, and philosophical contexts. It uses various methods to analyze the production, representation and reception of scientific knowledge and its [[epistemology|epistemic]] and [[semiotics|semiotic]] role.

Similarly to [[cultural studies]], science studies are defined by the subject of their research and encompass a large range of different theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. The interdisciplinary approach may include and borrow methods from the humanities, natural and formal sciences, from [[scientometrics]] to [[ethnomethodology]] or [[cognitive science]]. Science studies have a certain importance for [[evaluation]] and science policy. Overlapping with the field of [[science, technology and society]], practitioners study the relationship between science and technology, and the interaction of expert and lay knowledge in the public realm.

== Scope ==
The field started with a tendency toward [[Omphaloskepsis|navel-gazing]]: it was extremely self-conscious in its genesis and applications.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; From early concerns with scientific [[discourse]], practitioners soon started to deal with the relation of scientific expertise to politics and lay people.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; Practical examples include [[bioethics]], [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE), [[pollution]], [[global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;Martello M (2004) Global change science and the Arctic citizen.Sci Public Policy 31(2):107–115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff S (ed) (2004) States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order. Routledge, Abingdon&lt;/ref&gt; [[biomedical sciences]], [[physical sciences]], [[natural hazard]] predictions, the (alleged) impact of the Chernobyl disaster in the UK, generation and review of science policy and risk governance and its historical and geographic contexts.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; While staying a discipline with multiple metanarratives, the fundamental concern is about the role of the perceived ̳expert‘ in providing governments and local authorities with information from which they can make decisions.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;
The approach poses various important questions about what makes an expert and how experts and their authority are to be distinguished from the lay population and interacts with the values and policy making process in liberal democratic societies.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;

Practitioners examine the forces within and through which scientists investigate specific phenomena such as
* technological milieus, epistemic instruments and [[Epistemic cultures|cultures]] and [[laboratory life]] (compare [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]], [[Bruno Latour]], Hans-Jörg Rheinberger)
* Science and technology (e.g. [[Wiebe Bijker]], [[Trevor Pinch]], [[Thomas P. Hughes]])
* Science, technology and society (e.g. [[Peter Weingart]], [[Ulrike Felt]], [[Helga Nowotny]] and [[Reiner Grundmann]])
* Language and  [[rhetoric of science]] (e.g. [[Charles Bazerman]], [[Alan G. Gross]], Greg Myers)
* [[Aesthetics#Aesthetics and science|aesthetics of science]] and visual culture in science (u.a. [[:de:Peter Geimer]]), the role of aesthetic criteria in scientific practice (compare [[mathematical beauty]]) and the relation between emotion, [[cognition]] and rationality in the development of science.&lt;ref&gt;International Studies in the Philosophy of Science   Volume 16,  Issue 1, 2002, Recent work on aesthetics of science DOI:10.1080/02698590120118783 James W. McAllister pages 7-11, 21 Jul 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[semiotics|Semiotic]] studies of creative processes, as in the discovery, conceptualization, and realization of new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Zeichen für Kunst: Zur Organisierbarkeit von Kreativität Detlev Nothnagel, ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 {{ISBN|978-3-86057-887-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the interaction and management of different forms of knowledge in cooperative research.&lt;ref&gt;Organisierte Kreativität: Die vielen Gesichter der Innovation, Rene J.Jorna, in Zeichen für Kunst: Zur Organisierbarkeit von Kreativität Detlev Nothnagel, ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 {{ISBN|978-3-86057-887-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Large scale research and research institutions, e.g. particle colliders ([[Sharon Traweek]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Traweek | first = Sharon | author-link = Sharon Traweek | title = Beamtimes and lifetimes: the world of high energy physicists | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780674044449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[research ethics]], [[science policy]], and the role of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Biagioli: ''The science studies reader''. Routledge, New York 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-91867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek de Solla Price]]: ''Little Science, Big Science. Von der Studierstube zur Großforschung.'' Suhrkamp, 1982, {{ISBN|978-3518076484}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the field ==
[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanislaw Ossowski]] started to introduce the concept in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kölbel: [http://www.dart-europe.eu/full.php?id=466024 ''Wissensmanagement in der Wissenschaft''], Berlin: Gesellschaft für Wissenschaftsforschung e.V. c/o Inst. f. Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, 2002, elektronische Bereitstellung 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn's]] ''[[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962) led to an increased interest in not only the [[history of science]], but also its [[history and philosophy of science|philosophical underpinnings]]. Kuhn's work established that the [[history of science]] was less a linear succession of discoveries, but rather the concept of [[paradigm]]s to the [[philosophy of science]]. Paradigms are broader, socio-intellectual constructs that determine which types of truth claims are permissible. Science studies try to identify crucial [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]] as in science and technology, nature and culture, theories and experiments; science and fine art leading to the separation of various science fields and practices. [[Sociology of scientific knowledge]] developed at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where [[David Bloor]] and his colleagues developed what has been termed the '[[strong programme]]'. The strong programme proposed that both 'true' and 'false' scientific theories should be treated the same way.&lt;ref&gt;David Bloor, "The strengths of the strong programme." Scientific rationality: The sociological turn (Springer Netherlands, 1984) pp. 75-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are caused by social factors or conditions, such as cultural context and self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Wiebe E. Bijker, et al. The social construction of technological systems: New directions in the sociology and history of technology (MIT press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; All human knowledge, as something that exists in the human cognition, must contain some social components in its formation process.&lt;ref&gt;Harry M. Collins, "Introduction: Stages in the empirical programme of relativism." Social studies of science (1981): 3-10. in JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;

It proved however difficult to address natural science topics with sociologist methods, as proven by the US [[science wars]].&lt;ref name=thn/&gt; The use of a deconstructive approach (as for works on arts or religion) on natural sciences risked to endanger not only the "hard facts" of natural sciences, but as well the objectivity and positivist tradition of sociology itself.&lt;ref name=thn&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Latour | first = Bruno | author-link = Bruno Latour | title = When things strike back: a possible contribution of ‘science studies’ to the social sciences | journal = [[British Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–123 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-4446.2000.00107.x | date = March 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2000.00107.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view on scientific knowledge production as a (at least partial) social construct was not easily accepted.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;  Latour and others identified a dichotomy crucial for modernity, the division between nature (things, objects) as being [[Transcendental idealism|transcendent]], allowing to detect them, and society (the subject, the state) as [[Immanence#Continental philosophy|immanent]] as being artificial, constructed. The dichotomy allowed for a mass production of things (technical-natural hybrids) and large scale [[global issue]]s that in the meanwhile threaten endangered the distinction as such. E.g. ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]'' asks to reconnect the social and natural worlds returning to the premodern use of "thing"&lt;ref&gt;In premodern times (and various languages) the term both meant an object and [[Thing (assembly)|an assembly]]&lt;/ref&gt; - addressing objects as hybrids made and scrutinized by the public interaction of people, things and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lash | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Lash |year=1999 | title = Objects that judge: Latour's parliament of things, in another modernity, a different rationality | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford  | isbn = 9780631164999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science studies scholars such as [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Steve Woolgar]] started already in the 1980s to involve "technology", and called their field '[[science, technology and society]]'.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt;An Introduction to Science and Technology Studies&lt;/span&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Sergio+Sismondo%22 &lt;span dir="ltr"&gt; Sergio Sismondo&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt; John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/span&gt;, 17.08.2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This "turn to technology" brought science studies into communication with academics in science, technology, and society programs.

More recently, a novel approach known as [[mapping controversies]] has been gaining momentum among science studies practitioners, and was introduced as a course for students in engineering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demoscience.org/ MIT] web.mit.edu Retrieved on 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ Ecoles Polytechniques Fédérales de Lausanne] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712012636/http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ |date=2012-07-12 }} mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch Retrieved on 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.co.uk University of Manchester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515123357/http://www.mappingcontroversies.co.uk/ |date=2009-05-15 }} mappingcontroversies.co.uk Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 [[Harry Collins]] and Robert Evans asked for a third wave of science studies (a pun on ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler)|The Third Wave]]''), namely studies of ''expertise'' and ''experience'' answering to recent tendencies to dissolve the boundary between experts and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Social Studies of Science April 2002 vol. 32 no. 2 235-296 The Third Wave of Science Studies Studies of Expertise and Experience H.M.

== Application on natural and man made hazards ==

=== Sheepfarming after Chernobyl ===
[[File:Pair of Herdwicks grazing.jpg|thumb|[[Herdwick]]s grazing in Cumbria]]

A showcase of the rather complex problems of scientific information and its interaction with lay persons is [[Brian Wynne]]'s study of Sheepfarming in Cumbria after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;&lt;ref name=mah&gt;Wynne B (1989) Sheepfarming after Chernobyl: a case study in communicating scientific information. Environment 31(2):33–39
&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated on the responses of sheep farmers in [[Cumbria]], who had been subjected to administrative restrictions because of [[radioactive contamination]], allegedly caused by the nuclear accident at [[Chernobyl]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;  The sheep farmers suffered economic losses and their resistance against the regulation imposed was being deemed irrational and not adequate.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;  It turned out that the source of radioactivity was actually the [[Sellafield]] nuclear reprocessing complex; thus, the experts who were responsible for the duration of the restrictions were completely mistaken.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt; The example lead to various attempts to better involve local knowledge and experience of lay people and to assess its often highly geographically and historically defined background.&lt;ref&gt;Risk, Environment and Modernity: Towards a New Ecology [[Scott Lash]] [[Bronislaw Szerszynski]], [[Brian Wynne]] SAGE, 05.04.1996&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science studies / STS on volcanology ===
[[Image:Soufrière Hills volcanic aftermath (Aerial views, Montserrat, 2007) 02.jpg|thumb|The aftermath of the 2007 [[Soufrière Hills]] eruption in Montserrat]]

Donovan et al. (2012) used and described the STS respectively science studies for ''social studies of [[volcanology]]'' and the generation of knowledge and expert advice on various active volcanoes.&lt;ref name=vulc&gt;Amy Donovan, Clive Oppenheimer, Michael Bravo. Social studies of volcanology: knowledge generation and expert advice on active volcanoes. Bulletin of Volcanology, Springer Verlag (Germany), 2012, 74 (3), pp.677-689. doi:&lt;10.1007/s00445-011-0547-z insu-00691620&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a survey of volcanologists carried out during 2008 and 2009 and interviews with scientists in the [[List of volcanoes in the United Kingdom|UK]], [[Soufrière Hills|Montserrat]], [[Volcanology of Italy|Italy]] and [[Volcanology of Iceland|Iceland]] during fieldwork seasons. Donovan et al. (2012) asked the experts about the felt purpose of volcanology and what they considered the most important eruptions in historical time. The survey tries to identify eruptions that had an influence on volcanology as a science and to assess the role of scientists in policymaking.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; 
A main focus was on the impact of the Montserrat eruption 1997. The eruption, a classical example of the [[black swan theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Donovan et al. (2012) cite Taleb NN (2007) The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable. Allen Lane, London 
&lt;/ref&gt; directly killed (only) 19 persons. However the outbreak had major impacts on the local society and destroyed important infractructure, as the [[W. H. Bramble Airport|island's airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/3666502.stm |title=BBC country profile: Montserrat |accessdate=2008-03-08 | date=22 September 2009 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7,000 people, or two-thirds of the population, left Montserrat; 4,000 to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4237882.stm |date=12 September 2005 |title=Montserrat evacuation remembered |publisher=BBC |accessdate= 19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Montserrat case put immense pressure on volcanologists, as their expertise suddenly became the primary driver of various public policy approaches.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; The STS approach provided valuable insights in that situation.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; There were various miscommunications among scientists. Matching scientific uncertainty (typical of volcanic unrest) and the request for a single unified voice for political advice was a challenge.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; The Montserrat Volcanologists began to use statistical elicitation models to estimate the probabilities of particular events, a rather subjective method, but allowing to synthesizing consensus and experience-based expertise step by step.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; It involved as well local knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;

[[Volcanology]] as a science currently faces a shift of its epistemological foundations of volcanology. The science started to involve more research into risk assessment and risk management. It requires new, integrated methodologies for knowledge collection that transcend scientific disciplinary boundaries but combine qualitative and quantitative outcomes in a structured whole.&lt;ref&gt;Horlick-Jones T, Sime J (2004) Living on the border: knowledge, risk and transdisciplinarity. Futures 36(4):441&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experts and Democracy ==
Science has become a major force in Western democratic societies, which depend on innovation and technology (compare [[Risk society]]) to address its risks.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Beck"&gt;{{cite book |title=Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity |author=[[Ulrich Beck]] |publisher=Sage Publications |location=New Delhi |date=1992 |isbn=978-0803983465}} (in German: Die Risikogesellschaft 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Beliefs about science can be very different from those of the scientists themselves, for reasons of e.g. moral values, epistemology or political motivations.The designation of expertise as authoritative in the interaction with lay people and decision makers of all kind is nevertheless challenged in contemporary risk societies, as suggested by scholars who follow [[Ulrich Beck]]'s theorisation. The role of expertise in contemporary democracies is an important theme for debate among science studies scholars.

A '''sign''' is an [[Physical body|object]], [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], event, or [[entity]] whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else.&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; A natural sign bears a causal relation to its object—for instance, [[thunder]] is a sign of storm, or medical [[symptom]]s signify a disease. A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a [[full stop]] signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a [[language]], as well as bodily [[gesture]]s, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, [[road sign]]s, etc., collectively known as [[signage]]) generally inform or instruct using [[written text]], [[symbol]]s, [[picture]]s or a combination of these.

The philosophical study of signs and [[symbol]]s is called [[semiotics]]; this includes the study of [[semiosis]], which is the way in which [[sign (semiotics)|signs (in the semiotic sense)]] operate.

==Nature==
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2018}}
[[Semiotics]], [[epistemology]], logic, and [[philosophy of language]] are concerned about the nature of signs, what they are and how they signify.  The nature of signs and symbols and significations, their definition, elements, and types, is mainly established by [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Aquinas]]. According to these classic sources, significance is a relationship between two sorts of things: signs and the kinds of things they signify (intend, express or mean), where one term necessarily causes something else to come to the mind. Distinguishing natural signs and conventional signs, the traditional theory of signs ([[Augustine]]) sets the following threefold partition of things:
all sorts of indications, evidences, symptoms, and physical signals, there are signs which are ''always'' signs (the entities of the mind as ideas and images, thoughts and feelings, constructs and intentions); and there are signs that ''have'' to get their signification (as linguistic entities and cultural symbols). So, while natural signs serve as the source of signification, the human mind is the agency through which signs signify naturally occurring things, such as objects, states, qualities, quantities, events, processes, or relationships. Human [[language]] and [[discourse]], [[communication]], [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[poetry]], [[theology]], and [[religion]] are only some of fields of human study and activity where grasping the nature of signs and symbols and patterns of signification may have a decisive value. Communication takes place without words but via the mind as a result of signs and symbols; They communicate/pass across/ messages to the human mind through their pictorial representation.

* A sign, in common use, is an [[wikt:indication|indication]] that a previously observed event is about to occur again
* Sign, in [[divination]] and religion: an [[omen]], an event or occurrence believed to foretell the future
* Sign, in [[ontology]] and [[spirituality]]: a [[coincidence]] or surprising event thought to reveal divine will; see [[synchronicity]]
* [[Sign (linguistics)]]: a combination of a concept and a sound-image described by Ferdinand de Saussure
* In [[mathematics]], the [[sign (mathematics)|sign of a number]] tells whether it is [[positive and negative numbers|positive or negative]]. Also, the [[sign of a permutation]] tells whether it is the product of an [[parity (mathematics)|even or odd]] number of [[transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]].
* [[Signedness]], in computing, is the property that a representation of a number has one [[bit]], the sign bit, which denotes whether the number is non-negative or negative.  A number is called signed if it contains a sign bit, otherwise unsigned. See also [[signed number representation]]
* Sign, in [[biology]]: an indication of some living thing's presence
* [[Medical sign]], in [[medicine]]: objective evidence of the presence of a disease or disorder, as opposed to a [[symptom]], which is subjective

* [[Signature]], in history: a handwritten depiction observed on a document to show authorship and will
* For marketing or advocacy purposes, a [[signage]] refers to the collective use of signs to convey a message.

== Christianity ==

===St. Augustine and signs===
[[St. Augustine]] was the first man who synthesized the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs. For him a sign is a thing which is used to signify other things and to make them come to mind (''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (hereafter DDC) 1.2.2; 2.1.1). The most common signs are spoken and written words (DDC 1.2.2; 2.3.4-2.4.5). Although God cannot be fully expressible, Augustine gave emphasis to the possibility of God’s communication with humans by signs in Scripture (DDC 1.6.6).  Augustine endorsed and developed the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs.  Among the mainstream in the theories of signs, i.e., that of Aristotle and that of Stoics, the former theory filtered into the works of Cicero (106-43 BC, ''De inventione rhetorica'' 1.30.47-48) and Quintilian (circa 35-100, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 5.9.9-10), which regarded the sign as an instrument of inference.  In his commentary on Aristotle’s ''De Interpretatione'', Ammonius said, "according to the division of the philosopher Theophrastus, the relation of speech is twofold, first in regard to the audience, to which speech signifies something, and secondly in regard to the things about which the speaker intends to persuade the audience." If we match DDC with this division, the first part belongs to DDC Book IV and the second part to DDC Books I-III. Augustine, although influenced by these theories, advanced his own theological theory of signs, with whose help one can infer the mind of God from the events and words of Scripture.

Books II and III of DDC enumerate all kinds of signs and explain how to interpret them. Signs are divided into natural (''naturalia'') and conventional (''data''); the latter is divided into animal (''bestiae'') and human (''homines''); the latter is divided into non-words (''cetera'') and words (''verba''); the latter is divided into spoken words (''voces'') and written words (''litterae''); the latter is divided into unknown signs (''signa ignota'') and ambiguous signs (''signa ambigua''); both the former and the latter are divided respectively into particular signs (''signa propria'') and figurative signs (''signa translata''), among which the unknown figurative signs belong to the pagans.
In addition to exegetical knowledge (Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 1.4.1-3 and 1.8.1-21) which follows the order of reading (''lectio''), textual criticism (''emendatio''), explanation (''enarratio''), and judgment (''iudicium''),  one needs to know the original language (Hebrew and Greek) and broad background information on Scripture (DDC 2.9.14-2.40.60).

Augustine’s understanding of signs includes several hermeneutical presuppositions as important factors. First, the interpreter should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (DDC 2.41.62). Second, the interpreter must have a spirit of active inquiry and should not hesitate to learn and use pagan education for the purpose of leading to Christian learning,  because all truth is God’s truth (DDC 2.40.60-2.42.63). Third, the heart of interpreter should be founded, rooted, and built up in love which is the final goal of the entire Scriptures (DDC 2.42.63).

The sign does not function as its own goal, but its purpose lies in its role as a signification (''res significans'', DDC 3.9.13). God gave signs as a means to reveal himself; Christians need to exercise hermeneutical principles in order to understand that divine revelation. Even if the Scriptural text is obscure, it has meaningful benefits. For the obscure text prevents us from falling into pride, triggers our intelligence (DDC 2.6.7), tempers our faith in the history of revelation (DDC 3.8.12), and refines our mind to be suitable to the holy mysteries (DDC 4.8.22). When interpreting signs, the literal meaning should first be sought, and then the figurative meaning (DDC 3.10.14-3.23.33). Augustine suggests the hermeneutical principle that the obscure Scriptural verse is interpreted with the help of plain and simple verses, which formed the doctrine of "scriptura scripturae interpres" (Scripture is the Interpreter of Scripture) in the Reformation Era. Moreover, he introduces the seven rules of Tyconius the Donatist to interpret the obscure meaning of the Bible, which demonstrates his understanding that all truth belongs to God (DDC 3.3.42-3.37.56). In order to apply Augustine's hermeneutics of the sign appropriately in modern times, every division of theology must be involved and interdisciplinary approaches must be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2011}}
'''Portability''' in [[High-level programming language|high-level computer programming]] is the usability of the same [[software]] in different environments. The prerequirement for portability is the generalized [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] between the application logic and [[Interface (computer science)|system interfaces]]. When software with the same functionality is produced for several [[computing platform]]s, portability is the key issue for development cost reduction.

== Strategies for portability ==
Software portability may involve:
* Transferring installed program files to another computer of basically the same architecture.
* Reinstalling a program from distribution files on another computer of basically the same architecture.
* [[Compiler|Building]] [[executable]] programs for different platforms from [[source code]]; this is what is usually understood by "[[porting]]".

=== Similar systems ===
When [[operating system]]s of the same family are installed on two computers with [[CPU|processors]] with similar [[instruction set]]s it is often possible to transfer the files implementing program files between them.

In the simplest case the file or files may simply be copied from one machine to the other. However, in many cases, the software is [[Installation (computer programs)|installed]] on a computer in a way which depends upon its detailed hardware, software, and setup, with [[device driver]]s for particular devices, using installed operating system and supporting software components, and using different [[Logical drive|drives]] or [[Directory (file systems)|directories]].

In some cases software, usually described as "[[portable application|portable software]]" is specifically designed to run on different computers with compatible operating systems and processors without any machine-dependent installation; it is sufficient to transfer specified directories and their contents. Software installed on portable [[mass storage]] devices such as [[USB stick]]s can be used on any compatible computer on simply plugging the storage device in, and stores all configuration information on the removable device. Hardware- and software-specific information is often stored in [[configuration file]]s in specified locations (e.g. the [[Windows registry|registry]] on machines running [[Microsoft Windows]]).

Software which is not portable in this sense will have to be transferred with modifications to support the environment on the destination machine.

=== Different processors ===
{{As of|2011}} the majority of desktop and laptop computers used [[microprocessor]]s compatible with the 32- and 64-bit [[x86]] instruction sets. Smaller portable devices use processors with different and incompatible instruction sets, such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]]. The difference between larger and smaller devices is such that detailed software operation is different; an application designed to display suitably on a large screen cannot simply be ported to a pocket-sized smartphone with a tiny screen even if the functionality is similar.

[[Web applications]] are required to be processor independent, so portability can be achieved by using web programming techniques, writing in [[JavaScript]]. Such a program can run in a common web browser. Such [[web application]]s must, for security reasons, have limited control over the host computer, especially regarding reading and writing files. Non-web programs, installed upon a computer in the normal manner, can have more control, and yet achieve system portability by linking to portable libraries that provides the same interface on different systems.

== Source code portability ==
Software can be compiled and [[linker (computing)|linked]] from source code for different operating systems and processors if written in a programming language supporting compilation for the platforms. This is usually a task for the program developers; typical users have neither access to the source code nor the required skills.

In [[Open-source software|open-source]] environments such as Linux the source code is available to all. In earlier days source code was often distributed in a standardised format, and could be built into executable code with a standard [[Make (software)|Make tool]] for any particular system by moderately knowledgeable users if no errors occurred during the build. Some [[Linux distribution]]s distribute software to users in source form. In these cases there is usually no need for detailed adaptation of the software for the system; it is distributed in a way which [[Conditional compilation|modifies the compilation process to match the system]].

=== Effort to port source code ===
Even with seemingly portable languages like [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] the effort to port source code can vary considerably. The authors of [[UNIX/32V]] (1979) reported that "[t]he [[Bourne shell|(Bourne) shell]] [...] required by far the largest conversion effort of any supposedly portable program, for the simple reason that it is not portable."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. London and John F. Reiser (1978). [https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/otherports/32vscan.pdf A Unix operating system for the DEC VAX-11/780 computer]. Bell Labs internal memo 78-1353-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the effort consists of recompiling the source code,  but sometimes it is necessary to rewrite major parts of the software. Many language specifications describe implementation defined behaviour (e.g. right shifting a signed integer in C can do a [[Logical shift|logical]] or an [[Arithmetic shift|arithmetic]] shift). Operating system functions or third party libraries might not be available on the target system. Some functions can be available on a target system, but exhibit slightly different behaviour (E.g.: utime() fails under Windows with EACCES, when it is called for a directory). The program code itself can also contain unportable things, like the paths of include files. Drive letters and the backslash as path delimiter are not accepted on all operating systems. Implementation defined things like [[Endianness|byte order]] and the size of an [[Integer (computer science)|int]] can also raise the porting effort. In practice the claim of languages, like [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], to have the WOCA ([[write once, compile anywhere]]) is arguable.

In [[linguistics]], '''syntax''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|t|æ|k|s}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}) is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in a given [[Natural language|language]], usually including [[word order]]. The term ''syntax'' is also used  to refer to the study of such principles and processes.&lt;ref name="Chomsky def"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2002 |origyear=1957 |title= Syntactic Structures |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SNeHkMXHcd8C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22syntax+is%22 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the [[Universal grammar|syntactic rules]] common to all languages.

In mathematics, ''syntax'' refers to the rules governing the notation of mathematical systems, such as [[formal language]]s used in [[logic]]. (See [[Syntax (logic)|logical syntax]].)

== Etymology ==
The word ''syntax'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]]: {{wikt-lang|grc|σύνταξις}} "coordination", which consists of {{lang|grc|σύν}} ''syn'', "together", and {{lang|grc|τάξις}} ''táxis'', "an ordering".

==Sequencing of subject, verb, and object==

A basic feature of a language's syntax is the sequence in which the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (S), [[verb]] (V), and [[object (grammar)|object]] (O) usually appear in sentences. Over 85% of languages usually place the subject first, either in the sequence [[subject-verb-object|SVO]] or the sequence [[subject-object-verb|SOV]]. The other possible sequences are [[verb-subject-object|VSO]], [[verb-object-subject|VOS]], [[object-verb-subject|OVS]], and [[object-subject-verb|OSV]], the last three of which are rare.

== Early history ==
Works on [[grammar]] were written long before modern syntax came about; in [[Ancient India|Ancient]] [[India]], the ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' of [[Pāṇini]] (c. 4th century BC) is often cited as an example of a premodern work that approaches the sophistication of a modern syntactic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fortson IV |first=Benjamin W. |title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1405188968 |page=186 |quote=[The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī''] is a highly precise and thorough description of the structure of Sanskrit somewhat resembling modern generative grammar...[it] remained the most advanced linguistic analysis of any kind until the twentieth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, the school of thought that came to be known as "traditional grammar" began with the work of [[Dionysius Thrax]].

For centuries, work in syntax was dominated by a framework known as {{lang|fr|grammaire générale}}, first expounded in 1660 by [[Antoine Arnauld]] in a book of the same title. This system took as its basic premise the assumption that language is a direct reflection of thought processes and therefore there is a single, most natural way to express a thought.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, in the 19th century, with the development of [[historical-comparative linguistics]], linguists began to realize the sheer diversity of human language and to question fundamental assumptions about the relationship between language and logic. It became apparent that there was no such thing as the most natural way to express a thought, and therefore [[logic]] could no longer be relied upon as a basis for studying the structure of language.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal grammar]] modeled the study of syntax upon that of logic. (Indeed, large parts of the [[Port-Royal Logic]] were copied or adapted from the ''Grammaire générale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnauld |first=Antoine |title=La logique |year=1683 |edition=5th |location=Paris |publisher=G. Desprez |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&amp;O=NUMM-57444 |quote={{lang|fr|Nous avons emprunté...ce que nous avons dit...d'un petit Livre...sous le titre de Grammaire générale.}} |pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Syntactic categories were identified with logical ones, and all sentences were analyzed in terms of "subject – copula – predicate". Initially, this view was adopted even by the early comparative linguists such as [[Franz Bopp]].

The central role of syntax within [[theoretical linguistics]] became clear only in the 20th century, which could reasonably be called the "century of syntactic theory" as far as linguistics is concerned. (For a detailed and critical survey of the history of syntax in the last two centuries, see the monumental work by Giorgio Graffi (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Giorgio |first=Graffi |year= 2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/200_Years_of_Syntax.html?id=mydolrE-PPkC |title= 200 Years of Syntax: A Critical Survey |format=googlebook preview |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=9789027284570  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.)

== Theories ==
There are a number of theoretical approaches to the discipline of syntax. One school of thought, founded in the works of [[Derek Bickerton]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |title=Language and Species |author=Bickerton, Derek |year=1990 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-04610-9}} and, for more recent advances, {{cite book |title=Biological foundations and origin of syntax |editor1=Derek Bickerton |editor2=Eörs Szathmáry |year=2009 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-01356-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; sees syntax as a branch of biology, since it conceives of syntax as the study of linguistic knowledge as embodied in the human [[mind]]. Other linguists (e.g., [[Gerald Gazdar]]) take a more [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|Platonistic]] view, since they regard syntax to be the study of an abstract [[formal system]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Briscoe, 2 May 2001, [http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html#SECTION00040000000000000000 Interview with Gerald Gazdar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122163306/http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html |date=2005-11-22 }}. Retrieved 2008-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others (e.g., [[Joseph Greenberg]]) consider syntax a taxonomical device to reach broad generalizations across languages.

=== Generative grammar ===
{{Main|Generative grammar}}
The hypothesis of generative grammar is that language is a structure of the human mind. The goal of generative grammar is to make a complete model of this inner language (known as ''[[i-language]]''). This model could be used to describe all human language and to predict the [[grammaticality]] of any given utterance (that is, to predict whether the utterance would sound correct to native speakers of the language). This approach to language was pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]]. Most generative theories (although not all of them) assume that syntax is based upon the constituent structure of sentences. Generative grammars are among the theories that focus primarily on the form of a sentence, rather than its communicative function.

Among the many generative theories of linguistics, the Chomskyan theories are:
* [[Transformational grammar]] (TG) (Original theory of generative syntax laid out by Chomsky in ''Syntactic Structures'' in 1957)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. 1957. ''Syntactic Structures''. The Hague/Paris: Mouton, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Government and binding theory]] (GB) (revised theory in the tradition of TG developed mainly by Chomsky in the 1970s and 1980s)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1981/1993). Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Minimalist program]] (MP) (a reworking of the theory out of the GB framework published by Chomsky in 1995)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1995). The Minimalist Program. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories that find their origin in the generative paradigm are:
* [[Arc pair grammar]]
* [[Generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG; now largely out of date)
* [[Generative semantics]] (superseded by Semantic Syntax &lt;ref&gt;Seuren, P. A. M. 2018. ''Semantic Syntax''. Revised edition. Leiden: Brill&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG)
* [[Lexical functional grammar]] (LFG)
* [[Nanosyntax]]&lt;!--Commenting out until explained: the link seems to be about something unrelated. HPSG and LFG also fall into the category of [[unification]] grammars.--&gt;
* [[Relational grammar]] (RG) (now largely out of date)

=== Dependency grammar ===
{{Main|Dependency grammar}}
[[Dependency grammar]] is an approach to sentence structure where syntactic units are arranged according to the dependency relation, as opposed to the constituency relation of [[phrase structure grammar]]s. Dependencies are directed links between words. The (finite) verb is seen as the root of all clause structure and all the other words in the clause are either directly or indirectly dependent on this root. Some prominent dependency-based theories of syntax are:

* [[Recursive categorical syntax]], or Algebraic syntax
* [[Functional generative description]]
* [[Meaning–text theory]]
* [[Operator grammar]]
* [[Word grammar]]

[[Lucien Tesnière]] (1893–1954) is widely seen as the father of modern dependency-based theories of syntax and grammar. He argued vehemently against the binary division of the clause into [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] that is associated with the grammars of his day (S → NP VP) and which remains at the core of most phrase structure grammars. In the place of this division, he positioned the verb as the root of all clause structure.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Tesnière's rejection of the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate and in favor of the verb as the root of all structure, see Tesnière (1969:103–105).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Categorial grammar ===
{{Main|Categorial grammar}}
[[Categorial grammar]] is an approach that attributes the syntactic structure not to rules of grammar, but to the properties of the [[syntactic categories]] themselves. For example, rather than asserting that sentences are constructed by a rule that combines a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP) (e.g., the [[phrase structure rule]] S → NP VP), in categorial grammar, such principles are embedded in the category of the [[head (linguistics)|head]] word itself. So the syntactic category for an [[intransitive]] verb is a complex formula representing the fact that the verb acts as a [[function word]] requiring an NP as an input and produces a sentence level structure as an output. This complex category is notated as (NP\S) instead of V. NP\S is read as "a category that searches to the left (indicated by \) for an NP (the element on the left) and outputs a sentence (the element on the right)." The category of [[transitive verb]] is defined as an element that requires two NPs (its subject and its direct object) to form a sentence. This is notated as (NP/(NP\S)) which means "a category that searches to the right (indicated by /) for an NP (the object), and generates a function (equivalent to the VP) which is (NP\S), which in turn represents a function that searches to the left for an NP and produces a sentence."

[[Tree-adjoining grammar]] is a categorial grammar that adds in partial [[tree structure]]s to the categories.

=== Stochastic/probabilistic grammars/network theories ===
Theoretical approaches to syntax that are based upon [[probability theory]] are known as [[stochastic grammar]]s. One common implementation of such an approach makes use of a [[neural network]] or [[connectionism]].

=== Functionalist grammars ===
{{main|Functional theories of grammar}}
Functionalist theories, although focused upon form, are driven by explanation based upon the function of a sentence (i.e., its communicative function). Some typical functionalist theories include:
* [[Cognitive grammar]]
* [[Construction grammar]] (CxG)
* [[Emergent grammar]]
* [[Functional discourse grammar]] (Dik)
* [[Prague linguistic circle]]
* [[Role and reference grammar]] (RRG)
* [[Systemic functional grammar]]

'''''Sztuka kochania''''' (Polish title; literally ''The Art of Loving'') published in English as '''''A Practical Guide to Marital Bliss''''') is a popular [[sex manual]] written by the pioneering Polish sexologist [[Michalina Wisłocka]], first published in 1978. The book has achieved great publishing success.  About 7 million copies were sold in Poland, not including pirated reprints.

The author describes methods of [[contraception]], a list of [[sexual position]]s and [[sex game|games]], historical texts on [[erotic talk|love talk]] and methods of satisfying the sexual needs of lonely people.  On the other hand, the author of ''Sztuka kochania'' also talks a lot about love and the need to understand another human being.

== 2016 republication ==
In 2016, the book was republished, with an introduction by professor [[Zbigniew Izdebski]] and a new chapter on contraception. The new edition was released just before the premiere of the biographical film ''The Art of Loving: Story of Michalina Wislocka'' directed by Maria Sadowska, with [[Magdalena Boczarska]] in the role of Michalina Wisłocka.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4360">In [[philosophy]], '''truth by consensus''' is the process of taking statements to be true simply because people generally agree upon them.  [[Imre Lakatos]] characterizes it as a "watered down" form of provable [[truth]] propounded by some [[sociology of knowledge|sociologists of knowledge]], particularly [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Michael Polanyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Papers|author=[[Imre Lakatos]]|chapter=Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes|pages=8|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter-url=http://www.csun.edu/~vcsoc00i/classes/s680f11/Lakatos.pdf|isbn=978-0-521-28031-0|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Nigel Warburton]] argues that the truth by consensus process is not a reliable way of discovering truth.  That there is general agreement upon something does not make it actually true.&lt;br&gt;
There are two main reasons for this:&lt;ref name=Warburton&gt;{{cite book|title=Thinking from A to Z|author=Nigel Warburton|chapter=truth by consensus|pages=134&amp;ndash;135|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-22281-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# One reason Warburton discusses is that people are prone to wishful thinking.  People can believe an assertion and espouse it as truth in the face of overwhelming evidence and facts to the contrary, simply because they wish that things were so.  
# The other one is that people are gullible, and easily misled.

Another unreliable method of determining truth is by determining the majority opinion of a popular vote.  This is unreliable because on many questions the majority of people are ill-informed.  Warburton gives [[astrology]] as an example of this.  He states that while it may be the case that the majority of the people of the world believe that people's destinies are wholly determined by astrological mechanisms, given that most of that majority have only sketchy and superficial knowledge of the stars in the first place, their views cannot be held to be a significant factor in determining the truth of astrology.  The fact that something "is generally agreed" or that "most people believe" something should be viewed critically, asking the question why that factor is considered to matter at all in an argument over truth.  He states that the simple fact that a majority believes something to be true is unsatisfactory justification for believing it to be true.&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Warburton makes a distinction between the fallacy of truth by consensus and the process of [[democracy]] in decision-making.  Democracy is preferable to other processes not because it results in truth, but because it provides for equal participation by multiple special-interest groups, and the avoidance of [[tyranny]].&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Weinberger characterizes [[Jürgen Habermas]] as a proponent of a [[consensus theory of truth]], and criticizes that theory as unacceptable on the following grounds:  First, even if everyone's opinion is in agreement, those opinions may all nonetheless be erroneous.  Second, truth by consensus is conceived as a limit that is approached via an idealized process of discourse; however, it has not been proven that discourse even tends towards such a limit, or that discourse even tends towards ''one single'' limit, and thus it is not proven that truth is the limit that is approached by ideal discourse and consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alternative Action Theory: Simultaneously a Critique of Georg Henrik Von Wright's Practical Philosophy|author=Ota Weinberger|pages=63|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-5184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of printing}}

'''Woodblock printing''' (or block printing) is a technique for [[printing]] text, [[image]]s or patterns used widely throughout [[East Asia]] and originating in [[China]] in antiquity as a method of [[textile printing|printing on textiles]] and later [[paper]]. As a [[Woodblock printing on textiles|method of printing on cloth]], the earliest surviving examples from [[China]] date to before 220 AD. Woodblock printing existed in [[Tang China]] during the 7th century AD and remained the most common East Asian method of printing books and other texts, as well as images, until the 19th century. ''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' is the best known type of [[Japan]]ese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique for printing images on paper are covered by the art term [[woodcut]], except for the [[#15th-century Europe|block-books]] produced mainly in the 15th century in India.

==Seals and stamps==
Prior to the invention of woodblock printing, seals and stamps were used for making impressions. The oldest of these seals came from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The use of round "[[cylinder seal]]s" for rolling an impress onto [[clay tablet]]s goes back to early [[Mesopotamia]]n civilization before 3000 BC, where they are the most common works of art to survive, and feature complex and beautiful images. A few much larger brick (e.g. 13&amp;times;13&amp;nbsp;cm) [[impression seal|stamp]]s for marking clay bricks survive from [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] from around 2270 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoyencollection.com/pre1450.html#21.1 Schoyen collection]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also [[Roman lead pipe inscription]]s of some length that were stamped, and [[amulet MS 5236]] may be a unique surviving gold foil sheet stamped with an [[amulet]] text in the 6th&amp;nbsp;century BC.  However none of these used ink, which is necessary for printing (on a proper definition), but stamped marks into relatively soft materials. In both China and Egypt, the use of [[scaraboid seal|small stamp]]s for seals preceded the use of larger blocks. In Europe and India, the printing of cloth certainly preceded the printing of paper or papyrus; this was probably also the case in China. The process is essentially the same—in Europe special presentation impressions of [[old master print|prints]] were often printed on [[silk]] until at least the 17th century.

==Technique==
[[File:Woodcut Press Skeen 1872.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut press, from engraving in Early Typography by William Skeen, Colombo, Ceylon, 1872]]The wood block is carefully  prepared as a [[relief print|relief]] pattern, which means the areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife, chisel, or sandpaper leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block was cut along the grain of the wood. It is necessary only to ink the block and bring it into firm and even contact with the paper or cloth to achieve an acceptable print. The content would of course print "in reverse" or mirror-image, a further complication when text was involved. The art of carving the woodcut is technically known as ''[[xylography]]'', though the term is rarely used in English.

For colour printing, multiple blocks are used, each for one colour, although overprinting two colours may produce further colours on the print. Multiple colours can be printed by keying the paper to a frame around the woodblocks.

There are three methods of printing to consider:
[[Image:Textildruckmodel - Indien um 1900.jpg|upright|thumb|Woodblock for textile printing, India, about 1900, 22&amp;times;17&amp;times;8 cm]]
; Stamping: Used for many fabrics, and most early European woodcuts (1400–40). These  items were printed by putting paper or fabric on a table or a flat surface with the block on top, and pressing, or hammering, the back of the block.
; Rubbing: Apparently the most common for Far Eastern printing. Used for European woodcuts and block-books later in the 15th century, and very widely for cloth. The block is placed face side up on a table, with the paper or fabric on top. The back of the paper or fabric is rubbed with a "hard pad, a flat piece of wood, a burnisher, or a leather frotton".&lt;ref name="Hind"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p64-94, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Printing in a press: "Presses" only seem to have been used in Asia in relatively recent times. Simple weighted presses may have been used in Europe, but firm evidence is lacking. Later, printing-presses were used (from about 1480). A deceased Abbess of [[Mechelen]] in [[Flanders]] in 1465 had "unum instrumentum ad imprintendum scripturas et ymagines ... cum 14 aliis lapideis printis" ("an instrument for printing texts and pictures ... with 14 stones for printing") which is probably too early to be a [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]-type printing press in that location.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt;

In addition, ''jia xie'' is a method for dyeing textiles (usually silk) using wood blocks invented in the 5th-6th centuries in China. An upper and a lower block is made, with carved out compartments opening to the back, fitted with plugs. The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and clamped between the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth. The method is not strictly printing however, as the pattern is not caused by pressure against the block.&lt;ref name="cave"&gt;Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas", 1990, British Museum publications, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour woodblock printing===
[[File:Hiroshige A large waterfall.jpg|thumb|upright|''Mino province: Yoro-taki'' from the series ''Views of Famous Places in the Sixty-odd Provinces'' by [[Hiroshige]], an [[ukiyo-e]] artist]]

The earliest woodblock printing known is in colour—[[China|Chinese]] [[silk]] from the [[Han dynasty]] printed in three colours.&lt;ref name="cave" /&gt;
On paper, European woodcut prints with coloured blocks were invented in Germany in 1508 and are known as [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s.

Colour is very common in Asian woodblock printing on paper; in [[China]] the first known example is a Diamond sutra of 1341, printed in black and red at the Zifu Temple in modern-day Hubei province. The earliest dated book printed in more than 2 colours is ''Chengshi moyuan'' ({{zh|程氏墨苑}}), a book on ink-cakes printed in 1606 and the technique reached its height in books on art published in the first half of the 17th century. Notable examples are the [[Hu Zhengyan]]'s ''Treatise on the Paintings and Writings of the Ten Bamboo Studio'' of 1633,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shi zhu zhai shu hua pu|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-FH-00910-00083-00098/1|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden|''Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual'']] published in 1679 and 1701.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. |last=Sickman |first2=A. |last2=Soper |title=The Art and Architecture of China |series=Pelican History of Art |edition=3rd |year=1971 |location= |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-14-056110-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], a multi-colour technique called ''[[nishiki-e]]'' ("brocade pictures") spread more widely, and was used for prints from the 1760s on. Japanese woodcut became a major artistic form, although at the time it was accorded a much lower status than painting.

In both Europe and Japan, book illustrations were normally printed in black ink only, and colour reserved for individual artistic prints. In China, the reverse was true, and colour printing was used mainly in books on art and erotica.

==History of woodblock printing==
[[File:Yuan dynasty woodblock.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yuan dynasty|Yuan-dynasty]] woodblock edition of a [[China|Chinese]] play]]

===Origins in Asia===
The earliest woodblock printed fragments to survive are from China and are of silk, printed with flowers in three colours from the [[Han dynasty]] (before AD 220).&lt;ref name="cave"/&gt; It is clear that woodblock printing developed in Asia several centuries before Europe.  The Chinese were the first to use the process to print solid text, and equally that, much later, in Europe the printing of images on cloth developed into the printing of images on paper ([[woodcut]]s). It is also now established that the use in Europe of the same process to print substantial amounts of text together with images in block-books only, came about four hundred years after the development of [[movable type]] by [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051) during the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] of China, .

[[File:WoodcutBuddaChina.jpg|thumb|Coloured woodcut Buddha, 10th century, China]]

In China, an alternative to woodblock printing was a system of [[reprography]] since the Han Dynasty using carved stone [[stele]]s to reproduce pages of text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berner |first=R. Thomas |title=The Ancient Chinese Process of Reprography |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=424–431 |jstor=3107128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three necessary components for woodblock printing are the wood block, which carries the design cut in [[relief carving|relief]]; dye or [[ink]], which had been widely used in the ancient world; and either [[cloth]] or [[paper]], which was first developed in China, around the 3rd century BC or 2nd century BC. Woodblock printing on [[papyrus]] seems never to have been practised, although it would be possible.

A few specimen of wood block printing, possibly called ''tarsh'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], have been excavated from a 10th-century context in [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic Egypt]]. They were mostly used for prayers and amulets. The technique may be spread from China or an independent invention, but had very little impact and virtually disappeared at the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Bulliet&gt;Richard W. Bulliet (1987), "[http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos107-3-1987-rwb.pdf Medieval Arabic Tarsh: A Forgotten Chapter in the History of Printing]", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''107''' (3), pp. 427–438.&lt;/ref&gt; In India the main importance of the technique has always been as a method of printing textiles, which has been a large industry since at least the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jameelcentre.ashmolean.org/collection/6/1272/1274|title=Ashmolean − Eastern Art Online, Yousef Jameel Centre for Islamic and Asian Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of printed Indian silk and [[cotton]] were exported to Europe throughout the [[Modern period]].

Because [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] has a [[character set]] running into the thousands, woodblock printing suits it better than [[movable type]] to the extent that characters only need to be created as they occur in the text. Although the Chinese had invented a form of movable type with baked clay in the 11th century, and metal movable type was invented in Korea in the 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreanhero.net/fiftywonders/FiftyWonders2_English.pdf |title=Fifty Wonders |publisher=Korean Hero |date= |accessdate=2013-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904181045/http://www.koreanhero.net/fiftywonders/FiftyWonders2_English.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; woodblocks continued to be preferred owing to the formidable challenges of typesetting Chinese text with its 40,000 or more characters. Also, the objective of printing in the East may have been more focused on standardization of ritual text (such as the Buddhist canon [[Tripitaka]], requiring 80,000 woodblocks), and the purity of validated woodblocks could be maintained for centuries.&lt;ref name=christensen&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rightreading.com/printing/gutenberg.asia/gutenberg-asia-1-introduction.htm | title=Did East Asian Printing Traditions Influence the European Renaissance? | author=Thomas Christensen | accessdate=2006-10-18 | year= 2007 | publisher = Arts of Asia Magazine (to appear) }}&lt;/ref&gt; When there was a need for the reproduction of a text, the original block could simply be brought out again, while moveable type necessitated error-prone composition of distinct "editions".

In China, [[Korea]], and [[Japan]], the state involved itself in printing at a relatively early stage; initially only the government had the resources to finance the carving of the blocks for long works. The difference between East Asian woodblock printing and the Western [[printing press]] had major implications for the development of book culture and book markets in East Asia and Europe.

===Early printed books in China and Korea===
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from [[Tang Dynasty]] China, the world's earliest dated printed book, AD 868 ([[British Library]])]]

Woodblock printing in China is strongly associated with [[Buddhism]], which encouraged the spread of charms and sutras. In the Tang Dynasty, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] writer named Fenzhi first mentioned in his book "Yuan Xian San Ji" that the woodblock was used to print Buddhist scriptures during the Zhenguan years (AD 627~649).

The oldest existing print done with wood-blocks was discovered in 1974 in an excavation in [[Xi'an]] (the capital of Tang-Dynasty China, then called [[Chang'an]]), [[Shaanxi]], China, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pan |first=Jixing |title=On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |year=1997 |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=976–981 [pp. 979–980] |issn=1001-6538 |doi=10.1007/BF02882611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''[[dharani]]'' sutra printed on [[hemp]] paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"/&gt; Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang Dynasty has also been found, the ''Saddharma pundarika'' sutra printed from 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"/&gt;

[[File:Dharani sutra.jpg|thumb|left|Dharani sutra replica exhibited at [[National Museum of Korea]]]]

An early example of woodblock printing on paper is [[The Great Dharani Sutra]] that is dated between AD 704 and 751. It was found at [[Bulguksa]], [[South Korea]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/7.htm North Korea&amp;nbsp;— Silla Countrystudies.us] accessed 2009-12-03; [http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-yosz.htm ''A History of Writings in Japanese and Current Studies in the Field of Rare Books in Japan''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120130752/http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-yosz.htm |date=2008-11-20 }} - 62nd IFLA General Conference, Ifla.org, accessed 009-12-03; [http://www.rightreading.com/printing/gutenberg.asia/gutenberg-asia-9-korea.htm ''Gutenberg and the Koreans: The Invention of Movable Metal Type Printing in Korea''], Rightreading.com, 2006-09-13, accessed 2009-12-03; [http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000594295&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002187369&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;Menu_code=0000008846&amp;sub_menu= Cho Woo-suk, ''JoongAng Daily'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081555/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000594295&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002187369&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;Menu_code=0000008846&amp;sub_menu= |date=2011-07-19 }}, November 22, 2004, Eng.buddhapia.com, accessed 2009-12-03; [http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/newinfo/Culresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,01260600,37&amp;queryText=V_KDCD=11 National Treasure No. 126-6], by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean), jikimi.cha.go.kr, accessed 2009-12-28; [https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+world+history:+ancient,+medieval,+and+modern%22+by+Peter+N.+Stearns&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y5dGg9u9uJ&amp;sig=u9uP_DdhfHi8qza6fEK1KldlhQM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=upboTP3MK8Kblge0-6nWCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false National Treasure No. 126-6, by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean)]&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Buddhist]] text was printed on a {{convert|8|x|630|cm|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Paper Mulberry|mulberry]] paper scroll in the early Korean Kingdom of [[Unified Silla]]. Another version of the Dharani sutra, printed in Japan around AD 770, is also frequently cited as an example of early printing. One million copies of the sutra, along with other prayers, were ordered to be produced by [[Empress Shōtoku]]. As each copy was then stored in a tiny wooden pagoda, the copies are together known as the ''[[Hyakumantō Darani]]'' (百万塔陀羅尼, "1,000,000 towers/pagodas Darani").

The world's earliest dated (AD 868) printed book is a Chinese scroll about sixteen feet long containing the text of the [[Diamond Sutra]]. It was found in 1907 by the [[archaeologist]] Sir [[Marc Aurel Stein]] in the [[Mogao Caves]] of [[Dunhuang]], and is currently in the possession of the [[British Library]]. The book displays a great maturity of design and layout and speaks of a considerable ancestry for woodblock printing. The [[colophon (book)|colophon]], at the inner end, reads: ''Reverently [caused to be] made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [i.e. 11 May, AD 868 ]''.

[[File:Pen ts'ao, woodblock book 1249-ce.png|thumb|Finely crafted books — like the ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'' shown above — were produced in China as early as the ninth century.&lt;ref name="meggs24"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meggs |first=Philip B. |title=A History of Graphic Design |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1998 |page=24 |isbn=0-471-29198-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In late 10th century China the complete Buddhist canon [[Tripitaka]] of 130,000 pages was printed with blocks, which took between 1080 and 1102, and many other very long works were printed. Early books were on [[scroll]]s, but [[Traditional Chinese bookbinding|other book formats]] were developed. First came the ''Jingzhe zhuang'' or "sutra binding", a scroll folded concertina-wise, which avoided the need to unroll half a scroll to see a passage in the middle. About AD 1000 "butterfly binding" was developed; two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a [[codex]] with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the bindings were sewn rather than pasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |title=Dunhuang concertina binding findings |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000309034110/http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |archivedate=2000-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only relatively small volumes (''[[:wiktionary:菤|juan 卷]]'') were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a ''tao'', with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 ''juan'' in 595 ''tao''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/5/5.18/#2540]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese woodblock prints===

{{Main|Woodblock printing in Japan}}

The earliest known woodblock printing dates from 764-770, when Empress Shotoku commissioned one million small wooden [[pagoda]]s containing short printed scrolls—typically {{convert|6|x|45|cm|abbr=on}}—to be distributed to temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/5/5.18/#2489]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the production of [[Buddhist]] texts, which became widespread from the 11th century in Japan, the process was only adopted in Japan for secular books surprisingly late, and a [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-[[Japanese language|Japanese]] dictionary of 1590 is the earliest known example.

Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a [[movable type]] [[printing-press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], printing equipment&lt;ref name=Lane&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Richard Douglas Lane |last=Lane |first=Richard |year=1978 |title=Images of the Floating World |location=Old Saybrook, CT |publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky |page=33 |isbn=1-56852-481-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army seized from [[Korea]] in 1593&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bonds of Civility: Aesthetic Networks and the Political Origins of Japanese Culture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KsN81J1s70kC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2005-02-28|isbn = 9780521601153|language = en|first = Eiko|last = Ikegami}}&lt;/ref&gt; had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming ''[[shōgun]]'', effected the creation of the first native movable type,&lt;ref name=Lane/&gt; using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.

An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598, using a Korean moveable type printing press, at the order of [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writing would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sansom |first=George |year=1961 |title=A History of Japan: 1334–1615 |location=Stanford, California |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology quickly gained popularity among publishers, and was used to produce affordable prints as well as books. As a result, Japan began to see something of literary mass production and increasing literacy. The content of these books varied widely, including travel guides, advice manuals, ''[[kibyōshi]]'' (satirical novels), ''[[sharebon]]'' (books on urban culture), art books, and play scripts for the ''[[Bunraku|jōruri]]'' (puppet) theatre. Often, within a certain genre, such as the ''jōruri'' theatre scripts, a particular style of writing would come to be the standard for that genre; in other words, one person's personal calligraphic style was adopted as the standard style for printing plays.

===Diffusion in Eurasia===
The technique is found through South and Central Asia, and in the [[Byzantine]] world for cloth, and by AD 1000 examples of woodblock printing on paper appear in Islamic [[Egypt]]. Printing onto cloth had spread much earlier, and was common in Europe by 1300. "In the 13th century the Chinese technique of blockprinting was transmitted to Europe",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rise of Modern China |edition= |last=Hsü |first=Immanuel C. Y. |year= 1970 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-501240-2 |page= 830}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon after paper became available in Europe. The [[old master print|print]] in [[woodcut]], later joined by [[engraving]], quickly became an important cultural tradition for popular religious works, as well as [[playing cards]] and other uses.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt;

Many early Chinese examples, such as the Diamond Sutra (above) contain images, mostly Buddhist, that are often elaborate. Later, some notable artists designed woodblock images for books, but the separate artistic print did not develop in China as it did in Europe and Japan. Apart from devotional images, mainly Buddhist, few "single-leaf" Chinese prints were made until the 19th century.

===15th-century Europe===
[[File:BibliaPauperum.jpg|thumb|upright|Three episodes from a block-book [[Biblia Pauperum]] illustrating [[typology (theology)|typological]] correspondences between the Old and New Testaments: [[Eve]] and the serpent, the [[Annunciation]], [[Gideon]]'s miracle]]
{{Main|block book}}

Block-books, where both text and images are cut on a single block for a whole page, appeared in Europe in the mid-15th century. As they were almost always undated and without statement of printer or place of printing, determining their dates of printing has been an extremely difficult task. [[Allan H. Stevenson]], by comparing the watermarks in the paper used in blockbooks with watermarks in dated documents, concluded that the "heyday" of blockbooks was the 1460s, but that at least one dated from about 1451.&lt;ref name="Carter p. 46"&gt;[[#Carter|Carter]] p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan H. Stevenson, ''The Quincentennnial of Netherlandish Blockbooks'', British Museum Quarterly, Vol. 31, No. 3/4 (Spring 1967), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Block books printed in the 1470s were often of cheaper quality, as a cheaper alternative to books printed by [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  Block books continued to be  printed sporadically up through the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Carter p. 46"/&gt;

The most famous block-books are the [[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]] and the [[Ars moriendi]], though in this the images and text are on different pages, but all block-cut. The [[Biblia pauperum]], a Biblical picture-book, was the next most common title, and the great majority of block-books were popular devotional works. All block-books are fairly short at less than fifty pages. While in Europe movable metal type soon became cheap enough to replace woodblock printing for the reproduction of text, woodcuts remained a major way to reproduce images in illustrated works of early modern European printing. (''See also:'' [[Old master print]].)

Most block-books before about 1480 were printed on only one side of the paper&amp;nbsp;— if they were printed by rubbing it would be difficult to print on both sides without damaging the first one to be printed. Many were printed with two pages per sheet, producing a book with opening of two printed pages, followed by openings with two blank pages (as earlier in China). The blank pages were then glued together to produce a book looking like a type-printed one. Where both sides of a sheet have been printed, it is presumed a [[printing-press]] was used.

The method was also used extensively for printing [[playing cards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://trionfi.com/0/p/20/ created 2003 - 2005        Early Card painters and Printers in Germany, Austria and Flanders (14th and 15th century)]. Retrieved 28 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further development in East Asia===

In East Asia, woodblock printing proved to be more enduring than in Europe, continuing well into the 19th century as the major form of printing texts, especially in China, even after the introduction of the European printing press.

In countries using Arabic, Turkish and similar scripts, works, especially the [[Qur'an]] were sometimes printed by [[lithography]] in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answering-islam.org/Books/Zwemer/Translations/index.htm |title=Qur'an translations |publisher=Answering-islam.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the links between the characters require compromises when movable type is used which were considered inappropriate for sacred texts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Nianhua]] were a form of [[color|coloured]] woodblock prints in China, depicting images for decoration during the [[Chinese New Year]].

Dr. Henry, in his "Notes on the Economic Botany of China," refers to your wish to obtain specimens of the woods used in China for printing blocks. The name which the neighbouring city of [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] enjoys for the excellence of its printing work has led me to inquire into the woods used there, and I am sending you specimens of them by parcel post. The wood which is considered the best is the Veng li mu, which has been identified as the [[Pyrus communis|Pyrus betulcefolia]], Bunge., and which grows in this Province. Slabs of this wood 1 ft. x 6 ins. x 1^ in. cost 150 cash, or about 5½.d. A cheaper wood generally used for printing proclamations is the tu chung mu. [[Eucommia ulmoides]], Oliv., has been determined to be the tu chung mu. The tu chung here used is a native of this Province. A wood used in [[Kiangsu]] is the yin hsing mu, which is one of the names of the Salisburia adiantifolia. Boxwood, huang yang mu, is obtained from [[Szechuen]], but only in small pieces, which are mainly used for cutting the stamps used for private seals on letters and documents. &lt;br&gt;

In the third volume of the Japanese work, the "So Mokn Sei Fu," a drawing is given of the huang yang, together with a quotation from the Chinese Materia Medica, which speaks of the tree as growing an inch a year, except in these years which have an intercalary moon, when it grows backwards. From this it would appear to be a slow growing tree.

Block printing has also been extensively used for decorative purposes such as [[Textile|fabric]]s, [[leather]]s and [[wallpaper]]. This is easiest with repetitive patterns composed of one or a small number of [[motif (art)|motifs]] that are small to medium in size (due to the difficulty of carving and handling larger blocks). For a multi-colour pattern, each colour element is carved as a separate block and individually inked and applied. Block printing was the standard method of producing [[wallpaper]] until the early 20th century, and is still used by a few traditionalist firms. It also remains in use for making cloth, mostly in small artisanal settings, for example in [[India]].

[[William Morris]] was one artist who used woodblock printing to produce patterned wallpaper and textiles during the late 19th century. Examples of Morris' work are housed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. The museum also holds a number of Morris' original woodblocks, which are still in limited use.
