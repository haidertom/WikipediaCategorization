'''Allegany College of Maryland''' (or '''ACM''') is a two-year public community college located in [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], [[Maryland]]. It was previously known as '''Allegany Community College''' (or '''ACC''').

== History ==

Allegany College of Maryland began operations in 1961 as "Allegany Community College" in an old public school facility (the segregationist era all-black Carver Community School) that had been closed by the Allegany County Board of Education. The College opened with an enrollment of 122 students from Allegany County under the direction of ACM’s first president, Dr. Robert S. Zimmer.

In 1969, the College moved to a new campus consisting of seven buildings on a 316-acre (1.3&amp;nbsp;km²) tract in suburban Cumberland that was partially funded by the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]]. Enrollment reached the 1000 mark in credit programs during the first year on the new campus and community service and continuing education courses and programs began. Since that time, the campus has expanded to include 15 buildings, which provide modern facilities for both credit and non-credit students.

The College opened two Pennsylvania campuses in 1989 ([[Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Somerset County]] Campus in [[Somerset, Pennsylvania]]) and 1990 ([[Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Bedford County]] Campus in [[Everett, Pennsylvania]]). It expanded its Hospitality Management and Culinary Arts programs into the Gateway Center located in downtown Cumberland in 2002.

The College now serves over 3,700 credit students and over 15,000 continuing education registrations. Over 1,000 of these credit students are served at the Pennsylvania campuses.

On January 17, 2017 it was announced that the Somerset location will close following the Spring 2017 semester.

== Programs ==

The College offers over 53 associate degrees, 23 certificates, and 21 letters of recognition.

== Athletics ==
The College's men's baseball and basketball teams have been consistently ranked in the top 20 of their respective [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA) Divisions. The baseball team participated in the NJCAA national tournaments nine times, including a four-year run from 1994-1997. The men's basketball team has participated twelve times in the NJCAA national tournament in 1995-96 (finished 2nd), 1997–98, 2000–01 (finished 2nd), 2001–02, 2003–04 and 2007–08.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electroniccampus.org/CampusTour/undergraduate/1256/Allegany_College_of_Maryland/Allegany_College_of_Maryland1.html Electronic Campus - Select a College - Campus Tours - Allegany College of Maryland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance and accreditation ==
The [[Maryland Higher Education Commission]] (MHEC) oversees and coordinates higher education in the State of Maryland including academic and financial policies at the College. An eight-member Board of Trustees, appointed by the [[Governor of Maryland|Governor of the State of Maryland]], governs the College. The College also has an advisory board for each of its two Pennsylvania Campuses—the Bedford County Campus Advisory Committee ([[Bedford County, Pennsylvania]]) and the Somerset County Campus Advisory Committee ([[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]]).

The college is a member of the [[Maryland Association of Community Colleges]] (MACC) and is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education, [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]]. The College is also accredited and approved for operation by MHEC. The [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]] has granted certification to Allegany College of Maryland campuses in Bedford and Somerset counties and to the academic programs they offer.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5640">The '''Art Elective Program (AEP)''' is offered by schools in [[Singapore]] that have obtained permission from the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]]. This programme is also known as Higher Art and can also be offered as a [[Singapore]]-[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] [[General Certificate of Education]] [[GCE Ordinary Level|Ordinary Level]] (O-level) subject.

Lessons for the AEP are usually conducted in a separate classroom, sometimes after regular classes. Schools that offer AEP as a subject normally have an art room, a media lab and facilities to store and use art materials. In AEP, students learn how to design or work with digital art programs such as [[Adobe Illustrator]]. Techniques with basic media such as pencil, pen, and paint are taught.

The lessons also include Study Of the Visual Arts (SOVA), in which the students are taught to analyze works by renowned artists. 

==History==
AEP was announced in 1983 by the Ministry of Education. It was conceived as an enrichment programme for students with an artistic flair. It was started in January 1984 by the Chinese High School and the Nanyang Girls' High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19830825-1.2.61.aspx|title=Two schools to start flair for art programme|date=25 August 1983|newspaper=The Straits Times|page=14|access-date=10 April 2016|via=NewspaperSG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEP is designed to enable students with artistic abilities to undertake an enriched art programme. The AEP curriculum aims to develop students’ conceptual and analytical thinking and creativity. Samples of the AEP curriculum and students’ creative processes and artworks can be found in the catalogue published for the AEP exhibition.

==Projects==
Every year, students create at least two projects within the spectrum of art and design, such as photography or designing a logo. Projects are weighted heavily in the overall grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seab.gov.sg/pages/nationalExaminations/GOL/School_Candidates/2016_GCE_O.asp|title=SEAB list of O'level subject syllabus|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.seab.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examinations==
Throughout the year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/education-system/ |title= SEAB Education System Website|publisher=www.moe.gov.sg|date= |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;the students prepare SOVA and Drawing and Painting papers. The four exams are Continual Assessments 1 and 2, Semester Assessments 1 and 2. Drawing and Painting examinations vary in duration and students are allowed to create an art piece over around 2–3 hours. Two weeks before the Drawing and Painting exams, students are given several themes to choose from. They then have two weeks to complete their assigned task. The exam is marked according to five components: Investigation and Interpretation of Theme, Exploration and Development of Theme, Aesthetic Qualities, Control of Materials and Technical Processes and Personal Response. For the SOVA examination, students are tested on several artists whom they have studied. They examine selected artworks by these artists and interpret their styles and the methods applied to produce the artwork. This paper is considered a "theory" examination.

'''''SRM – Associazione Studi e Ricerche per il Mezzogiorno'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sr-m.it/?lang=en |title=Official Website|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Italy|Italian]] Study Centre founded in [[Naples]] in 2003 which aims to improve the knowledge of Italian economy in terms of infrastructural, productive and social assets, proceeding from a European and Mediterranean perspective. From the Study Centre of the [[Banco di Napoli]], established in 1931, SRM inherited a consolidated know-how in the analysis of the economic dynamics of the South of Italy. Over the years, it has implemented its research from an international point of view.

Its founders are four banks of the [[Intesa Sanpaolo Group]], the Banco di Napoli Foundation and the Turin-based Compagnia di San Paolo Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.compagniadisanpaolo.it/|title=Compagnia di San Paolo|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the [[President (corporate title)|President]] of SRM is Paolo Scudieri and the [[General Manager]] is Massimo Deandreis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sr-m.it/chi-siamo/?lang=en |title=About Us|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and Research==

SRM is a Study Centre related to the [[Intesa Sanpaolo Group]]. It specializes in the analysis of regional economic dynamics, with a particular eye towards Southern Italy. In this context, it carries out studies and research monitoring of the performance of productive sectors, investigating economic and financial scenarios, interdependence and internationalisation, and the economic value of the non-profit sector. SRM publishes studies and research in three types of publishing products: monographic research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/ricerche-monografiche-en/?lang=en|title=Researches|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; periodical reports &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/rapporti-periodici/?lang=en|title=Periodical Reports|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/reviews/?lang=en|title=Reviews|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Since 2003 SRM has provided much research on topics related to numerous Italian economic sectors: automotive, aerospace, agri-food, pharmaceutical, textile, tourism, water, renewable energy, and many others.
* Among the periodic reports, SRM has a line of reports produced in collaboration with other Institutes: the semi-yearly report "Check up Mezzogiorno"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/check-up-mezzogiorno/|title=Check Up Mezzogiorno|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[Confindustria]]; the "Territorial Finance in Italy" Report, in collaboration with IRES, IRPET, Eupolis Lombardia, IPRES and Liguria Ricerche; and the Report on the internationalisation of Italian regions, in collaboration with Intesa Sanpaolo Research Department. SRM also publishes the Young Entrepreneurs Observatory and the Mezzogiorno Bulletin.
* SRM also edits three magazines. Since 1993, it has been publishing the bi-monthly magazine ''Dossier Unione Europea'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/dossier-ue/|title= Dossier UE|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to monitor European policies and their impact on the Italian economy. Since 2004, it has been editing the international magazine ''Rassegna Economica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/rassegna-economica/|title= Rassegna Economica|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1931 by the Banco di Napoli. Since 2016, SRM has also published a half-yearly magazine ''Quaderni di Economia Sociale'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/quaderni-di-economia-sociale//|title= Quaderni di Economia Sociale|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject of non-profit and social solidarity, carried out together with the Fondazione con il Sud and with the collaboration of Banca Prossima ([[Intesa Sanpaolo]] Banking Group), established as a periodic report in 2012.

SRM has also activated two permanent observatories: the first one, on the Maritime Economy, monitors the economic impact of the logistics and maritime transport sector; the second, on the Mediterranean Economy, monitors the dynamics of the commercial relations between Italy (and in particular the South of Italy) and the Mediterranean countries. Italy, including its southern regions, plays a natural role as an economic and logistic bridge between Europe and the southern shores of the Mediterranean, where the great maritime trade routes pass to and from Asia and America.

==Maritime Economy Permanent Observatory==

''Maritime Economy'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/|title=Maritime Economy|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a SRM project born in 2014 with the aim to establish a permanent observatory on the logistics and maritime transport sector. SRM has always had a consolidated research area dedicated to this field of studies because it has always believed that efficient and effective maritime transport fosters internationalization, innovation, investments in infrastructure, and employment and GDP growth.

The Maritime Economy Observatory manifests itself in a website (http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/ - in [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]) that offers a wealth of analysis and studies on the topic of maritime transport seen from a variety of standpoints: from the business side (e.g. the shipping industry), from the point of view of infrastructures (ports), and in terms of individual sectors and territories (for instance by taking a closer look at the maritime transport strategies pursued by other countries).

An Annual Report titled "Italian Maritime Economy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/cp/annual-report/|title= Italian Maritime Economy Annual Report|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published every year, in June. This Report is the result of SRM analyses and its study missions abroad. It includes also scientific articles by international experts in the sector. In the course of its research activity on the maritime economy, SRM has created numerous "networks" formed by entities of varying nature - business associations, companies, infrastructure components, institutions – each of which, in its own way, provides added value to the research activity and papers offered.

SRM, in Shanghai on 13 December 2016, signed the Cooperation Agreement called "Global Shipping Think Tank Alliance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/srm-firma-a-shanghai-laccordo-global-shipping-think-tank-alliance/?lang=en|title= Global Shipping Think Tank Alliance|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a partnership fostered by the Shanghai International Shipping Institute (SISI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.sisi-smu.org/|title= Shangai International Shipping Institute|publisher=SISI}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most important Chinese research centres in the world for research on shipping, logistics and the port industry. The Agreement involves the most prestigious research institutes on the maritime economy of [[China]], [[Japan]], [[the United States]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Germany]] and the [[UK]]. SRM was the only Italian study centre and one of three European entities to become a partner in the initiative, which was endorsed to implement joint studies on maritime transport, to exchange research and analysis methods, to propose policies to public policy makers with the aim to develop port and logistics infrastructure, and to organize meetings to discuss and debate the economic trends of the sea-related sectors.
With this agreement SRM strengthens its ability to analyse and forecast trends in the economics of the maritime industry and the dynamics of shipping and port logistics, expanding its cooperation with international economic think tanks such as the [[Kühne Logistics University of Hamburg]], the [[University of Antwerp]] and the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]], which are globally recognized in the field of the maritime economy.

==Mediterranean Economy Permanent Observatory==

The Permanent Observatory on the Economic Relations between Italy and the Mediterranean Area &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-med.com/|title= Mediterranean Observatory|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a project realized by SRM and born in 2011 thanks to the sponsorship of the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Compagnia di San Paolo]]&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; with the aim to monitor and study the dynamics and the impact of mutual economic relations between [[Italy]] (and in particular Southern Italy) and the Mediterranean Area.

SRM has established this new field of research developing a strong network of relations with other national and international Research Centres on the Mediterranean Area. The Observatory analyses in particular two geographic areas - the Southern Mediterranean Area ([[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]]) and the Eastern Mediterranean Area ([[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]]) - investigating the commercial, financial, infrastructural, entrepreneurial, energetic and technological inter-exchange relations, paying special attention to business indicators and normative-institutional dynamics affecting the Euro-Mediterranean Area. The Adriatic Mediterranean Area ([[Albania]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Montenegro]]) is investigated separately. Since 2015 the analysis has been extended to the [[Gulf Countries]] ([[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[United Arab Emirates]]).

SRM Med Observatory represents a permanent laboratory the activity of which takes place on the website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9862">'''Aubrey Levin''' (born December 18, 1938)&lt;ref&gt;Birthdate according to his statement to Calgary police&lt;/ref&gt; is a South African-born Canadian psychiatrist and former Colonel in the [[South African Defence Force]] who used abusive procedures on homosexual army conscripts and conscientious objectors in an attempt to cure them of supposed vices in [[apartheid era]] South Africa. 

During the 1970s and 1980s, Levin subjected many homosexual men to [[electroshock]] or [[chemical castration]], and over 900 conscripts were forced to undergo involuntary [[sexual reassignment surgery]].&lt;!--Do not replace SRS with 'gender reassignment', 'gender confirmation', or any of the other gender-related SRS synonyms.  This is SRS as mutilation, not gender confirmation.--&gt;

In 1995 Levin moved to Canada and acquired a license to practice medicine. He became professor of clinical [[psychiatry]] at the [[University of Calgary]].  In 2010 he was arrested for sexual assault of a patient; thirty men claimed they were assaulted by Levin during counseling.  Levin was tried and convicted for assault, sentenced to five years in prison, and his medical license was suspended.

==Life and career==
Levin was first licensed as a psychiatrist in [[South Africa]] in 1969. He was a Colonel in the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF), as well as the chief psychiatrist at the [[Voortrekkerhoogte]] military hospital during the 1970s, during which time he was the attending psychiatrist at [[Greefswald]], an isolated detention barracks where harsh conditions were supposed to cure conscripts of supposed vices and conscientious objections. Among his patients was [[Gordon Torr]] who wrote about his experience in the book, ''Kill Yourself and Count to 10'' (2014). Levin later served at Addington Hospital in Durban (1975-1981) and at [[Fort England Psychiatric Hospital]] in Grahamstown.&lt;ref name=Poplak&gt;Richard Poplak,"Dr. Shock", ''The Walrus'', September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relocation to Canada===
Meanwhile, in 1995, Levin and his wife left South Africa and he became licensed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of [[Saskatchewan]], Canada and later by [[Alberta]]'s college in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tetley |first=Deborah |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Prominent+Calgary+psychiatrist+facing+assault+charge/2720353/story.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412030417/http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Prominent%2BCalgary%2Bpsychiatrist%2Bfacing%2Bassault%2Bcharge/2720353/story.html |archivedate=2010-04-12 |title=Prominent Calgary psychiatrist facing sex assault charge |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2013-02-04 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta suspended Levin's license&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elderadvocates.ca/courtroom-psychiatrist-charged-in-sex-assault/ |title=Courtroom psychiatrist charged in sex assault &amp;#124; Elder Advocates Of Alberta Society |publisher=Elderadvocates.ca |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; over accusations of abuse after a male patient secretly filmed the psychiatrist allegedly making sexual advances.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

===Trial and conviction===
A pre-trial hearing determined that Levin was fit to stand trial although in the early stages of dementia.&lt;ref name="Daryl Slade, Calgary Herald"&gt;{{cite web|author=Daryl Slade, Calgary Herald : |url=http://www.globaltvcalgary.com/psychiatrist+charged+with+sexual+assault+mentally+unfit+to+stand+trial+court+hears/6442728043/story.html |title=Global Calgary &amp;#124; Psychiatrist charged with sexual assault mentally unfit to stand trial, court hears |publisher=Globaltvcalgary.com |date=2012-10-04 |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; July 2010, police announced that 30 other men had come forward, claiming they were assaulted by Levin during counseling sessions. On October 11, 2012 Levin went to trial at the Court of Queen's Bench in Calgary. The Crown decided to go ahead with nine of the original 21 cases. During the trial, a jury was shown the graphic video of Levin touching a patient, which had been secretly recorded on the patient's [camera wristwatch]. On January 28, 2013, a jury found Dr. Levin guilty of three charges of sexual assault against male patients, not guilty of two other charges of sexual assault, while a [[mistrial]] was declared in reference to a further four counts.&lt;ref name="Daryl Slade, Calgary Herald" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jan 28, 2013 12:27 PM MT |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2013/01/28/calgary-levin-jury-sent-back.html |title=Calgary ex-psychiatrist found guilty of sexual assault - Calgary - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2013-01-29 |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGreal-2012"&gt;{{cite news|author=Chris McGreal in Portland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/canadian-psychiatrist-dr-shock-trial |title=Canadian psychiatrist 'Dr Shock' stands trial on sexual abuse charges &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2012-10-10 |accessdate=2013-02-04 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; February 7, 2013 police arrested Dr. Levin's wife Erica Levin, then aged 69, and charged her with obstruction of justice for alleging attempting to bribe a juror. The juror said she was approached on a train platform in January and offered $1000 or $10,000 in a white envelope, to bring in a not-guilty verdict. The juror informed police and was subsequently dismissed.

Despite a 5-year prison sentence Levin was released on $15,000 bail on February 13, 2013. The judge said that, since his license to practice medicine has been suspended, he is "not a danger to the public.". Levin awaits an appeal (Sept.2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/541532/timeline-dr-aubrey-levin/|title=TIMELINE: Dr. Aubrey Levin|work=Global News|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2014 the Alberta Court of Appeal, in a unanimous decision, upheld the 2013 conviction. Dr. Levin was ordered to report, within 48 hours, to begin a five-year sentence at an unnamed institution.&lt;ref name=Poplak/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6973">'''Cancer slope factors''' (CSF) are used to estimate the risk of [[cancer]] associated with exposure to a [[carcinogen]]ic or potentially carcinogenic substance. A slope factor is an upper bound, approximating a 95% [[confidence limit]], on the increased cancer risk from a lifetime exposure to an agent by [[ingestion]] or [[inhalation]]. This estimate, usually expressed in units of proportion (of a population) affected per mg of substance/kg [[body weight]]-day, is generally reserved for use in the low-dose region of the [[dose-response relationship]], that is, for exposures corresponding to risks greater than 1 in 100.&lt;ref name="IRIS"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/iris/help_ques.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Slope factors are also referred to as cancer potency factors (PF).

==Toxicity Assessments for Carcinogenic Effects==

For carcinogens, it is commonly assumed that a small number of molecular events may evoke changes in a single cell that can lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation and eventually to a clinical diagnosis of cancer.  This [[toxicity]] of carcinogens is referred to as being "non-threshold" because there is believed to be essentially no level of exposure that does not pose some probability of producing a carcinogenic response, therefore, there is no dose that can be considered to be risk-free. However, some (non-genotoxic) carcinogens may exhibit a threshold whereby doses lower than the threshold do not invoke a carcinogenic response. 

When evaluating cancer risks of genotoxic carcinogens, theoretically an effect threshold cannot be estimated.  For [[chemical]]s that are carcinogens, a two-part evaluation to quantify risk is often employed in which the substance first is assigned a weight-of-evidence classification, and then a ''slope factor'' is calculated.&lt;ref name ="RAGS"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oswer/riskassessment/ragsa/pdf/ch7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generating a Slope Factor==

When the chemical is a known or probable human carcinogen, a toxicity value that defines quantitatively the relationship between dose and response (i.e., the slope factor) is calculated.  Because risk at low exposure levels is difficult to measure directly either by animal experiments or by [[Epidemiology|epidemiologic studies]], the development of a slope factor generally entails applying a model to the available ''[[data set]]'' and using the model to extrapolate from the relatively high doses administered to experimental animals (or the exposures noted in epidemiologic studies) to the lower exposure levels expected for human contact in the environment.&lt;ref name="RAGS" /&gt;

==Data Sets==

High-quality human data (e.g. high quality epidemiological studies) on carcinogens are preferable to animal data. When human data are limited, the most sensitive species is given the greatest emphasis.  Occasionally, in situations where no single study is judged most appropriate, yet several studies collectively support the estimate, the [[geometric mean]] of estimates from all studies may be adopted as the slope.  This practice ensures the inclusion of all relevant data.&lt;ref name="RAGS" /&gt;

==Weight-of-Evidence Classification for Carcinogens==

Slope factors are typically calculated for potential carcinogens in classes A, B1, and B2.  Quantitative estimation of slope factors for the chemicals in class C proceeds on a case-by-case basis. The slope factor is used in risk assessments to estimate an upper-bound lifetime probability of an individual developing cancer as a result of exposure to a   particular level of a potential carcinogen.  Slope  factors should always be accompanied by the ''weight of-evidence'' classification to indicate the strength of the evidence that the agent is a human carcinogen.&lt;ref name="RAGS" /&gt;

* A = Human carcinogen
* B1 = indicates that limited human data are available.
* B2 = indicates sufficient evidence in animals and inadequate or no evidence in humans.
* C = Possible human carcinogen
* D = Not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity
* E = Evidence of non-carcinogenicity for humans

==Calculation of Cancer Risk==
For each age interval "i", the cancer risk for exposure by a specified pathway is computed as:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oswer/riskassessment/sghandbook/riskcalcs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\text{Risk}_i = C \cdot \frac{IR_i \cdot EF_i \cdot ED_i}{BW_i \cdot AT} \cdot SF \cdot ADAF_i
&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:C = Concentration of the chemical in the contaminated environmental medium (soil or water) to which the person is exposed. The units are mg/kg for soil and mg/L for water.
:IR&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Intake rate of the contaminated environmental medium for age bin "i". The units are kg/day for soil and L/day for water.
:BW&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Body weight of the exposed person for age bin "i".
:EF&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Exposure frequency for age bin "i" (days/year). This describes how often a person is exposed to the contaminated medium over the course of a typical year.
:ED&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Exposure duration for age bin "i" (years). This describes how long a person is exposed to the contaminated medium over the course of their lifetime.
:AT = Averaged time, in days. This term specifies the length of time over which the average dose is calculated. For quantifying cancer risk a "lifetime" of 70 years is used (i.e, 70 years times 365 days/year).
:SF = Cancer slope factor (mg/kg-day)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
:ADAF = Age-dependant adjustment factor for age bin "i" (unitless)

==Risk Specific Dose (RSD)==

The '''Cancer Slope Factor''' is used to derive the Risk Specific Dose (RSD)(mg/kg-day) for direct-acting carcinogenic agents, those that cause chemical changes ([[mutation]]s) in [[DNA]].  It is also the default choice for carcinogens when there are insufficient data to demonstrate that the mode of action of the chemical is nonlinear.  The RSD is often calculated based on a one-in-a-million extra risk (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; risk) or a one-in-a-hundred-thousand risk (10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; risk) for other-than highly exposed individuals.  The term "extra" in the definition of the RSD refers to a risk from environmental exposure to the chemical of interest above the background risk that is always present.&lt;ref&gt;http://water.epa.gov/learn/training/wacademy/health_page15.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula to calculate the RSD for a chemical based on a one-in-a-million extra risk (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; risk) is:  RSD = 0.000001 / CSF

==Potency Factor==
The CSF is also called a "potency factor" and is used to calculate the Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk by multiplying the CSF by the chronic daily intake (CDI).  The CDI is the dose over a lifetime and is expressed in mg/kg-day.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental law, policy, and economics: reclaiming the environmental agenda By Nicholas Askounes Ashford, Charles C. Caldart (Page 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Causation in Sciences Project''' ('''CauSci''') is a 4-year interdisciplinary research project on the field of [[Causality|causation]] in the [[Philosophy of science|Philosophy of Science]], funded by the [[Norwegian Research Council]] (NFR) and hosted by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131015073703/http://www.umb.no/ior-en School of Economics and Business] at the [[Norwegian University of Life Sciences]] (NMBU).

[[Causality]] is one of the key concepts employed in the sciences. In our attempt to understand and influence the world around us, one of the main things we need to know is what causes what. Once we understand the causal connections, we are in a position to explain what has gone before, predict what will come in the future, and intervene to produce the outcomes we require. While scientists deal with the concrete details, it is [[Philosophy|philosophers]] who consider in the abstract what it is for one thing to cause another. The aim of this project is to bring together that abstract philosophical approach to causation with a more concrete understanding of the work actually undertaken by the practitioners of the sciences.

[http://www.umb.no/causci/article/about-causci CauSci] is based on a [[Disposition (philosophy)|dispositional]] theory of causation, in which a cause is understood as [[Event (philosophy)|event]] that disposes towards an [[result|effect or outcome]]. A further key theme for causation comes from that this theory, namely [[Reductionism]] versus [[holism]] in the sciences. Many philosophers have been attracted to a reductive view of nature in which everything is to be explained ultimately in terms of [[Subatomic particle|subatomic particles.]] But is there any evidence for the success of reductionism in the sciences or is the view a mere philosophers’ fancy? It appears, on the contrary, that many sciences are premised on holistic phenomena that cannot be reduced to the sum of their parts: at certain levels of nature, new [[causality|causal powers]] emerge that cannot be explained at relatively lower levels. Nature is stratified.

The project aims to test the existing dispositional theory of causation against four key sciences in which the issues of causation, emergentism and reduction are central: physics, biology, psychology and the social sciences. While the theory aims to offer new insights that explain practice within these sciences, the theory in return will gain a more empirically informed grounding. A team of [http://www.umb.no/causci/article/people Norwegian and international] researchers in these four fields have been recruited as collaborators to the project.

== Methodology ==
The methodological basis of the project is that [[philosophy]] should not dictate to [[science]] and nor should science dictate to philosophy. While these two disciplines have the same subject matter - understanding the world - they aim to answer very different questions. What can be achieved, however, is a reflective equilibrium: a unified view of causation that is both philosophically and [[empirically]] satisfactory. It is all well and good for philosophers to decide [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] what would make a good theory of causation, but what use is that if scientists are dealing with something else? By considering both the abstract and the concrete together in unison, an account can emerge that is both philosophically and empirically adequate and complete.

Four central sciences have been selected against which to test and improve the [http://www.umb.no/causci/article/causal-dispositionalism causal dispositionalist] hypothesis. The approach will be to apply the theory to some of the key problems within that science. It will be taken as a sign of success for the theory if it is able to solve those problems or at the very least offer some illumination of them. The sciences are selected on the basis of their centrality but also their diversity. Theories of causation are sometimes criticised on the basis that they explain only causation in physics, for instance, but with no indication of how they could apply to biological, social or mental causation. The four sciences selected therefore cover some of the most important divisions across human thinking: matter, life, mind and society.

The '''comedy of humours''' is  a [[genre]] of [[drama]]tic [[comedy]] that focuses on a [[fictional character|character]] or range of characters, each of whom exhibits two or more overriding traits or '[[Humorism|humours]]' that dominates their personality, desires and conduct. This comic technique may be found in [[Aristophanes]], but the [[England|English]] [[playwright]]s [[Ben Jonson]] and [[George Chapman]] popularized the genre in the closing years of the sixteenth century. In the later half of the seventeenth century, it was combined with the [[comedy of manners]] in [[Restoration comedy]]. 

[[Image:Lavater1792.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The four '[[Humourism|humours]]' or temperaments (Clockwise from top right; [[choleric]]; [[Melancholia|melancholic]]; [[Four temperaments#Sanguine|sanguine]]; [[phlegmatic]]).]]
In Jonson’s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (acted 1598), which made this type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] popular, all the words and acts of Kitely are controlled by an overpowering suspicion that his wife is unfaithful; George Downright, a country squire, must be "frank" above all things; the country gull in town determines his every decision by his desire to "catch on" to the manners of the city gallant. 

In his [[Induction (play)|Induction]] to ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'' (1599) Jonson explains his character-formula thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some one peculiar quality&lt;br /&gt;Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw&lt;br /&gt;All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,&lt;br /&gt;In their confluctions, all to run one way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comedy of humours owes something to earlier vernacular comedy but more to a desire to imitate the classical comedy of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]] and to combat the vogue of [[Shakespearean comedy|romantic comedy]], as developed by [[William Shakespeare]]. The satiric purpose of the comedy of humours and its realistic method lead to more serious character studies with Jonson’s ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''. The humours each had been associated with physical and mental characteristics; the result was a system that was quite subtle in its capacity for describing types of personality.

'''Corroborating evidence''' (or '''corroboration''') is evidence that supports a proposition already supported by initial evidence, therefore confirming the original proposition. For example, W, a witness, testifies that she saw X drive his automobile into a green car.  Meanwhile, Y, another witness, testifies that when he examined X's car, later that day, he noticed green paint on its fender. There can also be corroborating evidence related to a certain source, such as what makes an author think a certain way due to the evidence that was supplied by witnesses or objects.&lt;ref&gt;For more information on this type of reasoning, see: [[Casuistry]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of corroborating evidence comes from using the [[Baconian method]], i.e. the  [[method of agreement]], [[Mill's Methods#Method of difference|method of difference]], and [[method of concomitant variations]].

These methods are followed in [[experimental design]]. They were codified by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]], and developed further by [[John Stuart Mill]] and consist of controlling several [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]], in turn, to establish which variables are [[causality|causally]] connected. These principles are widely used intuitively in various kinds of proofs, demonstrations and investigations, in addition to being fundamental to experimental design.

In law, corroboration refers to the requirement in some jurisdictions, such as in [[Scots Law|Scotland]], that any evidence adduced be backed up by at least one other source (see [[Corroboration in Scots law]]).

==Corroboration broken down==
If one person says, “this is what I intended by the action I took,” and his friend agrees that his actions could have looked like what their friend intended. Then it can be generally agreed that is what happened.

If one person says, “this is what I meant by what I said,” and his friend agrees that was their understanding of what was meant by their friend. Then it can be generally agreed that is what was meant.

==An example of corroboration==
Defendant says "It was like what he/she (a witness) said and...". This is corroborative evidence from the defendant that the evidence the witness gave is true and correct.

Corroboration is not needed in certain instances. For example, there are certain statutory exceptions. In the [[Education (Scotland) Act]], it is only necessary to produce a register as proof of lack of attendance. No further evidence is needed.

==England and Wales==
'''Perjury'''

See section 13 of the [[Perjury Act 1911]].

'''Speeding offences'''

See section 89(2) of the [[Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984]].

'''Sexual offences'''

See section 32 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].

'''Confessions by mentally handicapped persons'''

See section 77 of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]].

{{Economic anthropology|Related articles}}
{{more footnotes|date=July 2010}}
The '''culture of poverty''' is a concept in [[social theory]] that asserts that the values of people experiencing poverty play a significant role in perpetuating their impoverished condition, sustaining a [[cycle of poverty]] across generations.  It attracted academic and policy attention in the 1970s, received academic criticism ({{harvnb|Goode|Eames|1996}}; {{harvnb|Bourgois|2001}}; {{harvnb|Small|Harding|Lamont|2010}}), and made a comeback at the beginning of the 21st century.{{sfn|Cohen|2010}} It offers one way to explain why poverty exists despite anti-poverty programs. Critics of the early culture of poverty arguments insist that explanations of poverty must analyze how structural factors interact with and condition individual characteristics ({{harvnb|Goode|Eames|1996}}; {{harvnb|Bourgois|2001}}; {{harvnb|Small|Harding|Lamont|2010}}). As put by {{harvtxt|Small|Harding|Lamont|2010}}, "since human action is both constrained and enabled by the meaning people give to their actions, these dynamics should become central to our understanding of the production and reproduction of poverty and social inequality."

== Early formulations ==
Early proponents of the theory argued that the poor are not only lacking resources but also acquire a poverty-perpetuating [[value system]]. According to anthropologist [[Oscar Lewis]], "The subculture [of the poor] develops mechanisms that tend to perpetuate it, especially because of what happens to the worldview, aspirations, and character of the children who grow up in it". {{harv|Lewis|1969|p=199}}

Some later scholars ({{harvnb|Young|2004}}; {{harvnb|Newman|1999}}; {{harvnb|Edin|Kefalas|2005}}; {{harvnb|Dohan|2003}}; {{harvnb|Hayes|2003}}; {{harvnb|Carter|2005}}; {{harvnb|Waller|2002}}; {{harvnb|Duneier|1992}}) contend that the poor do not have different values.

The term "subculture of poverty" (later shortened to "culture of poverty") made its first appearance in Lewis's ethnography ''Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty'' [[#CITEREFLewis1959|(1959)]]. Lewis struggled to render "the poor" as legitimate subjects whose lives were transformed by [[poverty]]. He argued that although the burdens of poverty were systemic and so imposed upon these members of society, they led to the formation of an autonomous subculture as children were socialized into behaviors and attitudes that perpetuated their inability to escape the [[underclass]].

Lewis gave 70 characteristics ([[#CITEREFLewis1996|1996 [1966]]], [[#CITEREFLewis1998|1998]]) that indicated the presence of the culture of poverty, which he argued was not shared among all of the lower classes.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;
The people in the culture of poverty have a strong feeling of marginality, of helplessness, of dependency, of not belonging. They are like aliens in their own country, convinced that the existing institutions do not serve their interests and needs. Along with this feeling of powerlessness is a widespread feeling of inferiority, of personal unworthiness. This is true of the slum dwellers of [[Mexico City]], who do not constitute a distinct ethnic or [[race (human classification)|racial group]] and do not suffer from racial discrimination. In the [[United States]] the culture of poverty that exists in the black community has the additional disadvantage of perceived [[racial discrimination]].

People with a culture of poverty have very little sense of history. They are a marginal people who know only their own troubles, their own local conditions, their own neighborhood, their own way of life. Usually, they have neither the knowledge, the vision nor the [[ideology]] to see the similarities between their problems and those of others like themselves elsewhere in the world. In other words, they are not [[class conscious]], although they are very sensitive indeed to status distinctions. When the poor become class conscious or members of trade union organizations, or when they adopt an internationalist outlook on the world they are, in my view, no longer part of the culture of poverty although they may still be desperately poor.
&lt;/cite&gt; {{harv|Lewis|1998}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Lewis was concerned with poverty in the developing world, the culture of poverty concept proved attractive to US public policy makers and politicians. It strongly informed documents such as the [[Moynihan Report]] (1965) as well as the [[War on Poverty]], more generally.

The culture of poverty also emerges as a key concept in [[Michael Harrington]]'s discussion of American poverty in ''[[The Other America]]'' ([[#CITEREFHarrington1962|1962]]). For Harrington, the culture of poverty is a structural concept defined by social institutions of exclusion that create and perpetuate the cycle of poverty in America.

== Reactions ==
Since the 1960s, critics of culture of poverty explanations for the persistence of the underclasses have attempted to show that real world data do not fit Lewis's model {{harv|Goode|Eames|1996}}. In 1974, anthropologist Carol Stack issued a critique of it, calling it "fatalistic" and noticing the way that believing in the idea of a culture of poverty does not describe the poor so much as it serves the interests of the rich.

She writes, citing Hylan Lewis another critics of Oscar Lewis' Culture of Poverty:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The culture of poverty, as Hylan Lewis points out, has a fundamental political nature.  The ideas matters most to political and scientific groups attempting to rationalize why some Americans have failed to make it in American society. It is, Lewis (1971) argues, 'an idea that people believe, want to believe, and perhaps need to believe.' They want to believe that raising the income of the poor would not change their life styles or values, but merely funnel greater sums of money into bottomless, self-destructing pits. This fatalistic view has wide acceptance among scholars, welfare planners, and the voting public. Indeed, even at the most prestigious university, the country's theories alleging racial inferiority have become increasingly prevalent. 
{{sfn|Stack|1974}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, she demonstrates the way that political interests to keep the wages of the poor low create a climate in which it is politically convenient to buy into the idea of culture of poverty {{harv|Stack|1974}}. In sociology and anthropology, the concept created a backlash, pushing scholars to look to structures rather than "[[blaming-the-victim]]" {{harv|Bourgois|2001}}.

Since the late 1990s, the culture of poverty has witnessed a resurgence in the social sciences, but most scholars now reject the notion of a monolithic and unchanging culture of poverty. Newer research typically rejects the idea that whether people are poor can be explained by their values. It is often reluctant to divide explanations into "structural" and "cultural," because of the increasingly questionable utility of this old distinction.{{sfn|Small|Harding|Lamont|2010}}

[[File:Comedy and tragedy masks without background.svg|upright=0.9|right|thumb|Comedy and tragedy masks]]
'''Drama''' is the specific [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of [[fiction]] [[Mimesis|represented]] in [[performance]]: a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[mime]], [[ballet]], etc, performed in a [[theatre]], or on [[Radio drama|radio]] or television.&lt;ref name="elam98"&gt;Elam (1980, 98).&lt;/ref&gt; Considered as a genre of [[poetry]] in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and the [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] modes ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of [[dramatic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Fergusson]] writes that "a drama, as distinguished from a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]], is not primarily a composition in the verbal medium; the [[Dialogue (fiction)|words]] result, as one might put it, from the underlying [[Dramatic structure|structure of incident]] and [[Character (arts)|character]]. As [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] remarks, 'the poet, or "maker" should be the maker of [[Plot (narrative)|plots]] rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he [[Mimesis|imiates]], and what he imitates are [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]'" (1949, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term "drama" comes from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "[[Action (philosophy)|action]]" ([[Classical Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δρᾶμα}}, ''drama''), which is derived from "I do" ([[Classical Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δράω}}, ''drao''). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional [[Genre|generic]] division between [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. 

In English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word "[[Play (theatre)|play]]" or "game" (translating the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''pleġan'' or [[Latin]] ''ludus'') was the standard term used to describe drama until [[William Shakespeare]]'s time—just as its creator was a "play-maker" rather than a "dramatist" and the building was a "play-house" rather than a "[[Theater (building)|theatre]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1959, 32—41; 1969, 133; 1981, 68—69). The sense of the creator of plays as a "maker" rather than a "writer" is preserved in the word "[[playwright]]." [[The Theatre]], one of the first purpose-built playhouses in London, was "a self-conscious latinism to describe one particular playhouse" rather than a term for the buildings in general (1967, 133). The word 'dramatist' "was at that time still unknown in the English language" (1981, 68).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of "drama" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific ''type'' of [[play (theatre)|play]] dates from the modern era. "Drama" in this sense refers to a play that is ''neither'' a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, [[Émile Zola|Zola's]] ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' ([[1873 in literature|1873]]) or [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov's]] ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' ([[1887 in literature|1887]]). It is this narrower sense that the [[film]] and [[television]] industries, along with [[film studies]], adopted to describe "[[Drama (film and television)|drama]]" as a [[Film genre|genre]] within their respective media. "[[Radio drama]]" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of [[radio]].&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 894–900).&lt;/ref&gt;

The enactment of drama in [[theatre]], performed by [[actor]]s on a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] before an [[audience]], presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref&gt;Pfister (1977, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body. Drama can be combined with [[music]]: the dramatic text in [[opera]] is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musical theatre|Musicals]] include both spoken [[dialogue]] and [[song]]s; and some forms of drama have [[incidental music]] or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue ([[melodrama]] and Japanese [[Noh|Nō]], for example).&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;See the entries for "opera", "musical theatre, American", "melodrama" and "Nō" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Closet drama]] describes a form that is intended to be read, rather than performed.&lt;ref name="closet"&gt;''[[Manfred]]'' by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], for example, is a good example of a "[[Verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic poem]]." See the entry on "Byron (George George)" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.&lt;ref name="impro"&gt;Some forms of improvisation, notably the [[Commedia dell'arte]], improvise on the basis of 'lazzi' or rough outlines of scenic action (see Gordon (1983) and Duchartre (1929)). All forms of improvisation take their cue from their immediate response to one another, their characters' situations (which are sometimes established in advance), and, often, their interaction with the audience. The classic formulations of improvisation in the theatre originated with [[Joan Littlewood]] and [[Keith Johnstone]] in the UK and [[Viola Spolin]] in the USA; see Johnstone (1981) and Spolin (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Western drama==
===Classical Greek drama===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Greece}}
[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|''Relief of a seated poet ([[Menander]]) with masks of New Comedy'', 1st century BC – early 1st century AD, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]
[[Western culture|Western]] drama originates in [[classical Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), and Ley (2007, 206). Taxidou notes that "most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct" (2004, 104). Brown writes that [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] "was essentially the creation of [[classical Athens]]: all the dramatists who were later regarded as classics were active at Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the time of the [[Athenian democracy]]), and all the surviving plays date from this period" (1998, 441). "The dominant culture of [[Classical Athens|Athens in the fifth century]]", Goldhill writes, "can be said to have invented [[theatre]]" (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatrical culture]] of the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] produced three [[genre]]s of drama: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]]. Their origins remain obscure, though by the 5th century BC they were [[institution]]alised in [[Agon|competitions]] held as part of [[Athenian festivals|festivities]] celebrating the god [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Banham (1998, 441–447).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians know the names of many ancient Greek dramatists, not least [[Thespis]], who is credited with the innovation of an actor ("''hypokrites''") who speaks (rather than sings) and impersonates a [[Character (arts)|character]] (rather than speaking in his own person), while interacting with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and its leader ("''[[coryphaeus]]''"), who were a traditional part of the performance of non-dramatic poetry ([[dithyramb]]ic, [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Epic poetry|epic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 441–444). For more information on these ancient Greek dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a small fraction of the work of five dramatists, however, has survived to this day: we have a small number of complete texts by the tragedians [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], and the comic writers [[Aristophanes]] and, from the late 4th century, [[Menander]].&lt;ref&gt;The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] would bring this number to six dramatists whose work survives.&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus' historical tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' is the oldest surviving drama, although when it won first prize at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] competition in 472 BC, he had been writing plays for more than 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 8) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16).&lt;/ref&gt; The competition ("''[[agon]]''") for tragedies may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records ("''didaskaliai''") begin from 501 BC when the [[satyr play]] was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Banham (1998, 442).&lt;/ref&gt; Tragic dramatists were required to present a [[tetralogy]] of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play (though exceptions were made, as with Euripides' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' in 438 BC). [[Comedy]] was officially recognized with a prize in the competition from 487 to 486 BC.

Five comic dramatists competed at the City [[Dionysia]] (though during the [[Peloponnesian War]] this may have been reduced to three), each offering a single comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 18) and Banham (1998, 444–445).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is traditionally divided between "old comedy" (5th century BC), "middle comedy" (4th century BC) and "new comedy" (late 4th century to 2nd BC).&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 444–445).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Roman drama===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Statuette actor Petit Palais ADUT00192.jpg|thumb|An ivory statuette of a Roman actor of [[tragedy]], 1st century CE.]]
Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]].&lt;ref name="h43"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43).&lt;/ref&gt; From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; [[Theater of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 36, 47).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43). For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 46–47).&lt;/ref&gt; The first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] and [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] that [[Livius Andronicus]] wrote from 240 BC.&lt;ref name="h47"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write drama.&lt;ref name="h47" /&gt; No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both [[genres]], Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama.&lt;ref name="h47" /&gt;

By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a [[guild]] of writers (''collegium poetarum'') had been formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47–48).&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman comedies that have survived are all ''[[fabula palliata]]'' (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: [[Plautus|Titus Maccius Plautus]] (Plautus) and [[Terence|Publius Terentius Afer]] (Terence).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48–49).&lt;/ref&gt; In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in dividing the drama into [[episode]]s and introduced musical accompaniment to its [[dialogue]] (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence).&lt;ref name="h49"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49).&lt;/ref&gt; The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from [[eavesdropping]].&lt;ref name="h49" /&gt;

Plautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his [[farce]]s are best known; he was admired for the [[wit]] of his dialogue and his use of a variety of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meters]].&lt;ref name="h48"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48).&lt;/ref&gt; All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour.&lt;ref name="h48" /&gt; No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]], and [[Lucius Accius]].&lt;ref name="h49" /&gt;

From the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref name="h50"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 50).&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49–50).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.&lt;ref name="h50" /&gt;

===Medieval===
{{Main article|Medieval theatre}}
[[File:Castle of Perseverance staging.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stage drawing from a 15th-century [[vernacular]] [[morality play]] ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (as found in the [[Macro Manuscript]]).]]
Beginning in the [[early Middle Ages]], churches staged dramatised versions of biblical events, known as [[liturgical drama]]s, to enliven annual celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76, 78). Many churches would have only performed one or two [[liturgical drama]]s per year and a larger number never performed any at all.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest example is the [[Easter]] trope ''Whom do you Seek? (Quem-Quaeritis)'' (c. 925).&lt;ref name="Brockett_76"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76).&lt;/ref&gt; Two groups would sing responsively in [[Latin]], though no impersonation of [[Character (arts)|characters]] was involved. By the 11th century, it had spread through Europe to [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[Italy]]; excluding [[Al-Andalus|Islamic-era Spain]].

In the 10th century, [[Hrosvitha]] wrote six plays in Latin modeled on [[Terence]]'s comedies, but which treated religious subjects.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 77).&lt;/ref&gt; Her plays are the first known to be composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western drama of the post-Classical era.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt; Later, [[Hildegard of Bingen]] wrote a [[music]]al drama, ''Ordo Virtutum'' (c. 1155).&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt;

One of the most famous of the early [[Secularity|secular]] plays is the courtly [[pastoral]] ''[[Jeu de Robin et Marion|Robin and Marion]]'', written in the 13th century in French by [[Adam de la Halle]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1981, 191; 1987, 141).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' (c. 1300), one of the earliest known in English, seems to be the closest in tone and form to the contemporaneous French [[farce]]s, such as ''[[The Boy and the Blind Man]].''&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 9, 11, 38, 45), Dillon (2006, 213), and Wickham (1976, 195; 1981, 189–190). In ''Early English Stages'' (1981), Wickham points to the existence of ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' as evidence that the old-fashioned view that [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] began in England in the 1550s with ''[[Gammer Gurton's Needle]]'' and ''[[Ralph Roister Doister]]'' is mistaken, ignoring as it does a rich tradition of [[Medieval theatre|medieval comic drama]]; see Wickham (1981, 178).&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of plays survive from [[France]] and [[Germany]] in the [[late Middle Ages]], when some type of religious drama was performed in nearly every European country. Many of these plays contained [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s, and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt; In England, trade guilds began to perform [[vernacular]] "[[mystery plays]]," which were composed of long cycles of a large number of playlets or "pageants," of which four are [[Extant literature|extant]]: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and the so-called "[[N-Town Plays|N-Town]]" (42). ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play]]'' from the Wakefield cycle is a farcical story of a stolen sheep that its [[protagonist]], Mak, tries to pass off as his new-born child asleep in a crib; it ends when the shepherds from whom he has stolen are summoned to the [[Nativity of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morality plays]] (a modern term) emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished in the early [[Elizabethan era]] in England. Characters were often used to represent different ethical ideals. ''[[Everyman]]'', for example, includes such figures as Good Deeds, Knowledge and Strength, and this characterisation reinforces the conflict between good and evil for the audience.  ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (c. 1400—1425) depicts an archetypal figure's progress from birth through to death. ''[[Horestes]]'' (c. 1567), a late "hybrid morality" and one of the earliest examples of an English [[revenge play]], brings together the classical story of [[Orestes]] with a [[Vice (character)|Vice]] from the medieval [[Allegory|allegorical]] tradition, alternating comic, [[slapstick]] scenes with serious, [[Tragedy|tragic]] ones.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack (1958, 251-303), Bevington (1962, 58-61, 81-82, 87, 183), and Weimann (1978, 155).&lt;/ref&gt; Also important in this period were the folk dramas of the [[Mummers Play]], performed during the [[Christmas]] season. Court [[masque]]s were particularly popular during the reign of [[Henry VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 101-103).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabethan and Jacobean===
{{Main article|English Renaissance theatre}}
One of the great flowerings of drama in [[England]] occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many of these plays were written in verse, particularly [[iambic pentameter]]. In addition to Shakespeare, such authors as [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Thomas Middleton]], and [[Ben Jonson]] were prominent playwrights during this period. As in the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], historical plays celebrated the lives of past kings, enhancing the image of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] monarchy. Authors of this period drew some of their storylines from [[Greek mythology]] and [[Roman mythology]] or from the plays of eminent Roman playwrights such as [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].

===English Restoration comedy===
{{Main article|Restoration comedy}}
[[File:Colley Cibber as Lord Foppington in The Relapse by John Vanbrugh engraving.jpg|thumb|[[Colley Cibber]] as the extravagant and affected Lord Foppington, "brutal, evil, and smart", in [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh's]] ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696).]]

[[Restoration comedy]] refers to English comedies written and performed in England during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. [[Comedy of manners]] is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy.&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur [https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; After [[London theatre closure 1642|public theatre had been banned]] by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 with the Restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hatch|first1=Mary Jo|title=The Three Faces of Leadership: Manager, Artist, Priest|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration comedy is known for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness, urbane, cosmopolitan [[wit]], up-to-the-minute topical writing, and crowded and bustling plots. Its dramatists stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] plays, and even from [[Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Classics|classical]] comedies, combining the various plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized "variety" within as well as between plays. Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of the first professional female playwright, [[Aphra Behn]], in the 1680s is an important exception. In the mid-1690s, a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are significantly different from each other.

The unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]] reflected the atmosphere at Court and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]] (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). The single play that does most to support the charge of [[obscenity]] levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's masterpiece ''[[The Country Wife]]'' (1675), whose title contains a [[Lascivious behavior|lewd]] [[pun]] and whose notorious "china scene" is a series of sustained [[double entendre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|ROI9FhR6URI|The "China scene" from Wycherley's play}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the "softer" comedies of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh]] set out to appeal to more socially diverse audience with a strong middle-class element, as well as to female spectators. The comic focus shifts from young lovers outwitting the older generation to the vicissitudes of marital relations. In Congreve's ''[[Love for Love]]'' (1695) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), the give-and-take set pieces of couples testing their attraction for one another have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the latter's famous "Proviso" scene. Vanbrugh's ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) has a light touch and more humanly recognisable characters, while ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696) has been admired for its throwaway wit and the characterisation of Lord Foppington, an extravagant and affected [[burlesque]] [[fop]] with a dark side.&lt;ref&gt;''The Provoked Wife'' is something of a Restoration [[problem play]] in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of "divorce" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the [[House of Lords]].&lt;/ref&gt; The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out by the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did.&lt;ref&gt;Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were [[demographic]] change, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]]'s and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place.&lt;/ref&gt; At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of ''The Way of the World'', Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by [[sentimental comedy]] and the drama of exemplary morality.

===Modern and postmodern===
The pivotal and innovative contributions of the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th-century]] Norwegian dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]] and the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th-century]] German [[theatre practitioner]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] dominate modern drama; each inspired a tradition of imitators, which include many of the greatest playwrights of the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1993, 25–26) and Moi (2006, 17). Moi writes that "Ibsen is the most important playwright writing after Shakespeare. He is the founder of modern theater. His plays are world classics, staged on every continent, and studied in classrooms everywhere. In any given year, there are hundreds of Ibsen productions in the world." Ibsenites include [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Arthur Miller]]; Brechtians include [[Dario Fo]], [[Joan Littlewood]], [[W. H. Auden]] [[Peter Weiss]], [[Heiner Müller]], [[Peter Hacks]], [[Tony Kushner]], [[Caryl Churchill]], [[John Arden]], [[Howard Brenton]], [[Edward Bond]], and [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]].&lt;/ref&gt; The works of both playwrights are, in their different ways, both [[Modernism|modernist]] and [[Realism (theatre)|realist]], incorporating formal [[Experimental theatre|experimentation]], [[meta-theatre|meta-theatricality]], and [[Social criticism|social critique]].&lt;ref&gt;Moi (2006, 1, 23–26). Taxidou writes: "It is probably historically more accurate, although methodologically less satisfactory, to read the [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalist movement in the theatre]] in conjunction with the more anti-illusionist aesthetics of the theatres of the same period. These interlock and overlap in all sorts of complicated ways, even when they are vehemently denouncing each other (perhaps particularly when) in the favoured mode of the time, the manifesto" (2007, 58).&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the traditional theoretical discourse of genre, Ibsen's work has been described as the culmination of "[[Tragedy#Modern development|liberal tragedy]]", while Brecht's has been aligned with an [[Historicization|historicised]] comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966) and Wright (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important playwrights of the modern era include Antonin Artaud, [[August Strindberg]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Dario Fo]], [[Heiner Müller]], and [[Caryl Churchill]].

== Opera ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
[[Opera|Western opera]] is a dramatic art form that arose during the [[Renaissance]] in an attempt to revive the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|classical Greek drama]] in which dialogue, dance, and song were combined. Being strongly intertwined with [[Classical music|western classical music]], the opera has undergone enormous changes in the past four centuries and it is an important form of theatre until this day. Noteworthy is the major influence of the German 19th-century composer [[Wagner|Richard Wagner]] on the opera tradition. In his view, there was no proper balance between music and theatre in the operas of his time, because the music seemed to be more important than the dramatic aspects in these works. To restore the connection with the classical drama, he entirely renewed the operatic form to emphasize the equal importance of music and drama in works that he called "[[music drama]]s".

[[Chinese opera]] has seen a more conservative development over a somewhat longer period of time.

== Pantomime ==
{{Main|Pantomime}}
[[Pantomime]] (informally '''panto'''),&lt;ref&gt;Lawner, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[musical theatre|musical comedy]] stage production, designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or [[Folklore|folk tale]].&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline. "Pantomime", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', Jack Zipes (ed.), Oxford University Press (2006), {{ISBN|9780195146561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer (1969), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.

These stories follow in the tradition of [[fable]]s and [[Folklore|folk tale]]s. Usually, there is a lesson learned, and with some help from the audience, the hero/heroine saves the day. This kind of play uses [[stock character]]s seen in masque and again [[commedia dell'arte]], these characters include the villain (doctore), the clown/servant (Arlechino/Harlequin/buttons), the lovers etc. These plays usually have an emphasis on [[moral dilemma]]s, and good always triumphs over evil, this kind of play is also very entertaining making it a very effective way of reaching many people.

Pantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre. It developed partly from the 16th century [[commedia dell'arte]] tradition of Italy, as well as other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century [[masque]]s and [[music hall]].&lt;ref name=Reid/&gt; An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the [[harlequinade]].&lt;ref name=HistoryIBY&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/Factsheets/The%20History%20of%20Pantomime.pdf "The History of Pantomime"], It's-Behind-You.com, 2002, accessed 10 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Britain the word "pantomime" is usually used to mean '''[[Mime artist|miming]]''', rather than the theatrical form discussed here.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Webster's New World Dictionary]]'', World Publishing Company, 2nd College Edition, 1980, p. 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mime==
[[Mime artist|Mime]] is a theatrical medium where the action of a story is told through the movement of the body, without the use of speech. Performance of mime occurred in [[Ancient Greece]], and the word is taken from a single masked dancer called ''Pantomimus'', although their performances were not necessarily silent.&lt;ref&gt;Gutzwiller (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Medieval]] Europe, early forms of mime, such as [[Mummers Play|mummer play]]s and later [[dumbshow]]s, evolved. In the early nineteenth century [[Paris]], [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]] solidified the many attributes that we have come to know in modern times, including the silent figure in whiteface.&lt;ref&gt;Rémy (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Copeau]], strongly influenced by [[Commedia dell'arte]] and Japanese [[Noh]] theatre, used masks in the training of his actors. [[Étienne Decroux]], a pupil of his, was highly influenced by this and started exploring and developing the possibilities of mime and refined [[corporeal mime]] into a highly sculptural form, taking it outside of the realms of [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]]. [[Jacques Lecoq]] contributed significantly to the development of mime and [[physical theatre]] with his training methods.&lt;ref name=Callery&gt;Callery (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballet==
While some ballet emphasises "the lines and patterns of movement itself" dramatic dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; Such ballets are theatrical works that have characters and "tell a story",&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; Dance movements in ballet "are often closely related to everyday forms of physical expression, [so that] there is an expressive quality inherent in nearly all dancing", and this is used to convey both action and emotions; mime is also used.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', which tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse, [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ballet ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', based on Shakespeare's famous play, and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', which tells tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets.

== Creative drama ==
Creative drama includes dramatic activities and games used primarily in educational settings with children. Its roots in the United States began in the early 1900s. [[Winifred Ward]] is considered to be the founder of creative drama in education, establishing the first academic use of drama in Evanston, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich (1974, 75–80).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest-surviving fragments of [[Sanskrit drama]] date from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 516–517).&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516"&gt;Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient ''[[Vedas]]'' ([[hymn]]s from between 1500 and 1000 BC that are among the earliest examples of [[History of literature#India|literature]] in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of [[dialogue]]) and the [[ritual]]s of the [[Vedic period]] do not appear to have developed into theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516"/&gt; The ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' by [[Patañjali]] contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name="Richmond517"&gt;Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise on [[grammar]] from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of [[theatre in India]].&lt;ref name="Richmond517"/&gt;

The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is ''[[Natyashastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' (''Nātyaśāstra''), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to [[Bharata Muni]]. The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], architecture, [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond517"/&gt;

Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii"&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised [[stock character]]s, such as the hero (''nayaka''), heroine (''nayika''), or clown (''vidusaka''). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. It was patronized by the kings as well as village assemblies. Famous early playwrights include [[Bhasa]], [[Kalidasa]] (famous for ''[[Vikramōrvaśīyam|Vikrama and Urvashi]]'', ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram|Malavika and Agnimitra]]'', and ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|The Recognition of Shakuntala]]''), [[Śudraka]] (famous for ''[[Mṛcchakatika|The Little Clay Cart]]''), [[Asvaghosa]], [[Daṇḍin]], and [[Harsha|Emperor Harsha]] (famous for ''[[Nagananda]]'', ''[[Ratnavali]],'' and ''[[Priyadarsika]]''). ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|Śakuntalā]]'' (in English translation) influenced [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808–1832).&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii"/&gt;

====Modern Indian drama====
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
[[Rabindranath Tagore]] was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed.&lt;ref name="Banham1051"&gt;Banham (1998, 1051).&lt;/ref&gt; His plays are written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and include ''Chitra'' (''Chitrangada'', 1892), ''The King of the Dark Chamber'' (''Raja'', 1910), ''[[The Post Office (play)|The Post Office]]'' (''Dakghar'', 1913), and ''Red Oleander'' (''Raktakarabi'', 1924).&lt;ref name="Banham1051"/&gt;
[[Girish Karnad]] is a noted playwright, who has written a number of plays that use history and mythology, to critique and problematize ideas and ideals that are of contemporary relevance. Karnad's numerous plays such as ''Tughlaq'', ''Hayavadana'', ''[[Taledanda]]'', and ''Naga-Mandala'' are significant contributions to Indian drama. [[Vijay Tendulkar]] and [[Mahesh Dattani]] are amongst the major Indian playwrights of the 20th century. Mohan Rakesh in Hindi and [[Danish Iqbal]] in Urdu are considered architects of new age Drama. Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe Adhoore and Danish Iqbal's ''Dara Shikoh'' are considered modern classics.

====Modern Urdu drama of India and Pakistan====
{{Original research|section|date=December 2011}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Urdu Drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of North India shaping Rahas or Raas as practiced by exponents like [[Nawab Wajid Ali Shah]] (1822 – 1887) of [[Awadh]]. His dramatic experiments led to the famous [[Inder Sabha]] of Amanat and later this tradition took the shape of Parsi Theatre. Agha Hashr Kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition.

Urdu theatre tradition has greatly influenced modern [[Indian theatre]]. Theatre has flourished in [[Urdu]] (which was called [[Hindi]] by early writers), along with [[Gujarati language|Gujrati]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Urdu drama has had an important influence on [[Hindi film industry|Bombay Film industry]] and all the early works of Urdu theatre (performed by Parsi Companies) were made into films. Urdu dramatic tradition has existed for more than a 100 years.

Prof Hasan, Ghulam Jeelani, J.N,Kaushal, Shameem Hanfi, Jameel Shaidayi, etc. belong to the old generation, contemporary writers like Danish Iqbal, Sayeed Alam, Shahid Anwar, Iqbal Niyazi, and Anwar are a few [[postmodern]] playwrights actively contributing in the field of Urdu Drama.

Sayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for plays like 'Ghalib in New Delhi', 'Big B' and many other works, which are regularly staged for large audiences. ''Maulana Azad'' is his most important play both for its content and style.

Danish Iqbal's play ''[[Dara Shikoh]]'' directed by [[M. S. Sathyu]] is a modern classic that uses newer theatre techniques and a contemporary perspective. His other plays are ''[[Sahir]]''. on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet. ''Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam'' is another play written by Danish which is basically a Celebration of [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz|Faiz]]'s poetry, featuring events from the early part of his life, particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals. ''Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan'' – another play inspired from Faiz's letters written from various jails during the [[Rawalpindi Conspiracy]] days. He has written 14 other plays including ''Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa'' and ''Main Gaya Waqt Nahin hoon''. Shahid's ''Three B'' is also a significant play. He has been associated with many groups like 'Natwa' and others. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Urdu theatre flying in [[Kolkata]]. Unlike the writers of previous generation Sayeed, Shahid, Danish Iqbal and Zaheer do not write bookish plays but their work is a product of performing tradition. Iqbal Niyazi of [[Mumbai]] has written several plays in Urdu, his play ''AUR KITNE JALYANWALA BAUGH?'' won a National award other awards. Hence this is the only generation after Amanat and Agha Hashr who actually write for stage and not for libraries.

===China===
{{Main article|Theatre of China}}
[[File:1958 CPA 2262.jpg|thumb|A 1958 [[U.S.S.R.]] [[postage stamp]] commemorating [[Guan Hanqing]], one of the great Chinese dramatists, who is renowned for his "[[zaju]]" plays.]]

Chinese theatre has a long and complex history. Today it is often called [[Chinese opera]] although this normally refers specifically to the popular form known as [[Beijing opera]] and [[Kunqu]]; there have been many other forms of theatre in China, such as [[zaju]].

===Japan===
{{Main article|Theatre of Japan}}
Japanese [[Noh|Nō drama]] is a serious dramatic form that combines drama, music, and dance into a complete aesthetic performance experience. It developed in the 14th and 15th centuries and has its own musical instruments and performance techniques, which were often handed down from father to son. The performers were generally male (for both male and female roles), although female amateurs also perform Nō dramas. Nō drama was supported by the government, and particularly the military, with many military commanders having their own troupes and sometimes performing themselves. It is still performed in Japan today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iijnet.or.jp/NOH-KYOGEN/english/english.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050715090014/http://www.iijnet.or.jp/NOH-KYOGEN/english/english.html| archivedate=2005-07-15| accessdate=2013-02-27| deadurl=yes| title=Background to Noh-Kyogen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kyōgen]] is the comic counterpart to Nō drama. It concentrates more on dialogue and less on music, although Nō instrumentalists sometimes appear also in Kyōgen. [[Kabuki]] drama, developed from the 17th century, is another comic form, which includes dance.

'''El Sueño de Arquímedes''' was a Spanish science podcast and radio program which was broadcast by [[Radio Nacional de España|Radio Nacional de España (RNE)]] from September 2006 until June, 2007. The program was created by [[Ángel Rodríguez Lozano]]. A total of 35 programs are still available for download. In addition to El Sueño de Arquímedes, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano also hosted [[Vanguardia de la Ciencia]], which was broadcast weekly without interruption from April 1995 until June 2007. The name of the program means "the dream of [[Archimedes]]", and alludes to Archimedes' statement that given a [[lever]] and a fixed point, he could move the world. To Ángel Rodríguez Lozano, the dream was moving the world by popularizing and sharing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dimetu.com/2008/02/20/retropodcast-12-entrevista-a-angel-rodriguez-lozano/ ¡DIME TÚ! – Entrevista a Ángel Rodríguez Lozano.] First published 30 June 2007.''"Arquímedes, lo que propuso fue que con una palanca podía mover el mundo. Para mi, El sueño de Arquímedes era simplemente mover el mundo divulgando y repartiendo conocimiento."''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Before the startup of El Sueño de Arquímedes, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano had been hosting Vanguardia de la Ciencia for more than a decade. When RNE
asked if he would host a second popular science program, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano realised that the scheduled timing, Sundays between 3 and 4 p.m, meant that it would be sandwiched between sports broadcasts. Therefore, he would have to capture the attention of listeners who were not looking for this type of program. The intention was therefore to make the program even more accessible than Vanguardia de la Ciencia, with shorter interviews and more music. Ángel Rodríguez Lozano stated that it had been a marvellous experience, and that the response had been tremendous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dimetu.com/2008/02/20/retropodcast-12-entrevista-a-angel-rodriguez-lozano/ |title=¡DIME TÚ! – Entrevista a Ángel Rodríguez Lozano |publisher=Dimetu.com |date=20 February 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program included science news, interviews, and biographies of great scientists, written by [http://www.rtve.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605dceedec15a322702dd41da976ac96c4395def1e9f8e232e7869bb1c304bb715731b852947013e5ad675ccaeddfc4875cdea9bcd15f8880681 Carmen Buergo]. In the final, humorous section of the program, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano paid a visit to the archetypical [[mad scientist]]
[http://www.ciencia.rne.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605d5391d7ca78deb60dc51e84fc79f34cf020766f1ed143c396b5d1b644b9b60d9d0e1aa0b6615df94332359e92d8b381cbb51cf1d8bab454cc Alejandro Laguna], who supposedly lived and worked in a hidden laboratory in the basements of Radio Nacional de España, seven floors below ground level. Alejandro would demonstrate one of his latest inventions, which usually defied the laws of physics, and Ángel played the role of a rather gullible spectator. Alejandro then explained the physics of the corresponding real-world device. Finally, the demonstration of his invention usually had some highly unpleasant consequence for Ángel.

==Termination of El Sueño de Arquímedes==

In June 2007, El Sueño de Arquímedes and Vanguardia de la Ciencia were abruptly terminated. In the correspondence section of one of the last programs of Vangurardia de la Ciencia, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano explained, in response to a letter from an outraged listener, that the decision to terminate the program was made due to a re-structuration of RNE, and that he was but one of 4,150 employees who had to leave.&lt;ref&gt;
Correspondence section at the end of the program [[Vanguardia de la Ciencia]] of 9 June 2007. {{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209052256/http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}

{{Conservation status}}
[[File:Linces1.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Iberian lynx]] (''Lynx pardinus''), an endangered species.]]
An '''endangered species''' is a [[species]] which has been categorized  as very likely to become [[Extinction|extinct]]. E&lt;!--Capital "E" as this is a specific IUCN category--&gt;ndangered (EN), as categorized by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List]], is the second most severe [[conservation status]] for wild populations in the IUCN's schema after [[Critically endangered|{{allow wrap|Critically Endangered}}]]&amp;nbsp;(CR).

In 2012, the IUCN Red List featured 3079 [[animal]] and 2655 [[plant]] species as endangered&amp;nbsp;(EN) worldwide.&lt;ref name="iucn 2012.2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/summarystatistics/2012_2_RL_Stats_Table_2.pdf |title=IUCN Red List version 2012.2: Table 2: Changes in numbers of species in the threatened categories (CR, EN, VU) from 1996 to 2012 (IUCN Red List version 2012.2) for the major taxonomic groups on the Red List |accessdate=2012-12-31 |publisher=[[IUCN]] |year=2012 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures for 1998 were, respectively, 1102 and 1197.

Many nations have [[Environmental law|law]]s that protect [[conservation-reliant species]]: for example, forbidding [[hunting]], restricting [[land development]] or creating preserves. Population numbers, trends and species' conservation status can be found at the [[lists of organisms by population]].

The [[conservation status]] of a [[species]] indicates the likelihood that it will become [[extinct]].  Many factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natureserve.org/infonatura/Lnsstatus.htm |title=NatureServe Conservation Status |date=April 2007 |publisher=NatureServe |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |title=Red List Overview |date=February 2011 |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527175928/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |archivedate=May 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/ |title=Threatened Species |publisher=Conservation and Wildlife |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913043721/http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species |archivedate=September 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord to create [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s that will protect endangered and other threatened species. In the [[United States]], such plans are usually called [[Endangered Species Recovery Plan|Species Recovery Plan]]s.

Though labelled a list, the [[IUCN Red List]] is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes "Data Deficient"&amp;nbsp;(DD) species&amp;nbsp;– species for which more data and assessment is required before their status may be determined&amp;nbsp;– as well species comprehensively assessed by the IUCN's species assessment process. Those species of "[[Near-threatened species|Near Threatened]]"&amp;nbsp;(NT) and "[[Least concern|Least Concern]]"&amp;nbsp;(LC) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms "endangered species" and "threatened species" with particular meanings: "Endangered"&amp;nbsp;(EN) species lie between "[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]"&amp;nbsp;(VU) and "[[Critically Endangered species|Critically Endangered]]"&amp;nbsp;(CR) species, while "Threatened" species are those species determined to be Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered.

== Endangered species in the United States ==
There is data from the United States that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species. Using species data from the Database on the Economics and Management of Endangered Species (DEMES) database and the period that the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) has been in existence, 1970 to 1997, a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Shogren|editor1-first=Jason F.|editor2-last=Tschirhart|editor2-first=John|title=Protecting Endangered Species in the United States: Biological Needs, Political Realities, Economic Choices|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521662109|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endangered Species Act===
[[File:Status ESA LE.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|"Endangered" in relation to "threatened" under the ESA.]]
Under the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] in the [[United States]], species may be listed as "endangered" or "threatened". The [[Salt Creek tiger beetle]] (''Cicindela nevadica lincolniana'') is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species, and adding a particular species to the list can be a long, controversial process (Wilcove &amp; Master, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;414).

Some endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include: criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and criteria for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered; whether restrictions on land development constitute a "taking" of land by the [[government]]; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their lands; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from [[hunting|hunters]] and various industries like the [[petroleum industry]], [[construction]] industry, and [[logging]], has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws.

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the [[Obama administration]], this policy has been reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/news/newsreleases/showNews.cfm?newsId=EE78C309-C119-D9DC-042421265ACD62A4|title=FWS.gov|author=|date=|website=fws.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Courchamp |first=Franck |author2=Elena Angulo |author3=Philippe Rivalan |author4=Richard J. Hall |author5=Laetitia Signoret |author6=Leigh Bull |author7=Yves Meinard |title=Rarity Value and Species Extinction: The Anthropogenic Allee Effect |publisher=PLoS Biology |url=http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040415 |accessdate=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is potentially reducible, such as in China where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dharmananda |first=Subhuti |title=Endangered Species issues affecting turtles and tortoises used in Chinese medicine |publisher=Institute for Traditional Medicine, Portland, Oregon |url=http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040415 |accessdate=2006-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the "shoot, shovel, and shut-up" method of clearing endangered species from an area of land. Some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it. They have allegedly opted to silently kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat, thus removing the problem from their land, but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/34933.html |title=Shoot, Shovel and Shut Up |work=Reasononline |publisher=Reason Magazine |date=2003-12-31 |accessdate=2006-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]]&amp;nbsp;– which coined the term "endangered species"&amp;nbsp;– has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool. Nineteen species have been delisted and recovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/DelistingReport.do |title=USFWS Threatened and Endangered Species System (TESS) |publisher=U. S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service |accessdate=2007-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728035106/http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/DelistingReport.do |archivedate=2007-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 93% of listed species in the northeastern United States have a recovering or stable population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esasuccess.org/reports/|title=ESA Successes|author=|date=|website=www.esasuccess.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law.&lt;!--Too vague: &lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 2006 (webpage).&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; This approximation, however, does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws as the Endangered Species Act. According to [[NatureServe conservation status|NatureServe's global conservation status]], approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants, and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.&lt;ref name="WM2008"&gt;Wilcove &amp; Master 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpages|415|16}} Thus, in total, between seven and eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction.&lt;ref name="WM2008"/&gt;{{refpage|416}} This total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.

[[File:2010-bald-eagle-kodiak.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Bald eagle]]
[[File:American bison k5680-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|American bison]]
Ever since mankind began hunting to preserve itself, over-hunting and fishing has been a large and dangerous problem. Of all the species who became extinct due to interference from mankind, the [[dodo]], [[passenger pigeon]], [[great auk]], [[Tasmanian tiger]] and [[Steller's sea cow]] are some of the more well known examples; with the [[bald eagle]], [[grizzly bear]], [[American bison]], [[Eastern timber wolf]] and [[sea turtle]] having been hunted to near-extinction.  Many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport. However, due to major efforts to prevent extinction, the bald eagle, or ''[[Bald eagle|Haliaeetus leucocephalus]]'' is now under the category of Least Concern on the red list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Haliaeetus leucocephalus (Bald Eagle)|url = http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/22695144/0|website = www.iucnredlist.org|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced. Large whales like the blue whale, bowhead whale, finback whale, gray whale, sperm whale and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the Endangered Species List. Actions have been taken to attempt reduction in whaling and increase population sizes, including prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).  But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as [[Japan]] continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of "scientific purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=Bill |title=Endangered species |journal=Gale |year=2008 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list and could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future.

== Invasive species ==
{{main|Introduced species}}

The introduction of non-indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered. Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chiras |first=Daniel D. |title=Invader Species |url=http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3753825|journal=Grolier |year=2011 |series=Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captive breeding===
{{main|Captive breeding}}
Captive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos and other conservation facilities. Captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilize the population of the species that it will not disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/ConservationAndScience/EndangeredSpecies/CapBreedPops/default.cfm |title=Captive Breeding Populations - National Zoo |publisher=Nationalzoo.si.edu |accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique has worked for many species for some time, with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of European and Asian rulers, an example being the [[Père David's deer]]. However, captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory birds (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. [[hilsa]]). Additionally, if the captive breeding population is too small, then inbreeding may occur due to a reduced [[gene pool]] and reduce [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].

In 1981, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) created a [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP) in order to help preserve specific endangered and threatened species through captive breeding.  With over 450 SSP Plans, there are a number of endangered species that are covered by the AZA with plans to cover population management goals and recommendations for breeding for a diverse and healthy population, created by Taxon Advisory Groups.  These programs are commonly created as a last resort effort. SSP Programs regularly participate in species recovery, veterinary care for wildlife disease outbreaks, and a number of other wildlife conservation efforts.  The AZA's Species Survival Plan also has breeding and transfer programs, both within and outside of AZA - certified zoos and aquariums.  Some animals that are part of SSP programs are [[giant pandas]], lowland gorillas, and [[California condors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|archive-url =https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090803071836/http://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|dead-url =yes|archive-date =2009-08-03|title =Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species Survival Programs|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private farming===
[[File:Ostafrikanisches Spitzmaulnashorn.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Black rhino]]
[[File:Thmac u0.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Southern bluefin tuna]]
Whereas poaching substantially reduces endangered animal populations, legal, for-profit, private farming does the opposite. It has substantially increased the populations of the southern [[black rhinoceros]] and southern [[white rhinoceros]]. Dr Richard Emslie, a scientific officer at the IUCN, said of such programs, "Effective law enforcement has become much easier now that the animals are largely privately owned... We have been able to bring local communities into the conservation programmes. There are increasingly strong economic incentives attached to looking after rhinos rather than simply poaching: from Eco-tourism or selling them on for a profit. So many owners are keeping them secure. The private sector has been key to helping our work."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/hes-black-and-hes-back-private-enterprise-saves-southern-africas-rhino-from-extinction-848482.html He's black, and he's back!

Conservation experts view the effect of China's [[turtle farming]] on the wild turtle populations of China and South-Eastern Asia&amp;nbsp;– many of which are endangered&amp;nbsp;– as "poorly understood".&lt;ref name="scale"&gt;{{cite news |title=Evidence for the massive scale of turtle farming in China |last=Shi |first=Haitao |last2=Parham |first2=James F. |last3=Fan |first3=Zhiyong |last4=Hong |first4=Meiling |last5=Yin |first5=Feng |publication-date= |date=2008-01-01 |periodical=Oryx |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=42 |pages=147–150 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=1738732&amp;jid=ORX&amp;volumeId=42&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=1738724 |doi=10.1017/S0030605308000562 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they commend the gradual replacement of turtles caught wild with [[Turtle farming|farm-raised turtles]] in the marketplace&amp;nbsp;– the percentage of farm-raised individuals in the "visible" trade grew from around 30% in 2000 to around 70% in 2007&lt;ref name="ff"&gt;"[http://www.fishfarmer-magazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/993/Turtle_farms_threaten_rare_species,_experts_say.html Turtle farms threaten rare species, experts say] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218191219/http://www.fishfarmer-magazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/993/Turtle_farms_threaten_rare_species%2C_experts_say.html |date=2012-02-18 }}".

The conservation expert Peter Paul van Dijk noted that turtle farmers often believe that animals caught wild are superior breeding stock. Turtle farmers may, therefore, seek and catch the last remaining wild specimens of some endangered turtle species.&lt;ref name="ff"/&gt;

A '''''fabula crepidata''''' or '''''fabula cothurnata''''' is a Latin tragedy with Greek subjects. The genre probably originated in adaptations of [[Greek tragedy]] (hence the names, coming from ''crepida'' = ''sandal'' and ''[[Buskin|cothurnus]]'') beginning in  the early third century B.C. Only nine have survived intact, all by [[Senecan tragedy|Seneca]]. Of the plays written by [[Lucius Livius Andronicus]], [[Gnaeus Naevius]], [[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]], [[Lucius Accius]], and others, only titles, small fragments, and occasionally brief summaries are left. [[Ovid]]'s ''Medea'' also did not survive.

'''FairChain''' aims to establish a fairer distribution of returns in a production chain. For many products, this distribution is crooked, leaving the farmer or the exporting country a fraction of the retail price. Fair Chain goes beyond [[fair trade]], which mainly wants to guarantee farmers a fair price. The Fair Chain principles were first developed by Dutch-born entrepreneur Guido van Staveren van Dijk, when he founded Moyee.  Moyee, a Dutch-Ethiopean coffee company, (2012) is an organization to apply the chain concept in the coffee production chain by roasting, mixing and packaging beans in the country of origin, instead of in Europe or the United States as it is normally done. The aim of Fair Chain is  therefore to leave more added value in the producing country.
This way to operate fits into the idea of [[Creating Shared Value|creating shared value]], which means that in Moyee's case economic and social interests go hand in hand:
* it pays a large premium on the local price for beans
* it roasts locally, in a joint venture with local partners who invest in improving the agricultural and living conditions
* profits are used to fund social projects that the fair chain principle reinforcing.

After the FairChain foundation wrote down
Its principles and Moyee Coffee was created, Escoffee in Ecuador and Azahar Coffee in Colombia ("Value Added at Source") could be considered amongst the first initiatives to work according to the FairChain principles

'''Geoarchaeology''' is a multi-disciplinary approach which uses the techniques and subject matter of [[geography]], [[geology]] and other [[Earth science]]s to examine topics which inform [[archaeology|archaeological]] knowledge and thought. Geoarchaeologists study the natural physical processes that affect [[archaeological site]]s such as [[geomorphology]], the formation of sites through geological processes and the effects on buried sites and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] post-deposition. Geoarchaeologists' work frequently involves studying [[soil]] and [[sediments]] as well as other geographical concepts to contribute an archaeological study. Geoarchaeologists may also use computer cartography, [[geographic information systems]] (GIS) and  [[digital elevation model]]s (DEM) in combination with disciplines from human and social sciences and earth sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index422.html Ghilardi, M. and Desruelles, S. (2008) “Geoarchaeology: where human, social and earth sciences meet with technology”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''1''' (2) ]&lt;/ref&gt; Geoarchaeology is  important to society because it  informs archaeologists about the geomorphology of the soil, sediments and the rocks on  the buried sites and artifacts they're researching on. By doing this we are able locate ancient cities and artifacts and estimate by the quality of soil how  "prehistoric" they really are.

==Techniques used in geoarchaeology==

===Column sampling===
Column sampling is a technique of collecting samples from a [[archaeological section|section]] for analyzing and detecting the buried processes down the profile of the section. Narrow metal tins are hammered into the section in a series to collect the complete profile for study. If more than one tin is needed they are arranged offset  and overlapping to one side so the complete profile can be rebuilt offsite in laboratory conditions.

===Loss on ignition testing===
Loss on ignition testing for [[soil]] [[Soil organic matter|organic]] content.- a technique of measuring organic content in soil samples. Samples taken from a known place in the profile collected by column sampling are weighed then placed in a fierce oven which burns off the organic content. The resulting cooked sample is weighed again and the resulting loss in weight is an indicator of organic content in the profile at a certain depth. These readings are often used to detect buried soil horizons. A buried soil's [[archaeological horizon|horizons]] may not be visible in [[archaeological section|section]] and this horizon is an indicator of possible occupation levels. Ancient land surfaces especially from the prehistoric era can be difficult to discern so this technique is useful for evaluating an areas potential for [[prehistoric]] surfaces and archaeological evidence. Comparative measurements down the profile are made and a sudden rise in organic content at some point in the profile combined with other indicators is strong evidence for buried surfaces.

===Magnetic susceptibility analysis===
The magnetic susceptibility of a material is a measure of its ability to become magnetised by an external magnetic field (Dearing, 1999). The magnetic susceptibility of a soil reflects the presence of magnetic iron-oxide minerals such as maghaematite; just because a soil contains a lot of iron does not mean that it will have high magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic forms of iron can be formed by burning and microbial activity such as occurs in top soils and some anaerobic deposits. Magnetic iron compounds can also be found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.

The relationship between iron and burning means that magnetic susceptibility is often used for:
* Site prospection, to identify areas of archaeological potential prior to excavation.
* Identifying hearth areas and the presence of burning residues in deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Enhancement of magnetic susceptibility of soils on archaeological sites. |journal= Archaeometry |volume=13  |year=1971 |pages=209–219 |author1=Tite, M.S. |author2=Mullins, C. |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1971.tb00043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Explaining whether areas of reddening are due to burning or other natural processes such as gleying (waterlogging).

The relationship between soil formation and magnetic susceptibility means that it can also be used to:
* Identify buried soils in depositional sequences.
* Identify redeposited soil materials in peat, lake sediments etc.

===Phosphate and orthophosphate content with spectrophotometry===
Phosphate in man-made soils derives from people, their animals, rubbish and bones. 100 people excrete about 62&amp;nbsp;kg of phosphate annually, with about the same from their rubbish. Their animals excrete even more. A human body contains about 650g of PO4,(500g-80% in the skeleton), which results in elevated levels in burial sites. Most is quickly immobilised on the clay of the soil and ‘fixed’, where it can persist for thousands of years. For a 1 ha site this corresponds to about 150&amp;nbsp;kg PO4 ha-1yr-1 about 0.5% to 10% of that already present in most soils. Therefore, it doesn’t take long for human occupation to make orders of magnitude differences to the phosphate concentration in soil. Phosphorus exist in different ‘pools’ in the soil 1) organic (available), 2) occluded (adsorbed), 3) bound (chemically bound). Each of these pools can be extracted using progressively more aggressive chemicals. Some workers (Eidt especially), think that the ratios between these pools can give information about past land use, and perhaps even dating.
	
Whatever the method of getting the phosphorus from the soil into solution, the method of detecting it is usually the same. This uses the ‘molybdate blue’ reaction, where the depth of the colour is proportional to phosphorus concentration. In the lab, this is measured using a colorimeter, where light shining through a standard cell produces an electric current proportional to the light attenuation. In the field, the same reaction is used on detector sticks, which are compared to a colour chart.

Phosphate concentrations can be plotted on archaeological plans to show former activity areas, and is also used to prospect for sites in the wider landscape.

===Particle size analysis===
The particle size distribution of a soil sample may indicate the conditions under which the [[stratum|strata]] or [[sediment]] were deposited. Particle sizes are generally separated by means of dry or wet sieving (coarse samples such as [[till]], [[gravel]] and [[sand]]s, sometimes coarser [[silt]]s) or by measuring the changes of the density of a dispersed solution (in sodiumpyrophosphate, for example))of the sample (finer silts, [[clay]]s). A rotating clock-glass with a very fine-grained dispersed sample under a heat lamp is useful in separating particles.

The results are plotted on curves which can be analyzed with statistical methods for particle distribution and other parameters.

The fractions received can be further investigated for cultural indicators, macro- and microfossils and other interesting features, so particle size analysis is in fact the first thing to do when handling these samples.

===Trace element geochemistry===
Trace element geochemistry is the study of the abundances of elements in geological materials that do not occur in a large quantity in these materials. Because these trace elements' concentrations are determined by a large number of particular situations under which a certain geological material is formed, they are usually unique between two locations which contain the same type of rock or other geological material.

Geoarchaeologists use this uniqueness in trace element geochemistry to trace ancient patterns of resource-acquisition and trade. For example, researchers can look at the trace element composition of obsidian artifacts in order to "fingerprint" those artifacts. They can then study the trace element composition of obsidian outcrops in order to determine the original source of the raw material used to make the artifact.

===Clay mineralogy analysis===
Geoarchaeologists study the mineralogical characteristics of pots through macroscopic and microscopic analyses. They can use these characteristics to understand the various manufacturing techniques used to make the pots, and through this, to know which production centers likely made these pots. They can also use the mineralogy to trace the raw materials used to make the pots to specific clay deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Druca, I. C. and Q. H. J. Gwynb (1997), From Clay to Pots: A Petrographical Analysis of Ceramic Production in the Callejón de Huaylas, North-Central Andes, Peru, ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', ''25'', 707-718.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ostracod analysis===
Naturally occurring Ostracods in freshwater bodies are impacted by changes in salinity  and pH due to human activities.  Analysis of Ostracod shells in sediment columns show the changes brought about by farming and habitation activities.  This record can be correlated with age dating techniques to help identify changes in human habitation patterns and population migrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnesr.com/images/Bayman_et_al._2004.pdf ^ Manuel R. Palacios-Fest, “Nonmarine ostracode shell chemistry from ancient hohokam irrigation canals in central Arizona: A paleohydrochemical tool for the interpretation of prehistoric human occupation in the North American Southwest” ''Geoarchaeology'', Volume 9 Issue 1, Pages 1 – 29, Published Online: 9 Jan 2007 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological geology==

'''Archaeological geology''' is a term coined by [[Werner Kasig]] in 1980. It is a sub-field of [[geology]] which emphasises the value of earth constituents for human life.

== History ==
Founded in [[Silicon Valley]] in 2003 by Paul J.J. Payack, the GLM describes its role as "a media analytics company that documents, analyzes and tracks cultural trends in language the world over, with a particular emphasis upon Global English".  GLM's main services include various products based on the Narrative Tracker technologies for global Internet and social media analysis. NarrativeTracker is based on global discourse, providing a real-time, accurate picture about any topic, at any point in time. NarrativeTracker analyzes the Internet, blogosphere, the top 275,000 print and electronic global media, as well as new social media sources as they emerge.&lt;ref name=officialsite&gt;{{cite web|work=The Times |location=  London |url=http://www.languagemonitor.com |title=Global Language Monitor |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, GLM moved its headquarters from [[San Diego]] to [[Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&amp;p_theme=aasb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_hidethis=no&amp;s_dispstring=%22global%20language%20monitor%22&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22global%20language%20monitor%22)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no] / Finally, California sends a business we can support&lt;/ref&gt;

GLM announced "Emoji" as its Top Word of 2014 for Global English along with its complete lists of Top Words, Phrases and Names in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/category/top-words-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821185308/http://www.languagemonitor.com/category/top-words-2/ |archivedate=2012-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary from Global Language Monitor About the 2017 edition of its annual fashion capital rankings===
The current 2017 rankings now include 63 fashion capitals.  There are three new fashion capitals from West Africa:  Accra, Ghana; Dakar, Senegal; and Lagos, Nigeria.  There is one new fashion capital from East Asia: Kuala Lumpur.  There is one new fashion capital from the Middle East:  Beirut, Lebanon.  Before the various insurgencies in the region,  Beirut was known as the Paris of the Middle East.   There are two new fashion capitals from North America:  Portland, Oregon known for its ‘weird’ culture, much like Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio known in the fashion world as the manufacturing headquarters of Henri Bendel, Victoria’s Secret, the Bath &amp; Body Works, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (A&amp;F), and others.

====Commentary from Global Language Monitor individual cities in the 2017 edition====

No. 3 Barcelona — Moving into Big Four Territory is Big News by definition.

No. 4 Milano — Reclaiming its Big Four status; hmm, perhaps all that re-thinking and revamping just might be having an impact (we’ll see in 2018).

No. 6 London — Had a great run earlier in the decade, but not so great lately (If you consider the No. 6 spot not so great).

No. 7 Amsterdam — Moving up 15 spots is quite a move.

No. 9 Vegas — Back in the Top Ten, more evidence that the Red Carpet experience does indeed have an impact.

No. 10 Dubai — More evidence that billions of dollars Do, indeed, have an impact.

No. 17 Seoul — Finally making the move in Asia, not No. 1, but a respectable No. 3 regionally.

No. 21 Washington, DC — A move into respectability!?

No. 28 Melbourne and No. 34 Sydney — Trading Places

No. 44 Portland, OR — A very nice debut.

No. 47 Kuala Lumpur — Another solid debut.

No. 46 Boston, No. 48 Miami, No.53 Chicago, No. 54 Houston, and No. 59 Toronto — All down by twenty spots, or more.

No. 63  Caracas — On Hiatus due to Insurrection.

Methodology: For this analysis, the Global Language Monitor used its proprietary Brand Affiliation Index (BAI), the same technology used to measure global brand equity for the Olympics, World Cup, the Fortune 500, and others. This exclusive, GLM longitudinal-study encompasses the prior three years to better assess short-term velocity and longer-term momentum. The study is a Big Data textual analysis based on billions of webpages, millions of blogs, the top 375,000 global print and electronic media, and new social media formats as they appear. This is the eleventh edition of the survey, which was first made public in 2007.

== High tech terms ==

On March 29, 2013 announced The Most Confusing High Tech Buzzwords of the Second Decade of the 21st century, thus far (2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013) with commentary follow:

2013 Rank, Buzzword, Last Year’s rank

# Big Data (1) — Soon Human Knowledge will be doubling every second.  ’Big’ does not begin to describe what’s coming at us. 
# Dark Data (New)- Might not have noticed it because … it is ‘Dark Data’   ‘Big Data’ has begun to spin off its own superlatives.
# The Cloud (2) — All that data has got to go somewhere.  Hint:  it’s neither your phone nor your tablet.
# Yottabytes (New) – Showing up on lots of technologists’ radar lately:  a quadrillion gigabytes.
# The Next Big Thing (3) — A cliché rendered ever more meaningless but still on everyone’s tongue.
# Heisenbug (New) – A bug that disappears when you try to detect it, finally making the list after a steady ascent over the last decade.
# 3-D Printer (New) – Watch this space.  This technology has been used in CAD design for years and science fiction for decades — but now they are impinging upon everyday life. 
# Phablet (New) – The Next Big Thing? The odds are against it since consumer goods tend to evolve into single-purpose appliances.
# REST (New) – Representational State transfer is slowly climbing its way up the list.
# Web X.0 (5) — Formerly Web 2.0, 3.0, etc.

The study was released in conjunction with [[Austin]]'s [[South by Southwest]] Interactive festival.

On March 17, 2010, the Global Language Monitor presented the Most Confusing High Tech Buzzwords of the first decade of the 21st century (2000–2009).&lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Business-Intelligence/Most-Confusing-Tech-Buzzwords-824874/ Most Confusing Tech Buzzwords&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[HTTP]] — HyperText Transfer Protocol is used for [[HTML]] (HyperText Markup Language) files. 
# Flash — As in [[Flash Memory]].  "Flash’  is easier to say than " I brought the report on my EEPROM chip with a thin oxide layer separating a floating gate and control gate utilizing Fowler-Nordheim electron tunneling".
# God Particle – The [[Higgs boson]], thought to account for mass.  The God Particle has eluded discovery since its existence was first postulated some thirty years ago.
# Cloud computing – Distributing or accessing programs and services across the [[Internet]]. (The Internet is represented as a cloud.)
# [[Plasma display|Plasma]] (as in plasma TV) — Refers to a kind of television screen technology that uses matrix of gas plasma cells, which are charged by differing electrical voltages to create an image.
# [[IPOD]] – Apple maintains that the idea of the iPod was from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.  
# [[Megapixel]] – One million pixels or picture elements.
# Nano – Widely used to describe anything small as in [[nanotechnology]]. Like the word ‘mini’ which originally referred to the red hues in Italian miniature paintings, the word nano- is ultimately derived from the ancient Greek word for ‘dwarf’.
# Resonate – Not the tendency of a system to oscillate at maximum amplitude, but the ability to relate to (or resonate with) a customer’s desires.
# Virtualization – Around since the late ‘70s, virtualization now applies to everything from infrastructures to I/O.

On November 19, 2008 Global Language Monitor announced the most confusing yet frequently cited [[high tech]] [[buzzwords]] of 2008 to be cloud computing, [[green washing]], and [[buzzword]] compliant followed by resonate, de-duping, and virtualization.  Rounding out the Top Ten were [[Web 2.0]], [[Version control|versioning]], [[word clouds]], and [[petaflop]].  The most confusing Acronym for 2008 was [[SaaS]] (software as a service).

On 14 October 2007 GLM released a list of the most confusing high tech terms and buzzwords. The words included:
&lt;!-- This list formatted here for convenience does not publicly show up in rows, nor is it meant to. --&gt;
''[[iPod]]'',
''[[Adobe Flash|flash]]'',
''[[HTTP cookie|cookie]]'',
''nano'' and

followed by

(as in
''[[Mobile phone|cell phone]]''),
''[[plasma (physics)|plasma]]'',
''[[wiktionary:de-duplication|de-duplication]]''
and
''[[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-Ray]]''.
Other terms being tracked included
''[[terabyte]]'',
''[[Computer data storage|memory]]'',
''[[Magnetic core memory|core]]'',
and ''[[head crash]]''.
The most confusing acronym was found to be [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]], for service-oriented architecture, an acronym which [[IBM]] published a book about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=996 |title=Hooray! ‘SOA’ voted most ‘confusing acronym of the year’ &amp;#124; Service-Oriented Architecture &amp;#124; ZDNet.com |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=2007-11-05 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The studies were released each year on the anniversary of the ''cookie,'' the invention that made the [[World Wide Web]] practical for widespread surfing, communication, and [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=2968.php |title=The Global Language Monitor releases global study of top 10 most confusing yet widely used high tech buzzwords for 2007 |publisher=Nanowerk.com |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Times]] quoted Paul JJ Payack as saying that the PQI is "an algorithm that tracks words and phrases in the media and on the Internet in relation to frequency, context and appearance in global media.  It is a weighted index that takes into account year-to-year increases and acceleration in the last several months".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/realestate/29cov.html The Power of Words]&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, GLM describes its Predictive Quantities Indicator (PQI), used to run its analytics on global language trends and, as a weighted index, factoring in long-term trends, short-term changes, momentum and velocity, using frequency data on words and phrases in the global print and electronic media, on the Internet, and throughout the [[blogosphere]], as well as in proprietary databases ([[Factiva]], [[Lexis-Nexis]], etc.). It can also create "signals" that can be used in a variety of applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languagemonitor.com/predictive-quantities-indicator/pqi/  The Predictive Quantities Indicator (PQI)], GLM website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obama an English language word ==
On 20 February 2008 GLM announced that the latest word to enter the English language was "obama", derived from Barack Obama, in its many variations.  GLM described Obama- as a "root" for words including obamanomics, obamican, obamamentum, obamacize, obamarama, obamaNation, Obamafy, obamamania and obamacam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1579436/English-language-is-Barack-%27Obamafied%27.html English language is Barack 'Obamafied'], Catherine Elsworth, Los Angeles, Telegraph.co.uk, 26 Feb 2008&lt;/ref&gt; GLM announced it to be an accepted word, once it met the group's published criteria: a minimum of 25,000 citations in the global media, as well as achieving the necessary 'breadth' and 'depth' of citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/predictive-quantities-indicator/pqi// |title='PQI' |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11491">'''Gradualism''', from the Latin ''gradus'' ("step"), is a hypothesis, a theory or a tenet assuming that change comes about gradually or that variation is gradual in nature and happens over time as opposed to in large steps.&lt;ref&gt;Brian McGowran. (2008). ''Biostratigraphy: Microfossils and Geological Time''. Cambridge University Press. p. 384. {{ISBN|978-0521048170}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uniformitarianism]], [[incrementalism]], and [[reformism]] are similar concepts.

==Geology and biology==
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

In the natural sciences, gradualism is the [[theory]] which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes, often contrasted with [[catastrophism]].  The theory was proposed in 1795 by [[James Hutton]], a Scottish geologist, and was later incorporated into [[Charles Lyell]]'s theory of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].  Tenets from both theories were applied to [[biology]] and formed the basis of early [[evolution]]ary theory.

[[Charles Darwin]] was influenced by Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'', which explained both uniformitarian methodology and theory. Using uniformitarianism, which states that one cannot make an appeal to any force or phenomenon which cannot presently be observed (see [[catastrophism]]), Darwin theorized that the evolutionary process must occur gradually, not in [[Saltation (biology)|saltations]], since saltations are not presently observed, and extreme deviations from the usual phenotypic variation would be more likely to be selected against.

Gradualism is often confused with the concept of [[phyletic gradualism]]. It is a term coined by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] to contrast with their model of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which is gradualist itself, but argues that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability (called stasis), which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution.&lt;ref name=punc1972&gt;Eldredge, Niles, and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.pdf "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism."] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman, Cooper and Company, pp. 82-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phyletic gradualism ===
{{main|Phyletic gradualism}}
[[Phyletic gradualism]] is a model of [[evolution]] which theorizes that most [[speciation]] is slow, uniform and gradual.&lt;ref name=pe1972&gt;Eldredge, N. and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.asp "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism"] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; When evolution occurs in this mode, it is usually by the steady transformation of a whole [[species]] into a new one (through a process called [[anagenesis]]). In this view no clear line of demarcation exists between an ancestral species and a descendant species, unless [[cladogenesis|splitting]] occurs.

=== Punctuated gradualism ===
{{main|Punctuated gradualism}}
[[Punctuated gradualism]] is a [[microevolution]]ary [[hypothesis]] that refers to a species that has "relative stasis over a considerable part of its total duration [and] underwent periodic, relatively rapid, morphologic change that did not lead to lineage branching". It is one of the three common models of [[evolution]]. While the traditional model of palaeontology, the phylogenetic model, states that features evolved slowly without any direct association with speciation, the relatively newer and more controversial idea of [[punctuated equilibrium]] claims that major evolutionary changes don't happen over a gradual period but in localized, rare, rapid events of branching speciation.  Punctuated gradualism is considered to be a variation of these models, lying somewhere in between the [[phyletic gradualism]] model and the punctuated equilibrium model. It states that speciation is not needed for a lineage to rapidly evolve from one equilibrium to another but may show rapid transitions between long-stable states.

== Politics and society ==
{{Social democracy sidebar |Development}}

In [[politics]], gradualism is the hypothesis that social change can be achieved in small, discrete increments rather than in abrupt strokes such as [[revolution]]s or [[rebellion|uprisings]]. Gradualism is one of the defining features of political [[liberalism]] and [[reformism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=903 | title=Left reformism, the state and the problem of socialist politics today | author=Paul Blackledge | year=2013 | work= | publisher=International Socialist Journal | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Machiavellian]] politics pushes politicians to espouse gradualism.

In [[socialism|socialist politics]] and within the socialist movement, the concept of gradualism is frequently distinguished from reformism, with the former insisting that short-term goals need to be formulated and implemented in such a way that they inevitably lead into long-term goals. It is most commonly associated with the [[libertarian socialist]] concept of [[dual power]] and is seen as a middle way between reformism and [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionism]].

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]. The government wanted to try to integrate [[African-American]]s and European-Americans slowly into the same society, but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation:

Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.|Martin Luther King Jr.'s ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech, delivered August 28, 1963 at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Martin Luther|authorlink1=Martin Luther King|title=I have a dream speech|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1951-/martin-luther-kings-i-have-a-dream-speech-august-28-1963.php|accessdate=1 November 2015|date=August 28, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Linguistics and language change ==
In [[linguistics]], [[language change]] is seen as gradual, the product of chain reactions and subject to [[Drift (linguistics)#Long-term cyclic drift|cyclic drift]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Wittmann]] (1983). "Les réactions en chaîne en morphologie diachronique."  ''Actes du Colloque de la Société internationale de linguistique fonctionnelle'' 10.285-92.[http://www.nou-la.org/1983c-morphodia.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The view that [[creole language]]s are the product of [[catastrophism]] is heavily disputed.

==Morality==
===Christianity===
{{main|Law of graduality}}

Gradualism has also been used in a religious sense, especially in the [[Catholic Church]] (specifically, in [[Catholic ethics|ethics]] and [[Catholic moral theology|moral theology]]), to describe the view that certain individuals and families that make up a parish or community may be living at various points along a line extending from being in a state of [[mortal sin]], to being at least minimally in the "[[State (theology)|state]] of [[Grace in Christianity|grace]]" and able to receive the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], and to a level of greater [[Universal call to holiness|holiness]]. This view teaches that the lives and relationships of people with morally unacceptable lifestyles may have some elements of good, even of great good, such as [[Agape|sacrificial love]] and consistent respect. It holds that virtues are not all-or-nothing propositions, and that elements of good may be found even in the context of morally unacceptable situations. Catholic clergy who espouse this view include the Bishop of [[San Diego, California]], [[Robert W. McElroy]], who in 2016 wrote: {{quote|The principle of gradualness reaches far beyond the question of marriage to embrace all elements of the Christian moral life, for it really is an embodiment of the pastoral method of the Lord himself. Pope Francis repeatedly cites the example of Jesus’ conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well as a prism through which to construct the Church’s outreach to young couples, a prism which embraces them in their humanity and their love, rather than categorizing them as living in sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/church/2016/05/11/san-diego-bishop-backs-pope-on-divorced-and-remarried/|title=San Diego bishop backs pope on divorced and remarried|work=Crux|date=May 11, 2016|author=Michael O'Loughlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Buddhism and other Oriental philosophies===
{{main|Subitism}}
&lt;!--"Five precepts" links here.--&gt; 
Gradualism is the approach of certain schools of Buddhism and other Eastern philosophies (e.g. [[Theravada]] or [[Yoga]]), that [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] can be achieved step by step, through an arduous practice. The opposite approach, that [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] is attained all at once, is called [[subitism]]. The debate on the issue was very important to the history of the development of [[Zen]], which rejected gradualism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/ChanZenStudies.htm Bernard Faure, ''Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field'']&lt;/ref&gt; and to the establishment of the opposite approach within the [[Tibetan Buddhism]], after the [[Debate of Samye]]. It was continued in other schools of [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and [[Chinese philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Gregory | first =Peter N. (editor) | year =1991 | title =''Sudden and Gradual. Approaches to Enlightenment in Chinese Thought'' | place =Delhi | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types==
[[Lorenzo Peña#Contradictorial gradualism|Contradictorial gradualism]] is the paraconsistent treatment of [[Fuzzy logic|fuzziness]] developed by [[Lorenzo Peña]] which regards true contradictions as situations wherein a state of affairs enjoys only partial existence.

Gradualism in [[social change]] implemented through [[reformist]] means is a moral principle to which the [[Fabian Society]] is committed. In a more general way, [[reformism]] is the assumption that gradual changes through and within existing institutions can ultimately change a [[society]]'s fundamental [[economic system]] and political structures; and that an accumulation of reforms can lead to the emergence of an entirely different economic system and form of society than present-day [[capitalism]]. That hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to [[revolutionary socialism]], which contends that [[revolution]] is necessary for fundamental structural changes to occur.

In the terminology of [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Gradualism|NWO]]-related speculations, gradualism refers to the gradual implementation of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government]].

The '''Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem''' (GYE) is one of the last remaining large, nearly intact [[ecosystem]]s in the northern [[temperate zone]] of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="ecosystem"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schullery |first=Paul |url=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm |title=The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem |work=Our Living Resources |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2007-03-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927172031/http://biology.usgs.gov/s%2Bt/noframe/r114.htm |archivedate=2006-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located within the northern [[Rocky Mountains]], in areas of northwestern [[Wyoming]], southwestern [[Montana]], and eastern [[Idaho]], and is about 18 million acres.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/our-work/greater-yellowstone-ecosystem#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellowstone National Park]] and the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] 'hotspot' are within it.&lt;ref&gt;Initial wikipedia article was based on [[public domain]] [http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm Biology.usgs.gov content written by Paul Schullery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925064249/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}, from the [[U.S. National Park Service]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict over ecological and resource management has been controversial, and the area is a flagship site among conservation groups that promote [[ecosystem management]]. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) is one of the world's foremost natural laboratories in [[landscape ecology]] and [[Holocene]] [[geology]], and is a world-renowned recreational destination. It is also home to the diverse [[native plant]]s and [[animals of Yellowstone]].

==History==
Yellowstone National Park boundaries were drawn in 1872 to include all the known [[Geothermal areas of Yellowstone|geothermal basins in the region]]. No other landscape ecology considerations were incorporated into boundary decisions. By the 1970s, however, the [[grizzly bear]]'s (''Ursus arctos'') range in and near the park became the first informal minimum boundary of a theoretical "Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem" that included at least {{convert|16000|km2|acre}}. Since then, definitions of the greater ecosystem's size have steadily grown larger. A 1994 study listed the size as {{convert|76890|km2|acre}}, while a 1994 speech by a Greater Yellowstone Coalition leader enlarged that to {{convert|80000|km2|acre}}.

In 1985 the [[United States House of Representatives]] Subcommittees on Public Lands and National Parks and Recreation held a joint subcommittee hearing on Greater Yellowstone, resulting in a 1986 report by the [[Congressional Research Service]] outlining shortcomings in inter-agency coordination and concluding that the area's essential values were at risk.

===Federal protection===
Federally managed areas within the GYE include: 
* [[United States National Park Service]] (NPS) — [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Grand Teton National Park]], and [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway]].
* [[United States National Forest Service]] (USFS) — [[Gallatin National Forest|Gallatin]], [[Custer National Forest|Custer]], [[Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest]], [[Caribou-Targhee National Forest|Caribou-Targhee]], [[Bridger-Teton National Forest|Bridger-Teton]], and [[Shoshone National Forest]]s
* [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) — [[National Elk Refuge]], [[Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge|Red Rock Lakes]] and [[Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge]]s

Ten distinct [[National Wilderness Preservation System|National Wilderness Area]]s have been established within the GYE's [[United States National Forest|National Forest]]s since 1966, mandating a higher level of [[habitat]] protection than the USFS otherwise uses.

The GYE also encompasses some privately held and state lands surrounding those managed by the U.S. Government.

[[The Trust for Public Land]] has protected 67,000 acres over about 40 projects in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Ecosystem management by species==
The great ecosystem concept has been most often advanced through concerns over individual [[species]] rather than over broader ecological principles. Though 20 or 30 or even 50 years of information on a population may be considered long-term by some, one of the important lessons of Greater Yellowstone management is that even half a century is not long enough to give a full idea of how a species may vary in its occupation of a wild ecosystem.

The Yellowstone hot springs are important for their diversity of [[Thermophile|thermophilic]] bacteria. These bacteria have been useful in studies of the evolution of [[photosynthesis]] and as sources of thermostable [[enzyme]]s for [[molecular biology]]. Although the smell of [[sulfur]] is common and there are some sulfur fixing [[cyanobacteria]], it has been found that [[hydrogen]] is being used as an energy source by [[extremophile]] [[microbe]]s.

===Flora===
{{See also|Category: Flora of the Rocky Mountains}}
Among [[native plant]]s of the GYE, [[Pinus albicaulis|whitebark pine (''Pinus albicaulis'')]] is a species of special interest, in large part because of its seasonal importance to grizzly bears, but also because its distribution could be dramatically reduced by relatively minor [[global warming]]. In this case, researchers do not have a good long-term data set on the species, but they understand its ecology well enough to project declining future [[conservation status]]. A more immediate and serious threat to whitebark pines is an introduced [[rust (fungus)|fungal rust]] disease, [[White Pine Blister Rust]] (''Cronartium ribicola''), which is causing heavy mortality in the species. Occasional resistant individuals occur, but in the short to medium term, a severe population decline is expected.

Estimates of the decline of [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspen (''Populus tremuloides'')]] on the park's northern range since 1872 range from 50% to 95%. Perhaps no conservation controversy underway in Greater Yellowstone more clearly reveals the need for comprehensive interdisciplinary research.&lt;br&gt;
Several factors are suspected in the quaking aspen's changing status, including: 
*[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] influences on numerous [[mammal]] species and on [[fire ecology]]-return intervals before the creation of the park in 1872.
*European influences on [[wildfire]] frequency since 1886; regional [[climate]] warming.
*Human harvests of [[North American beaver|beaver]] and [[ungulate]]s in the first 15 years of the park's history, and of [[Gray wolf|wolves]] and other [[predator]]s before 1930.
*Human settlement on traditional ungulate migration routes north of the park since 1872; ungulate (especially [[elk]]) effects on all other parts of the ecosystem since 1900; and human influences on elk distribution in the park.

===Fauna===
{{See also|Category: Fauna of the Rocky Mountains}}
Anecdotal information on grizzly bear abundance dates to the mid-19th century, and administrators have made informal population estimates for more than 70 years. From these sources, ecologists know the species was common in Greater Yellowstone when [[Europe]]ans arrived and that the population was not isolated before the 1930s, but is now. Researchers do not know if bears were more or less common than now.

A 1959-1970 [[bear]] study suggested a grizzly bear population size of about 176, later revised to about 229.&lt;ref&gt;http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm#23489 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925064249/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later estimates have ranged as low as 136 and as high as 540; the most recent is a minimum estimate of 236,&lt;ref&gt;http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm#23525 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925064249/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but biologists think there may be as many as 1,000 bears in the ecosystem. Although the Greater Yellowstone population is relatively close to recovery goals, the plan's definition of recovery is controversial. Thus, even though the population may be stable or possibly increasing in the short term, in the longer term, continued [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] loss, climate change, and increasing [[human]] activities may well reverse the trend.

[[Yellowstone cutthroat trout]] (''Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri'') have suffered considerable declines since European settlement, but recently began flourishing in some areas. Especially in [[Yellowstone Lake]] itself, long-term records indicate an almost remarkable restoration of robust populations from only three decades ago when the numbers of this [[fish]] were depleted because of excessive harvest. Its current recovery, though a significant management achievement, does not begin to restore the species' historical abundance. Also, they declined because of invasive lake trout. An aggressive lake trout removal program has caused the cutthroats to rebound.

Early accounts of [[pronghorn]] (''Antilocapra americana'') in Greater Yellowstone described [[herd]]s of hundreds seen ranging through most major [[valley|river valley]]s. These populations were decimated by 1900, and declines continued among remaining herds. On the park's northern range, pronghorn declined from 500-700 in the 1930s to about 122 in 1968. By 1992 the herd had increased to 536.

====Gray Wolf reintroduction====
{{main|Wolf reintroduction|History of wolves in Yellowstone}}
The park is a commonly cited example of [[apex predator]]s affecting an ecosystem through a [[trophic cascade]]. After the reintroduction of the [[gray wolf]] in 1995, researchers noticed drastic changes occurring. [[Elk]], the primary prey of the gray wolf, became less abundant and changed their behavior, freeing riparian zones from constant grazing. The respite allowed willows and aspens to grow, creating habitat for [[North American beaver|beaver]],&lt;ref name=LOE032015&gt;{{cite news|title=Beyond the Headlines|url=http://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=15-P13-00012&amp;segmentID=5|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=Living on Earth|date=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[moose]], and scores of other species. In addition to the effects on prey species, the gray wolf's presence also affected the park's [[grizzly bear]] population. The bears, emerging from hibernation, chose to scavenge off wolf kills to gain needed energy and fatten up after fasting for months. Dozens of other species have been documented scavenging from wolf kills.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120716054429/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?artid=357498 Gray Wolves as Climate Change Buffers in Yellowstone]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}&lt;!-- references some of the section, but not yet all--&gt;

'''Holism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὅλος}} ''holos'' "all, whole, entire") is the idea that [[system]]s (physical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic) and their properties should be viewed as wholes, not just as a collection of parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Barry | last = Oshry | title = Seeing Systems: Unlocking the Mysteries of Organizational Life | publisher = Berrett-Koehler | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sunny Y | last = Auyang | title = Foundations of Complex-system Theories: in Economics, Evolutionary Biology, and Statistical Physics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term holism was coined by [[Jan_Smuts|Jan Smuts]].&lt;ref name="HaE"&gt;{{ cite book | first = Jan Christiaan | last = Smuts | title = Holism and Evolution 2nd Edition |publisher = Macmillan and Co | year = 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first publication of ''Holism and Evolution'' was by Macmillan and Co. in 1926. Smuts published a 2nd edition in 1927 and there have been at least three subsequent reprints; Compass/Viking Press 1961, Greenwood Press 1973, and Sierra Sunrise Books 1999 (a version edited by Sanford Holst). The full text of the 1927 2nd edition is available on the Internet Archive site, and this is the source used in updating the Holism page.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Adler]] considered holism as a concept that represents all of the wholes in the universe, and these wholes are the real factors in the universe. Further, that Holism also denoted a theory of the universe in the same vein as Materialism and Spiritualism.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|120–121}}

== Synopsis of ''Holism and Evolution'' ==
After identifying the need for reform in the fundamental concepts of matter, life and mind (chapter 1) Smuts examines the reformed concepts (as of 1926) of space and time (chapter 2), matter (chapter 3) and biology (chapter 4) and concludes that the close approach to each other of the concepts of matter, life and mind, and the partial overflow of each other's domain, imply that there is a fundamental principle (Holism) of which they are the progressive outcome.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|86}}  Chapters 5 and 6 provide the general concept, functions and categories of Holism; chapters 7 and 8 address Holism with respect to Mechanism and Darwinism, chapters 9-11 make a start towards demonstrating the concepts and functions of Holism for the metaphysical categories (mind, personality, ideals) and the book concludes with a chapter that argues for the universal ubiquity of Holism and its place as a monistic ontology.

The following is an overview of Smuts' opinions regarding the general concept, functions, and categories of Holism; like the definition of Holism, other than the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, the editor is unaware of any authoritative secondary sources corroborating Smuts' opinions.

=== Structure ===
Wholes are composites which have an internal structure, function or character which clearly differentiate them from mechanical additions, aggregates, and constructions, such as science assumes on the mechanical hypothesis.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|106}} The concept of structure is not confined to the physical domain (e.g. chemical, biological and artifacts);  it also applies to the metaphysical domain (e.g. mental structures, properties, attributes, values, ideals, etc.)&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|161}}

=== Field ===
The field of a whole is not something different and additional to it, it is the continuation of the whole beyond its sensible contours of experience.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|113}}  The field characterizes a whole as a unified and synthesised event in the system of Relativity, that includes not only its present but also its past—and also its future potentialities.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|89}}  As such, the concept of field entails both activity and structure.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|115}}

=== Variation ===

Darwin's theory of organic descent placed primary emphasis on the role of natural selection, but there would be nothing to select if not for variation.  Variations that are the result of mutations in the biological sense and variations that are the result of individually acquired modifications in the personal sense are attributed by Smuts to Holism; further it was his opinion that because variations appear in complexes and not singly, evolution is more than the outcome of individual selections; it is holistic.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|190–192}}

=== Regulation ===

The whole exhibits a discernible regulatory function as it relates to cooperation and coordination of the structure and activity of parts, and to the selection and deselection of variations. The result is a balanced correlation of organs and functions. The activities of the parts are directed to central ends; co-operation and unified action instead of the separate mechanical activities of the parts.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|125}}

=== Creativity ===
It is the intermingling of fields which is creative or causal in nature.  This is seen in matter, where if not for its dynamic structural creative character matter could not have been the mother of the universe.  This function, or factor of creativity is even more marked in biology where the protoplasm of the cell is vitally active in an ongoing process of creative change where parts are continually being destroyed and replaced by new protoplasm. With minds the regulatory function of Holism acquires consciousness and freedom, demonstrating a creative power of the most far-reaching character. Holism is not only creative but self-creative, and its final structures are far more holistic than its initial structures.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|18, 37, 67–68, 88–89 }}

=== Causality ===
As it relates to causality Smuts makes reference to [[A. N. Whitehead]], and indirectly [[Baruch Spinoza]]; the Whitehead premise is that organic mechanism is a fundamental process which realizes and actualizes individual syntheses or unities.  Holism (the factor) exemplifies this same idea while emphasizing the holistic character of the process.  The whole completely transforms the concept of Causality; results are not directly a function of causes. The whole absorbs and integrates the cause into its own activity; results appear as the consequence of the activity of the whole.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|121–124,126}}  Note that this material relating to Whitehead's influence as it relates to causality was added in the second edition, and of course will not be found in reprints of the first edition; nor is it included in the most recent Holst edition.  It is the second edition of ''Holism and Evolution'' (1927) that provides the most recent and definitive treatment by Smuts.

=== The whole is greater than the sum of its parts ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fundamental holistic characters as a unity of parts which is so close and intense as to be more than the sum of its parts; which not only gives a particular conformation or structure to the parts, but so relates and determines them in their synthesis that their functions are altered;  the synthesis affects and determines the parts, so that they function towards the whole; and the whole and the parts, therefore reciprocally influence and determine each other, and appear more or less to merge their individual characters: the whole is in the parts and the parts are in the whole, and this synthesis of whole and parts is reflected in the holistic character of the functions of the parts as well as of the whole.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Progressive grading of wholes ===
A "rough and provisional" summary of the progressive grading of wholes that comprise holism is as follows:&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|109}}

# Material structure e.g. a chemical compound
# Functional structure in living bodies 
# Animals, which exhibit a degree of central control that is primarily implicit and unconscious
# Personality, characterized as conscious central control
# States and similar group organizations characterized by central control that involve many people 
# Holistic Ideals, or absolute Values, distinct from human personality that are creative factors in the creation of a spiritual world, for example Truth, Beauty and Goodness.

==Holism in philosophy==
{{main|Confirmation holism|Semantic holism}}
In philosophy, any doctrine that emphasizes the priority of a whole over its parts is holism. Some suggest that such a definition owes its origins to a non-holistic view of language and places it in the reductivist camp. Alternately, a 'holistic' definition of holism denies the necessity of a division between the function of separate parts and the workings of the 'whole'. Effectively this means that the concept of a part has no absolute foundation in observation, but is rather a result of a materialist structuring of reality based on the necessity of logical and distinct units as a means to deriving information through comparative analysis. It suggests that the key recognizable characteristic of a concept of 'true' holism is a sense of the fundamental truth of any particular experience. This exists in contradistinction to what is perceived as the reductivist reliance on inductive method as the key to verification of its concept of how the parts function within the whole. Equally the potential for recognising the clarity of holistic experience within the logical terms of maths is limited by the abstract nature of numbers. In terms of real life measurements numbers have no scale or dimensional properties, so they have to rely on experimentally verified units (e.g. inches, volts, calories etc.), to describe reality. It is this reliance on the holistic integrity of experience which leads to the recognition that intuitive perception rather than mathematical calculation is the source of the truth of effective theories.  (See references Holism, 2016.)

=== Philosophy of language ===
In the [[philosophy of language]] this becomes the claim, called [[semantic holism]], that the meaning of an individual word or sentence can only be understood in terms of its relations to a larger body of language, even a whole theory or a whole language. In the [[philosophy of mind]], a mental state may be identified only in terms of its relations with others. This is often referred to as "content holism" or "holism of the mental". This notion involves the philosophies of such figures as [[Frege]], [[Wittgenstein]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_holism.html ''Holism'', The Basics of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemological and confirmation holism ===
[[epistemological holism|Epistemological]] and [[confirmation holism]] are mainstream ideas in contemporary philosophy.

=== Ontological holism ===
Ontological holism was espoused by [[David Bohm]] in his theory&lt;ref&gt;Bohm, D. (1980). ''Wholeness and the Implicate Order''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7100-0971-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[implicate and explicate order]].

=== Spinoza ===
The concept of holism played a pivotal role in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Huenemann, ''Interpreting Spinoza: Critical Essays'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eccy De Jonge, ''Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism'', UK: Ashgate Publishing, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hegel ===
Hegel rejected "the fundamentally atomistic conception of the object," (Stern, 38) arguing that "individual objects exist as manifestations of indivisible substance-universals, which cannot be reduced to a set of properties or attributes; he therefore holds that the object should be treated as an ontologically primary whole." (Stern, 40) In direct opposition to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], therefore, "Hegel insists that the unity we find in our experience of the world is not constructed by us out of a plurality of intuitions." (Stern, 40) In "his ontological scheme a concrete individual is not reducible to a plurality of sensible properties, but rather exemplifies a substance universal." (Stern, 41) His point is that it is "a mistake to treat an organic substance like blood as nothing more than a compound of unchanging chemical elements, that can be separated and united without being fundamentally altered." (Stern, 103) In Hegel's view, a substance like blood is thus "more of an organic unity and cannot be understood as just an external composition of the sort of distinct substances that were discussed at the level of chemistry." (Stern, 103) Thus in Hegel's view, blood is blood and cannot be successfully reduced to what we consider are its component parts; we must view it as a whole substance entire unto itself. This is most certainly a fundamentally holistic view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafire.com/?rxmn2t1votf Robert Stern, ''Hegel, Kant and the Structure of the Object'', London: Routledge Chapman Hall, 1990 (full text download)] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160520122904/http://www.mediafire.com/?rxmn2t1votf |date=2016-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- [Editors note: work in progress, moving references to Hegel to a common section] [[Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stern, ''Hegel, Kant and the Structure of the Object'', London: Routledge, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;6 &amp; p.&amp;nbsp;135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merold Westphal, ''Hegel, Freedom, and Modernity'', New York: SUNY, 1992, pp.79-81, &amp; p.&amp;nbsp;86&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Esfield, ''Holism in Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Physics'', Springer, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Maria Tito, ''Logic in the Husserlian Context'', Northwestern University Press, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;245&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Holism in physical sciences==
{{main |Holism in science}}

=== Agriculture ===
There are several newer methods in [[agricultural science]] such as [[permaculture]] and holistic planned grazing ([[holistic management]]) that integrate [[ecology]] and [[social sciences]] with food production. [[Organic farming]] is sometimes considered a holistic approach.

=== Chaos and complexity ===
In the latter half of the 20th century, holism led to [[systems thinking]] and its derivatives. Systems in biology, psychology, or sociology are frequently so complex that their behavior is, or appears, "new" or "[[emergence|emergent]]": it cannot be deduced from the properties of the elements alone.{{Sfn | von Bertalanffy | 1971 | p = 54}}

Holism has thus been used as a catchword. This contributed to the resistance encountered by the scientific interpretation of holism, which insists that there are [[ontology|ontological]] reasons that prevent reductive models in principle from providing efficient algorithms for prediction of system behavior in certain classes of systems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Scientific holism holds that the behavior of a system cannot be perfectly predicted, no matter how much data is available. Natural systems can produce surprisingly unexpected behavior, and it is suspected that behavior of such systems might be [[computational irreducibility|computationally irreducible]], which means it would not be possible to even approximate the system state without a full simulation of all the events occurring in the system. Key properties of the higher level behavior of certain classes of systems may be mediated by rare "surprises" in the behavior of their elements due to the principle of interconnectivity, thus evading predictions except by brute force simulation.

[[Complex systems|Complexity theory]] (also called "science of complexity") is a contemporary heir of systems thinking. It comprises both computational and holistic, relational approaches towards understanding [[complex adaptive systems]], and especially in the latter, some argue that it can be seen as the polar opposite to reductive methods. General theories of complexity have been proposed, and numerous complexity institutes and departments have sprung up around the world. The [[Santa Fe Institute]] is arguably the most famous of them.

=== Ecology ===
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The Earth seen from [[Apollo 17]]]]
{{See also|Holistic community}}
Holistic thinking is often applied to ecology, combining biological, chemical, physical, economic, ethical, and political insights. The complexity grows with the area, so that it is necessary to reduce the characteristic of the view in other ways, for example to a specific time of duration.

[[John Muir]], Scots-born early American conservationist,&lt;ref&gt;Reconnecting with John Muir By Terry Gifford, University of Georgia, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "When we try to pick out anything by itself we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe".

More information is to be found in the field of [[systems ecology]], a cross-disciplinary field influenced by [[general systems theory]].

=== Medicine ===
In [[primary care]] the term "holistic," has been used to describe approaches that take into account social considerations and other intuitive judgements.&lt;ref name="TudorHart2010"&gt;[[Julian Tudor Hart]] (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_6-NeAqcsC&amp;pg=PA258 ''The Political Economy of Health Care''] pp.106, 258&lt;/ref&gt; The term holism, and so-called approaches, appear in [[psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]] medicine in the 1970s, when they were considered one possible way to conceptualize psychosomatic phenomena. Instead of charting one-way causal links from [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] to [[Soma (biology)|soma]], or vice versa, it aimed at a systemic model, where multiple biological, psychological and social factors were seen as interlinked.&lt;ref name="Lipowski1977"/&gt;

Other, alternative approaches in the 1970s were psychosomatic and somatopsychic approaches, which concentrated on causal links only from psyche to soma, or from soma to psyche, respectively.&lt;ref name="Lipowski1977"&gt;Lipowski, 1977.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present it is commonplace in psychosomatic medicine to state that psyche and soma cannot really be separated for practical or theoretical purposes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} A disturbance on any level—somatic, psychic, or social—will radiate to all the other levels, too. In this sense, psychosomatic thinking is similar to the [[biopsychosocial model]] of medicine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Many [[alternative medicine]] practitioners claim a [[Holistic health|holistic approach to healing]].

=== Neurology ===
A lively debate has run since the end of the 19th century regarding the functional organization of the [[brain]]. The holistic tradition (e.g., [[Pierre Marie]]) maintained that the brain was a homogeneous organ with no specific subparts whereas the localizationists (e.g., [[Paul Broca]]) argued that the brain was organized in functionally distinct [[cortical area]]s which were each specialized to process a given type of information or implement specific mental operations. The controversy was [[epitome|epitomized]] with the existence of a [[language]] area in the brain, nowadays known as [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref&gt;'Does Broca's area exist?': Christofredo Jakob's 1906 response to Pierre Marie's holistic stance. Kyrana Tsapkini, Ana B. Vivas, Lazaros C. Triarhou. ''Brain and Language'', Volume 105, Issue 3, June 2008, Pages 211-219 {{DOI|10.1016/j.bandl.2007.07.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holism in social sciences==

=== Architecture ===
Architecture is often argued by design academics and those practicing in design to be a holistic enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this context, holism tends to imply an all-inclusive design perspective. This trait is considered exclusive to architecture, distinct from other professions involved in design projects.

=== Branding ===
A holistic brand (also holistic branding) is considering the entire brand or image of the company. For example, a universal brand image across all countries, including everything from advertising styles to the stationery the company has made, to the company colours.

=== Economics ===
With roots in [[Schumpeter]], the evolutionary approach might be considered the holistic theory in economics. It shares certain language from the biological evolutionary approach. It takes into account how the [[innovation system]] evolves over time. Knowledge and know-how, know-who, know-what and know-why are part of the whole business economics. Knowledge can also be tacit, as described by [[Michael Polanyi]]. These models are open, and consider that it is hard to predict exactly the impact of a policy measure. They are also less mathematical.

=== Education reform ===
The [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives]] identifies many levels of cognitive functioning, which can be used to create a more [[holistic education]]. In [[authentic assessment]], rather than using computers to score multiple choice tests, a [[standards based assessment]] uses trained scorers to score open-response items using holistic scoring methods.&lt;ref&gt;Rubrics (Authentic Assessment Toolbox) "So, when might you use a holistic rubric? Holistic rubrics tend to be used when a quick or gross judgment needs to be made." [http://jonathan.mueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/rubrics.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In projects such as the North Carolina Writing Project, scorers are instructed not to count errors, or count numbers of points or supporting statements. The scorer is instead instructed to judge holistically whether "as a whole" is it more a "2" or a "3". Critics question whether such a process can be as objective as computer scoring, and the degree to which such scoring methods can result in different scores from different scorers.

===Psychology===

==== Psychology of perception ====
A major holistic movement in the early twentieth century was [[gestalt psychology]]. The claim was that perception is not an aggregation of atomic [[sense data]] but a field, in which there is a figure and a ground. Background has holistic effects on the perceived figure. Gestalt psychologists included [[Wolfgang Koehler]], [[Max Wertheimer]], and [[Kurt Koffka]]. Koehler claimed the perceptual fields corresponded to electrical fields in the brain. [[Karl Lashley]] did experiments with gold foil pieces inserted in monkey brains purporting to show that such fields did not exist. However, many of the perceptual illusions and visual phenomena exhibited by the gestaltists were taken over (often without credit) by later perceptual psychologists. Gestalt psychology had influence on [[Fritz Perls]]' [[gestalt therapy]], although some old-line gestaltists opposed the association with counter-cultural and [[New Age]] trends later associated with gestalt therapy. Gestalt theory was also influential on phenomenology. [[Aron Gurwitsch]] wrote on the role of the field of consciousness in gestalt theory in relation to phenomenology. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] made much use of holistic psychologists such as work of [[Kurt Goldstein]] in his ''Phenomenology of Perception''.

==== Teleological psychology ====
[[Alfred Adler]] believed that the individual (an integrated whole expressed through a self-consistent unity of thinking, feeling, and action, moving toward an unconscious, [[Classical Adlerian psychology#Fictional final goal|fictional final goal]]), must be understood within the larger wholes of society, from the groups to which he belongs (starting with his face-to-face relationships), to the larger whole of mankind. The recognition of our social embeddedness and the need for developing an interest in the welfare of others, as well as a respect for nature, is at the heart of Adler's philosophy of living and principles of psychotherapy.

[[Edgar Morin]], the French philosopher and sociologist, can be considered a holist based on the [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] nature of his work.

Mel Levine, M.D., author of ''A Mind at a Time'',&lt;ref&gt;(Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder (with Charles R. Schwab) of the not-for-profit organization All Kinds of Minds, can be considered a holist based on his view of the 'whole child' as a product of many systems and his work supporting the educational needs of children through the management of a child's educational profile as a whole rather than isolated weaknesses in that profile.

=== Anthropology ===
There is an ongoing dispute as to whether anthropology is intrinsically holistic. Supporters of this concept consider anthropology holistic in two senses. First, it is concerned with all human beings across times and places, and with all dimensions of humanity (evolutionary, biophysical, sociopolitical, economic, cultural, psychological, etc.)  Further, many academic programs following this approach take a "four-field" approach to anthropology that encompasses [[physical anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]] or [[social anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shore | first = Bradd | year = 1999 | title = Strange Fate of Holism | journal = Anthropology News | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 4–5 | doi = 10.1111/an.1999.40.9.5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some leading anthropologists disagree, and consider anthropological holism to be an artifact from 19th century [[sociocultural evolution|social evolutionary]] thought that inappropriately imposes scientific [[positivism]] upon cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=Sacred_bundle&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last =Segal | editor1-first = Daniel A | first2 = Ian | editor2-last = Yanagisako | first1 = James | last1 = Clifford | last2 = Hodder | first3 = Rena | last3 = Lederman | first4 = Michael | last4 = Silverstein |title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology |publisher=Duke University Press |year= 2005 |url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/cgibin/forwardsql/search.cgi?template0=nomatch.htm&amp;template2=books/book_detail_page.htm&amp;user_id=11016434335&amp;Bmain.Btitle_option=1&amp;Bmain.Btitle=Unwrapping+the+Sacred+Bundle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "holism" is additionally used within social and cultural anthropology to refer to an analysis of a society as a whole which refuses to break society into component parts. One definition says: "as a methodological ideal, holism implies ... that one does not permit oneself to believe that our own established institutional boundaries (e.g. between politics, sexuality, religion, economics) necessarily may be found also in foreign societies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/holism.htm anthrobase definition of holism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Émile Durkheim ====
{{main|Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft}} {{see also|Ubuntu (philosophy)}}
[[Émile Durkheim]] developed a concept of holism which he set as opposite to the notion that a [[society]] was nothing more than a simple collection of individuals. In more recent times, [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]], 1984&lt;/ref&gt; has contrasted "holism" to "[[individualism]]" as two different forms of societies. According to him, modern humans live in an individualist society, whereas ancient Greek society, for example, could be qualified as "holistic", because the individual found identity in the whole society. Thus, the individual was ready to sacrifice himself or herself for his or her [[community]], as his or her life without the ''[[polis]]'' had no sense whatsoever.

==== Cosmomorphism ====
The French Protestant missionary [[Maurice Leenhardt]] coined the term "cosmomorphism" to indicate the state of perfect [[symbiosis]] with the surrounding environment which characterized the culture of the [[Melanesians]] of [[New Caledonia]]. For these people, an isolated individual is totally indeterminate, indistinct, and featureless until he can find his position within the natural and social world in which he is inserted. The confines between the self and the world are annulled to the point that the material body itself is no guarantee of the sort of recognition of identity which is typical of our own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Bihan, [http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ile.en.ile/paroles/bihan_writer.html "The Writer, a Man Without Qualities"], ''Literature and Identity in New Caledonia''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Rasmussen, [http://ijds.lemoyne.edu/journal/3_1/pdf/IJDS.3.1.03.Rasmussen.pdf "Personahood, Self, Difference, and Dialogue (Commentary on Chaudhary)"], ''International Journal for Dialogical Science'', Fall 2008, Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;1, 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
Holistic concepts are strongly represented within the thoughts expressed within [[Logos]] (per [[Heraclitus]]), [[Panentheism]] and [[Pantheism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[theological anthropology]], which belongs to theology and not to anthropology, holism is the belief that [[Human body|body]], [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]] are not separate components of a person, but rather facets of a united whole.&lt;ref&gt;"The traditional anthropology encounters major problems in the Bible and its predominantly holistic view of human beings. Genesis 2:7 is a key verse: 'Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being' (NRSV). The 'living being' (traditionally, 'living soul') is an attempt to translate the Hebrew ''nephesh hayah'', which indicates a 'living person' in the context. More than one interpreter has pointed out that this text does not say that the human being ''has'' a soul but rather ''is'' a soul. H. Wheeler Robinson summarized the matter in his statement that 'The Hebrew conceived man as animated body and not as an incarnate soul.'" (Martin E. Tate, "The Comprehensive Nature of Salvation in Biblical Perspective," ''Evangelical review of theology'', Vol. 23.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4774">'''Inner-worldly asceticism''' was characterized by [[Max Weber]] in ''[[Economy and Society]]'' as the concentration of human behavior upon activities leading to salvation within the context of the everyday world.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Elton, ''Reformation Europe'' (1969) p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

He saw it as a prime influence in the emergence of [[modernity]] and the technological world,&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (1972) p. 14 and p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; a point developed in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.

==Four-fold typology==

Weber's [[Ideal type|typology]] of religion set off the distinction between asceticism and [[mysticism]] against that between inner-worldly and other-worldly orientations, to produce a four-fold set of religious types.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talcott Parsons]], Introduction, Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. li&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pawel Stefan Zaleski "Ideal Types in Max Weber’s Sociology of Religion: Some Theoretical Inspirations for a Study of the Religious Field", ''Polish Sociological Review'' No. 3(171)/2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to Talcott Parsons, otherwordly stances provided no leverage upon socio-economic problems, and inner-worldly mystics attached no significance to the material world surrounding them,&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. li-lii&lt;/ref&gt; the inner-worldly ascetic acted within the institutions of the world, while being opposed to them, and as an instrument of God. However Stefan Zaleski showed that inner-worldly mysticism that is magic was interested in active transformation of reality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In religions which can be characterized by inner-world-asceticim, the world appears to the religious virtuoso as his responsibility.&lt;ref name="weber_asceticism"&gt;Weber, Max. "Asceticism, Mysticism and Salvation." In ''Economy and society; an outline of interpretive sociology''.. New York: Bedminster Press, 1968. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationalism==

For Weber, the worldly ascetic is a rationalist. He rationalizes his own conduct but also rejects conduct which is specifically irrational, esthetic, or dependent upon his own emotional reactions to the world.&lt;ref name="weber_asceticism2"&gt;Weber, Max. "Asceticism, Mysticism and Salvation." In ''Economy and society; an outline of interpretive sociology''.. New York: Bedminster Press, 1968. 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inner-worldly asceticism, including above all [[Protestantism]], taught the fulfillment of obligations in the world as the sole method of proving religious merit. Its emphasis on the importance of one's [[Vocation|calling]] encouraged the differentiation of life-spheres, while its rationality favoured an emphasis on [[natural law]]&lt;ref&gt;David Owen, ''Maturity and Modernity'' (1994) p. 11-7&lt;/ref&gt; – further aspects enhancing the impact Weber postulated such asceticism had upon the development of [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 528&lt;/ref&gt; or rather the particular type of capitalism Weber saw as marked by "the rational organization and institutionalization of social relationships...rational bourgeois capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''Sociology'' p. 183 and p. lix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

* Critics have challenged the validity of Weber's linking of Calvinism, and predestination in particular, with the emergence of the capitalist spirit;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Oakes, 'The Thing That Would Not Die: Notes on Refutation' in H. Lehman/G. Roth eds, ''Weber's Protestant Ethic'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as disputing more generally any inherent or correlative link between Protestantism and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Elton, p. 312-8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Postmodernism]] in its repudiation of [[metanarratives]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Appiganesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; has rejected Weber's theory as one (Eurocentric) aspect of such grand tales;&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Fredric Jameson]] sees it as illuminating at least one facet of the bourgeois cultural revolution&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;—the psycho-sociological transformation that accompanied the move from [[Traditional society|traditional]] [[agrarian society]] to the modern urban world-system.

The '''Institute for Science and Society (ISS)''' was an international centre of excellence{{clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what is a centre of excellence}} in [[Science and Technology Studies]] located at the [[University of Nottingham]], [[UK]].

== History ==

It was founded in 1998 as the Genetics and Society Unit (GSU) and was later (2001) renamed the Institute for the Study of Genetics, Biorisks and Society (IGBiS) before its remit was expanded in 2006 to cover the social, legal, ethical and cultural implications of any field of science, medicine or technology, at which point it became ISS. The Institute was restructured in 2010 and mostly merged into the School of Sociology and Social Policy.

== About ISS ==

The Institute for Science and Society was a multidisciplinary centre drawing on a wide range of social sciences and humanities disciplines to conduct research into cutting edge aspects of the mutual relationship between science and society.{{clarify|date=May 2013}} Historically{{clarify|date=May 2013}}, the Institute's agenda was dominated by topics in the bio-sciences, broadly conceived, but it became increasingly involved in partnerships around physical science issues like nanotechnology, sustainable energy use and climate change.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} 

The Institute is now physically part of the School of Sociology and Social Policy at the University of Nottingham, but works virtually across the University under the University's Priority Group scheme as the Science and Technology Studies Priority Group.

Since its foundation, the Institute has been variously supported by grants and contracts from the [[Leverhulme Trust|Leverhulme]] and [[Wellcome Trust]]s, the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC), the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC), the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC), the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC), The [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC), the [[European Union]] and the [[National Health Service]] (NHS).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Dr. Sujatha Raman and Professor Brigitte Nerlich are the current co-directors of the Institute.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3594">The '''Institute of Conservation''' ('''Icon''') is a charity and the professional body for [[Conservator-restorer|conservators and restorers]] in the United Kingdom. It has over three thousand members, including [[Conservator-restorer|professional conservators]] working with heritage objects and [[Architectural conservation|buildings]]. 

==Background==
Icon was formed in 2005 as a result of a merger between five smaller bodies: The United Kingdom Institute for Conservation, The Institute of Paper Conservation, The Scottish Society for Conservation and Restoration, the Photographic Materials Conservation Group and the Care of Collections Forum. These five organisations were known collectively as the 'Vanguard Bodies' of the National Council for Conservation-Restoration (NCCR). In 2006 a sixth organisation, the Institute of Conservation Science, which had not been part of the NCCR, merged into Icon.

Seven other bodies which were also members of the NCCR opted not to merge into Icon in 2005.  These were:
* The British Antique Furniture Restorer's Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafra.org.uk|title=Home - British Antique Furniture Restorers' Association|work=British Antique Furniture Restorers' Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The British Association of Paintings Conservator-Restorers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bapcr.org.uk|title=BAPCR Home|work=bapcr.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two Irish bodies, the Irish Professional Conservators &amp; Restorers Association (IPCRA) and The Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works in Ireland (ICHAWI) - which merged in 2013 into the Institute of Conservators-Restorers in Ireland (ICRI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icriconservation.ie/about-us/background|title=Home - Institute of Conservator-Restorers in Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three 'hybrid' bodies, combining conservators and non-conservators in their membership - [[Natural Sciences Collections Association|NatSCA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natsca.org/|title=Natural Sciences Collections Association|work=natsca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BHI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhi.co.uk/|title=British Horological Institute|work=bhi.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Society of Archivists]] which merged into the [[Archives and Records Association]] in 2010.

==Activities==
* Icon is a member of the National Heritage Science Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/member-institutions.php|title=National Heritage Science Forum - Home|work=heritagescienceforum.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Icon operates a professional  [[accreditation]] scheme for suitably trained and qualified professionals in [[conservation and restoration]] called PACR (Professional Accreditation of Conservator-Restorers.) 
* Icon operates the Conservation register&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationregister.com|title=The Conservation Register|work=conservationregister.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of practices with an accredited employee in the UK or Ireland
* Icon was formerly a member of the [[European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers' Organisations]], but withdrew in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iiconservation.org/archive/www.iiconservation.org/news/index153d.html?p=106|title=International Conservation News  » Blog Archive   » Icon withdraws from ECCO|work=iiconservation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intent is to illustrate the hierarchical structure and relationship of events, accomplishments, criteria, and tasks.]]

In the [[United States Department of Defense]], the '''Integrated Master Plan''' ('''IMP)''' and the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) are important [[program management]] tools that provide significant assistance in the planning and scheduling of work efforts in large and complex materiel acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''AFMC Pamphlet 63-5, Integrated Master Plan and Schedule Guide'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/USAF/USAF-AFMC/download.php?spec=AFMC_PAM_63-5.004210.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Air Force]] | date=11 Nov 2004 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMP is an event-driven plan  that documents the significant accomplishments necessary to complete the work and ties each accomplishment to a key program event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Integrated Master Plan (IMP) / Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)'' | url=https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=24654  | publisher=[[Defense Acquisition University]] | accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMP is expanded to a time-based IMS to produce a networked and multi-layered schedule showing all detailed tasks required to accomplish the work effort contained in the IMP. The IMS flows directly from the IMP and supplements it with additional levels of detail——both then form the foundations to implement an [[Earned Value Management| Earned Value Management System]].

* The IMP is a bilateral agreement between the Government and a contractor on what defines the “event-driven” program. The IMP documents the key events, accomplishments, and the evaluation "criteria" in the development, production and/or modification of a military system; moreover, the IMS provides sequential events and key decision points (generally meetings) to assess program progress. Usually the IMP is a contractual document.
* Supporting the IMP is the IMS that is made up of "tasks" depicting the work effort needed to complete the "criteria".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Scheduling Guide for Program Managers'' | url=http://www.dau.mil/publications/publicationsDocs/schedulinguide.pdf | format=PDF | publisher= Defense Systems Management College Press, Fort Belvoir, VA | date=October 2001 |accessdate=19 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a detailed time-driven plan for program execution that helps to ensure on-time delivery dates are achieved, and that tracking and status tool are used during program execution. These tools must show progress, interrelationships and dependencies.

In civic planning or [[urban planning]], ''Integrated Master Plan'' is used at the levels of city &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''City of Riverside, Wastewater Integrated Master Plan'' | url=http://www.riversideca.gov/pworks/masterplan-wastewater.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Integrated Master Plan for Lahore 2021'' | url=http://www.urbanunit.gov.pk/pubpublic/pubcomp/70.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; county,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Santa Clara County Parks, Draft Integrated Master Plan'' | url=http://sccgov.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=4&amp;ID=101252}}&lt;/ref&gt; and state or province to refer to a document integrating diverse aspects of a [[public works]] project.

== Purpose and Objectives  ==
The primary purpose of the IMP—and the supporting detailed schedules of the IMS—is their use by the U.S. Government and Contractor acquisition team as the day-to-day tools for the planning, executing, and tracking program technical, schedule, and cost status, including risk mitigation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Integrated Master Plan and Integrated Master Schedule Preparation and Use Guide'' | url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/se/docs/IMP_IMS_Guide_v9.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |work=Ver. 0.9 |date=31 Oct 2005 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMP provides a better structure than either the [[Work breakdown structure|Work Breakdown Structure]] (WBS) or [[Organizational chart|Organizational Breakdown Structure]] (OBS) for measuring actual integrated master schedule (IMS) progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bachman, David C.| title=''Better Schedule Performance Assessments Derived From Integrated Master Plan-Referenced Schedule Metrics'' | url=http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/PubsCats/AR%20Journal/arj60/Bachman_ARJ60.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=[[Defense Acquisition University]] |date=October 2011 |work=Defense Acquisition Research Journal (ARJ) |pages=406–427 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective of the IMP is a single plan that establishes the program or project fundamentals. It provides a hierarchical, event-based plan that contains: Events; Significant accomplishments; Entry and exit criteria; however it does not include any dates or  durations. Using the IMP provides sufficient definition for explain program process and completion tracking, as well as providing effective communication of the program/project content and the "''What and How''" of the program.

== Rationale ==
The IMP is a collection of [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] (called  "events") that form the process architecture of the program. This means the sequence of events must always result in a deliverable product or service. While delivering products or services is relatively straight forward in some instances (i.e.,  list the tasks to be done, arrange them in the proper sequence, and execute to this “plan”), in other cases, problems often arise: (i) the description of "complete" is often missing for intermediate activities; (ii) program partners, integration activities, and subcontractors all have unknown or possibly unknowable impacts on the program; and (iii) as products or services are delivered the maturity of the program changes (e.g., quality and functionality expectations, as well as other attributes)——this maturity provided by defining "complete"
serves as an insurance policy against future problems encountered later in the program.

Often, it's easier to define the IMP by stating what it is not. The IMP is NOT BASED on calendar dates, and therefore it is not
schedule oriented; each event is completed when its supporting accomplishments are completed, and this completion is evidenced by the satisfaction of the criteria supporting each of the accomplishments. Furthermore, many of the IMP events are fixed by customer-defined milestones
(e.g., Preliminary or Critical Design Review, Production Deliver, etc.) while intermediate events are defined by the Supplier (e.g., integration and test, software build releases, Test Readiness Review, etc.).

The critical IMP attribute is its focus on events, when compared to effort or task focused planning.
The event focus asks and answers the question ''what does done look like?'' rather than what work has been done. Certainly work must be done to complete a task, but a focus solely on the work hides the more important metric of ''are we meeting our commitments?'' While meeting commitments is critical, it's important to first define the criteria used for judging if the commitments are being met. This is where Significant Accomplishments (SA) and their Accomplishment Criteria (AC) become important. It is important to meet commitments, but recognizing when the commitment has been met is even more important.

== Attributes and Characteristics ==

The IMP  provides Program Traceability by expanding and complying with the program's Statement of Objectives (SOO), Technical Performance Requirements (TPRs), the Contract [[Work Breakdown Structure]] (CWBS), and the Contract [[Statement of work|Statement of Work]] (CSOW)—all of which are based on the Customer's WBS to form the basis of the IMS and all cost reporting. The IMP implements a measurable and trackable program structure to accomplish integrated product development, integrate the functional program activities, and incorporates functional, lower-level and subcontractor  IMPs. The IMP provides a framework for independent evaluation of Program Maturity by allowing insight into the overall effort with a level-of-detail that is consistent with levied risk and complexity metrics. It uses the methodology of decomposing events into a logical series of accomplishments having measurable criteria to demonstrate the completion and/or quality of accomplishments.

== Requirements Flowdown ==

A Government customer tasks a Supplier to prepare and implement an IMP that linked with the IMS and integrated with the EVMS. The IMP list the contract requirements documents (e.g., Systems Requirements Document and Technical Requirements Document (i.e., the system specification or similar document)) as well as the IMP events  corresponding to development and/or production activities required by the contract. The IMP should include significant accomplishments encompassing all steps necessary to satisfy all contract objectives and requirements, manage all significant risks, and facilitate Government insight for each event. Significant accomplishments shall be networked to show their logical relationships and that they flow logically from one to another. The IMP, IMS, and EVMS products will usually include the prime contractor, subcontractor, and major vendor activities and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''SMC-S-019, Rev. A'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/USAF/USAF-SMC/download.php?spec=SMC-S-019A_11AUG2008.021545.PDF | format=PDF | publisher=[[Space and Missile Systems Center]], Air Force Space Command, El Segundo, CA | date=11 Aug 2008 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation of an IMS ==

When evaluating a proposed IMS, the user should focus on realistic task durations, predecessor/successor relationships, and identification of [[critical path method|critical path]] tasks with viable risk mitigation and contingency plans. An IMS summarized at too high a level may result in obscuring critical execution elements, and contributing to failure of the EVMS to  report progress. A high-level IMS may fail to show related [[risk management]] approaches being used, which can  result in long duration tasks and artificial linkages masking the true critical path. In general, the IMP is a top-down planning tool and the IMS as the bottom-up execution tool. It should be noted, however, the IMS is a scheduling tool for management control of program progression, not for cost collection purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Systems Engineering Guide: Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)/Integrated Master Plan (IMP) Application'' | url=http://www.mitre.org/work/systems_engineering/guide/acquisition_systems_engineering/acquisition_program_planning/integrated_master_schedule_master_plan_application.html | publisher=Mitre Corporation] | date= |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An IMS would seek general consistency and a standardized approach to project planning, scheduling and analysis.  It may use guides such as the PASEG Generally Accepted Schedule Principles (GASP) as guidance to improve execution and enable EVMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| title = Planning &amp; Scheduling Excellence Guide (PASEG), Version 3.0 
| url = https://www.humphreys-assoc.com/evms/planning-scheduling-excellence-guide-paseg-version-ta-a-175-t-1_25_32.html
| publisher = NDIA
| accessdate = 17 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to other Documents ==

The IMP/IMS are related to the product-based ''' [[Work Breakdown Structure]] (WBS)''' as defined in MIL-STD-881, by giving a second type of view on the effort, for different audiences or to provide a combination which gives better overall understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Department of Defense Standard: Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) for Defense Material Items (Superseding MIL-HDBK-881A)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/download.php?spec=MIL-STD-881C.037590.pdf/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=3 Oct 2011 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linkage between the IMP/IMS and WBS is done by referencing the WBS numbering whenever the PE (Program Event), SA (Significant Accomplishment), or AC (Accomplishment Criteria) involves a deliverable product.

== Reporting Formats ==

The IMP is often called out as a contract data deliverable on [[United States Department of Defense]] materiel acquisitions, as well as other U.S. Government procurements. Formats for these deliverables are covered in [[Data Item Descriptions]] (DIDs) that define the data content, format, and data usages. Recently, the DoD  cancelled the DID (DI-MISC-81183A) that jointly addressed both the IMP and the IMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MISC-81183A, Data Item Description: Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MISC/DI-MISC-81183A_11978/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=9 Feb 1996  |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement  documents include DI-MGMT-81650 (Integrated Master Schedule), DI-MGMT-81334A (Contract Work Breakdown Structure) and DI-MGMT-81466 (Contract Performance Report).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MGMT-81650, Data Item Description: Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MGMT/DI-MGMT-81650_12009/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=30 Mar 2005  |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MISC-81334D, Data Item Description: Contract Work Breakdown Structure'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MGMT/download.php?spec=DI-MGMT-81334D.034122.pdf/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=18 May 2011  |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MISC-81466A, Data Item Description: Cost Performance Report (CPR)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MGMT/DI-MGMT-81466A_16102/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=30 Mar 2005 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition DFARS 252.242–7001 and 252.242–7002 provide guidance for integrating IMP/IMS with [[Earned Value Management]].

'''International Yacht Training Worldwide''' (IYT Worldwide) is an independent sailing and boating training organization which provides education and training standards for professional and recreational boaters and yachtsmen and women. It was originally based entirely in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA; it is now a  British Columbia, Canada Corporation based in Kelowna.
Its qualifications are similar to those of the [[Royal Yachting Association]] (RYA) at the recreational level, but IYT Worldwide also offers additional courses at the professional level. It is regulated by a number of [[Maritime Administrations]] and has an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[Quality Management System]] to independently monitor and control all of its training standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.net/florida/iyt-fort-lauderdale-pyt-usa-florida IYT Fort Lauderdale]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

IYT Worldwide was founded by Mark Fry in 1998 as a credible alternative to the RYA with the purpose of providing training for crews of [[Luxury yacht|superyachts]] by offering professional yachtsmen and women the opportunity to train for their career outside the UK, a first for the professional yachting fraternity. 
IYT Worldwide was approved, and its courses recognized by the UK [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] (MCA),in October 1999 and is now recognized as a world leader by multiple administrations due to its numerous (20 plus) international recognitions covering a large number of its courses. IYT has trained over 110,000 candidates in the last 12 years.
Due to its dedication to high standards, quality training and the implementation of its ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System, the company has enjoyed an international expansion which now includes almost 300 partner schools in 56 countries. No other yacht training organisation is as internationally recognised or accepted as IYT.

==Global spread==
Initially recognized for its professional courses, IYT has successfully developed professional, recreational and other boating [[watersports]] courses delivered through licensed training schools. There are currently 271 partner schools around the world in 56 different countries (October 2017). These include Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belarus, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Croatia,Cyprus, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, French West Indies, Gibraltar, Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,Italy, Kuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Postugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, St Maarten, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, St Lucia, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine,United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and the United States.

==Membership==

There are basically 2 membership levels, those partner schools offering recreational courses and those offering professional yachting courses such as Master of Yachts (MOY) and [[STCW]], [[Basic Safety Training]].

Two levels of qualification may be obtained from IYT Worldwide training providers:

Level 1	
•	Recreational boating courses from ‘Introduction to Boating’ through ‘Recreational Yachtmaster Coastal, Yachmaster Offshore and Yachtmaster Ocean’ ( Modules 1 to 21 in the IYT Passport booklet)
•	VHF SRC Radio Operators Certificate
•	Small Powerboat &amp; RIB Master (includes VHF certification)
•	Superyacht Deck Crew (includes Small Powerboat &amp; RIB Master and VHF)
•	Superyacht Interior Crew
•	International Certificate of Competency (ICC)
•	Personal Watercraft Operations

Level 2	
•	Master of Yacht Training (MOY) – Mate 200 Ton/Coastal, Master of Yacht 200 Ton Limited and Master of Yacht 200 Ton Unlimited
•	STCW ‘95 Basic Training – (Standard of Training and Certification for Watchkeepers) 5 Modules over 6 days – required by the IMO (International Maritime Organisation) for employment on commercially operated yachts carrying passengers.  
•	Diveboat Master Level 1 and Level 2 (includes General Engineering Knowledge)

==International Certificate of Competence - ICC==

[[International Certificate of Competence]] Also referred to as International Certificate of Competency, may be required to operate a vessel in EU waters, both coastal and internal. It is a certificate which is similar to an [[International Drivers License]].

An International Certificate of Competence (ICC) is a certificate which may be issued to anyone who has successfully completed certain national boating licenses or met the ICC Standards of Knowledge and practical competencies. Almost all member states within the European Union have accepted the IYT World ICC.

Although only guaranteed to be accepted in countries that have adopted the relevant UN Resolution 40, the ICC is a useful document to carry and will generally be accepted where proof of competence is required.

In general terms an ICC is required for the inland waterways of Europe and for inland and coastal waters of Mediterranean countries. For the coastal waters of Northern Europe the ICC is generally not required, however to all of these generalisations there are exceptions.

If in doubt, be sure to check with the country administration you are visiting and the charter company that you are chartering with .

The '''Max-Reger-Institute''' (MRI) is a musicological [[research institute]] and archive in [[Karlsruhe]], Germany, dedicated to the work of the composer [[Max Reger]], a representative of German music around the turn of the 20th century. An associated foundation, the Elsa-Reger-Stiftung, is named after his wife, [[Elsa Reger]], who founded the foundation and the institute. It has a substantial archive of manuscripts and documents related to Reger.

== History ==
Reger's widow and biographer, Elsa Reger, installed in 1947 a foundation, run by the Max-Reger-Institut in [[Bonn]]. A main objective was to collect the autographs which had been dispersed during two world wars, and to establish an archive as a base for research.&lt;ref name="Foundation" /&gt; The institute moved to Karlsruhe in 1996, first to the building of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Museum für Literatur am Oberrhein|de}}. The state [[Baden-Württemberg]] and the town [[Karlsruhe]] have funded the institute since. In 1998 it moved to the [[Karlsburg Castle|Karlsburg]] in [[Durlach]]. It collaborates with the Musikhochschule and with the [[Baden State Library]].&lt;ref name="AsKI" /&gt;

== Archive ==
The archive holds [[autograph]]s of sketches, scores and corrections from all periods and genres of Reger's composions, also many of his handwritten letters and postcards to friends, publishers, performers and notable contemporaries. It also keeps the correspondence of his widow, and documents, photos, paintings, caricatures, concert programs and other memorabilia. From 2003, the BrüderBuschArchiv, an archive of the brothers [[Fritz Busch]] and [[Adolf Busch]] with many documents related to their work is part of the MRI.&lt;ref name="Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Busch" /&gt; The library holds prints of first editions as well as later ones, international literature about Reger and related topics, sound documents, and copies of manuscripts that are not part of the MRI's archive.&lt;ref name="AsKI" /&gt;

== Publications ==
The MRI is the centre of research of the composer, publishing research in its own ''Schriftenreihe'' ([[monographic series]]), including [[dissertation]]s written with scientific guidance by the MRI. A new edition of Reger's works, the Reger-Werk-Ausgabe, was begun in 2008. The new Reger-Werk-Verzeichnis appeared in 2011, funded in part by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]].&lt;ref name="AsKI" /&gt;

== Other activities ==
A focus of the MRI has been to provide access to the material related to Reger, to researchers, musicians and music lovers. The institute organizes regularly exhibitions, conventions, lecture concerts, and concert series in collaboration with international music schools and universities. In 2005 the MRI established a biennial European chamber music competition, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Europäischer Kammermusikwettbewerb Karlsruhe|de}}, together with [[Karlsruhe]] and the Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe.&lt;ref name=AsKI /&gt;

The university has to its merit more than 160000 specialists, 250 chief designers in the Aerospace Industry. 50 [[Academicians]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], 22 [[cosmonauts]], 100 test pilots and 60 Olympic champions in different sports.

Alumni of the institute form the backbone of many companies like [[Sukhoi]], [[MiG|MIG]], [[Ilyushin]], [[Tupolev]], [[Yakovlev]], [[Beriev]], [[Myasishchev]], [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant]], [[OAO S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia]], [[Lavochkin]], [[Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau]], [[Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center]], [[NPO Energomash]], [[Almaz-Antey]] and others.

== History ==

=== Founding and Vision ===

Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University) was established on 20 March 1930 as Higher Aero-mechanical college (VAMU) by the order of Supreme Economic Council of the USSR in order to ensure training of qualified personnel for the aviation industry. The Aero-mechanical faculty of [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University]] formed the basis of the new university. On 29 August 1930, the university was renamed as Moscow Aviation Institute. In the beginning it had 3 departments, Aeronautical, Aircraft engines and Aerodynamics. On its 10th anniversary in 1940, the university had established itself as a premier aeronautical university with 38 departments, 22 laboratories and a Student design office and production facility. 

The uniqueness of the MAI is that historically it was created to train specialists for almost all departments and teams in [[OKB|the Design Bureaus]] of the aviation industry.

=== World War II ===

On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The students and faculty members were mobilized to work in aircraft workshops and design offices. Many students signed up to join the armed forces during the [[Battle of Moscow]], many continued to work aircraft production facilities and armaments workshops.

The university was partly evacuated to [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]] under the leadership of [[Alexander Yakovlevich Bereznyak|Alexander Yakovlev]]. By 1942 the Moscow campus of MAI started functioning in parallel with the Almaty campus. It was in the workshops of MAI in Almaty, [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]], the legendary rifle designer worked on his [[AK-47]] assault rifle.

By 1943, the university was completely relocated back to Moscow. Members of the university were involved in research &amp; designing new combat aircraft and sub-systems, along with refining and redesigning existing aircraft, for the war effort.
{|style="margin: 0 auto;"

In 1945 the institute was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]].

=== Jet age &amp; Space age ===

Although prototypes of the first jet aircraft were made as far back as 1910 by [[Henri Coandă]], it war during World War II that significant developments were made.
[[Arkhip Lyulka]] designed the first Two-stage centrifugal compressor Turbojet in 1938. [[Alexander Bereznyak]] a graduate of MAI, designed the first jet aircraft in the USSR, the [[Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1]] in 1942.

After the war, the university placed special emphasis on developing new technology required for developing jet aircraft and was quick to adapt to new technologies.
this was emphasised in May 1946, during the second Student technical conference, faculty members of the institute defended 6 post-doctoral thesis and 14 Ph.Ds on various aspects regarding development of jet aircraft. On 26 April 1946, [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9]] became the first operational turbojet fighter in the USSR.

It was also in the same year Faculty of Radio electronics was established based on department of Radio-location, to assimilate newer technologies in the field of Radio location.

The era of helicopters began in USSR with two leading pioneers at MAI [[Boris Yuryev]], inventor of [[Swashplate]] in helicopters and [[Bratukhin]], they were awarded the state prize of the USSR in 1946. In 1952, department of helicopter design was established under the leadership of Prof. Boris Yuryev.

In 1955, the university celebrated its silver jubilee.

On 4 October 1957, the USSR launched the first artificial satellite opening up Space for mankind, graduates from MAI were deeply involved in the space program since its inception under the leadership of [[Sergey Korolev]], the legendary chief designer of head of the Soviet space program and [[Mikhail Tikhonravov]] chief designer of satellites [[Sputnik-3]], [[Luna-1]], [[Luna-3]], [[Luna-4]].

=== Cold War ===
During the cold war, students, faculty members and graduates of the university were involved in cutting edge research in the fields of Aeronautics, Missile development and armaments research. They were pivotal in keeping the USSR ahead in the arms race in close collaboration with the Aerospace and Defense industry and Research organizations like [[TsAGI]], National Institute of Aviation technologies, Russian scientific-research institute of aviation materials, Central institute of Aircraft engines, [[30th Central Scientific Research Institute, Ministry of Defence]], [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] among others.

Key figures from the university during this era were Rostislav Belyakov chief designer of MIG-29, [[Myasishchev]], [[Mikhail Yangel]], Sergey Mikheev chief designer of Kamov helicopters, Marat Tishchenko of Mil helicopters, Mikhail Reshetnev and others.

In 1962, the University established the Student design office(ОСКБ — объединение СКБ факультетов и кафедр), which integrated different faculties and departments within the institute to develop aircraft prototypes in-house and to provide greater exposure to students in design and production work. The Design office functions today as the OKKBES-MAI http://oskbes.ru/english.html.

== Moscow Aviation Institute (Moscow Aviation and Aerospace University) today ==

Currently, MAI is the only university in Russia, which provides highly qualified personnel for the entire aerospace product life cycle from system design to implementation of the cutting edge technologies in production, testing, utilisation, and aircraft recycling.

The present-day MAI is a unique institute of higher education where thorough theoretical knowledge are combined with various practical skills. More than 120 laboratories, 3 student design offices, 3 specialized resource centers, an experimental-design factory, and an aerodrome are available for the students.

In 1980 the institute was awarded the [[Order of the October Revolution]].

In 1993 Moscow Aviation Institute was given one more name: "State Technological University". To date, the development in the field of aeronautics and astronautics is based mostly on the activities of institute professors and alumnus of the university.

Moscow Aviation Institute is a large scientific research center. Significant scientific ideas are developed here; new technological principles are discovered; new devices are invented and constructed. Five fundamental scientific discoveries for dynamic systems have been patented; the opto-electronic device "Photon" designed here is now operating in outer space; innovative power sources based on new principles invented and constructed here are currently used in aircraft and aerospace system units, etc.

In October 2009, the MAI was ranked among the 12 best universities of the Russian Federation. The rank of a "National research university" was conferred to the institute by decision of the Russian Government.

On 31 March 2015 the Ministry of Education reorganized Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI) by annexation of the Russian State Technological University named after Tsiolkovsky (MATI).

== OSKBES MAI ==

The history of aircraft creation in the MAI (Moscow Aviation Institute) began simultaneously with the foundation of the institute in 1930. The modern design bureau in the MAI was formed in 1965 as a students one. It was engaged in creation of experimental pilot and remote controlled light aircraft, which were developed according to the requirements specifications of various organizations of the Ministry of Aviation Industry (MAP), the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MGA) and the Ministry of Defense (MOP).

In 1982 by the order of Ministry of Aircraft Industry the Design Bureau was transformed into a branch-wise experimental students aircraft construction design bureau of the MAI. The work was carried out by professional engineers. If necessary the co-workers from among the MAI students and teachers and also from among the workers of the industry were invited. The production facility of the MAI aircraft development plant (EOZ) in the experimental development shop (shop № 3) are manned by qualified technicians. The OSKBES work on the experimental aircraft engineering constantly received high estimations of the industry. Their technical novelty and utility are confirmed by nine Introduction Certificates and more than twenty Invention Certificates. By the end of 1980s six experimental aircraft of different types were designed and built: Kvant, Elf-D UAV, PS-01 small-sized UAV, Elf, Photon and Yunior aircraft.

The basic structure, address and the industrial areas occupied by it in the OSKBES MAI have remained the same. The EOZ MAI (shop № 3) and the MAPO (Moscow aircraft building plant) were used as an industrial base. On July 27, 1992 the application on realization the inspection work in the OKB MA for reception the certificate for the right to develop the civil aircraft engineering was sent to the Aviaregister of the MAK and the Air Industry Department of the Ministry of Industry of Russian Federation. It was made on behalf of the "Aviatika" joint-stock company. According to the inspection results the Aviaregister of the MAK issued Certificate № R-9 to the "Aviatika" joint-stock company with the right to develop light civil aircraft. It was on February 17, 1993.

Aircraft designed and developed at OSKBES include

A single-seater Aviatika-MAI-890 aircraft — passed certification, had a temporary Certificate of a type of 31 March 1994 № 52В-890, valid till 1 April 1995, is series produced by the RAC "MiG";
A two-seater Aviatika-MAI-890U aircraft is serially produced by the RAC "MiG";
An agricultural Aviatika-MAI-890SKh aircraft is serially produced by the RAC "MiG";
A single-seater Aviatika-MAI-900 aerobatics ("Akrobat")'
A two-seater Aviatika-MAI-910 with wings, folding on the ground;
An Aviatika-MAI-920 glider;
A single-seater Aviatika-MAI-890A autogyro, a pre-production model at the stage of flying test.
The basis for the "Aviatika" aircraft manufacture at the MAPO plant is the License Agreement concluded by this plant with the "Aviatika" joint-stock company on 10 April 1995 (contract № 4276).

The personnel of the OSKBES have continued to work in the field of light civil aircraft together with the MAPO MIG.

In April 27, 1998 the Aviaregister of Interstate Aviation Committee issued a Design Organization Certificate R-52 of the developer of light civil aircraft.

29 September 1999 eight members of our design bureau, Moscow Aviation Institute and RAC "MIG" were rewarded by "State Prize of the Russian Federation in science and technology" for designing and development of light multipurpose airplanes in a serial production. They are:

OSKBES MAI Chief Designer K. Zhidovetskiy (posthumously);
OSKBES MAI Deputy Chief Designer (after the death of K. Zhidovetskiy —
Chief Designer) N. Goryunov;
OSKBES MAI Deputy Chief Designer V. Demin;
OSKBES MAI Deputy Chief Designer V. Feigenbaum;
Rector of MAI A. Matveyenko;
Manager of MAI Experimental Plant P. Ogadzhanov;
General Manager of RAC "MIG" plant G. Nemov;
Deputy Manager of RAC "MIG" O. Chukantsev.

Autogyro MAI-205 made the first flight in 2001, chief designer Andrey Zorin.

In 2002 OSKBES MAI has started designing a new plane MAI-223. This plane made the first flight in 2004.

In 2003 OSKBES MAI started to work on different aircraft, airships and autogyros. It designed and produced gondolas, nacelles, fly-by-wire power plant controls and empennages of NPO "RosAeroSystems" airships Au-30 and Au-12M.

The design and development of Autogyro MAI-208 was started in 2006. The first MAI-208 is undergoing testing. OSKBES MAI presented MAI-208 at the 2nd International exhibition of the helicopter industry "HeliRussia-2009" (21...23 May 2009, Moscow). The new autogyro has caused the big interest of visitors and the press.

July 1, 2008 Vadim Demin was appointed Chief Designer of OSKBES MAI. The same year the design office has started working on a new multi-purpose four-seat twin engine aircraft MAI-407.

In 2009 OSKBES MAI started designing a new training glider MAI-227.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4411">A '''narrative hook''' (or just '''hook''') is a [[literary technique]] in the opening of a story that "hooks" the reader's attention so that he or she will keep on reading. The "opening" may consist of several paragraphs for a short story, or several pages for a novel, but ideally it is the [[opening sentence]] in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Examples ==
One of the most common forms is dramatic action, which engages the reader into wondering what the consequences of the action will be.{{Example needed}}  This particular form has been recommended from the earliest days, stemming from [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]].{{Example needed}}

The use of action as the hook, and the advice to so use it, is so widespread as to sometimes lead to the use of the term to mean an action opening, but other things can be used for narrative hooks, such mysterious settings, or engaging characters, or even a thematic statement, as with [[Jane Austen]]'s opening line, "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." (''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'')

When a story does not lend itself to a good hook when it is laid out linearly, the writer may tell the story out of order to engage the reader's interest.  The story may begin with a dramatic moment and, once the reader is curious, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the history necessary to understand it.  Or it may be told as a [[story-within-a-story]], with the narrator in the [[frame story]] telling the story to answer the curiosity of his listeners, or by warning them that the story began in an ordinary seeming way, but they must follow it to understand latter actions. A famous early example of this technique was used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', in which the frame story consists of [[Sheherazade]] telling stories to King [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryar|Shahriyar]]; she must keep him 'hooked' to each of the stories, in order to prevent him from executing her the next morning.

=== ''In medias res'' ===
''[[In medias res]]'' is where the relating of a story begins at the midpoint, rather than at the beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifford|first=Tim|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of story telling might be used as a narrative hook. Narrative hooks often play an important role in [[Thriller (genre)|suspense thrillers]] and [[mystery fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Treat, America | year = 1982 | title = Mystery Writer's Handbook | publisher = Writer's Digest Books | page = 111 | isbn= 0898790808}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of both these occurrences is ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in which a tale, "[[The Three Apples]]," begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body, thus keeping the reader interested in "[[whodunit]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nutrient pollution,''' a form of [[water pollution]], refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of [[eutrophication]] of [[surface water]]s, in which excess nutrients, usually [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]], stimulate [[algae|algal]] growth. Sources of nutrient pollution include [[surface runoff]] from farm fields and pastures, discharges from [[septic tank]]s and [[feedlot]]s, and [[air pollution|emissions]] from combustion. Excess nutrients have been summarized as potentially leading to:
* Population effects: excess growth of algae (blooms);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/harmful-algal-blooms |title=Harmful Algal Blooms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-07 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community effects: species composition shifts (dominant taxa); 
* Ecological effects: food web changes, light limitation; 
* Biogeochemical effects: excess organic carbon (eutrophication); dissolved oxygen deficits ([[hypoxia (environmental)|environmental hypoxia]]); toxin production;&lt;ref name="EPA envir effects"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-environment |title=The Effects: Environment |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-07 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human health effects: excess nitrate in drinking water ([[blue baby syndrome]]); disinfection by-products in drinking water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-human-health |title=The Effects: Human Health |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-10 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biodiversity effects: excessive algae blooms ([[biodiversity loss]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/national-nutrient-strategy |title=National Nutrient Strategy |publisher=EPA|date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) report, the agency's Science Advisory Board succinctly stated: “Excess [[reactive nitrogen]] compounds in the environment are associated with many large-scale environmental concerns, including eutrophication of surface waters, toxic algae blooms, hypoxia, acid rain, nitrogen saturation in forests, and global warming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA |title=Reactive Nitrogen in the United States: An Analysis of Inputs, Flows, Consequences, and Management Options, A Report of the Science Advisory Board EPA-SAB-11-013 |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/67057225CC780623852578F10059533D/$File/EPA-SAB-11-013-unsigned.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219045824/http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/67057225cc780623852578f10059533d/%24file/epa-sab-11-013-unsigned.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
[[File:Nutrient sources Gulf-Mex &amp; Chesbay - EPA 2010.png|thumb|Agriculture is the major source of nutrient pollution in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In the [[Chesapeake Bay]], agriculture is a major source, along with urban areas and atmospheric deposition.]]

===Nitrogen===
Use of [[synthetic fertilizer]]s, burning of [[fossil fuel]]s, and agricultural [[animal production]], especially [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s (CAFO), have added large quantities of reactive nitrogen to the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Galloway |first1=J.N. |last2=Dentener |first2=F.J. |display-authors=1 |date=September 2004 |title=Nitrogen Cycles: Past, Present, and Future |url= |journal=Biogeochemistry |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=153–226 |doi=10.1007/s10533-004-0370-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phosphorus===
Phosphorus pollution is caused by excessive use of fertilizers and [[manure]], particularly when compounded by [[soil erosion]]. Phosphorus is also discharged by municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants and some industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/phosphorus.html |title=Phosphorus and Water |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-13 |website=USGS Water Science School |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) |location=Reston, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land uses===
The principal source(s) of nutrient pollution in an individual [[drainage basin|watershed]] depend on the prevailing [[land use]]s. The sources may be [[Point source pollution|point sources]], [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint sources]], or both:
* [[Agricultural pollution|Agriculture]]: animal production or crops
* Urban/suburban: [[Urban runoff|stormwater runoff]] from roads and parking lots; excessive fertilzer use on lawns; municipal sewage treatment plants; motor vehicle emissions
* Industrial: [[air pollution]] emissions (e.g. [[Thermal power station|electric power plants]]), wastewater discharges from various industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions |title=Sources and Solutions |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-10 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nutrient pollution from some air pollution sources may occur independently of the local land uses, due to long-range transport of air pollutants from distant sources.&lt;ref name="EPA envir effects"/&gt;

==Mitigation of nutrient pollutant discharges==
===United States===
Agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution is the largest source of water quality impairments throughout the U.S., based on surveys by state environmental agencies.&lt;ref name="EPA 319 report"&gt;{{cite report |date=October 2016 |title=National Nonpoint Source Program: A catalyst for water quality improvements |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/319-grant-reports-and-project-summaries |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-R-16-009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} NPS pollution is not subject to discharge permits under the federal [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA).&lt;ref name="NPDES basic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics |title=NPDES Permit Basics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-07-25 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA and states have used grants, partnerships and demonstration projects to create incentives for farmers to adjust their practices and reduce [[surface runoff]].&lt;ref name="EPA 319 report"/&gt;{{rp|10-11}}

====Discharge permits====
Many [[point source pollution|point source]] dischargers in the U.S., while not necessarily the largest sources of nutrients in their respective watersheds, are required to comply with nutrient [[effluent limitation]]s in their permits, which are issued through the [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES), pursuant to the CWA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/status-nutrient-requirements-npdes-permitted-facilities |title=Status of Nutrient Requirements for NPDES-Permitted Facilities |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-06-08 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some large municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants, such as the [[Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant]] in Washington, D.C. have installed [[biological nutrient removal]] (BNR) systems to comply with regulatory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dcwater.com/nitrogen-reduction |title=Removing Nitrogen from Wastewater Protects our Waterways |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |access-date=2018-01-15 |publisher=DC Water |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other municipalities have made adjustments to the operational practices of their existing [[secondary treatment]] systems to control nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/national-study-nutrient-removal-and-secondary-technologies |title=National Study of Nutrient Removal and Secondary Technologies |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-01-10 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discharges from large livestock facilities (CAFO) are also regulated by NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/animal-feeding-operations-afos |title=Animal Feeding Operations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-01-17 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface runoff from farm fields, the principal source of nutrients in many watersheds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chesapeakebay.net/issues/agriculture |title=Agriculture |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Learn the Issues |publisher=Chesapeake Bay Program |location=Annapolis, Maryland |access-date=2018-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is classified as NPS pollution and is not regulated by NPDES permits.&lt;ref name="NPDES basic"/&gt;

====TMDL program====
A [[Total Maximum Daily Load]] (TMDL) is a regulatory plan that prescribes the maximum amount of a pollutant (including nutrients) that a body of water can receive while still meeting CWA water quality standards.&lt;ref name="TMDL overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/program-overview-impaired-waters-and-tmdls |title=Overview of Identifying and Restoring Impaired Waters under Section 303(d) of the CWA |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-09-13 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Section 303 of the Act requires each state to generate a TMDL report for each body of water impaired by pollutants. TMDL reports identify pollutant levels and strategies to accomplish pollutant reduction goals. EPA has described TMDLs as establishing a "pollutant budget" with allocations to each of the pollutant's sources.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |title=Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDLs) at Work: New York: Restoring the Long Island Sound While Saving Money |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/lawsguidance/cwa/tmdl/long_island_sound.cfm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many coastal water bodies, the main pollutant issue is excess nutrients, also termed ''nutrient over-enrichment.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Golen |first=Richard F. |title=Incorporating Shellfish Bed Restoration into a Nitrogen TMDL Implementation Plan |date=2007 |url=http://www.coonamessettfarm.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/Incorporating_Shellfish_Bed_Restoration_into_Nitrogen_TMDL_Implementation_Plan.pdf |publisher=University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth |location=Dartmouth, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TMDL can prescribe the minimum level of [[dissolved oxygen]] (DO) available in a body of water, which is directly related to nutrient levels. (''See'' [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia and Eutrophication|Aquatic Hypoxia]].) In 2010, 18 percent of TMDLs nationwide were related to nutrient levels including organic enrichment/oxygen depletion, noxious plants, algal growth, and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Water Quality Standards Academy|url=http://water.epa.gov/learn/training/standardsacademy/upload/module_nutrient.pdf|date=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMDLs identify all point source and nonpoint source pollutants within a watershed. To implement TMDLs with point sources, wasteload allocations are incorporated into their NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-writers-manual |title=NPDES Permit Writers' Manual |chapter=Chapter 6. Water Quality-Based Effluent Limitations |date=September 2010 |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-833-K-10-001.}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPS discharges are generally in a voluntary compliance scenario.&lt;ref name="TMDL overview"/&gt;

In [[Long Island Sound]], the TMDL development process enabled the [[Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection]] and the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] to incorporate a 58.5 percent nitrogen reduction target into a regulatory and legal framework.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"/&gt;

==Nutrient remediation==
[[File:Mussels at Strawberry Rocks PC013145.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Mussels are examples of organisms that act as nutrient bioextractors&lt;/center&gt;]]Innovative solutions have been conceived to deal with nutrient pollution in aquatic systems by altering or enhancing natural processes to shift nutrient effects away from detrimental ecological impacts.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Nutrient remediation is a form of environmental remediation, but concerns only biologically active nutrients such as [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]. “Remediation” refers to the removal of pollution or contaminants, generally for the protection of human health. In [[environmental remediation]] nutrient removal technologies include [[biofiltration]], which uses living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Examples include green belts, [[riparian]] areas, natural and constructed wetlands, and treatment ponds. These areas most commonly capture anthropogenic discharges such as wastewater, stormwater runoff, or sewage treatment, for land reclamation after mining, refinery activity, or land development.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Biofiltration utilizes [[Assimilation (biology)#Examples of biological assimilation|biological assimilation]] to capture, absorb, and eventually incorporate the pollutants (including nutrients) into living tissue. Another form of nutrient removal is [[bioremediation]], which uses microorganisms to remove pollutants. Bioremediation can occur on its own as natural attenuation or intrinsic bioremediation or can be encouraged by the addition of fertilizers, a strategy called biostimulation.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Nutrient bioextraction is bioremediation involving cultured plants and animals. Nutrient bioextraction or bioharvesting is the practice of farming and harvesting [[shellfish]] and [[seaweed]] for the purpose of removing nitrogen and other nutrients from natural water bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nutrient Bioextraction Overview |url=http://longislandsoundstudy.net/issues-actions/water-quality/nutrient-bioextraction-overview/ |publisher=Long Island Sound Study partnership |location=Stamford, CT |access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that nitrogen removal by oyster reefs could generate net benefits for sources facing nitrogen emission restrictions, similar to other nutrient trading scenarios. Specifically, if oysters maintain nitrogen levels in estuaries below thresholds that would lead to the imposition of emission limits, oysters effectively save the sources the compliance costs they otherwise would incur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kroeger |first=Timm |title=Dollars and Sense: Economic Benefits and Impacts from two Oyster Reef Restoration Projects in the Northern Gulf of Mexico |url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/oyster-restoration-study-kroeger.pdf|publisher=The Nature Conservancy|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown that [[oysters]] and [[mussels]] have the capacity to dramatically impact nitrogen levels in estuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Comparative Roles of Suspension Feeders in Ecosystems, Vol. 47|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|pages=93–120|author=Newell, R.I.E., Fisher, T.R., Holyoke, R.R., Cornwell, J.C.|edition=NATO Science Series IV: Earth and Environmental Sciences|contribution=Influence of eastern oysters on nitrogen and phosphorus regeneration in Chesapeake Bay, USA|editor=Dame, R., Olenin, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grabowski,J.H., Petersen, C.H.|title=Restoring oyster reefs to recover ecosystem services|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier-Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|pages=281–298|edition=Ecosystem Engineers: Concepts, Theory and Applications|editor=Cuddington, K., Byers, J.E., Wilson, W.G., Hastings, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Rose JM, Tedesco M, Wikfors GH, Yarish C |title=International Workshop on Bioextractive Technologies for Nutrient Remediation Summary Report|url=http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/nefsc/publications/|publisher=US Dept Commerce, Northeast Fish Sci Cent Ref Doc. 10-19; 12 p.

==History of nutrient policy in the United States==
The basic requirements for states to develop nutrient [[Clean Water Act#Water quality criteria|criteria]] and [[Clean Water Act#Water quality standards|standards]] were mandated in the 1972 Clean Water Act. Implementing this water quality program has been a major scientific, technical and resource-intensive challenge for both EPA and the states, and development is continuing well into the 21st century.

EPA published a wastewater management regulation in 1978 to begin to address the national nitrogen pollution problem, which had been increasing for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kilian |first1=Chris |title=Cracking down on Nutrient Pollution: CLF Fights to Bring New England's Coastal Waters Back to Life |journal=Conservation Matters |date=2010 |volume=16 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the agency published a ''National Nutrient Strategy'' with a focus on developing nutrient criteria.&lt;ref name="EPA-strategy"&gt;{{cite report |date=June 1998 |title=National Strategy for the Development of Regional Nutrient Criteria |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20003NOU.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 822-R-98-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2000 and 2010 EPA published federal-level nutrient criteria for rivers/streams, lakes/reservoirs, estuaries and wetlands; and related guidance. "Ecoregional" nutrient criteria for 14 ecoregions across the U.S. were included in these publications. While states may directly adopt the EPA-published criteria, in many cases the states need to modfiy the criteria to reflect site-specific conditions. In 2004, EPA stated its expectations for numeric criteria (as opposed to less-specific narrative criteria) for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), [[chlorophyll a]](chl-a), and clarity, and established "mutually-agreed upon plans" for state criteria development. In 2007, the agency stated that progress among the states on developing nutrient criteria had been uneven. EPA reiterated its expectations for numeric criteria and promised its support for state efforts to develop their own criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/nutrient-memo-may252007.pdf |title=Nutrient Pollution and Numeric Water Quality Standards |author-last=Grumbles |author-first=Benjamin |date=2007-05-25 |publisher=EPA |id=Memorandum to State and Tribal Water Program Directors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 EPA published a progress report on state efforts to develop nutrient standards. A majority of states had not developed numeric nutrient criteria for rivers and streams; lakes and reservoirs; wetlands and estuaries (for those states that have estuaries).&lt;ref name="EPA-state adoption"&gt;{{cite report |title=State Adoption of Numeric Nutrient Standards (1998–2008) |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P1002TQ0.txt |date=December 2008 |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 821-F-08-007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, EPA also established a Nutrient Innovations Task Group (NITG), composed of state and EPA experts, to monitor and evaluate the progress of reducing nutrient pollution.&lt;ref name="EPA_programmatic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/programmatic-information-numeric-nutrient-water-quality-criteria |title=Programmatic Information on Numeric Nutrient Water Quality Criteria |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-16 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the NTIG issued a report, "An Urgent Call to Action," expesssing concern that water quality continued to deteriorate nationwide due to increasing nutrient pollution, and recommending more vigorous development of nutrient standards by the states.&lt;ref name="NTIG"&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2009 |title=An Urgent Call to Action: Report of the State-EPA Nutrient Innovations Task Group |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100U1TD.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 800-R-09-032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 EPA reiterated the need for states to fully develop their nutrient standards, noting that [[Safe Drinking Water Act#Monitoring, compliance and enforcement|drinking water violations]] for nitrates had doubled in eight years, that half of all streams nationwide had medium to high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, and [[harmful algal bloom]]s were increasing. The agency set out a framework for states to develop priorities and watershed-level goals for reductions of nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/memo_nitrogen_framework.pdf |title=Working in Partnership with States to Address Phosphorus and Nitrogen Pollution through Use of a Framework for State Nutrient Reductions |author-last=Stoner |author-first=Nancy K. |date=2011-03-16 |publisher=EPA |id=Headquarters Memorandum to EPA Regional Administrators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrient trading==
After the EPA had introduced watershed-based [[NPDES]] permitting in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watershed-Based NPDES Permitting|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/basics/Watershed-Based-NPDES-Permitting.cfm|publisher=EPA|accessdate=20 February 2015|date=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; interest in nutrient removal and achieving regional TMDLs led to the development of nutrient trading schemes. Nutrient trading is a type of [[United States regulation of point source water pollution#Water quality trading|water quality trading]], a [[Market-based environmental policy instruments|market-based policy instrument]] used to improve or maintain water quality. Water quality trading arose around 2005 and is based on the fact that different pollution sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA Water Quality Trading Webcast Seminar |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/watersheds/trading.cfm|publisher=EPA|date=December 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water quality trading involves the voluntary exchange of pollution reduction credits from sources with low costs of pollution control to those with high costs of pollution control, and the same principles apply to nutrient water quality trading. The underlying principle is “polluter pays”, usually linked with a regulatory driver for participating is the trading program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Genevieve Bennett |author2=Nathaniel Carroll |author3=Katherine Hamilton |title=Charting New Waters, State of Watershed Payments 2012|url=http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/reports/sowp2012|publisher=Forest Trends}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 2013 Forest Trends report summarized water quality trading programs and found three main types of funders: beneficiaries of watershed protection, polluters compensating for their impacts and ‘public good payers’ that may not directly benefit, but fund the pollution reduction credits on behalf of a government or [[NGO]]. As of 2013, payments were overwhelmingly initiated by public good payers like governments and NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Genevieve Bennett |author2=Nathaniel Carroll |author3=Katherine Hamilton |title=Charting New Waters State of Watershed Payments 2012Figure 4b: Watershed Investments by Payer Type, Globally, Excluding China|url=http://www.forest-trends.org/documents/files/doc_3308.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=QqnnVNmuHNGpyAT2wILoCA&amp;ved=0CAYQFjAB&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1eQccAysAnihOB89UutZMKp-K_g|publisher=Forest Trends Association|accessdate=20 February 2015|pages=98|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

== Nutrient source apportionment ==
Nutrient source apportionment is used to estimate the nutrient load from various sectors entering water bodies, following attenuation or treatment. [[Agriculture]] is typically the principal source of nitrogen in water bodies in Europe, whereas in many countries households and industries tend to be the dominant contributors of phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607736796|title=Source apportionment of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs into the aquatic environment|date=2005|publisher=European Environment Agency|others=European Environment Agency.|isbn=9291677779|location=Copenhagen|oclc=607736796}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where [[water quality]] is impacted by excess nutrients, load source apportionment models can support the proportional and pragmatic management of water resources by identifying the pollution sources. There are two broad approaches to load apportionment modelling, (i) load-orientated approaches which apportion origin based on in-stream monitoring data&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=S.|last2=Taylor|first2=D.|last3=McElarney|first3=Y.R.|last4=Foy|first4=R.H.|last5=Jordan|first5=P.|title=An evaluation of catchment-scale phosphorus mitigation using load apportionment modelling|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969711001653|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=409|issue=11|pages=2211–2221|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.02.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grizzetti|first=B.|last2=Bouraoui|first2=F.|last3=Marsily|first3=G. de|last4=Bidoglio|first4=G.|title=A statistical method for source apportionment of riverine nitrogen loads|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.07.036|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=304|issue=1-4|pages=302–315|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.07.036}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (ii) source-orientated approaches where amounts of diffuse, or [[nonpoint source pollution]], emissions are calculated using models typically based on export coefficients from catchments with similar characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockler|first=Eva M.|last2=Deakin|first2=Jenny|last3=Archbold|first3=Marie|last4=Daly|first4=Donal|last5=Bruen|first5=Michael|date=2016|title=Nutrient load apportionment to support the identification of appropriate water framework directive measures|jstor=10.3318/bioe.2016.22|journal=Biology and Environment: Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy|volume=116B|issue=3|pages=245–263|doi=10.3318/bioe.2016.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=R.V.|last2=Jordan|first2=C.|last3=Annett|first3=J.A.|title=A phosphorus budget for Northern Ireland: inputs to inland and coastal waters|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.10.004|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=304|issue=1-4|pages=193–202|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Source Load Apportionment Model (SLAM) takes the latter approach, estimating the relative contribution of sources of nitrogen and phosphorus to surface waters in Irish catchments without in-stream monitoring data by integrating information on point discharges (urban wastewater, industry and septic tank systems), diffuse sources (pasture, arable, forestry, etc.), and catchment data, including hydrogeological characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockler|first=Eva M.|last2=Deakin|first2=Jenny|last3=Archbold|first3=Marie|last4=Gill|first4=Laurence|last5=Daly|first5=Donal|last6=Bruen|first6=Michael|title=Sources of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions to Irish rivers and coastal waters: Estimates from a nutrient load apportionment framework|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.186|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=601-602|pages=326–339|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sexuality pearl necklace small.png|thumb|right|Drops of [[semen]] on the neck]]

A "'''pearl necklace'''" is [[sexual slang|slang]] for a [[Human sexuality|sexual]] act in which a man [[ejaculates]] [[semen]] on or near the [[neck]], [[chest]], or [[breast]] of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Partridge |first1=Eric |author-link1=Eric Partridge |last2=Dalzell |first2=Tom |last3=Victor |first3=Terry |title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-25938-X |page=1455 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mAdUqLrKw4YC&amp;pg=PA1455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such ejaculation can follow [[mammary intercourse]], [[fellatio]], [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]], or [[masturbation]] over the other person.{{r|Davis (1996) pp. 125-127}} The term originates from the way the deposited semen resembles a [[necklace]] of translucent white [[pearl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Dan |title=Sex Tips for Straight Women from a Gay Man |publisher=[[Regan Books]] |date=1997 |pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alvi |first1=Suroosh |author-link1=Suroosh Alvi |last2=McInnes |first2=Gavin |author-link2=Gavin McInnes |last3=Smith |first3=Shane |author-link3=Shane Smith (journalist) |title=The Vice Guide to Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll |publisher=[[Warner Books]] |date=2003 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[George Carlin]] used the term in his "Incomplete List of Impolite Words" joke as early as 1984, on the album ''Carlin on Campus''. The term was also used in the [[stoner comedy]] ''[[Half Baked]]'' (1996). The [[ZZ Top]] song "[[Pearl Necklace (song)|Pearl Necklace]]" drew attention for its lyrics which were alleged to objectify women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saunders |first=Michael |title=Blues-driven Boogie of ZZ Top to Fill Miami Arena for 2 Shows |date=April 5, 1991 |work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |agency=[[New York Daily News]] |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-04-05/features/9101170548_1_guitarist-billy-gibbons-zz-frank-beard |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |quote=ZZ Top is not without its booing section.

'''''Philobiblon''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by the [[Central University Library of Cluj-Napoca]], Romania, in collaboration with [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Cluj University Press]] (Presa Universitară Clujeană). It was established in 1996 as a continuation of an irregular publication entitled ''Biblioteca și Învățămîntul'' (''Library and Education'').

The subtitles and publication frequency of the journal have changed several times: ''Bulletin of the Lucian Blaga Central University Library'' (1996−2008), ''Journal of the Lucian Blaga Central University Library'' (2009−2010), and currently: ''Transylvanian Journal of Multidisciplinary Research in Humanities''. Until 2011 it was published annually (except for 1996−1997, when it was also published twice a year).

''Philobiblon'' is available electronically through [[EBSCO Publishing]] and [[ProQuest]] databases, as well as in print. The journal was ranked in 2011 by the [[Romanian National Council for Scientific Research in Higher Education]] in seven Humanities categories as a periodical having serious chances to gain international import: Arts;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_10.pdf|title=Arts|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_9_20121.pdf|title=Philosophy|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_5.pdf|title=Architecture|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; History of Science;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_1.pdf|title=History of Science|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historiography and Theory of History;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_4.pdf|title=Historiography|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian Language and Literature;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_7.pdf|title=Language and Literature|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Languages and Literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_8.pdf|title=Foreign Languages|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Until 2011, issues of the journal were thematic, engaging several areas of academic research in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. As of 2011, the journal changed its profile, appearing with two issues per year as an academic journal of multidisciplinary research in humanities, covering research at the confluence of various branches of the humanities and social sciences and promoting the contemporary synergy of sciences (such as, for example, [[medical humanities]]).

Selected articles from ''Philobiblon'' are translated into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in a series of biannually published [[Anthology|anthologies]] entitled ''Hermeneutica Bibliothecaria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hermeneutica Bibliothecaria |url=http://www.philobiblon.ro/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=336&amp;Itemid=76&amp;lang=en |title=Welcome |work=Philobiblon |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstracting and indexing==
The journal is abstracted and indexed in [[EBSCO Information Services|EBSCO databases]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebscohost.com/titleLists/a2h-journals.pdf |title=Academic Search Alumni Edition, Magazines and Journals |publisher=[[EBSCO Publishing]] |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Library, Information Science &amp; Technology Abstracts]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebscohost.com/titleLists/lih-coverage.pdf |title=Library, Information Science &amp; Technology Abstracts with Full Text |publisher=[[EBSCO Publishing]] |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ProQuest |ProQuest databases]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proquest.com/en-US/catalogs/databases/detail/pq_research_library.shtml |title=Research Library |publisher=ProQuest |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scopus]],&lt;ref name=Scopus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.com/online-tools/scopus/content-overview |title=Content overview |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |work=Scopus |accessdate=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ERIH PLUS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dbh.nsd.uib.no/publiseringskanaler/erihplus/periodical/info?id=484050 |title=Periodical information |work=ERIH PLUS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reinhard Rudolf Karl Hartmann''' is a [[lexicography|lexicographer]] and [[applied linguistics|applied linguist]]. Until the 1970s, [[lexicographers]] worked in relative isolation, and Hartmann is credited with making a major contribution to lexicography&lt;ref&gt;Robert Burchfield (1989) in the Foreword of the Festschrift issued on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the Exeter University Language Centre and the 5th of the Dictionary Research Centre as well as Hartmann's 50th birthday, ''Lexicographers and their Works'' ed. by G. James (Volume 14, Exeter Linguistic Studies, University of Exeter Press) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; and fostering interdisciplinary consultation between reference specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Terry C. Falla (2005) "A conceptual framework for a new Comprehensive Syriac–English Lexicon" in ''Foundations for Syriac Lexicography: Proceedings of the First International Syriac Language Project Meeting'' ed. by B. Turner (Cambridge: Gorgias Press) p. 65, n. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

R.R.K. Hartmann is co-author of the standard texts ''Dictionary of Language and Linguistics'' (1972) and the ''Dictionary of Lexicography'' (1998); the former has been translated into Chinese, the latter into Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;The Literati Club/Reference Reviews 1999 award for excellence as 'best specialist reference work' was given to the editors of the ''Dictionary of Lexicography''.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartmann has also produced works on a wide range of linguistic and lexicographic topics (see list of Publications below). Two selections of his essays have been published in Kuwait (2004) and Germany (2007).

==Career==
Reinhard Hartmann was born on 8 April 1938 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], as the son of Walther and Gerta Hartmann. He obtained a degree at the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration]], where he later wrote a doctoral dissertation on public economy control and auditing, studied at the [[University of Vienna]], where he was awarded a diploma in English translation, and was a postgraduate student at [[Southern Illinois University]], where he received an M.A. in international economics.

In 1964, Hartmann moved to Manchester where he married Lynn Warren and where their children Nasim and Stefan were born. He started his career with an appointment as lecturer in modern languages at the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]]. This was followed in 1968 by a lectureship in applied linguistics at the [[University of Nottingham]]. From 1974 onwards, Hartmann held senior posts in the Language Centre and the School of English at the [[University of Exeter]], where he also organised a number of influential conferences, such as ''LEXeter ’83'' which led to the creation of the ''European Association of Lexicography'' (EURALEX), the ''International Journal of Lexicography'' and the book series ''Lexicographica Series Maior'' (of which he was one of the co-editors from 1984 to 2008, during which period 134 volumes were published). He attended 12 of the 13 biennial congresses that have been held since 1983, contributing papers at half of them and acting as first secretary and fourth president.&lt;ref&gt;He has been given honorary life membership for his services to EURALEX.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartmann has also been involved in the founding of AFRILEX (Johannesburg 1995) and ASIALEX (Hong Kong 1997). Other conferences he hosted at Exeter include one on the history of lexicography (Hartmann 1986), which demonstrated that lexicographic traditions differ considerably by dictionary types and languages, and one on lexicography in Africa (Hartmann 1990).  He has acted as a consultant to a number of bodies,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. research councils such as the National Endowment for the Humanities and the British Council, publishers such as Oxford U.P. and Benjamins, and selection panels for conferences such as EURALEX congresses.&lt;/ref&gt; received a number of grants and fellowships to spend time abroad&lt;ref&gt;Visiting fellowships held at the Humanities Research Centre of the ANU in Canberra (1977), the State University of New York at Binghamton (1985), the University of Waterloo (Ontario) Centre for the New OED (1985), the European Translation Centre at Straelen and the Institut fuer deutsche Sprache in Mannheim (1986), the School of English and Linguistics at Macquarie University in Sydney (1994), the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (1997), and the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and to participate in various initiatives to promote the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;ERASMUS grant 1990/1991 to start M.A. programmes in lexicography at various universities in Europe; Thematic Network Project in the Area of Languages with a Sub-project on Dictionaries in Language Learning in Europe (Hartmann 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; He also welcomed several visiting scholars for periods at Exeter University.&lt;ref&gt;The list includes Alan Kirkness (New Zealand), Colin Yallop (Australia), Rufus Gouws (South Africa), Olga Karpova (Russia), Alan Turney, Isamu Hayakawa and Masaaki Ohsugi (Japan), Xiaojun Heng and Jianping Wu (China).&lt;/ref&gt; His achievements have been recorded in several international directories,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Linguisten-Handbuch'' (1994), the ''Kenkyusha Biographical Dictionary of English Linguistics and Philology'' (1995), the ''International Who's Who in Translation and Terminology'' (1995), the ''Who's Who in Lexicography'' (1996), and the ''Dictionary of International Biography'' (34th edition 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and he is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and of the Chartered Institute of Linguists.

While at Exeter, Hartmann supervised over 45 M.A. and 30 Ph.D. dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;Some of these Exeter postgraduates have moved on to make an impact on their respective specialisms and countries, notably Fred Weeks, Jon Mills, Mersedeh Proctor and Martin Stark (UK), Peter Sharpe (UK and Japan), Gregory James, Philip Benson, Li Lan, Tan Zaixi and Jacqueline Lam (UK and Hong Kong), [[Barbara Kipfer]] (USA), Evanthia Tsiouris and Agapios Oikonomidis (Greece), Ibrahim Al-Besbasi (Libya), Turki Diab (UAE), Nazih Kassis (Israel), Takashi Kanazashi, Kusujiro Miyoshi and Yuri Komuro (Japan), and Young-kuk Jeong (Korea).&lt;/ref&gt; specialising on such aspects as [[dictionary criticism]] (evaluating their many different features), [[dictionary history]] (tracing their varying traditions), [[dictionary typology]] (classifying their different genres), [[dictionary use]] (observing the reference skills needed to access information), [[contrastive linguistics]], [[translation]] and [[bilingual lexicography]].

Upon his retirement in 2001, the Dictionary Research Centre that Hartmann had established at the [[University of Exeter]] was transferred to the [[University of Birmingham]] where he was awarded the title of Honorary Professor of Lexicography in the School of English. Since 2007, Hartmann has been consolidating his various lists of conferences, institutions, dictionary projects, dissertations, and periodicals into an International Directory of Lexicography Institutions.

'''Peter Reyner Banham''', [[FRIBA]] (2 March 1922 – 19 March 1988) was an [[English people|English]] architectural [[critic]] and writer best known for his theoretical [[treatise]] ''Theory and Design in the First Machine Age'' (1960) and for his 1971 book ''Los Angeles:  The Architecture of Four Ecologies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reyner Banham, Architectural Critic, Dies at 66 |last=Goldberger |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Goldberger |date=22 March 1988 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/22/obituaries/reyner-banham-architectural-critic-dies-at-66.html?scp=2&amp;sq=reyner%20banham&amp;st=cse |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter he categorized the [[Los Angeles]] experience into four ecological models (Surfurbia, Foothills, The Plains of Id, and Autopia) and explored the distinct architectural cultures of each. Banham worked in [[London]], but lived primarily in the [[United States]] from the late 1960s until the end of his life.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Banham Los Angeles Architecture 4 Ecologies.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of a paperback edition of ''Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies'' (1971), a popular study of [[Los Angeles]]]]

He was born in [[Norwich]], England to Percy Banham, a gas engineer, and Violet Frances Maud Reyner. He was educated at [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich School]] and gained an engineering scholarship with the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]], where he spent much of the [[Second World War]]. In Norwich he gave art lectures, wrote reviews for the local paper and was involved with the [[Maddermarket Theatre]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sutherland Lyall|title=Banham, (Peter) Reyner (1922–1988)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004; online edn, May 2008|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39982|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 Banham entered the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] in London where he studied under [[Anthony Blunt]], [[Sigfried Giedion]] and [[Nikolaus Pevsner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/banhamr|title=Banham, [Peter] Reyner, "Peter"|author=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pevsner, who was his doctoral supervisor, invited Banham to study the history of modern architecture, following his own work ''Pioneers of the Modern Movement'' (1936).

==Career==
In 1952 Banham began working for the ''[[Architectural Review]]''.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Banham also had connections with the [[Independent Group]], the 1956 ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' art exhibition – considered by many to the birth of [[pop art]] – and the thinking of the [[Smithson]]s and of [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]], on the '[[New Brutalism]]', which he documented in his 1966 book ''The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?''{{clarify|date=January 2014}} But before this in ''Theory and Design in the First Machine Age'', he cut across mentor Pevsner's main theories, linking [[modernism]] to build structures in which the '[[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]' was actually subject to formal strictures. Later, he wrote a ''Guide to Modern Architecture'' (1962, later titled ''Age of the Masters, a Personal View of Modern Architecture''). Banham predicted a "second age" of the machine and [[mass consumption]]. ''The Architecture of Well-Tempered Environment'' (1969) follows Giedion's ''Mechanization Takes Command'' (1948), putting the development of technologies such as electricity and [[air conditioning]] ahead of the classic account of structures. In the 1960s, [[Cedric Price]], [[Peter Cook (architect)|Peter Cook]], and the [[Archigram]] group also found this to be an absorbing arena of thought.

[[Environmentalism|Green thinking]] (''Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies'') and then the [[1973 oil crisis|oil shock]] of 1973 affected him. The '[[postmodernism|postmodern]]' was for him uneasy, and he evolved into the conscience of postwar British architecture. He broke with [[utopian]] and technical [[Formalism (art)|formalism]]. ''Scenes in America Deserta'' (1982) talks of open spaces and his anticipation of a 'modern' future. In ''A Concrete Atlantis: U.S. Industrial Building and European Modern Architecture, 1900–1925'' (1986) Banham demonstrates the influence of American [[grain elevators]] and "Daylight" factories on the [[Bauhaus]] and other modernist projects in Europe.

===Teaching===
As a professor, Banham taught at the [[Bartlett School of Architecture]], [[University College London]] and the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo]], and through the 1980s at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. He had been appointed the Sheldon H. Solow Professor of the History of Architecture at the [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts|Institute of Fine Arts, New York University]] shortly before his death, but he never taught there. 

==Awards and tributes==
He was featured in the short documentary ''Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles''; in his book on Los Angeles, Banham said that he learned to drive so he could read the city in the original.

In 1988 he was awarded the [[Sir Misha Black]] award and was added to the [[College of Medallists]].&lt;ref name="mishablackawards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mishablackawards.org.uk/the-medal|title=The Sir Misha Black Medal &amp;#124; Misha Black Awards|publisher=mishablackawards.org.uk|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2003, Nigel Whiteley published a critical biography of Banham, ''Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future |last=Whiteley |first=Nigel |publisher=MIT Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-262-73165-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he gives an in-depth overview of Banham's work and ideas.

The award is sponsored by [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers]].  It carries a [[US Dollar|US$]]500 cash [[stipend]] and is presented at the APSA's Annual Meeting to a winner selected from political science professors nominated by members of the award committee, chaired by L. Sandy Maisel, Professor of Government and Director of the [[Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement]] at [[Colby College]] in [[Waterville, Maine|Waterville]], [[Maine]].&lt;ref name=APSA-Rowman /&gt;  

According to the Association, the Award recognizes developers of "effective new approaches to teaching" among political scientists.  Its intent is to honor a wide range of new directions, rather than one in particular.  The annual winner is chosen from among a pool of nominees whose innovations had moved [[political science]] [[pedagogy]] forward.&lt;ref name=APSA-VanVechten /&gt;

In 2006 school district officials stated that disorder was not increasing at Roxborough High while some teachers stated that it was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Snyder, Susan|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-143343554.html|title=Tension at Roxborough High: Teachers say disorder is on the rise.

In 2010 [[Manayunk, Philadelphia|Manayunk]] resident and Philadelphia School District teacher Keith Newman criticized the school district's handling of the high school, stating that it should not be ranked as "persistently dangerous" since it is in a relatively well-to-do area. At the time he was running for election for a political position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scally, Bernard J.|url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2010/05/09/roxborough_review/news/doc4be0896b94a54803448993.txt?viewmode=fullstory|title=Candidate Profile - 'A regular guy'|publisher=''[[Roxborough Review]]''|date=2010-05-09|accessdate=2016-11-16|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6m442G9KZ?url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2010/05/09/roxborough_review/news/doc4be0896b94a54803448993.txt?viewmode=fullstory|archivedate=2016-11-16|df=}} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

Roxborough alumnus Stephen Brandt made efforts to turn around the school during his time as principal. The school district had asked him, previously a [[Norristown School District]] employee, to help improve the high school. He received the 2013 Lindback Award for Distinguished Principal Leadership. In 2013 Brandt, then the outgoing principal, stated that Dana Jenkins was going to be the new principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scally, Bernard J.|url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2013/06/14/roxborough_review/news/doc51b745e5a0979592908489.txt|title=New principal named for Roxborough High|publisher=''[[Roxborough Review]]''|date=2013-06-14|accessdate=2016-11-16}} ([https://www.webcitation.org/6m40YiyNV?url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2013/06/14/roxborough_review/news/doc51b745e5a0979592908489.txt?viewmode=fullstory Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3167">[[File:Scepkin1903Sava142ob.jpg|thumb|right|Sava's book, 1.142]]
'''Sava's book''' ({{lang-bg|Савина книга}}, ''Savina kniga''; {{lang-ru|Саввина книга}}, ''Savvina kniga'') is a 129-folio [[Early Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[Old_Church_Slavonic#Canon|canon]] [[evangeliary]], written in the eleventh century.

The original 126 [[parchment]] folios are of Bulgarian provenance, being bound into a larger codex with later additions of the [[Russian Church Slavonic]] recension. The codex is named the priest Sav(v)a, who inscribed his name on two of the original folios. There is no other historical record of Sava, and it is therefore believed that he was one of the manuscript's copyists.

The early history of Sava's book is unknown. What can be ascertained is that the codex was in the Seredkino monastery near [[Pskov]] until at least the 17th century. Afterwards it was moved to the manuscript collection of the Moscow Synodal Printing House, where it was found in 1866 by the Russian Slavist [[Izmail Sreznevsky]], who gave the codex its modern-day appellation and was the first one to publish it (Saint Petersburg, 1868). Today it is kept in the Central State Archive of Old Documents (CGADA) in Moscow.

The first critical edition of the manuscript was published by V. N. Ščepkin (''Savvina kniga'', Saint Petersburg 1903), photographically reprinted in Graz in 1959. Ščepkin was the first to perform a paleolinguistic analysis of the manuscript (''Razsuždenie o jazyke Savvinoj knigy'', 1899), and he ascertained that it was copied from a [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] original. His 1903 edition led N. Karinski to propound several new readings and to fix some wrong solutions (''Perečenь važnejših netočnostei poslednego izdanija Savvinoj knigi'', Izv., XIX, 3, 206-216). Paleographic and linguistic analysis shows that the copyist wrote [[yer]]s where he did not pronounce them any more, and that behind ''č'', ''ž'' and ''š'' he wrote ''ъ'' instead of ''ь'', which indicates that the aforementioned consonants were pronounced "hard" in the scribe's mother tongue, or, more likely, that other than the preserved softness in the preceding consonant the two yers had merged. There is abundant evidence for the loss of epenthetic ''l'', and, instead of [[Ya (Cyrillic)|iotified a]] ({{Slavonic|ꙗ}}), [[yat]] ({{Slavonic|Ѣ}}) is often written.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52398">'''Situated cognition''' is a theory that posits that knowing is inseparable from doing&lt;ref&gt;[[John Seely Brown]], Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989; Greeno, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; by arguing that all knowledge is situated in activity bound to social, cultural and physical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Greeno &amp; Moore, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this assumption, which requires an [[epistemological]] shift from empiricism, situativity theorists suggest a model of knowledge and learning that requires thinking on the fly rather than the storage and retrieval of conceptual knowledge. In essence, cognition cannot be separated from the context. Instead knowing exists, ''in situ'', inseparable from context, activity, people, culture, and language. Therefore, learning is seen in terms of an individual's increasingly effective performance across situations rather than in terms of an accumulation of knowledge, since what is known is co-determined by the agent and the context. This perspective rejects [[mind–body dualism]], being conceptually similar to [[functional contextualism]], and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[behavior analysis]].

==History==
While situated cognition gained recognition in the field of [[educational psychology]] in the late twentieth century,&lt;ref name="Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989"&gt;Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; it shares many principles with older fields such as [[critical theory]], (Frankfurt School, 1930; Freire, 1968) [[anthropology]] ([[Jean Lave]] &amp; Wenger, 1991), philosophy ([[Martin Heidegger]], 1968), [[critical discourse analysis]] (Fairclough, 1989), and [[sociolinguistics]] theories ([[Bakhtin]], 1981) that rejected the notion of truly objective knowledge and the principles of Kantian [[empiricism]].

Lucy Suchman's work on situated action at Xerox Labs&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plans and situated actions: The problem of human-machine communication|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=9780521337397|location=Cambridge MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was instrumental in popularizing the idea that an actor's understanding of how to perform work results from reflecting on interactions with the social and material (e.g. technology-mediated) situation in which she or he acts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|date=January 1993|title=Response to Vera and Simon's Situated Action: A Symbolic Interpretation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.1993.17.issue-1/issuetoc|journal=COGNITIVE SCIENCE|volume=17|pages=71–75|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent perspectives of situated cognition have focused on and draw from the concept of identity formation &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; as people negotiate meaning through interactions within communities of practice.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Duguid, 2000; Clancey, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Situated cognition perspectives have been adopted in education,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; instructional design,&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; online communities and artificial intelligence (see Brooks, Clancey). Grounded Cognition, concerned with the role of simulations and embodiment in cognition, encompasses Cognitive Linguistics, Situated Action, Simulation and Social Simulation theories. Research has contributed to the understanding of embodied language, memory, and the representation of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Barsalou, L. Grounded Cognition (2008) Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2008. 59:617–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated cognition draws a variety of perspectives, from an anthropological study of human behavior in the context of technology-mediated work,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or within [[communities of practice]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  to the [[ecological psychology]] of the perception-action cycle&lt;ref&gt;[[James J. Gibson]], 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and intentional dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Kadar, Sim &amp; Reppenger, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and even research on robotics with work on [[autonomous agent]]s at NASA and elsewhere (e.g., work by W. J. Clancey). Early attempts to define situated cognition focused on contrasting the emerging theory with information processing theories dominant in cognitive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Bredo, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently theorists have recognized a natural affinity between situated cognition, New Literacy Studies and [[new literacies]] research (Gee, 2010). This connection is made by understanding that situated cognition maintains that individuals learn through experiences. It could be stated that these experiences, and more importantly the mediators that affect attention during these experiences is affected by the tools, technologies and languages used by a socio-cultural group and the meanings given to these by the collective group. New literacies research examines the context and contingencies that language and tool use by individuals and how this changes as the Internet and other communication technologies affect literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Leu et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key principles==
===Affordances/effectivities===
[[James J. Gibson]] introduced the idea of [[affordance]]s as part of a relational account of perception.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Perception should not be considered solely as the encoding of environmental features into the perceiver's mind, but as an element of an individual's interaction with her environment (Gibson, 1977). Central to his proposal of an ecological psychology was the notion of affordances. Gibson proposed that in any interaction between an agent and the environment, inherent conditions or qualities of the environment allow the agent to perform certain actions with the environment.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"&gt;Greeno, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; He defined the term as properties in the environment that presented possibilities for action and were available for an agent to perceive directly and act upon.&lt;ref name="Gibson 1979/1986"&gt;Gibson 1979/1986&lt;/ref&gt;
Gibson focused on the affordances of physical objects, such as doorknobs and chairs, and suggested that these affordances were directly perceived by an individual instead of mediated by mental representations such as mental models. It is important to note that Gibson's notion of direct perception as an unmediated process of noticing, perceiving, and encoding specific attributes from the environment, has long been challenged by proponents of a more category-based model of perception.

This focus on agent-situation interactions in ecological psychology was consistent with the situated cognition program of researchers such as James G. Greeno (1994, 1998), who appreciated Gibson's apparent rejection of the factoring assumptions underlying experimental psychology. The situated cognition perspective focused on "perception-action instead of memory and retrieval…A perceiving/acting agent is coupled with a developing/adapting environment and what matters is how the two interact".&lt;ref&gt;Young, Kulikowich, &amp; Barab, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;139&lt;/ref&gt; Greeno (1994) also suggested that affordances are "preconditions for activity," and that while they do not determine behavior, they increase the likelihood that a certain action or behavior will occur.

Shaw, Turvey, &amp; Mace (as cited by Greeno, 1994) later introduced the term effectivities, the abilities of the agent that determined what the agent could do, and consequently, the interaction that could take place. Perception and action were co-determined by the effectivities and affordances, which acted 'in the moment' together.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 1979/1986; Greeno, 1994; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the agent directly perceived and interacted with the environment, determining what affordances could be picked up, based on his effectivities. This view is consistent with Norman's (1988) theory of "perceived affordances," which emphasizes the agent's perception of an object's utility as opposed to focusing on the object itself.

An interesting question is the relationship between affordances and mental representations as set forth in a more cognitivist perspective. While Greeno (1998) argues that attunements to affordances are superior to constructs such as [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]] and mental models, Glenberg &amp; Robertson (1999) suggested that affordances are the building blocks of mental models.

===Perception (variance/invariance)===
The work of Gibson (1986) in the field of visual [[perception]] greatly influences situated cognition.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"/&gt; Gibson argued that visual perception is not a matter of the eye translating inputs into symbolic representation in the brain. Instead the viewer perceives and picks up on the infinite amount of information available in the environment. Specifically, an agent perceives affordances by discovering the variants, what changes, and more importantly the invariants, what does not change across different situations. Given a specific intention (or intentional set),{{clarify|date=October 2011}} perceptions of invariants are co-determined by the agent and the affordances of the environment, and are then built upon over time.{{clarify|date=October 2011}}

===Memory===
Situated cognition and ecological psychology perspectives emphasize perception and propose that [[memory]] plays a significantly diminished role in the learning process. Rather, focus is on the continuous tuning of perceptions and actions across situations based on the affordances of the environment and the interaction of the agent within that environment (Greeno, 1994). Representations are not stored and checked against past knowledge, but are created and interpreted in activity (Clancey, 1990).

Situated cognition understands memory as an interaction with the world, bounded by meaningful situations, that brings an agent toward a specified goal (intention). Thus, perception and action are co-determined by the effectivities and affordances, which act 'in the moment' together.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 1979/1986; Greeno, 1994; Young Kulikowich, &amp; Barab, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the agent directly perceives and interacts with the environment, determining what affordances can be picked up, based on his effectivities, and does not simply recall stored symbolic representations.

===Knowing===
Situativity theorists recast knowledge not as an entity, thing, or noun, but as knowing as an action or verb.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"/&gt; It is not an entity which can be collected as in knowledge acquisition models. Instead knowing is reciprocally co-determined between the agent and environment.&lt;ref name="br2006"&gt;Barab &amp; Roth, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This reciprocal interaction can not be separated from the context and its cultural and historical constructions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Therefore, knowing isn't a matter of arriving at any single truth but instead it is a particular stance that emerges from the agent-environment interaction.&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt;

Knowing emerges as individuals develop intentions&lt;ref&gt;Young, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; through goal-directed activities within cultural contexts which may in turn have larger goals and claims of truth. The adoption of intentions relates to the direction of the agent's attention to the detection of affordances in the environment that will lead to accomplishment of desired goals. Knowing is expressed in the agent's ability to act as an increasingly competent participant in a community of practice. As agents participate more fully within specific communities of practice, what constitutes knowing continuously evolves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For example, a novice environmentalist may not look at water quality by examining oxygen levels but may consider the color and smell.&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt; Through participation and enculturation within different communities, agents express knowing through action.

===Learning===
Since knowing is rooted in action and can not be decontextualized from individual, social, and historical goals&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt; teaching approaches that focus on conveying facts and rules separately from the contexts within which they are meaningful in real-life do not allow for [[learning]] that is based on the detection of invariants. They are therefore considered to be impoverished methods that are unlikely to lead to transfer. Learning must involve more than the transmission of knowledge but must instead encourage the expression of effectivities and the development of attention and intention&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2004b&lt;/ref&gt; through rich contexts&lt;ref&gt;Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; that reflect real life learning processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Learning, more specifically literacy learning is affected by the Internet and other communication technologies as also evidenced in other segments of society. As a result of this youth are recently using affordances provided by these tools to become experts in a variety of domains.&lt;ref name="Gee, 2010"&gt;Gee, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These practices by youth are viewed as them becoming "pro-ams" and becoming experts in whatever they have developed a passion for.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 2006; Leadbeater &amp; Miller, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Individuals don't just read or write texts, they interact with them, and often these interactions involve others in various socio-cultural contexts. Since [[language]] is often the basis for monitoring and tracking learning gains in comprehension, content knowledge and tool use in and out of school the role of situated cognition in language learning activities is important. Membership and interaction in social and cultural groups is often determined by tools, technologies and [[discourse]] use for full participation. Language learning or literacy in various social and cultural groups must include how the groups work with and interact with these texts.&lt;ref name="Gee, 2010"/&gt; Language instruction in the context of situated cognition also involves the skilled or novice use of language by members of the group, and instruction of not only the elements of language, but what is needed to bring a student to the level of expert. Originating from emergent literacy,&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson &amp; Neuman, 2006; Gee, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; specialist-language lessons examines the formal and informal styles and discourses of language use in socio-cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, 2004; Gee, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A function of specialist-language lessons includes "lucidly functional language", or complex specialist language is usually accompanied by clear and lucid language used to explain the rules, relationships or meanings existing between language and meaning.&lt;ref name="Gee, 2010"/&gt;

===Legitimate peripheral participation===
According to [[Jean Lave]] and Wenger (1991) [[legitimate peripheral participation]] (LPP) provides a framework to describe how individuals ('newcomers') become part of a community of learners. Legitimate peripheral participation was central to Lave and Wenger's take on situated cognition (referred to as "situated activity") because it introduced socio-cultural and historical realizations of power and access to the way thinking and knowing are legitimated. They stated, "Hegemony over resources for learning and alienation from full participation are inherent in the shaping of the legitimacy and peripherality of participation in its historical realizations" (p.&amp;nbsp;42). Lave and Wenger's (1991) research on the phenomenon of apprenticeship in communities of practice not only provided a unit of analysis for locating an individual's multiple, changing levels and ways of participation, but also implied that all participants, through increased involvement, have access to, acquire, and use resources available to their particular community.

To illustrate the role of LPP in situated activity, Lave and Wenger (1991) examined five apprenticeship scenarios (Yucatec midwives, Vai and Gola tailors, naval quartermasters, meat cutters, and non-drinking alcoholics involved in AA). Their analysis of apprenticeship across five different communities of learners lead them to several conclusions about the situatedness of LPP and its relationship to successful learning. Key to newcomers' success included:

* access to all that community membership entails,
* involvement in productive activity,
* learning the discourse(s) of the community including "talking about and talking within a practice," (p.&amp;nbsp;109), and
* willingness of the community to capitalize on the inexperience of newcomers, "Insofar as this continual interaction of new perspectives is sanctioned, everyone's participation is legitimately peripheral in some respect. In other words, everyone can to some degree be considered a 'newcomer' to the future of a changing community" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Planning vs. action ===
Suchman's book, ''Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human-machine Communication'' (1987), provided a novel approach to the study of [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interaction (HCI)]]. By adopting an anthropological approach to sensemaking and interpretation, Suchman was able to demonstrate how both action and planning were situated in the context of a flow of socially- and materially-mediated activities - an idea that stimulated many of the later conceptualizations of situated cognition. Her studies contrasted the deterministic approach to planning assumed by technology designers with the situated nature of planning as people make sense of the status of their workflow and adjust their course of action accordingly. For example, a photocopier will instruct its user to reload all pages in the original order after a jam, whereas the user understands that they only need to copy the last page again.  By arguing that plans were the result of ongoing processes of prospective/retrospective sense making, Suchman identified the limits of technology system access to relevant social and material resources as a major cause of limitations in how technology supports human work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This position led to a major debate with Vera and Simon (1993), who argued that cognition is based on symbolic representations and that planning must therefore be deterministic, based on a pre-determined repertoire of learned response. Most organizational theorists would now see this debate as reflecting individual/cognitive vs. socially-situated levels of analysis (requiring a similar need for paradigmatic co-existence as [[Wave–particle duality]]). Suchman (1993) argues that planning in the context of work-activity is similar to navigating a canoe through rapids: you know what point on the river you are aiming for, but you constantly adjust your course as you interact with rocks, swells, and currents on the way. As a result many organizational theorists argue that plans can only be viewed as post-hoc justifications of action, while Suchman herself views appears to view plans and actions as interrelated in the moment of action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Representation, symbols, and schemata===
In situated theories, the term "[[Mental representation|representation]]" refers to external forms in the environment that are created through social interactions to express meaning (language, art, gestures, etc.) and are perceived and acted upon in the first person sense. "Representing" in the first person sense is conceived as an act of re-experiencing in the imagination that involves the dialectic of ongoing perceiving and acting in coordination with the activation of neural structures and processes. This form of reflective representation is considered to be a secondary type of learning, while the primary form of learning is found in the "adaptive recoordination that occurs with every behavior".&lt;ref name="clancey1993"&gt;Clancey, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptualizing is considered to be a "prelinguistic" act, while "knowing" involves creative interaction with [[symbol]]s in both their interpretation and use for expression. "Schema" develop as neural connections become biased through repeated activations to reactivate in situations that are perceived and conceived as temporally and compositionally similar to previous generalized situations.&lt;ref name="clancey1993" /&gt;

===Goals, intention, and attention===
[[File:PS Dynamics.jpg|thumb|left|Young-Barab Model (1997)]]The Young-Barab Model (1997) pictured to the left, illustrates the dynamics of intentions and intentional dynamics involved in the agent’s interaction with his environment when problem solving.

Dynamics of Intentions:&lt;ref name=ksy&gt;Kugler et al., 1991; Shaw et al., 1992; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; goal (intention) adoption from among all possible goals (ontological descent). This describes how the learner decides whether or not to adopt a particular goal when presented with a problem. Once a goal is adopted, the learner proceeds by interacting with their environment through intentional dynamics. There are many levels of intentions, but at the moment of a particular occasion, the agent has just one intention, and that intention constrains his behavior until it is fulfilled or annihilated.

Intentional Dynamics:&lt;ref name=ksy /&gt; dynamics that unfold when the agent has only one intention (goal) and begins to act towards it, perceiving and acting.&lt;ref name="Gibson 1979/1986"/&gt; It is a trajectory towards the achievement of a solution or goal, the process of tuning one’s perception (attention). Each intention is meaningfully bounded, where the dynamics of that intention inform the agent of whether or not he is getting closer to achieving his goal. If the agent is not getting closer to his goal, he will take corrective action, and then continue forward. This is the agent’s intentional dynamics, and continues on until he achieves his goal.

===Transfer===
There are various definition of transfer found within the situated cognition umbrella. Researchers interested in social practice often define transfer as increased participation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ecological psychology perspectives define transfer as the detection of invariance across different situations.&lt;ref&gt;Young &amp; McNeese, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, transfer can only "occur when there is a confluence of an individual's goals and objectives, their acquired abilities to act, and a set of affordances for action".&lt;ref&gt;Young et al., 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied cognition===
{{main|Embodied cognition}}
The traditional cognition approach assumes that perception and motor systems are merely peripheral input and output devices.&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, 2007; Wilson, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[embodied cognition]] posits that the mind and body interact 'on the fly' as a single entity. An example of embodied cognition is seen in the area of robotics, where movements are not based on internal representations, rather, they are based on the robot’s direct and immediate interaction with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, research has shown that embodied facial expressions influence judgments,&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and arm movements are related to a person’s evaluation of a word or concept.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, &amp; Brendl, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter example, the individual would pull or push a lever towards his name at a faster rate for positive words, than for negative words. These results appeal to the embodied nature of situated cognition, where knowledge is the achievement of the whole body in its interaction with the world.

==Externalism==
As to the mind, by and large, situated cognition paves the way to various form of [[externalism]]. The issue is whether the situated aspect of cognition has only a practical value or it is somehow constitutive of cognition and perhaps of consciousness itself. As to the latter possibility, there are different positions. David Chalmers and Andy Clark, who developed the hugely debated model of the extended mind, explicitly rejected the externalization of consciousness.&lt;ref name="clark2008"&gt;Clark, A., (2008), ''Supersizing the Mind'', Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For them, only cognition is extended. On the other hand, others, like Riccardo Manzotti&lt;ref name=clark2008 /&gt; or Teed Rockwell,&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, 2005 #1561&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly considered the possibility to situate conscious experience in the environment.

==Pedagogical implications==
Since situated cognition views knowing as an action within specific contexts and views [[direct instruction]] models of knowledge transmission as impoverished, there are significant implications for pedagogical practices. First, curriculum requires instructional design that draws on apprenticeship models common in real life.&lt;ref name="Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989"/&gt; Second, curricular design should rely on contextual narratives that situate concepts in practice. Classroom practices such as [[project-based learning]] and [[problem-based learning]] would qualify as consistent with the [[situated learning]] perspective, as would techniques such as Case Base Learning, [[Anchored Instruction]], and [[cognitive apprenticeship]].

===Cognitive apprenticeship===
Cognitive apprenticeships were one of the earliest pedagogical designs to incorporate the theories of situated cognition (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989). Cognitive apprenticeship uses four dimensions (e.g., content, methods, sequence, sociology) to embed learning in activity and make deliberate the use of the social and physical contexts present in the classroom (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989; Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). Cognitive apprenticeship includes the enculturation of students into authentic practices through activity and social interaction (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989). The technique draws on the principles of Legitimate Peripheral Participation (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and reciprocal teaching (Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984; 1989) in that a more knowledgeable other, i.e. a teacher, engages in a task with a more novice other, i.e. a learner, by describing their own thoughts as they work on the task, providing "just in time" scaffolding, modeling expert behaviors, and encouraging reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1985; Scardamalia, Bereiter. &amp; Steinbach, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The reflection process includes having students alternate between novice and expert strategies in a problem-solving context, sensitizing them to specifics of an expert performance, and adjustments that may be made to their own performance to get them to the expert level (Collins &amp; Brown, 1988; Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). Thus, the function of reflection indicates "co-investigation" and/or abstracted replay by students.&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1983; Collins &amp; Brown, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins, Brown, and Newman (1989) emphasized six critical features of a cognitive apprenticeship that included observation, coaching, [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]], modeling, fading, and reflection. Using these critical features, expert(s) guided students on their journey to acquire the cognitive and metacognitive processes and skills necessary to handle a variety of tasks, in a range of situations&lt;ref&gt;Collins et al.,1989&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocal teaching, a form of cognitive apprenticeship, involves the modeling and coaching of various comprehension skills as teacher and students take turns in assuming the role of instructor.

===Anchored instruction===
Anchored instruction is grounded in a story or narrative that presents a realistic (but fictional) situation and raises an overarching question or problem (compare with an essential question posed by a teacher). This approach is designed to 1) engage the learner with a problem or series of related problems, 2) require the learner to develop goals and discover subgoals related to solving the problem(s), and 3) provide the learner with extensive and diverse opportunities to explore the problem(s) in a shared context with classmates. For example, a Spanish teacher uses a video drama series focused on the murder of a main character. Students work in small groups to summarize parts of the story, to create hypotheses about the murderer and motive, and to create a presentation of their solution to the class. Stories are often paired so that across the set students can detect the invariant structure of the underlying knowledge (so 2 episodes about distance-rate-time, one about boats and one about planes, so students can perceive how the distance-rate-time relationship holds across differences in vehicles). The ideal smallest set of instances needed provide students the opportunity to detect invariant structure has been referred to as a "generator set" of situations.

The goal of anchored instruction is the engagement of intention and attention. Through authentic tasks across multiple domains, educators present situations that require students to create or adopt meaningful goals (intentions). One of the educator’s objectives can be to set a goal through the use of an anchor problem.&lt;ref&gt;Barab &amp; Roth, 2006; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of anchored instruction is the Jasper series.&lt;ref&gt;The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990; Young et al., 1997; Young &amp; McNeese, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The Jasper series includes a variety of videodisc adventures focused on problem formulation and problem solving. Each videodisc used a visual narrative to present an authentic, realistic everyday problem. The objective was for students to adopt specific goals (intentions) after viewing the story and defining a problem. These newly adopted goals guided students through the collaborative process of problem formulation and problem solving.

===Perceiving and acting in avatar-based virtual worlds===
[[Virtual world]]s provide unique affordances for embodied learning, i.e. hands on, interactive, spatially oriented, that ground learning in experience. Here "embodied" means acting in a virtual world enabled by an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]].

Contextual affordances of online games and virtual environments allow learners to engage in goal-driven activity, authentic interactions, and collaborative problem-solving – all considered in situated theories of learning to be features of optimal learning. In terms of situated assessment, virtual worlds have the advantage of facilitating dynamic feedback that directs the perceiving/acting agent, through an avatar, to continually improve performance.

==Research methodologies==
The situative perspective is focused on interactive systems in which individuals interact with one another and physical and representational systems. Research takes place ''in situ'' and in real-world settings, reflecting assumptions that knowledge is constructed within specific contexts which have specific situational affordances. Mixed methods and qualitative methodologies are the most prominently used by researchers.

In qualitative studies, methods used are varied but the focus is often on the increased participation in specific communities of practice, the affordances of the environment that are acted upon by the agent, and the distributed nature of knowing in specific communities. A major feature of quantitative methods used in situated cognition is the absence of outcome measures. Quantitative variables used in mixed methods often focus on process over product. For example, trace nodes, dribble files, and hyperlink pathways are often used to track how students interact in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Effken, Fajen, Garret &amp; Morris, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of situativity==
In "Situated Action: A Symbolic Interpretation" Vera and Simon wrote: " ... the systems usually regarded as exemplifying Situated Action are thoroughly symbolic (and representational), and, to the extent that they are limited in these respects, have doubtful prospects for extension to complex tasks"&lt;ref&gt;Vera &amp; Simon, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; Vera and Simon (1993) also claimed that the [[information processing]] view is supported by many years of research in which symbol systems simulated "broad areas of human cognition" and that there is no evidence of cognition without representation.

Anderson, Reder and Simon (1996) summarized what they considered to be the four claims of situated learning and argued against each claim from a [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] perspective. The claims and their arguments were:
# Claim: Activity and learning are bound to the specific situations in which they occur. Argument: Whether learning is bound to context or not depends on both the kind of learning and the way that it is learned.
# Claim: Knowledge does not transfer between tasks. Argument: There is ample evidence of successful transfer between tasks in the literature. Transfer depends on initial practice and the degree to which a successive task has similar cognitive elements to a prior task.
# Claim: Teaching abstractions is ineffective. Argument: Abstract instruction can be made effective by combining of abstract concepts and concrete examples.
# Claim: Instruction must happen in complex social contexts. Argument: Research shows value in individual learning and on focusing individually on specific skills in a skill set.

Anderson, Reder and Simons summarize their concerns when they say:
"What is needed to improve learning and teaching is to continue to deepen our research into the circumstances that determine when narrower or broader contexts are required and when attention to narrower or broader skills are optimal for effective and efficient learning" (p.&amp;nbsp;10).

===Considerations===
However, it is important to remember that a theory is neither wrong nor right but provides affordances for certain aspects of a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sfard | first1 = A | year = 1998 | title = On two metaphors for learning and the dangers of choosing just one | url = | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 4–13 | doi=10.3102/0013189x027002004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lave and Wenger recognized this in their ironic comment, "How can we purport to be working out a theoretical conception of learning without engaging in the project of abstraction [decontextualized knowledge] rejected above?" (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;38).

'''Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity''', or '''SMOS''', is a [[satellite]] which forms part of [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Living Planet Programme]]. It is intended to provide new insights into Earth's [[water cycle]] and [[climate]]. In addition, it is intended to provide improved weather forecasting and monitoring of snow and ice accumulation.&lt;ref name = "ESAMBA2VMOC_LPsmos_0"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaLP/ESAMBA2VMOC_LPsmos_0.html ESA's water mission SMOS] European Space Agency&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"&gt;SMOS Project Team, [http://ursi-f-2005.jrc.it/fullpapers/URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1.pdf The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506200325/http://ursi-f-2005.jrc.it/fullpapers/URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1.pdf |date=2006-05-06 }} European Space Agency&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ESA Bulletin"&gt;SMOS Special Issue of ESA Bulletin [http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESA_Publications/SEMU9CWX3RF_0.html ESA Bulletin] Special Issue  137, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE Proceedings 2010-05-Font-Camps-Borges"&gt;''SMOS: The Challenging Sea Surface Salinity Measurement from Space'', J.

==History==
The project was proposed in November 1998; in 2004 the project passed ESA-phase "C/D" and,&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"&gt;[http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/indexsmos.html The Living Planet Program Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (MIRAS on RAMSES)] Mission SMOS at Centre d'Etudes Spatailes de la BIOsphere (CESBIO)&lt;/ref&gt; after several delays, it was launched on 2 November 2009 from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] on a [[Rockot]] rocket.&lt;ref name=bbc &gt;{{cite news | author=Jonathan Amos | title=European water mission lifts off | date=2 November 2009 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8331962.stm | accessdate = 2009-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first data from the [[Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis|MIRAS]] ([[Microwave]] Imaging [[Radiometer]] using [[Aperture]] Synthesis) instrument was received on 20 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaEO/SEMDGULX82G_index_0.html|title=First SMOS data received|date=20 November 2009|publisher=ESA|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMOS programme cost is about €315 million ($465 million; £280 million). It is led by ESA but with significant input from French and Spanish interests.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The satellite is part of ESA's Earth Explorer programme – eight spacecraft that will do innovative science in obtaining data on issues of pressing [[environmental science|environment]]al concern. The first is already in orbit – a mission called [[GOCE]], which is mapping variations in the pull of [[gravity]] across the Earth's surface. SMOS is the second Explorer to launch; and a third spacecraft, known as [[CryoSat-2]] (the first [[CryoSat]] failed on launch), was launched on 8 April 2010. CryoSat will assess the state of the world's ice cover.

==Launcher==
The satellite was launched on 2 November 2009 (04:50 (01:50 GMT)) to a nearly circular orbit of 763&amp;nbsp;km aboard a [[Rokot]], a modified [[Russians|Russian]] [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile]] (ICBM) [[SS-19]] launched from a decommissioned SS-19 launcher from Northern Russia's  [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]].&lt;ref name = "URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jonathan Amos | title=Smos satellite unfurls instrument | date=3 November 2009 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8341400.stm | accessdate = 2009-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SMOS satellite was launched together with the [[Proba-2]], a technology demonstration satellite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaTQM/1220880349148_index_0.html Successful launch qualification test for PROBA2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302233049/http://www.esa.int/esaTQM/1220880349148_index_0.html |date=2009-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurockot.com/alist.asp?cnt=20040811&amp;main=3&amp;subm=97# ESA's SMOS Mission to be launched in July 2009 from Plesetsk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061131/http://www.eurockot.com/alist.asp?cnt=20040811&amp;main=3&amp;subm=97 |date=2009-01-26 }} The Rockot Missions.

==Science==
The goal of the SMOS mission is to monitor surface soil moisture with an accuracy of 4% (at 35–50&amp;nbsp;km [[spatial resolution]]).&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"/&gt; This aspect is managed by the HYDROS project.  Project Aquarius will attempt to monitor sea surface salinity with an accuracy of 0.1 [[Practical salinity unit|psu]] (10- to 30-day average and a spatial resolution of 200&amp;nbsp;km x 200&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "EGU2008-A-01922"&gt;Mecklenburg S, Kerr Y, Font J and Hahne A. [http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/01922/EGU2008-A-01922.pdf?PHPSESSID= ''The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Mission - An overview''].

Released 2012.|The first global map of oceanic surface salinity, produced by the SMOS satellite. The salinity varies from 32[[‰]] (deep purple) to 38[[‰]] (bright red).]]
Soil moisture is an important aspect of climate, and therefore [[forecasting]]. Plants transpire water from depths lower than 1 meter in many places and satellites like SMOS can only provide moisture content down to a few centimeters, but using repeated measurements in a day, the satellite can extrapolate soil moisture.&lt;ref name = "URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ESA Bulletin"/&gt;  The SMOS team of ESA hope to work with farmers around the world, including the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to use as ground-based calibration for models determining soil moisture, as it may help to better understand [[crop yield]]s over wide regions.&lt;ref name = "SD_080424152254"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080424152254.htm How Dry We Are: European Space Agency To Test Earth's Soil Moisture Via Satellite]-Science News, Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocean [[salinity]] is crucial to the understanding of the role of the ocean in climate through the global [[water cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The water cycle and Global Warming|url=http://www.whoi.edu/sbl/liteSite.do?litesiteid=18912&amp;articleId=35166|publisher=WHOI|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity in combination with temperature determine ocean circulation by defining its density and hence [[thermohaline circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High-latitude salinity effects and interhemispheric thermohaline circulations|url=http://wind.mit.edu/~jscott/AMOC/bryan_86.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ocean salinity is one of the variables that regulate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and release and therefore has an effect on the oceanic [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Cycle - NASA Science|url=https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/ocean-earth-system/ocean-carbon-cycle/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Information from SMOS is expected to help improve short and medium-term weather forecasts, and also have practical applications in areas such as agriculture and water resource management.  In addition, climate models should benefit from having a more precise picture of the scale and speed of movement of water in the different components of the hydrological cycle.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The SMOS satellite carries a new type of instrument called [[Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis]] (MIRAS). Some eight metres across, it has the look of helicopter rotor blades; the instrument creates images of radiation emitted in the [[microwave]] [[L-band]] (1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz).

The '''Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research''' is an academic honour awarded by the [[International Science Council]] (ISC), the [[University of Bergen]] and the [[European Consortium for Political Research]] (ECPR), in memory of the [[Political science|political scientist]] and [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Stein Rokkan]] (prior to the 2018 formation of the International Science Council from the merger of the [[International Social Science Council]] (ISSC) and the [[International Council for Science]], the prize was awarded by the International Social Science Council).&lt;ref name="ISC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Call for nominations: Stein Rokkan prize for comparative social science research|url=https://council.science/current/news/call-for-nominations-stein-rokkan-prize-for-comparative-social-science-research|website=International Science Council|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISSC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stein Rokkan|url=http://www.worldsocialscience.org/activities/scientific-prizes/stein-rokkan/|website=International Social Science Council|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is awarded to scholars making "a very substantial and original contribution in comparative social science research".&lt;ref name="ISC" /&gt; These contributions can be in the form of book-length, unpublished manuscripts, published books, or collections of works published no more than two years prior to the award year. The prize is awarded annually and is worth $5000.&lt;ref name="ISC" /&gt;

According to a reputation survey conducted in 2013 and 2014, the Stein Rokkan Prize is the second most prestigious international academic award in political science, after the [[Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|title=IREG List of International Academic Awards|publisher=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|location=Brussels|url=http://ireg-observatory.org/en/pdfy/IREG-list-academic-awards-EN.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Juntao|last2=Liu|first2=Niancai|title=Mapping of important international academic awards|journal=Scientometrics|date=2015|volume=104|pages=763-791|doi=10.1007/s11192-015-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reputation survey conducted in 2018 found the Stein Rokkan Prize to be the most prestigious interdisciplinary award in the social sciences (jointly with the [[Holberg Prize]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Fan|last2=Liu|first2=Niancai|title=The hierarchical status of international academic awards in social sciences|journal=Scientometrics|date=2018|doi=10.1007/s11192-018-2928-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ''' (informally '''Universidad San Francisco''', or simply '''USFQ''') is a [[liberal-arts]], [[non-profit]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}, [[private university]] located in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]. It was the first totally private self-financed university in Ecuador and the first liberal-arts institution in the [[Andes|Andean region]].&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq"&gt;Sobre la USFQ {{cite web |url=http://www.usfq.edu.ec/Paginas/SobreUSFQ.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501123205/http://www.usfq.edu.ec/Paginas/SobreUSFQ.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qstopuniversities"&gt;Universidad San Francisco de Quito @QSTopUniversities {{cite web |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/universidad-de-san-francisco-de-quito |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011160235/http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/universidad-de-san-francisco-de-quito |archivedate=2011-10-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Academically, USFQ ranks as one of the three-top universities (category A) in the ranking of Ecuadorian universities (being the only totally private university to qualify for the highest category), issued by the Ecuadorian Council of Evaluation and Accreditation of High Education ([[:es:Consejo Nacional de Evaluación y Acreditación de la Educación Superior del Ecuador|Consejo Nacional de Evaluación y Acreditación de la Educación Superior CONEA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vistazo.com/webpages/pais/?id=7926 |title=Calificación de las universidades según el CONEA |publisher=Vistazo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511085200/http://www.vistazo.com/webpages/pais/?id=7926 |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CONEA: sólo 11 Universidades tienen calificación "A" y 9 calificación "B" [http://www.eldiario.com.ec/noticias-manabi-ecuador/136020-conea-solo-11-universidades-tienen-calificacion-a-y-9-calificacion-b/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was ranked first in Ecuador in relation to the number of [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific publication]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, T. 2009. Ecuador produce pocas publicaciones científicas. Scidev.Net [http://www.scidev.net/es/news/ecuador-produce-pocas-publicaciones-cient-ficas.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

The university now enrolls 5,500 students, 4,500 of whom are undergraduates. The university each year has about 100 indigenous students and 1,000 international students participate in USFQ academic programs. USFQ has developed a scholarship program for indigenous students, offering full scholarships to the best students of public high schools throughout Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Weaver. 2008. Transforming universities: The expediency of interculturality for indigenous superior education in Ecuador. MS Thesis, Tulane University. https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=e6dkwYIabIYC&lt;/ref&gt; Although USFQ receives no funding from the government of Ecuador, its faculty comprises one-half of all the people in that nation who hold a doctorate.&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt;

The main campus of USFQ is located in Cumbayá, outside of [[Quito]] (capital city of [[Ecuador]]), where students use a library, education and research laboratories, classrooms, and seven restaurants. USFQ is the only university in the world that owns a campus in the [[Galapagos Islands]], and a campus in the [[Yasuni National Park|Yasuni]] [[Biosphere Reserve]] ([[Tiputini Biodiversity Station]]), one of Earth's most biodiverse areas.&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qstopuniversities" /&gt;

==History==
Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ was founded in 1988&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt; by the ''Corporación de Promoción Universitaria'', its umbrella non-profit foundation. It was the first totally private self-financed university in Ecuador. It was named after the city of [[Quito]]: San Francisco de Quito (not after the saint), in response to the need of a private [[higher education|higher-education]] institution in Ecuador. It was recognized by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador]] in October 1995 and accredited by [http://www.conesup.net CONESUP] in May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conesup.net/info_universidades.php?id_univ=1038]. conesup.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment of the ''Corporación de Promoción Universitaria''===
In 1980, a group of Ecuadorian and international intellectuals and businesspeople, under the leadership of Santiago Gangotena González, established the non-profit ''Corporación de Promoción Universitaria'', with the mission to create a private Ecuadorian university. The corporation was legalized by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador]] in June 1985 (published in the Official Registry of the Ecuadorian Government in 28 de June 1985).

===Foundation of the University===
After eight years of planning and promotion, the first class of USFQ students started on September 1, 1988, in a manor located on the 12 de Octubre Ave. 1983 and Salazar St.,in the northern area of [[Quito]], with 130 students. The university was recognized by the Ecuadorian government on October 18, 1995, under Executive Decree 3166, published in the Official Registry 809 on October 25, 1995. The statutes of the university were approved by the National Council of High Education [http://www.conesup.net CONESUP] on May 18, 2001.

===Creation of the colleges===
USFQ is divided among academic colleges ([[Faculty (division)|faculties]]). In 1988, students were distributed among three academic colleges: ''Colegio de Administración para el Desarrollo'' for business studies, ''Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas'' for applied sciences, and ''Colegio de Comunicación y Cultura'' for communication, arts and cultural studies. In 1990, USFQ started the ''Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales'' for environmental sciences.

In 1992, six colleges were established: ''Colegio de Administración para el Desarrollo'', ''Colegio de Comunicación y Artes'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades'', y ''Colegio de Lenguas''. Subsequently, in 1993, the ''Colegio de Arquitectura'' started, followed in 1994 by the ''Colegio de Agricultura'' and the ''Colegio de Ciencias de la Salud''. In 1997, the ''Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades'' changed its name to ''Colegio de Artes Liberales''.

===Colleges of the university===
By 2017, USFQ is divided in 15 academic colleges and institutes spread across three campuses across [[Ecuador]] ([[Quito|Cumbayá-Quito]], [[Tiputini Biodiversity Station]], and the [[Galápagos Islands]]&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt;):

In [[mathematics]], '''vague sets''' are an extension of [[fuzzy set]]s. 

In a fuzzy set, each object is assigned a single [[Value (mathematics)|value]] in the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,1] reflecting its ''grade of [[Element (mathematics)|membership]]''. This [[Single-valued function|single value]] does not allow a separation of [[Mathematical proof|evidence]] for membership and evidence against membership. 

Gau et al.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=229476&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D229476 "Vague sets"].&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the notion of vague sets, where each object is characterized by two different membership [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]: a true membership function and a false membership function.
This kind of reasoning is also called interval membership, as opposed to point membership in the context of fuzzy sets.

==Mathematical definition==
A vague set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is characterized by
* its true membership function &lt;math&gt;t_v(x)&lt;/math&gt;
* its false membership function &lt;math&gt;f_v(x)&lt;/math&gt;
* with &lt;math&gt;0 \le t_v(x)+f_v(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

The ''grade of membership'' for x is not a crisp value anymore, but can be located in &lt;math&gt;[t_v(x), 1-f_v(x)]&lt;/math&gt;. This interval can be interpreted as an extension to the fuzzy membership function. The vague set degrades to a fuzzy set, if &lt;math&gt;1-f_v(x)=t_v(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all x.
The ''uncertainty'' of x is the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the membership interval; it can be computed as &lt;math&gt;(1-f_v(x))-t_v(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47045">The '''Vienna Circle''' ({{lang-de|Wiener Kreis}}) of [[Logical Empiricism]] was a group of [[philosopher]]s and [[scientist]]s drawn from the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[Social Sciences|social sciences]], [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] who met regularly from 1924 to 1936 at the [[University of Vienna]], chaired by [[Moritz Schlick]].

[[File:Eingang Mathematisches Kolloquium.TIF|thumb|Entrance to the Mathematical Seminar at the [[University of Vienna]], Boltzmanngasse 5. Meeting place of the Vienna Circle.]]

==Overview==
Among the members of the inner circle were [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], [[Philipp Frank]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Herbert Feigl]], [[Richard von Mises]], [[Karl Menger]], [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Felix Kaufmann]], [[Viktor Kraft]] and [[Edgar Zilsel]]. In addition, the Vienna Circle was occasionally visited by [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Alfred Jules Ayer]], [[Oskar Morgenstern]]&lt;ref&gt;Oskar Morgenstern: ''The Collaboration Between Oskar Morgenstern and John von Neumann on the Theory of Games''. In: ''Journal of Economic Literature'', 14(3), 1976, p. 806.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank P. Ramsey]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. the partition into "inner circle" and "periphery" in Stadler 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]] were in close contact to the Vienna Circle, but never participated in the meetings of the Schlick Circle.&lt;ref&gt;From 1926 to 1933 there were occasional meetings of Wittgenstein with Schlick, Waismann, Carnap and Feigl. Cp. Stadler 2001, chapter on "Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle", 422–441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Popper and the Vienna Circle, cp. Stadler 2001, 453–473.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical position of the Vienna Circle was called [[logical empiricism]] (German: ''logischer Empirismus''), [[logical positivism]] or [[neopositivism]]. It was influenced by [[Ernst Mach]], [[David Hilbert]], French [[conventionalism]] ([[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Pierre Duhem]]), [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Albert Einstein]]. The Vienna Circle was pluralistic and committed to the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. It was unified by the aim of making philosophy scientific with the help of modern [[logic]]. Main topics were foundational debates in the natural and social sciences, logic and mathematics; the modernization of [[empiricism]] by modern logic; the search for an empiricist criterion of meaning; the critique of [[metaphysics]] and the unification of the sciences in the [[unity of science]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Stöltzner/Uebel 2006, LII-LXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vienna Circle appeared in public with the publication of various book series – ''Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung'' (''Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception''), ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science'') and the journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]'' – and the organization of international conferences in [[Prague]]; [[Königsberg]] (today known as [[Kaliningrad]]); [[Paris]]; [[Copenhagen]]; [[Cambridge]], UK, and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Its public profile was provided by the ''Ernst Mach Society'' (German: ''Verein Ernst Mach'') through which members of the Vienna Circle sought to popularize their ideas in the context of programmes for national education in Vienna.

During the era of [[Austrofascism]] and after the [[annexation of Austria]] by [[Nazi Germany]] most members of the Vienna Circle were forced to emigrate. The murder of Schlick in 1936 by a former student put an end to the Vienna Circle in Austria.

The Vienna Circle's influence on [[20th-century philosophy]], especially [[philosophy of science]] and [[analytic philosophy]], is immense up to the present day.

The history and development of the Vienna Circle shows various stages:&lt;ref&gt;Cp. the phases in Stadler 2001. See 579–580 for an overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "First Vienna Circle" (1907–1912) ===
The pre-history of the Vienna Circle began with meetings on the [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]] from 1908&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein's Vienna, New Edition, Elephant Paperback, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; on, promoted by [[Philipp Frank]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and [[Otto Neurath]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Frank 1949, Stadler 2001, Uebel 2000. The expression goes back to Rudolf Haller, "Der erste Wiener Kreis", in: ''Fragen zu Wittgenstein und Aufsätze zur Österreichischen Philosophie'', Amsterdam 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], the oldest of the three (1879–1934), was a mathematician. He received his degree in [[mathematics]] in 1902. Afterwards he studied under the direction of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in Vienna and [[David Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]] in [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. In 1905 he received the [[Habilitation]] in mathematics. He taught at [[Innsbruck]] (1905–1906) and [[Vienna]] (from 1909).

[[Otto Neurath]] (1882–1945) studied [[mathematics]], [[political economy]], and [[history]] in Vienna and Berlin. From 1907 to 1914 he taught in Vienna at the [[Neue Wiener Handelsakademie]] (Viennese Commercial Academy). Neurath married Olga, Hahn's sister, in 1911.

[[Philipp Frank]], the youngest of the group (1884–1966), studied [[physics]] at Göttingen and Vienna with Ludwig Boltzmann, David Hilbert and Felix Klein. From 1912, he held the chair of [[theoretical physics]] in the [[German University in Prague]].

Their meetings were held in Viennese coffeehouses from 1907 onward. Frank remembered:

{{quotation|After 1910 there began in Vienna a movement which regarded Mach's [[positivist]] philosophy of science as having great importance for general intellectual life [...] An attempt was made by a group of young men to retain the most essential points of Mach's positivism, especially his stand against the misuse of [[metaphysics]] in science. [...] To this group belonged the mathematician H. Hahn, the political economist Otto Neurath, and the author of this book [i.e. Frank], at the time an instructor in [[theoretical physics]] in Vienna. [...] We tried to supplement Mach's ideas by those of the French philosophy of science of [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Pierre Duhem]], and also to connect them with the investigations in [[logic]] of such authors as [[Louis Couturat|Couturat]], [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]], Hilbert, etc.|Uebel, Thomas, 2003, p. 70.}}

A number of further authors were discussed in the meetings such as [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]], [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]], [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]], [[Husserl]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], [[Lenin]] and [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Stadler 2001, 143–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presumably the meetings stopped in 1912, when Frank went to [[Prague]], to hold the chair of theoretical physics left vacant by [[Albert Einstein]]. Hahn left Vienna during [[World War I]] and returned in 1921.

=== The formative years (1918–1924) ===
The formation of the Vienna Circle began with Hahn returning to Vienna in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 195–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the mathematician [[Kurt Reidemeister]] he organized seminars on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Tractatus logico-philosophicus]]'' and on Whitehead and Russell's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.

With the support of Hahn, [[Moritz Schlick]] was appointed to the chair of philosophy of the inductive sciences at the University of Vienna in 1922 – the chair formerly held by [[Ernst Mach]] and partly by [[Boltzmann]]. Schlick had already published two important works ''Raum und Zeit in die gegenwärtigen Physik'' (''Space and Time in contemporary Physics'') in 1917 and ''Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre'' (''General Theory of Knowledge'') in 1918.

Immediately after Schlick's arrival in Vienna, he organized discussions with the mathematicians around Hahn. In 1924 Schlick's students [[Friedrich Waismann]] and [[Herbert Feigl]] suggested to their teacher a sort of regular "evening circle". From winter term 1924 on regular meetings were held at the Institute of Mathematics in Vienna's Boltzmanngasse 5 on personal invitation by Schlick. These discussions can be seen as the beginning of the Vienna Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The non-public phase of the Vienna Circle – The Schlick Circle (1924–1928) ===
The group that met from 1924 on was quite diverse and included not only recognized scientists such as Schlick, Hahn, Kraft, Philipp Frank, Neurath, [[Olga Hahn-Neurath]], and [[Heinrich Gomperz]], but also younger students and doctoral candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 199–218.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the group invited foreign visitors.
 
In 1926 Schlick and Hahn arranged to bring [[Rudolf Carnap]] to the University of Vienna as a ''Privatdozent'' (private lecturer). Carnap's ''Logical Structure of the World'' was intensely discussed in the Circle.

Also Wittgenstein's ''Tractatus logico-philosophicus'' was read out loud and discussed. From 1927 on personal meetings were arranged between Wittgenstein and Schlick, Waismann, Carnap and Feigl.&lt;ref&gt;For the recording of these meetings see Brian McGuinness, ''Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle: Conversations Recorded by Friedrich Waismann.'' Trans. by Joachim Schulte and Brian McGuinness. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The public phase – Schlick Circle and ''Verein Ernst Mach'' (1928–1934) ===
In 1928 the ''Verein Ernst Mach'' (''Ernst Mach Society'') was founded, with Schlick as its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 219–290.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the society was the spreading of a "scientific world conception" through public lectures that were in large part held by members of the Vienna Circle.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the lectures of the ''Ernst Mach Society'' 1929–1932 see Stadler 2001, 342–344.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the Vienna Circle made its first public appearance under this name – invented by Neurath&lt;ref&gt;Frank 1949, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; – with the publication of its manifesto ''Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung. Der Wiener Kreis'' (''The Scientific Conception of the World. The Vienna Circle'' also known as ''Viewing the World Scientifically: The Vienna Circle''&lt;ref name="Edmunds, D 2001, page 151"&gt;Edmunds, D. and Eidenow, J. ''Wittgenstein's Poker: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers,'' 2001, page 151.&lt;/ref&gt;) The pamphlet is dedicated to Schlick, and its preface was signed by Hahn, Neurath and Carnap.

The manifesto was presented at the ''Tagung für Erkenntnislehre der exakten Wissenschaften'' (''Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences'') in autumn 1929, organized by the Vienna Circle together with the [[Berlin Circle]]. This conference was the first international appearance of [[logical empiricism]] and the first of a number of conferences: [[Königsberg]] (1930), [[Prague]] (1934), [[Paris]] (1935), [[Copenhague]] (1936), [[Cambridge]], UK (1938), [[Cambridge, Mass.]] (1939), and [[Chicago]] (1941).

While primarily known for its views on the natural sciences and metaphysics, the public phase of the Vienna Circle was explicitly political. Neurath and Schlick were both [[socialism|socialists]] and believed the rejection of magic was a necessary component for liberation of the working classes. The manifesto linked [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to their political and anti-metaphysical views, indicating a blur between what are now considered two separate schools of contemporary philosophy - [[analytic philosophy]] and [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 246-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Society took over the journal ''Annalen der Philosophie'' and made it the main journal of logical empiricism under the title ''[[Erkenntnis]]'', edited by Carnap and Reichenbach. In addition, the Vienna Circle published a number of book series: ''Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung'' (''Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception'', ed. by Schlick und Frank, 1928–1937),&lt;ref&gt;In 1934 Karl Popper's ''Logic of Scientific Discovery'' was published in this series.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science'', edited by Neurath, 1933–1939), and later the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]'' (edited by Neurath, Carnap and [[Charles W. Morris]], 1938–1970).

=== Disintegration, emigration, internationalization (1934–1938) ===
Since the beginning of the 1930s first signs of disintegration appeared for political and [[racist]] reasons: [[Herbert Feigl]] left Austria in 1930. Carnap was appointed to a chair at [[Prague University]] in 1931 and left for Chicago in 1935.

1934 marks an important break: Hahn died after surgery, Neurath fled to Holland because of the victory of [[Austrofascism]] in the [[Austrian Civil War]] following which the ''Ernst Mach Society'' was dissolved for political reasons by the [[Schuschnigg]] regime.

The murder of Moritz Schlick by the former student [[Hans Nelböck]] for political and personal reasons in 1936 set an end to the meetings of the Schlick Circle.&lt;ref&gt;For documents concerning the murder of Moritz Schlick and the trial against Nelböck see Stadler 2001, 869–909.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the circle such as Kraft, Waismann, Zilsel, Menger and Gomperz continued to meet occasionally. But the [[annexation of Austria]] to [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938 meant the definite end of the activities of the Vienna Circle in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Only after the war in 1949 arose the ''[[Kraft Circle]]'' in Vienna, a successor to the Vienna Circle, under the leadership of Viktor Kraft, a former member of the Vienna Circle. Among the members of this circle was [[Paul Feyerabend]].&lt;/ref&gt;

With the emigration went along the internationalization of [[logical empiricism]]. Many former members of the Vienna Circle and the [[Berlin Circle]] emigrated to the [[English-speaking world]] where they had an immense influence on the development of [[philosophy of science]]. The [[unity of science]] movement for the construction of an ''International Encyclopedia of Unified Science'', promoted mainly by Neurath, Carnap, and Morris, is symptomatic of the internationalization of logical empiricism, organizing numerous international conferences and the publication of the ''International Encyclopedia of Unified Science''.&lt;ref&gt;For a chronology of the emigration of the Vienna Circle see Hans-Joachim Dahms, "The Emigration of the Vienna Circle", in: Friedrich Stadler, Peter Weibel (ed.), ''The Cultural Exodus from Austria'', Vienna 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overview of the members of the Vienna Circle ===
Apart from the central figures of the Schlick Circle the question of membership in the Vienna Circle is in many cases unsettled. The partition into "members" and "those sympathetic to the Vienna Circle" produced in the manifesto from 1929 is representative only of a specific moment in the development of the Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Stöltzner and Uebel 2006, XX.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the criteria used (regular attendance, philosophical affinities etc.) there are different possible distributions in "inner circle" and "periphery".

In the following list (in alphabetical order), the "inner circle" is defined using the criterion of regular attendance. The "periphery" comprises occasional visitors, foreign visitors and leading intellectual figures who stood in regular contact with the Circle (such as Wittgenstein and Popper).&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Stadler 2001, 573. This list follows the presentation in Stadler 2001, 571ff., including further bio-bibliographical information on all the persons listed.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inner Circle:''' [[Gustav Bergmann]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Herbert Feigl]], [[Philipp Frank]], [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], [[Olga Hahn-Neurath]], [[Béla Juhos]], [[Felix Kaufmann]], [[Victor Kraft]], [[Karl Menger]], [[Richard von Mises]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Rose Rand]], [[Josef Schächter]], [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Edgar Zilsel]].

'''Periphery:''' [[Alfred Jules Ayer]], [[Egon Brunswik]], [[Karl Bühler]], [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]], [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik]], [[Heinrich Gomperz]], [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Eino Kaila]], [[Hans Kelsen]], [[Charles W. Morris]], [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]], [[Karl Raimund Popper]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Frank P. Ramsey]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Kurt Reidemeister]], [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Olga Taussky-Todd]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

===Reception in the United States and the United Kingdom===
The spread of [[logical positivism]] in the United States occurred throughout the 1920s and 1930s. In 1929 and in 1932, Schlick was a Visiting Professor at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], while Feigl, who immigrated to the United States in 1930, became lecturer (1931) and professor (1933) at the [[University of Iowa]]. The definite diffusion of logical positivism in the United States was due to Carl Hempel, Hans Reichenbach, Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, and Herbert Feigl, who emigrated and taught in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;E. Nagel, "Nature and Convention" in: ''The Journal of Philosophy'', 26, 1929, in which Nagel discussed Reichenbach's interpretation of the theory of relativity;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Hook, "Personal Impression of Contemporary German Philosophy" in: ''The Journal of Philosophy'', 27, 1930, in which Hook presented a favorable report on logical positivism;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.&amp;nbsp;E. Blumberg and H. Feigl, "Logical Positivism: A New Movement in European Philosophy" in: ''The Journal of Philosophy'', 28, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another link to the United States is [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], who traveled in 1932 and 1933 as a Sheldon Traveling Fellow to [[Vienna]], [[Prague]], and [[Warsaw]]. Moreover, American [[semiotician]] and philosopher [[Charles W. Morris]] helped many German and Austrian philosophers emigrate to the United States, including Rudolf Carnap, in 1936.

In the United Kingdom it was [[Alfred Jules Ayer]] who acquainted the British academia with the work of the Vienna Circle with his book ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936). [[Karl Popper]] was also important for the reception and critique of their work, even though he never participated in the meetings of the Vienna Circle.

==Topics and debates==
The Vienna Circle cannot be assigned ''one'' single philosophy. First, there existed a plurality of philosophical positions within the Circle, and second, members often changed their views fundamentally in the course of time and in reaction to discussions in the Circle. It thus seems more convenient to speak of "the philosophies (in the plural) of the Vienna Circle".&lt;ref&gt;Cp. [[Thomas Uebel]], "Vienna Circle", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/vienna-circle/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some central topics and debates can be identified.

===The Manifesto (1929)===
This states the scientific world-conception of the Vienna Circle, which is characterized "essentially by two features.&lt;ref&gt;On the historical background of the manifesto see Stadler 2001, 334–339.&lt;/ref&gt; First it is [[empiricism|empiricist]] and positivist: there is knowledge only from experience. Second, the scientific world-conception is marked by the application of a certain method, namely [[logic|logical analysis]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Scientific Conception of the World. The Vienna Circle'' in Sarkar, Sahotra, 1996, p. 331—hereinafter ''VC''&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical analysis is the method of clarification of philosophical problems; it makes an extensive use of [[symbolic logic]] and distinguishes the Vienna Circle empiricism from earlier versions. The task of philosophy lies in the clarification—through the method of logical analysis—of problems and assertions.

Logical analysis shows that there are two different kinds of statements; one kind includes statements reducible to simpler statements about the empirically given; the other kind includes statements which cannot be reduced to statements about [[experience]] and thus they are devoid of meaning. [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] statements belong to this second kind and therefore they are meaningless. Hence many philosophical problems are rejected as pseudo-problems which arise from logical mistakes, while others are re-interpreted as empirical statements and thus become the subject of scientific inquiries.

One source of the logical mistakes that are at the origins of metaphysics is the ambiguity of natural [[language]]. "Ordinary language for instance uses the same [[part of speech]], the substantive, for [[object (philosophy)|thing]]s ('apple') as well as for [[Quality (philosophy)|qualities]] ('hardness'), relations ('friendship'), and processes ('sleep'); therefore it misleads one into a thing-like conception of functional [[concept]]s".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of mistakes is "the notion that ''thinking'' can either lead to knowledge out of its own resources without using any empirical material, or at least arrive at new contents by an [[inference]] from given states of affair".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; [[synthetic proposition|Synthetic knowledge]] a priori is rejected by the Vienna Circle. Mathematics, which at a first sight seems an example of necessarily valid synthetic knowledge derived from pure [[reason]] alone, has instead a [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] character, that is its statements are [[analytic proposition|analytical statements]], thus very different from Kantian synthetic statements. The only two kinds of statements accepted by the Vienna Circle are synthetic statements ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' (i.e., scientific statements) and analytic statements ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' (i.e., logical and mathematical statements).

However, the persistence of metaphysics is connected not only with logical mistakes but also with "social and economical struggles".&lt;ref name="Vc"&gt;''VC'' p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysics and [[theology]] are allied to traditional social forms, while the group of people who "faces modern times, rejects these views and takes its stand on the ground of empirical sciences".&lt;ref name="Vc" /&gt; Thus the struggle between metaphysics and [[science|scientific world-conception]] is not only a struggle between different kinds of philosophies, but it is also—and perhaps primarily—a struggle between different political, social, and economical attitudes. Of course, as the manifesto itself acknowledged, "not every adherent of the scientific world-conception will be a fighter".&lt;ref&gt;VC p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians of the Vienna Circle see in the latter sentence an implicit reference to a contrast between the so-called 'left wing' of the Vienna Circle, mainly represented by Neurath and Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. The aim of the left wing was to facilitate the penetration of the scientific world-conception in "the forms of personal and public life, in [[education]], upbringing, [[architecture]], and the shaping of economic and social life".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 339–340&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Schlick was primarily interested in the theoretical study of science and philosophy. Perhaps the sentence "Some, glad of solitude, will lead a withdrawn existence on the icy slopes of logic" is an ironic reference to Schlick.&lt;ref name="Vc" /&gt;

The manifesto lists [[Walter Dubislav]], [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]], [[Kurt Grelling]], Hasso Härlen, [[Eino Kaila]], Heinrich Loewy, [[F.&amp;nbsp;P. Ramsey]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Kurt Reidemeister]], and [[Edgar Zilsel]] as people "sympathetic to the Vienna Circle" and [[Albert Einstein]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] as its "leading representatives".

===Unified science===
{{See also|Unity of science}}
The final goal pursued by the Vienna Circle was [[Unified Science|unified science]], that is the construction of a "constitutive system" in which every legitimate statement is reduced to the concepts of lower level which refer directly to the given [[experience]]. "The endeavour is to link and harmonise the achievements of individual investigators in their various fields of science".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; From this aim follows the search for clarity, neatness, and for a symbolic language that eliminates the problems arising from the ambiguity of natural language. The Vienna Circle published a collection, called ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science''), edited by Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, Otto Neurath, [[Joergen Joergensen]] (after Hahn's death) and [[Charles W. Morris]] (from 1938), whose aim was to present a unified vision of science. After the publication in [[Europe]] of seven monographs from 1933 to 1939, the collection was dismissed, because of the problems arising from the [[World War II]]. In 1938 a new series of publications started in the United States. It was the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]'', an ambitious project never completed devoted to unified science. Only the first section ''Foundations of the Unity of Sciences'' was published; it contains two volumes for a total of twenty monographs published from 1938 to 1969. As remembered by Rudolf Carnap and Charles Morris in the ''Preface'' to the 1969 edition of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science:

{{quotation|The ''Encyclopedia'' was in origin the idea of Otto Neurath. It was meant as a manifestation of the unity of science movement [...] Original plans for the Encyclopedia were ambitious. In addition to the two introductory volumes, there was to be a section on the methodology of the sciences, one on the existing state of the unification of sciences, and possibly a section on the application of the sciences. It was planned that the work in its entirety would comprise about twenty-six volumes (260 monographs)|''Foundations of the Unity of Sciences'', vol. 1, The University of Chicago Press, 1969, p. vii.}}

[[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well known work, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', was published in this Encyclopedia in 1962, as the number two in the second volume.

===Critique of metaphysics&lt;!--linked from 'Template:Positivism'--&gt;===
The attitude of Vienna Circle towards metaphysics is well expressed by Carnap in the article 'Überwindung der Metaphysik durch Logische Analyse der Sprache' in ''Erkenntnis'', vol. 2, 1932 (English translation 'The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language' in Sarkar, Sahotra, ed., ''Logical empiricism at its peak: Schlick, Carnap, and Neurath'', New York : Garland Pub., 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;10–31). A language—says Carnap—consists of a [[vocabulary]], i.e., a set of meaningful words, and a [[syntax]], i.e., a set of rules governing the formation of sentences from the words of the vocabulary. Pseudo-statements, i.e., sequences of words that at first sight resemble statements but in reality have no meaning, are formed in two ways: either meaningless words occur in them, or they are formed in an invalid syntactical way. According to Carnap, pseudo-statements of both kinds occur in metaphysics.

A word ''W'' has a meaning if two conditions are satisfied. First, the mode of the occurrence of ''W'' in its elementary sentence form (i.e., the simplest sentence form in which ''W'' is capable of occurring) must be fixed. Secondly, if ''W'' occurs in an elementary sentence ''S'', it is necessary to give an answer to the following questions (that are—according to Carnap—equivalent formulation of the same question):
* What [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s is ''S'' deducible from, and what sentences are deducible from ''S''?
* Under what conditions is ''S'' supposed to be true, and under what conditions false?
* How is ''S'' verified?
* What is the meaning of ''S''?
(Carnap, "The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language" in Sarkar, Sahotra 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;12)

An example offered by Carnap concerns the word '[[arthropod]]'. The sentence form "the thing ''x'' is an arthropod" is an elementary sentence form that is derivable from "''x'' is an animal", "''x'' has a segmented body" and "''x'' has jointed legs". Conversely, these sentences are derivable from "the thing ''x'' is an arthropod". Thus the meaning of the word 'arthropod' is determined.

According to Carnap, many words of metaphysics do not fulfill these requirements and thus they are meaningless. As an example, Carnap considers the word 'principle'. This word has a definite meaning, if the sentence "''x'' is the principle of ''y''" is supposed to be equivalent to the sentence "''y'' exists by virtue of ''x''" or "''y'' arises out of ''x''". The latter sentence is perfectly clear: ''y'' arises out of ''x'' when ''x'' is invariably followed by ''y'', and the invariable association between ''x'' and ''y'' is empirically verifiable. But—says Carnap—metaphysicians are not satisfied with this interpretation of the meaning of 'principle'. They assert that no empirical relation between ''x'' and ''y'' can completely explain the meaning of "''x'' is the principle of ''y''", because there is something that cannot be grasped by means of the experience, something for which no empirical criterion can be specified. It is the lacking of any empirical criterion—says Carnap—that deprives of meaning the word 'principle' when it occurs in metaphysics. Therefore, metaphysical pseudo-statements such as "water is the principle of the world" or "the spirit is the principle of the world" are void of meaning because a meaningless word occurs in them.

However, there are pseudo-statements in which occur only meaningful words; these pseudo-statements are formed in a counter-syntactical way. An example is the word sequence "Caesar is a [[prime number]]"; every word has a definite meaning, but the sequence has no meaning. The problem is that "prime number" is a predicate of numbers, not a predicate of human beings. In the example the nonsense is evident; however, in natural language the rules of grammar do not prohibit the formation of analogous meaningless word sequences that are not so easily detectable. In the grammar of natural languages, every sequence of the kind "''x'' is ''y''", where ''x'' is a noun and ''y'' is a predicate, is acceptable. In fact, in the grammar there is no distinction between predicate which can be affirmed of human beings and predicate which can be affirmed of numbers. So "Caesar is a general" and "Caesar is a prime number" are both well-formed, in contrast for example with "Caesar is and", which is ill-formed. In a logically constructed language—says Carnap—a distinction between the various kinds of predicate is specified, and pseudo-statements as "Caesar is a prime number" are ill-formed. Now, and this is the main point of Carnap's argument, metaphysical statements in which meaningless words do not occur, are indeed meaningless because they are formed in a way which is admissible in natural languages, but not in logically constructed languages. Carnap attempts to indicate the most frequent sources of errors from which metaphysical pseudo-statements can arise. One source of mistakes is the ambiguity of the verb "to be", which is sometimes used as a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] ("I am hungry"), and sometimes to designate existence ("I am"). The latter statement incorrectly suggests a predicative form, and thus it suggests that existence is a predicate. Only modern logic, with the introduction of an explicit sign to designate existence (the sign &lt;math&gt;\exists \;&lt;/math&gt;), which occurs only in statements such as &lt;math&gt;\exists \;xP(x)&lt;/math&gt;, never as a predicate, has shown that existence is not a predicate, and thus has revealed the logical error from which pseudo-statements such as "cogito, ergo sum" has arisen.

Another source of mistakes is type confusions, in which a predicate of a kind is used as a predicate of another kind. For example, the pseudo-statements "we know the Nothing" is analogous to "we know the rain", but while the latter is well-formed, the former is ill-formed, at least in a logically constructed language, because "Nothing" is incorrectly used as a [[noun]]. In a formal language, "Nothing" only means &lt;math&gt;\lnot \;\exists \;x&lt;/math&gt;, such as "there is nothing which is outside"—i.e., &lt;math&gt;\lnot \;\exists \;xO(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus "Nothing" never occurs as a noun or as a predicate.

According to Carnap, although metaphysics has no theoretical content, it does have content: metaphysical pseudo-statements express the attitude of a person towards life, and this is the role of metaphysics. He compares it to an art like lyrical poetry; the metaphysician works with the medium of the theoretical; he confuses art with science, attitude towards life with knowledge, and thus produces an unsatisfactory and inadequate work. "Metaphysicians are musicians without musical ability".&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, 'The Elimination of Metaphysics', in Sarkar, Sahotra 1996, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congresses and publications&lt;!--This section is linked from [[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]: do not rename without including an anchor to previous name ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
{{See also|International Encyclopedia of Unified Science#International Congresses for the Unity of Science}}
The Vienna Circle was very active in advertising their new philosophical ideas. Several congresses on [[epistemology]] and philosophy of science were organized, with the help of the [[Berlin Circle]]. There were some preparatory congresses: Prague (1929), [[Königsberg]] (1930), Prague (1934) and then the first congress on scientific philosophy held in [[Paris]] (1935), followed by congresses in [[Copenhagen]] (1936), Paris (1937), [[Cambridge]], UK (1938), [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. (1939). The Königsberg congress (1930) was very important, for Kurt Gödel announced that he had proven the [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness]] of [[first-order logic]] and the [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness]] of formal [[arithmetic]]. Another very interesting congress was the one held in Copenhagen (1936), which was dedicated to [[quantum physics]] and [[causality]].

Between 1928 and 1937, the Vienna Circle published ten books in a collection named ''Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung'' (''Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception''), edited by Schlick and Frank. [[Karl Raimund Popper]]'s book ''Logik der Forschung'' was published in this collection. Seven works were published in another collection, called ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science''). In 1930 Rudolf Carnap and Hans Reichenbach undertook the editorship of the journal ''Erkenntnis'', which was published between 1930 and 1940 (from 1939 the editors were Otto Neurath, Rudolf Carnap and Charles Morris).

The following is the list of works published in the two collections edited by the Vienna Circle.

==Institute Vienna Circle==
In 1991 the [[Institute Vienna Circle]] was established in Vienna. It is dedicated to studying the work and influence of the Vienna Circle. In 2011 it was integrated in the [[University of Vienna]] as a subunit of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education. In 2015 the Institute co-organized an exhibition on the Vienna Circle in the main building of the University of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/exhibitionViennaCircle/exhibitionViennaCircle/exhibition.html|title=Exhibition|website=www.univie.ac.at|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Walter Wilson Greg''' (9 July 1875 &amp;ndash; 4 March 1959), known professionally as '''W. W. Greg''', was one of the leading bibliographers and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] scholars of the 20th century.

==Family and education==

Greg was born at [[Wimbledon and Putney Commons|Wimbledon Common]] in 1875. His father, [[William Rathbone Greg]], was an essayist; his mother was the daughter of [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]]. As a child, Greg was expected one day to assume editorship of ''[[The Economist]]'', which his grandfather had founded in 1843; Greg was educated at [[Wixenford School|Wixenford]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=GRG894WW|name=Greg, Walter Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Cambridge he met [[Ronald Brunlees McKerrow|Ronald McKerrow]], whose friendship helped shape Greg's decision to pursue a career in literature. While still in school he compiled a list of Renaissance plays printed before 1700, and he joined the [[Bibliographical Society]] the same year. He was President of the Society from 1930 to 1932&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/about/presidents Past Presidents of The Bibliographical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; and received its Gold Medal in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/about/gold-medalists Gold Medalists of The Bibliographical Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127022846/http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/about/gold-medalists |date=2014-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

After school, Greg settled into a life of steady productivity, while living on the proceeds of his shares of ''The Economist''. Working in close association with [[A. H. Bullen]], he produced ''Pastoral Poetry and Pastoral Drama'' (1906), the first edited version of the account books of [[Philip Henslowe]] (1906–8) and the papers of [[Edward Alleyn]]. The latter two works provided him with a knowledge of Renaissance theatrical conditions perhaps rivaled only by [[E. K. Chambers]], and this knowledge he applied to the publications of the [[Malone Society]], which he served as general editor between 1906 and 1939. He served as Librarian of Trinity College, 1907–13, resigning after his marriage to his cousin Elizabeth Gaskell. As an independent scholar,  Greg produced editions of ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1910),  [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]]'s ''Orlando Furioso'' and [[George Peele]]'s ''[[The Battle of Alcazar]]'' (published together, 1923), and ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]'' (1911). He returned to specific editing with work on ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (1950). Greg also wrote on the material conditions of [[English Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theater]] and publishing; his work in this regard includes ''Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses'' (1931) and ''English Literary Autographs, 1550–1650'' (1932). ''The Variants in the First Quarto of King Lear'' (1940) offered a careful examination of this printing. He also wrote hundreds of reviews, including a notably caustic rejection of [[J. Churton Collins]]'s 1905 Oxford edition of Robert Greene.

At the beginning of [[World War II]], Greg moved to [[Sussex]], where he spent the war working on his edition of ''Faustus.'' In addition, he began to prepare his great works of the 1950s: ''The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare'' (1951), ''The Shakespeare First Folio: Its Bibliographical and Textual History'' (1955), ''Some Aspects and Problems of London Publishing, 1550–1650'' (1954), and the essay "The rationale of copy-text" (1950), which had a significant influence on [[textual criticism]]. He was Lyell Reader in Bibliography at Oxford University, 1954–5. Greg was knighted in 1950.

Greg was strongly associated with [[Alfred W. Pollard]] in developing a modern understanding of the transmission of Shakespeare's texts. His greatest achievement{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} is ''A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration,'' published in four volumes between 1939 and 1959.
