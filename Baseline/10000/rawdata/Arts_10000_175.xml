      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">"'''A Dialogue between Joseph Smith and the Devil'''" (or "'''Joe Smith and the Devil'''") is an 1844 short story by [[Parley P. Pratt]], generally credited as the first work of [[LDS_fiction#Foundations, 1830–1880|Mormon fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V15N03_15.pdf Parley P. Pratt: Father of Mormon Pamphleteering]" by Peter Crawley, ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]''. Accessed April 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A piece of [[closet drama]], "Dialogue" begins with [[the devil]] putting up [[handbills]]:
{{cquote|All the liars, swindlers, thieves, robbers, incendiaries, murderers, cheats, adulterers, harlots, blackguards, gamblers, bogus makers, idlers, busy bodies, pickpockets, vagabonds, filthy persons, and all other infidels and rebellious, disorderly persons, for a crusade against Joe Smith and the Mormons! Be quick, be quick, I say or our cause will be ruined and our kingdom overthrown by the d----d fool of an imposter and his associates, for even now all earth and hell is in a stew.}}

They engage in a conversation which manages wit while still engaging in Pratt's proselytory purposes.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/045-14-17.pdf The Humor of Mormon Seriousness: A Celestial Balancing Act]" by [[Richard H. Cracroft]], ''[[Sunstone Magazine]]''. Accessed April 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The two part on friendly terms:

{{cquote|Devil: (Holding up glass) Come, Mr. Smith, your good health. I propose we offer a toast.

Smith: Well proceed.

Devil: Here's to my good friend, Joe Smith, may all sorts of ill-luck befall him, and may he never be suffered to enter my kingdom, either in time or eternity, for he would almost make me forget that I am a devil, and make a gentleman of me, while he gently overthrows my government at the same time that he wins my friendship.

Smith: Here to his Satanic Majesty; may he be driven from the earth and be forced to put to sea in a stone canoe with an iron paddle, and may the canoe sink, and a shark swallow the canoe and its royal freight and an alligator swallow the shark and may the alligator be bound in the northwest corner of hell, the door be locked, key lost, and a blind man hunting for it.}}

The story first appeared on the front page of the ''[[New York Herald]]'', August 25, 1844.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.motleyvision.org/2009/happy-birthday-mormon-fiction/ Happy Birthday, Mormon Fiction]" by [[Kent Larsen]], ''[[A Motley Vision]]'', August 25, 2009; accessed April 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2196">An '''adaptation''' is a transfer of a work of art from one medium to another.

Some common examples are:
* [[Film adaptation]], a story from another work, adapted into a [[film]] (it may be a novel, non-fiction like journalism, autobiography, comic books, scriptures, plays or historical sources)
* [[Literary adaptation]], a story from a literary source, adapted into another work{{cn|date=March 2018}}
* [[Theatrical adaptation]], a story from another work, adapted into a [[play (theatre)|play]]

There is, however, no end to potential media involved in adaptation. Adaptation is the practice of transcoding (changing the code or 'language' used in a medium) as well as the assimilation of a work of art to other cultural, linguistic, semiotic, aesthetic or other norms. Recent approaches to the expanding field Adaptation Studies reflect these expansion of our perspective. Adaptation occurs as a special case of intertextual and intermedial exchange and the copy-paste culture of digital technologies has produced "new intertextual forms engendered by emerging technologies—mashups, remixes, reboots, samplings, remodelings, transformations— " that "further develop the impulse to adapt and appropriate, and the ways in which they challenge the theory and practice of adaptation and appropriation."&lt;ref&gt;Voigts, Eckart. "Memes and Recombinant Appropriation: Remix, Mashup, Parody" in Thomas Leitch (ed.) ''Oxford Handbook of Adaptation Studies.'' Oxford: OUP, 2017. http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199331000.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199331000-e-16&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7418">'''Anxiety of Influence''' is a type of [[literary criticism]] established by [[Harold Bloom]] in 1973, in his book, ''[[The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry]]''. It refers to the psychological struggle of aspiring authors to overcome the anxiety posed by the influence of their literary antecedents.

== Theory ==

The theory of anxiety of influence is a theory applied principally to early nineteenth century romantic poetry. Its author, Harold Bloom, maintains that the theory has general applicability to the study of literary tradition, ranging from Homer and the Bible to [[Thomas Pynchon]] and [[Anne Carson]] in the 20th and 21st century. It is based primarily on Bloom's belief that there is no such thing as an original poem, that every new composition is simply a misreading or misinterpretation of an earlier poem and that influence is unavoidable and inescapable; all writers inevitably, to some degree, adopt, manipulate or alter and assimilate certain aspects of the content or subject matter, literary style or form from their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrams &amp; Harpham|2009|pp=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate his point, Bloom quotes Oscar Wilde, noting that:

"Influence is simply transference of personality, a mode of giving away what is most precious to one's self, and its exercise produces a sense, and, it may be, a reality of loss. Every disciple takes away something from his master."&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-6"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to universally-held beliefs that the literary influence of precursors can provide a purely benevolent, inspirational platform for young, aspiring writers; Bloom deems that this influence provides entirely the opposite effect.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom}}{{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that it proves detrimental; that this influence instills in young writers a type of unease, apprehension or anxiety as they psychologically struggle against past literary forebears to create something definitive and original and achieve literary recognition and success. Bloom equates this struggle to the Freudian family drama; particularly to the Oedipal complex and relationship of son to father, where the emerging writer is cast as the 'son' in a battle against the 'father'; a literary precursor.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt; Bloom claims that this forces poets or authors into a type of 'creative misprision'; where they must distort the works of their literary masters in an attempt to create something revolutionary and innovative.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997" /&gt; The authors who triumph over this struggle are deemed 'strong', with some even receiving acclaim to the extent where the contemporary has the potential to transcend time, with some literary predecessors being read in terms of their contemporary successor. In contrast, writers who cannot prevail over this anxiety of influence are deemed 'weak', with their works regarded as markedly derivative and reminiscent of the works of earlier literary masters. Some great poets in which Bloom draws upon, who have overcome this anxiety of influence include Wordsworth, Shelley and Wallace Stevens.

== Effects on literature ==
In order to determine the effects of this theory on literature, Bloom has established the six "revisionary ratios", which are occasionally based on the model of Freud's defense mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-8"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ratios show the developmental stages of anxiety of influence in relation to the ways a poet or author misreads and deforms the work of a literary precursor in the composition of a literary text.&lt;ref name="Geddes"&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Clinamen'' – Bloom defines this as "poetic misreading or misprision proper".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author makes a swerve away from a precursor, alluding to the proposition that the original work was only precise and accurate up until a particular end; at which point, the successive author makes the corrective motion.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;  
* ''Tessera'' – Bloom defines this as "completion and antithesis".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt; The author elaborates upon a precursor's work, maintaining the precursor's terms and ideas but constituting them in another sense, with the implication that the predecessor failed to take the argument far enough in the first instance&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;
* ''Kenosis'' – Bloom defines this as a "breaking device similar to the defence mechanisms our psyches employ against repetition compulsions".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt; The author seeks a state of discontinuity, in the act of isolating themself from the influence of the precursor&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;
* ''Daemonization'' – Bloom defines this as a "movement towards a personalised Counter-Sublime, in reaction to the precursor's Sublime".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author manipulates an apparent power of a precursor that they believe is superior to the precursor in an effort to dismiss the originality of the predecessor's work and perpetuate the greatness of their own.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;
* ''Askesis'' – Bloom defines this as a "movement of self-purgation which intends the attainment of a state of solitude".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997" /&gt; In this process, the author diminishes both his own and his precursor's achievements, purging themself of all remnants of influence, with a rationale for independent, individual success and achievement.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;
* ''Apophrades'' – Bloom defines this as the "return of the dead".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt; The author is encumbered by his previous state of solitude and holds his work open for inspection with that of his predecessors&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt; Geddes 1999). Instead of proving detrimental to the author, this instead has the effect of the successor overpowering the predecessor, with the predecessor's work being read in terms of the successor's work.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;

The '''Arts Council of Great Britain''' was a [[non-departmental public body]] dedicated to the promotion of the [[fine arts]] in [[Great Britain]]. It was divided in 1994 to form the Arts Council of England (now [[Arts Council England]]), the [[Scottish Arts Council]], and the [[Arts Council of Wales]]. At the same time the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] was established and these three arts councils, plus the [[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]], became distribution bodies.

==History==
[[File:The Ballet Rambert Visiting An Aircraft Factory in Britain TR969.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Dancers from the [[Ballet Rambert]], under the auspices of CEMA perform ''[[Peter and The Wolf]]'' at an aircraft factory in the Midlands during World War II&lt;/center&gt;]]
In 1940, during the [[Second World War]], the '''Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts''' (CEMA), was appointed to help promote and maintain [[British culture]]. Chaired by [[Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr|Lord De La Warr]], [[President of the Board of Education]], the Council was government-funded and after the war was renamed the Arts Council of Great Britain.

A [[Royal Charter]] was granted on 9 August 1946,&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Music and Musicians' International Directory''. [[Burke's Peerage]] Edition, London 1962&lt;/ref&gt; followed by another in 1967. The latter provided for functions in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] to be conducted by two almost{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[autonomous]] committees known as the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils &amp;ndash; the basis for today’s Scottish Arts Council and Arts Council of Wales.

The Council's first Chairman was [[John Maynard Keynes]] who used his influence in Government to secure a high level of funding despite Britain's poor finances following the war. The majority of this funding was directed to organisations with which Keynes had close ties such as the [[Royal Opera House]] and was restricted to [[Central London]]. Keynes used his political influence to ensure that the Arts Council reported directly to the Treasury rather than an Arts Minister or the Education Department as had been the case with CEMA, establishing the principle of an 'arms length' relationship between UK Arts policy and the government of the day.

After Keynes' death in April 1946 Government funding was reduced but the Arts Council received wide recognition for its contribution to the [[Festival of Britain]] thanks to the new Chairman [[Kenneth Clark]]. Artworks commissioned by the Council for the Festival were retained to form the basis of the [[Arts Council Collection]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The Arts Council commissioned 12 sculptors and 60 painters, who made large paintings, {{convert|114|by|152|cm|in}} or more, to be displayed at the festival. Ultimately the works were to be given to new hospitals, libraries, schools, and health titi that emerged after the war. There were five cash prizes awarded: [[Robert Adams (sculptor and designer)|Robert Adams]]'s ''Apocalyptic Figure,'' [[Elinor Bellingham-Smith]]'s ''The Island,'' [[Lucian Freud]]'s ''Interior near Paddington,'' [[William Gear]]'s ''Autumn Landscape,'' and [[Robert MacBryde]]'s ''Figure and Still Life.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Becky Conekin|title=The Autobiography of a Nation: The 1951 Exhibition of Britain, Representing Britain in the Post-War World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8oTwreqPMUC&amp;pg=PA36|date=28 June 2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-6060-1|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Harold Wilson]] Government of 1964-70 the Arts Council enjoyed a [[Golden Age]] thanks to the close relationship between Chairman [[Arnold Goodman]] and the Arts Minister [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Jennie Lee]]. This period saw the Council establish a network of arts organisations across the country as regular client organisations and a programme of touring exhibitions and performances.  To support the Council’s responsibilities in relation to the visual arts, it opened the [[Hayward Gallery]] on [[London]]'s [[South Bank]] in 1968 as a home for its major exhibitions and the base for the [[Arts Council Collection]]. Since 1987, the gallery has been independently managed by the South Bank Centre. In 2003 sculpture in the Collection was moved to a base in [[Yorkshire]].

During the 1970s and 1980s the Arts Council came under attack for being elitist and politically biased, in particular from the prominent [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] minister [[Norman Tebbit]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} The Government grant to the Council was capped effecting a real terms reduction in funding though it was argued that any shortfall would be made up by increased sponsorship from the private sector. The Secretary-General from 1975–83, [[Roy Shaw (arts administrator)|Roy Shaw]], the last secretary-General to be knighted, faced the difficult task of reconciling the needs of arts organisations with the restricted funding. [[William Rees-Mogg]] was a political appointment as Chairman and proposed slimming down the Council's responsibilities. This led to a series of clashes with prominent figures from the Arts such as [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]] who resigned from the Council in protest. In 1987 the restructure inspired by Rees-Mogg cut by half the number of organisations receiving Arts Council funding. During the same period the Arts Council began encouraging a greater level of corporate sponsorship for the arts.

The Arts Council of Great Britain was divided in 1994 to form the [[Arts Council of England]], [[Scottish Arts Council]] and [[Arts Council of Wales]]. At the same time the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] was established and the [[Arts Council of England]] became one of the distribution bodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4444">'''Bandboy''' (also expressed as '''band boy''') is a bygone term for a job similar to for what now is known as a "[[roadie]]."  They set up, tear down, and maintain equipment, and music.  They help-out backstage, making sure there are towels, drinks, ice.

Unlike a roadie, the bandboy was more like a personal assistant, or ''[[au pair]]'', or butler/dresser for the leader — making sure suits were dry cleaned, shoes shined, and the like.  On foreign tours a local "bandboy" would translate, find places to eat, change money, buy train tickets, and so on.  Often the "bandboy" would disseminate information for the leader, hand out itineraries, room lists, and set lists.  The role of bandboy was different with every band and had different duties than the more senior road manager, who dealt with promoters, booking agents, contracts, payroll, catering, and such.  When times got tough, financially, road managers often performed bandboy duties &amp;mdash; or band members themselves handled the bandboy duties.

'''Buridan's Bridge''' (also known as '''[[Sophism]] 17''') is described by [[Jean Buridan]], one of the most famous and influential [[Philosophy|philosophers]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]], in his book ''Sophismata''. It is a [[self-referential]] [[paradox]] that involves a [[proposition]] pronounced about an event that might or might not happen in the future.

==The sophism==

The sophism is:
{{quotation|Imagine the following scenario:&lt;br&gt;
Socrates wants to cross a river and comes to a bridge guarded by Plato. The two speak as follows:&lt;br&gt;
''Plato:'' "Socrates, if in the first proposition which you utter, you speak the
truth, I will permit you to cross. But surely, if you speak falsely, I shall throw you into the water."&lt;br&gt;
''Socrates:'' "You will throw me into the water."&lt;ref name="Tense"/&gt;}}

[[Socrates]]' response puts [[Plato]] in a difficult situation. He could not throw Socrates into the water, because if he did he would violate his promise to let Socrates cross the bridge if he speaks the truth. On the other hand, if Plato allows Socrates to cross the bridge it would mean that Socrates spoke untruth when he replied: "You are going to throw me into the water." In that case Socrates should have been thrown into the water. In other words, Socrates could be allowed to cross the bridge if and only if he could not be.&lt;ref name="Buridan's Bridge"/&gt;

==Buridan's solution==

In order to solve the paradox Buridan proposes three questions:
#Is the proposition uttered by Socrates: "You are going to throw me into the water" true, or is it false?
#Is Plato's promise true or is it false?
#"What ought Plato to do to fulfill his promise?"&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In response to the first question Buridan states that it is impossible to determine if Socrates' proposition is true or false. This is because the proposition "You are going to throw me into the water" is a [[Problem of future contingents|future contingent]] that could be true or false depending on what Plato is going to do. Dr. Joseph W. Ulatowski says that Buridan apparently used [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] thesis about what "truth" is to come up with this response. Aristotle believed that a proposition is true if and only if it is verified by the state of things as they currently are. Contradicting the [[principle of bivalence]], Buridan implies a system of  [[three-valued logic]] in which there are three [[truth value]]s--''true'', ''false'', and some indeterminate third value.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In determining the truth value of Plato's conditional promise, Buridan suggests that Plato's promise was false, and that because Plato gave his promise carelessly he is not obligated to fulfill the promise.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In discussing the third question, "What ought Plato to do to fulfill his promise", Buridan states that Plato should not have given a conditional promise in the first place. He also suggests that Plato could have made sure that the condition was formulated in such a way that it would not cause a contradiction; because Plato cannot fulfill his conditional promise without violating it, he is not obligated to fulfill the promise. Ulatowski points out that this interpretation is the [[contrapositive]] of a principle of [[Immanuel Kant]]: "ought implies can".&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

==Philosophers on the sophism and its solution==

In his solution to the sophism, [[Walter Burley]] (d. 1344/1345) applied the principle "nothing is true unless at this instant" (''"nihil est verum nisi in hoc instanti"'') and concluded that "if a proposition is true it must be true now".&lt;ref name="truth now"/&gt;

Dr. Dale Jacquette of the [[University of Bern]] says that "Plato can either permit Socrates to pass or have him seized and thrown into the river without violating his conditional vow". Jacquette argues that Plato's conditional promise was given only in regard to Socrates's proposition being clearly and unconditionally either true or false. To prove his point Jacquette asks, what would Plato have to do if Socrates had said nothing and was "as silent as a [[Sphinx]]", or if he uttered something that could not be either proven or "undisproven", something like [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. Jacquette concludes that Plato's conditional promise was true, and Socrates's proposition is "neither true ''simpliciter'' nor false ''simpliciter''", and therefore Plato would be right regardless of the choice that he made.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In his book ''Paradoxes from A to Z'' Professor Michael Clark comes to the conclusion that if Plato is an honorable man, Socrates should not get wet under any circumstances. Clark argues that Socrates could say, "Either I am speaking falsely, and you will throw me in, or I am speaking truly, and you won't throw me in". Clark says that if this sentence is true, then it means that the first alternative "is ruled out", leaving us only with the second one. If this sentence is false, it means that both alternatives are false, and because Socrates spoke falsely "it will be false" to throw him into the river.&lt;ref name="Paradoxes from A to Z"/&gt;  

Dr. Joseph W. Ulatowski believes that since the truth value in Plato's conditional promise and even more so in Socrates's proposition is indeterminate, it means that Plato "ought to err on the side of caution with respect to the future contingency and allow Socrates to cross the bridge".&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt; In the same work Ulatowski offers a couple of humorous solutions to the paradox. Plato, Ulatowski says, could let Socrates to cross the bridge, and then throw him into water on the other side. Or both Plato and Socrates could combine their efforts and forcibly eject Buridan himself from Buridan's bridge.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

==In ''Don Quixote''==

Buridan's bridge sophism was used by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] in ''[[Don Quixote]]'',&lt;ref name="Paradoxes from A to Z"/&gt; when [[Sancho Panza|Sancho]] was presented with the Buridan's bridge dilemma: A man who was going to cross the bridge was asked to respond truthfully where he was going or otherwise to face a death by hanging. The man "swore and said that by the oath he took he was going to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing else."&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;

Sancho summarizes the situation by saying: "the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows; but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don't hang him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged". He then comes up with the solution, "that of this man they should let pass the part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with".&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt; After Sancho makes this statement, the person who was asking for advice reasons with him:{{quotation|"But then, senor governor," replied the querist, "the man will have to be divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die; and so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and it is absolutely necessary to comply with it."&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;}} Sancho comes up with the moral solution:{{quotation|...there is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living and passing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should let him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil.&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;}}

[[Image:Schriftzug Urkunde.jpg|thumb|Calligraphy of the German word "''Urkunde''" (deed)]]
'''Calligraphy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: καλλιγραφία) is a [[Visual arts|visual art]] related to [[writing]]. It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad tip instrument,  [[brush]], or other writing instruments.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{rp|17}} A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner".&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{rp|18}}

Modern calligraphy ranges from functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the letters may or may not be readable.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2016}} Classical calligraphy differs from [[typography]] and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may practice both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2006|title=Kalligrafie: Intensiv Training|trans-title=Calligraphy: Intensive Training|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt|isbn=9783874397001|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2005|title=Kalligrafie: Erste Hilfe und Schrift-Training mit Muster-Alphabeten|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt|isbn=9783874396752|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2007&gt;{{cite book|author=Zapf, H.|year=2007|title=Alphabet Stories: A Chronicle of technical developments|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester, New York|isbn=9781933360225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Zapf, H.|year=2006|title=The world of Alphabets: A kaleidoscope of drawings and letterforms}} CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt;

Calligraphy continues to flourish in the forms of [[wedding invitations]] and event invitations, [[font]] design and typography, original hand-lettered [[logo]] design, [[religious art]], announcements, [[graphic design]] and commissioned calligraphic art, cut stone [[inscription]]s, and memorial [[document]]s. It is also used for [[Theatrical property|prop]]s and moving images for film and television, and also for [[testimonial]]s, [[birth certificate|birth]] and [[death certificate|death]] certificates, [[map]]s, and other written works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Propfe, J.|year=2005|title=SchreibKunstRaume: Kalligraphie im Raum Verlag|publisher=[[Callwey Verlag]].|location=Munich|isbn=9783766716309|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geddes, A.|author2=Dion, C.|year=2004|title=Miracle: a celebration of new life|publisher=Photogenique Publishers|location=Auckland|isbn= 9780740746963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
[[File:Pointed pen parts.svg|thumb|A calligraphic [[Nib (pen)|nib]], with part names.]]

The principal tools for a calligrapher are the [[pen]] and the [[paintbrush|brush]]. Calligraphy pens write with [[nib (pen)|nibs]] that may be flat, round, or pointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reaves, M.|author2=Schulte, E.|year=2006|title=Brush Lettering: An instructional manual in Western brush calligraphy|edition=Revised|publisher=Design Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Child|editor-first=H.|year=1985|title=The Calligrapher's Handbook|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Lamb|editor-first=C.M.|origyear=1956|title=Calligrapher's Handbook|publisher=Pentalic|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some decorative purposes, multi-nibbed pens—steel brushes—can be used. However, works have also been created with [[felt-tip pen|felt-tip]] and [[ballpoint pen]]s, although these works do not employ angled lines. There are some styles of calligraphy, such as Gothic script, that require a stub nib pen.

Writing ink is usually water-based and is much less viscous than the oil-based inks used in printing. High quality paper, which has good consistency of absorption,{{clarify|date=October 2013}} enables cleaner lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calligraphyfonts.info/aesthetic-theory-arabic-calligraphy-islamic-art/ |title=Paper Properties in Arabic calligraphy |publisher=calligraphyfonts.info |date= |accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] is often used, as a knife can be used to erase imperfections and a [[light-box]] is not needed to allow lines to pass through it. Normally, light boxes and templates are used to achieve straight lines without pencil markings detracting from the work. Ruled paper, either for a light box or direct use, is most often ruled every quarter or half inch, although inch spaces are occasionally used. This is the case with ''litterea unciales'' (hence the name), and college-[[ruled paper]] often acts as a guideline well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://calligraphyislamic.com |title=Calligraphy Islamic website |publisher=Calligraphyislamic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608004825/http://www.calligraphyislamic.com/ |archive-date=2012-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World traditions==

===Europe===
{{Main|Western calligraphy}}
====History====
[[Image:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|Folio 27r from the Lindisfarne Gospels (c.700) contains the [[incipit]] from the [[Gospel of Matthew]].]]
Western calligraphy is recognizable by the use of the [[Latin script]]. The [[Latin alphabet]] appeared about 600 BC, in Rome, and by the first century{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} developed into [[Roman imperial capitals]] carved on stones, [[Rustic capitals]] painted on walls, and [[Roman cursive]] for daily use. In the second and third centuries the [[uncial]] lettering style developed. As writing withdrew to monasteries, uncial script was found more suitable for copying the Bible and other religious texts. It was the monasteries which preserved calligraphic traditions during the fourth and fifth centuries, when the Roman Empire fell and Europe entered the [[Middle Ages|Dark Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabard, V.|author2=Geneslay, V.|author3=Rébéna, L.|title=Calligraphie latine: Initiation|location=, Paris|edition=7th|year=2004|pages=8–11|isbn=978-2215021308|trans-title=Latin calligraphy: Introduction|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the Empire, its power reached as far as Great Britain; when the empire fell, its literary influence remained. The [[Semi-uncial]] generated the Irish Semi-uncial, the small Anglo-Saxon. &lt;ref&gt;Insular Manuscripts: Paleography Section 6: Language on the Page in Insular Manuscripts LAYOUT AND LEGIBILITY. (n.d.). Retrieved May 30, 2018, from https://www.vhmml.org/school/lesson/insular-paleography/layout&lt;/ref&gt; Each region developed its own standards following the main monastery of the region (i.e. [[Merovingian script]], Laon script, [[Luxeuil Abbey|Luxeuil script]], [[Visigothic script]], [[Beneventan script]]), which are mostly cursive and hardly readable.

[[Image:Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg|thumb|left|Calligraphy in a [[Latin]] [[Bible]] of 1407 on display in [[Malmesbury Abbey]], [[Wiltshire]], England. This bible was hand written in Belgium, by Gerard Brils, for reading aloud in a [[monastery]].]]
Christian churches promoted the development of writing through the prolific copying of the Bible, the [[Roman Breviary|Breviary]], and other sacred texts.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel 2001a&lt;/ref&gt; Two distinct styles of writing known as uncial and half-uncial (from the Latin "uncia", or "inch") developed from a variety of Roman bookhands.&lt;ref&gt;Knight 1998: 10&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th-9th centuries in northern Europe were the heyday of Celtic illuminated manuscripts, such as the Book of Durrow, [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Trinity College Library Dublin 2006; Walther &amp; Wolf 2005; Brown &amp; Lovett 1999: 40; Backhouse 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlemagne]]'s devotion to improved scholarship resulted in the recruiting of "a crowd of scribes", according to [[Alcuin]], the Abbot of [[York]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1981: 64&lt;/ref&gt; Alcuin developed the style known as the Caroline or [[Carolingian minuscule]]. The first manuscript in this hand was the Godescalc Evangelistary (finished 783)—a Gospel book written by the scribe Godescalc.&lt;ref&gt;Walther &amp; Wolf 2005; de Hamel 1994: 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; Carolingian remains the one progenitor hand from which modern booktype descends.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel 1994: 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eleventh century, the Caroline evolved into the [[blackletter|Gothic script]], which was more compact and made it possible to fit more text on a page.&lt;ref name=lovett2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Lovett, Patricia|title=Calligraphy and Illumination: A History and Practical Guide|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|year=2000|isbn= 978-0810941199}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}} The Gothic calligraphy styles became dominant throughout Europe; and in 1454, when [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed the first printing press in Mainz, Germany, he adopted the Gothic style, making it the first [[typeface]].&lt;ref name=lovett2000 /&gt;{{rp|141}}

[[File:მარიამისეული ქართლის ცხოვრება.JPG|thumb|The [[Georgian calligraphy]] is centuries-old tradition of an artistic writing of the [[Georgian language]] with its [[Georgian scripts|three scripts]].]]
In the 15th century, the rediscovery of old Carolingian texts encouraged the creation of the [[humanist minuscule]] or ''littera antiqua''. The 17th century saw the [[Bastarda|Batarde script]] from France, and the 18th century saw the [[English script (calligraphy)|English script]] spread across Europe and world through their books.

In the mid-1600s French officials, flooded with documents written in various hands and varied levels of skill, complained that many such documents were beyond their ability to decipher.  The Office of the Financier thereupon restricted all legal documents to three hands, namely the Coulee, the Rhonde, (known as [[Round hand]] in English) and a Speed Hand sometimes simply called the [[Bastarda]].&lt;ref name="Whalley"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joyce Irene Whalley|title=The Art of Calligraphy, Western Europe &amp; America|date=c. 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were many great French masters at the time, the most influential in proposing these hands was Louis Barbedor, who published ''Les Ecritures Financière Et Italienne Bastarde Dans Leur Naturel'' circa 1650.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

With the destruction of the [[Camera Apostolica]] during the [[sack of Rome (1527)]], the capitol for writing masters moved to Southern France.  By 1600, the Italic Cursiva began to be replaced by a technological refinement, the Italic Chancery [[Circumflessa]], which in turn fathered the Rhonde and later English [[Roundhand]].&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

In England, [[Philip Ayres (poet)|Ayres]] and Banson popularized the Round Hand while Snell is noted for his reaction to them, and warnings of restraint and proportionality. Still Edward Crocker began publishing his copybooks 40 years before the aforementioned.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

====Style====
[[Image:Westerncalligraphy.jpg|thumb|right|Modern Western calligraphy]]
Sacred [[Western calligraphy]] has some special features, such as the illumination of the first letter of each book or chapter in medieval times. A decorative "carpet page" may precede the literature, filled with ornate, geometrical depictions of bold-hued animals. The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] (715–720 AD) are an early example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, M.P.|year=2004|title=Painted Labyrinth: The World of the Lindisfarne Gospel|edition=Revised|publisher=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese]] or [[Islamic calligraphy]], Western calligraphic script employed the use of strict rules and shapes. Quality writing had a rhythm and regularity to the letters, with a "geometrical" order of the lines on the page. Each character had, and often still has, a precise [[stroke order]].

Unlike a typeface, irregularity in the characters' size, style, and colors increases aesthetic value,{{dubious|date=August 2016}} though the content may be illegible. Many of the themes and variations of today's contemporary Western calligraphy are found in the pages of [[The Saint John's Bible]]. A particularly modern example is [[Timothy Botts]]' illustrated edition of the Bible, with 360 calligraphic images as well as a calligraphy [[typeface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible: New Living Translation|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influences====
Several other Western styles use the same tools and practices, but differ by character set and stylistic preferences.
For [[Slavonic lettering]], the history of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] and consequently [[Russia]]n [[writing system]]s differs fundamentally from the one of the [[Latin|Latin language]]. It evolved from the 10th century to today.

In [[ancient China]], the oldest Chinese characters existing are [[Oracle bone script|Jiǎgǔwén  characters]] (甲骨文) carved on ox [[scapula]]e and tortoise [[plastrons]], because the dominators in [[Shang Dynasty]] carved pits on such animals' bones and then baked them to gain auspice of military affairs, agricultural harvest, or even procreating and weather. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, the characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved. (Keightley, 1978).

About 220 BC, the emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them [[Li Si]]'s character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized ''{{transl|zh|Xiǎozhuàn（小篆）}}'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fazzioli |first=Edoardo |others=Calligraphy by Rebecca Hon Ko |title=Chinese Calligraphy: From Pictograph to Ideogram: The History Of 214 Essential Chinese/Japanese Characters |publisher=[[Abbeville Publishing Group (Abbeville Press, Inc.)|Abbeville Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0896597741 |page=13 |quote=And so the first Chinese dictionary was born, the ''Sān Chāng'', containing {{formatnum:3300}} characters|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, few papers survive from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.

Printing technologies here allowed a shape stabilization. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt; But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of &lt;big&gt;{{lang|zh|广}}&lt;/big&gt; which is not absolutely the same in the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] of 1716 as in modern books.

Some [[variant Chinese character]]s were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, compose the [[Simplified Chinese]] character set.

[[File:Mi Fu-On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|''On Calligraphy'' by [[Mi Fu]], [[Song Dynasty]]]]
Traditional East Asian writing uses the [[Four Treasures of the Study]] ({{lang|zh-TW|文房四寶}}/{{lang|zh|文房四宝}})&lt;ref&gt;Li, J. (Ed.). (n.d.). "Four treasures of Study" tour. Retrieved May 30, 2018, from http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/anhui/travel/2010-06/02/content_9948922.htm&lt;/ref&gt;: the [[ink brush]]es known as máobǐ ({{lang|zh-TW|毛筆}}/{{lang|zh|毛笔}}) to write [[Chinese character]]s, Chinese ink, paper, and inkstone, known as the ''Four Friends of the Study'' ({{lang-ko|문방사우|文房四友}}) in Korea. In addition to these four tools, desk pads and paperweights are also used.

The shape, size, stretch, and [[Brush#Bristles|hair type]] of the ink brush, the color, color density and water density of the ink, as well as the paper's water absorption speed and surface texture are the main physical parameters influencing the final result. The calligrapher's technique also influences the result. The calligrapher's work is influenced by the quantity of ink and water he lets the brush take, then by the pressure, inclination, and direction he gives to the brush, producing thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, accelerations, decelerations of the writer's moves, turns, and crochets, and the [[stroke order]] give the "spirit" to the characters, by greatly influencing their final shapes.

=====Styles=====
Cursive styles such as ''[[Semi-cursive script|{{transl|zh|xíngshū}}]]'' ({{lang|zh-TW|行書}}/{{lang|zh|行书}})(semi-cursive or running script) and ''[[Grass script|{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}]]'' ({{lang|zh-TW|草書}}/{{lang|zh|草书}})(cursive, rough script, or grass script) are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from Clerical script, in the same time as Regular script ([[Han Dynasty]]), but ''{{transl|zh|xíngshū}}'' and ''{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}'' were used for personal notes only, and never used as a standard. The ''{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}''  style was highly appreciated in [[Emperor Wu of Han]] reign (140–187 AD).&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt;

Examples of modern printed styles are [[Ming (typeface)|Song]] from the [[Song Dynasty]]'s [[Four Great Inventions of ancient China#Printing|printing press]], and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]]. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written.

Both Japanese and Korean calligraphy were greatly influenced by Chinese calligraphy. The Japanese and Korean people have also developed their own specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphy while incorporating Chinese influences. For example, [[Japanese calligraphy]] go out of the set of [[CJK strokes]] to also include local alphabets such as [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]], with specific problematics such as new curves and moves, and specific materials ([[Japanese paper]], ''{{transl|ja|washi}}'' {{lang|ja|和紙}}, and Japanese ink).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Yuuko|title=An introduction to Japanese calligraphy|year=2005|publisher=Search|location=Tunbridge Wells|isbn=978-1844480579}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Korean calligraphy]], the [[Hangeul]] and the existence of the circle required the creation of a new technique which usually confuses Chinese calligraphers.

Temporary calligraphy is a practice of water-only calligraphy on the floor, which dries out within minutes. This practice is especially appreciated by the new generation of retired Chinese in public parks of China. These will often open studio-shops in tourist towns offering traditional Chinese calligraphy to tourists. Other than writing the clients name, they also sell fine brushes as souvenirs and lime stone carved stamps.

Since late 1980s, a few Chinese artists have branched out traditional Chinese calligraphy to a new territory by mingling [[Chinese characters]] with English letters; notable new forms of calligraphy are [[Xu Bing]]'s square calligraphy and DanNie's coolligraphy or cooligraphy.

[[Mongolian calligraphy]] is also influenced by Chinese calligraphy, from tools to style.

Calligraphy has influenced [[ink and wash painting]], which is accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Calligraphy has influenced most major art styles in [[East Asia]], including [[ink and wash painting]], a style of [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Japanese painting|Japanese]], and [[Korean painting|Korean]] based entirely on calligraphy.

The Philippines has numerous indigenous scripts collectively called as [[suyat]]. Various ethno-linguistic groups in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century up to the independence era in the 21st century have used the scripts with various mediums. By the end of colonialism, only four of the suyat scripts survived and continue to be used by certain communities in everyday life. These four scripts are [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo]] of the Hanuno'o [[Mangyan]] people, [[Buhid alphabet|buhid/buid]] of the Buhid [[Mangyan]] people, [[Tagbanwa script|apurahuano/tagbanwa]] of the [[Tagbanwa people]], and [[Palawan people|palaw'an/pala'wan]] of the [[Palawan people|Palaw'an people]].

Due to dissent from colonialism, many artists and cultural experts have revived the usage of [[suyat]] scripts that went extinct due to Spanish persecution. These scripts being revived include the [[Kulitan alphabet|kulitan]] script of the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan people]], the [[Visayan languages|badlit]] script of various [[Visayan languages|Visayan ethnic groups]], the [[Eskaya|iniskaya]] script of the [[Eskaya people]], the [[baybayin]] script of the [[Tagalog people]], and the [[Ilocano language|kur-itan]] script of the [[Ilocano people]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/201104-baybayin-national-writing-system-reactions|title=‘Educate first’: Filipinos react to Baybayin as national writing system|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1602707/Manila/Local-News/House-panel-approves-Baybayin-as-national-writing-system|title=House panel approves Baybayin as national writing system|date=24 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/04/25/18/5-things-to-know-about-phs-pre-hispanic-writing-system|title=5 things to know about PH's pre-Hispanic writing system|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the diversity of [[suyat]] scripts, all calligraphy written in [[suyat]] scripts are collectively called as Filipino suyat calligraphy, although each are distinct from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/577701/a-primer-on-baybayin/story/|title=A primer on Baybayin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2018/04/26/baybayin-bill.html|title=The Baybayin bill and the never ending search for ‘Filipino-ness’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy using the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are also prevalent in the Philippines due to its colonial past, but the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are not considered as suyat, and therefore Western-alphabet and Arabic calligraphy are not considered as suyat calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brideandbreakfast.ph/2015/08/12/awesome-calligraphers/|title=10 Perfectly Awesome Calligraphers You Need To Check Out|author=|date=12 August 2015|website=brideandbreakfast.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/2018/06/01/1820721/watch-how-ace-script-lettering|title=WATCH: How to ace in script lettering - Philstar.com|author=|date=|website=philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically Thai calligraphy has been limited to sacred texts of the Pali Canon with few wider artistic applications where graphic calligraphy representing figures and objects is produced. Calligraphy appears on the personal flag of each member of the Thai royal family  bearing its owner's initials in calligraphy. The most obvious place in the country where calligraphy is present is in graffiti. A few books have been published with calligraphic compositions.

Vietnamese calligraphy uses a variety of scripts, including Chinese characters, Chữ nôm, and the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ. Historically, calligraphers used the former two scripts. Due to the adoption of the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy uses Roman characters. Traditional Vietnamese calligraphy is strongly affected by that of China for historical and geographic regions. As part of the East Asian cultural sphere, Chinese was often used as the written medium of communication, and as a result, Vietnamese calligraphy thus also follows Chinese calligraphy’s standard and use Han script (Chinese language) in many of its writings. In modern times, calligraphy has been done mainly in the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ script, as Chữ nôm and Chinese characters have largely fallen out of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnamese neglect Han-Nom heritage|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/sunday/features/220749/vietnamese-neglect-han-nom-heritage.html|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=Viet Nam News|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aśoka]]'s edicts (c. 265–238 BC) were committed to stone. These inscriptions are stiff and angular in form. Following the Aśoka style of Indic writing, two new calligraphic types appear: [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭī]] and [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]]. Kharoṣṭī was used in the northwestern regions of India from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century of the Christian Era, and it was used in [[Central Asia]] until the 8th century.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In many parts of ancient India, the inscriptions were carried out in smoke-treated palm leaves. This tradition dates back to over two thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=10660&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Memory of the World &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020103635/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D10660%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html# |archive-date=2016-10-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the Indian languages were put on paper in the 13th century, palm leaves where considered a preferred medium of writing owing to its longevity (nearly 400 years) compared to paper. Both sides of the leaves were used for writing. Long rectangular strips were gathered on top of one another, holes were drilled through all the leaves, and the book was held together by string. Books of this manufacture were common to [[Southeast Asia]]. The palm leaf was an excellent surface for penwriting, making possible the delicate lettering used in many of the scripts of southern Asia.

====Nepal====
{{Main|Nepalese calligraphy}}
[[Ranjana script]] is the primary form of Nepalese calligraphy. The script itself, along with its derivatives (like [[Lanydza Script|Lantsa]], [['Phags-pa script|Phagpa]], [[Kutila]]) are used in [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Leh]], [[Mongolia]], coastal Japan, and Korea to write "[[Om mani padme hum]]" and other sacred [[Buddhist texts]], mainly those derived from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]].

====Tibet====
{{Main|Tibetan calligraphy}}
[[Image:BonpoBook.jpg|thumb|A [[Bön]] text]]

Calligraphy is central in [[Tibet]]an culture. The script is derived from [[Indic script]]s. The nobles of Tibet, such as the High [[Lama]]s and inhabitants of the [[Potala Palace]], were usually capable calligraphers. [[Tibet]] has been a center of [[Buddhism]] for several centuries, and that religion places a great deal of significance on written word. This does not provide for a large body of [[secular]] pieces, although they do exist (but are usually related in some way to Tibetan Buddhism). Almost all high religious writing involved calligraphy, including letters sent by the [[Dalai Lama]] and other religious and secular authority. Calligraphy is particularly evident on their [[prayer wheels]], although this calligraphy was forged rather than scribed, much like Arab and Roman calligraphy is often found on buildings. Although originally done with a reed, Tibetan calligraphers now use chisel tipped pens and markers as well.

===Islamic world===
{{Main|Islamic calligraphy}}
[[File:Basmalah-1wm.svg|left|thumb|The phrase [[Basmala|Bismillah]] in an 18th-century Islamic calligraphy from the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] region.]]
Islamic calligraphy (''calligraphy'' in Arabic is ''{{transl|ar|khatt ul-yad}}'' {{rtl-lang|ar|خط اليد}}) has evolved alongside [[Islam]] and the [[Arabic language]]. As it is based on Arabic letters, some call it "Arabic calligraphy". However the term "Islamic calligraphy" is a more appropriate term as it comprises all works of calligraphy by the Muslim calligraphers from [[Andalusia]] in modern [[Spain]] to China.

Islamic calligraphy is associated with geometric Islamic art ([[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]) on the walls and ceilings of [[mosque]]s as well as on the page. Contemporary artists in the [[Islamic world]] draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions.

Instead of recalling something related to the spoken word, calligraphy for [[Muslim]]s is a visible expression of the highest art of all, the art of the [[spirituality|spiritual]] world. Calligraphy has arguably become the most venerated form of Islamic art because it provides a link between the languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The [[Qur'an]] has played an important role in the development and evolution of the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the Arabic alphabet. Proverbs and passages from the Qur'an are still sources for Islamic calligraphy.

It is generally accepted that Islamic calligraphy excelled during the [[Ottoman era]].{{By whom|date=December 2016}} Istanbul is an open exhibition hall for all kinds and varieties of calligraphy, from inscriptions in mosques to fountains, schools, houses, etc. {{Clear}}

===Ethiopia/Abyssinia===
[[File:Ethiopian Scroll comprising prayers against various ailments Wellcome L0031387.jpg|thumb|upright|A painting of [[Susenyos I]] (r. 1607-1632)on a [[Ge'ez]] prayer scroll meant to dispel evil spirits, [[Wellcome Collection]], London]]

[[Ethiopian]] (Abyssinian)) calligraphy began with the [[Ge'ez script]], which replaced Epigraphic [[South Arabian]] in the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], that was developed specifically for [[Ethiopian Semitic languages]]. In those languages that use it, such as [[Amharic]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], the script is called ''{{transl|sem|Fidäl}}'', which means script or alphabet. The Epigraphic South Arabian letters were used for a few inscriptions into the 8th century, though not any South Arabian language since [[Dʿmt]].

Early inscriptions in Ge'ez and Ge'ez script have been dated to as early as the 5th century BC, and in a sort of proto-Ge'ez written in ESA since the 9th century BC. Ge'ez literature begins with the Christianization of Ethiopia (and the civilization of Axum) in the 4th century, during the reign of [[Ezana of Axum]]. 

The Ge'ez script is read from left to right and has been adapted to write other languages, usually ones that are also Semitic. The most widespread use is for [[Amharic language|Amharic]] in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] in [[Eritrea]] and Ethiopia.

===Persia===
{{Main|Persian calligraphy}}

[[Image:Nastaliq-proportions.jpg|thumb|Example showing Nastaliq's proportional rules]]

The history of calligraphy in [[Persia]] dates back to the pre-Islam era. In [[Zoroastrianism]] beautiful and clear writings were always praised.

It is believed that [[Old Persian|ancient Persian script]] was invented by about 600–500 BC to provide monument inscriptions for the [[Achaemenid Empire#Achaemenid kings and rulers|Achaemenid kings]]. These scripts consisted of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal nail-shape letters, which is why it is called [[Cuneiform script|"script of nails/cuneiform script"]] (''{{transl|fa|khat-e-mikhi}}'') in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Centuries later, other scripts such as "[[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]]" and "[[Avestan script|Avestan]]" scripts were used in ancient Persia.









==== Contemporary scripts ====
The [[Nasta'liq script|Nasta'liq]] style is the most popular contemporary style among classical Persian calligraphy scripts; Persian calligraphers call it the "bride of calligraphy scripts". This calligraphy style has been based on such a strong structure that it has changed very little since. [[Mir Ali Tabrizi]] had found the optimum composition of the letters and graphical rules so it has just been fine-tuned during the past seven centuries. It has very strict rules for graphical shape of the letters and for combination of the letters, words, and composition of the whole calligraphy piece.

===Mayan civilization===
Mayan calligraphy was expressed via [[Mayan hieroglyphs]]; modern Mayan calligraphy is mainly used on [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and monuments in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in Mexico. Mayan hieroglyphs are rarely used in government offices; however in [[Campeche]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] and [[Quintana Roo]], Mayan calligraphy is written in Latin letters.{{clarify|date=August 2016}} Some commercial companies in southern Mexico use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their business. Some community associations and modern Mayan brotherhoods use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their groups.

Most of the archaeological sites in Mexico such as [[Chichen Itza]], Labna, [[Uxmal]], [[Edzna]], [[Calakmul]], etc. have glyphs in their structures. Carved stone monuments known as [[stele]] are common sources of ancient Mayan calligraphy.

==Modern calligraphy==

===Revival===
[[File:Edward Johnston.png|thumb|[[Edward Johnston]], founder of modern western calligraphy, at work in 1902.]]
After [[printing]] became ubiquitous from the 15th century, the production of illuminated manuscripts began to decline.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel 2001a; de Hamel 1986&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rise of printing did not mean the end of calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Zapf 2007; de Hamel 2001a; Gilderdale 1999; Gray 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern revival of calligraphy began at the end of the 19th century, influenced by the aesthetics and philosophy of [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. [[Edward Johnston]] is regarded as being the father of modern calligraphy.&lt;ref name="ejf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejf.org.uk/|title=The Legacy of Edward Johnston|publisher=The Edward Johnston Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cockerell 1945; Morris 1882&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Font Designer — Edward Johnston|publisher=Linotype GmbH|url=http://www.linotype.com/733/edwardjohnston.html|accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After studying published copies of manuscripts by architect [[William Harrison Cowlishaw]], he was introduced to [[William Lethaby]] in 1898, principal of the [[Central School of Art and Design|Central School of Arts and Crafts]], who advised him to study manuscripts at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;such as the Ramsey Psalter, BL, Harley MS 2904&lt;/ref&gt;

This triggered Johnston's interest in the art of calligraphy with the use of a broad edged pen. He began a teaching course in calligraphy at the Central School in [[Southampton Row]], London from September 1899, where he influenced the typeface designer and sculptor [[Eric Gill]]. He was commissioned by  [[Frank Pick]] to design a [[Johnston (typeface)|new typeface]] for [[London Underground]], still used today (with minor modifications).&lt;ref&gt;The Eric Gill Society: [https://web.archive.org/web/20081010172820/http://www.ericgill.org.uk/associates/edward-johnston-1872-1944 Associates of the Guild: Edward Johnston]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been credited for reviving the art of modern [[penmanship]] and lettering single-handedly through his books and teachings - his handbook on the subject, ''Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering'' (1906) was particularly influential on a generation of British typographers and calligraphers, including [[Graily Hewitt]], [[Stanley Morison]], [[Eric Gill]], [[Alfred Fairbank]] and Anna Simons. Johnston also devised the simply crafted round calligraphic handwriting style, written with a broad pen, known today as the ''Foundational hand''. Johnston initially taught his students an uncial hand using a flat pen angle, but later taught his hand using a slanted pen angle.&lt;ref&gt;Gilderdale 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He first referred to this hand as "Foundational Hand" in his 1909 publication, ''Manuscript &amp; Inscription Letters for Schools and Classes and for the Use of Craftsmen''.&lt;ref&gt;Baines &amp; Dixon 2003: 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
[[Graily Hewitt]] taught at the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] and published together with Johnston throughout the early part of the century. Hewitt was central to the revival of [[gilding]] in calligraphy, and his prolific output on type design also appeared between 1915 and 1943. He is attributed with the  revival of  gilding with [[gesso]] and gold leaf on [[vellum]]. Hewitt helped to found the [[Society of Scribes &amp; Illuminators]] (SSI) in 1921, probably the world's foremost calligraphy society.

Hewitt is not without both critics&lt;ref&gt;Tresser 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and supporters&lt;ref&gt;Whitley 2000: 90&lt;/ref&gt; in his rendering of [[Cennino Cennini]]'s medieval gesso recipes.&lt;ref&gt;Herringham 1899&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Jackson (calligrapher)|Donald Jackson]], a British calligrapher, has sourced his gesso recipes from earlier centuries a number of which are not presently in English translation.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1981: 81&lt;/ref&gt; Graily Hewitt created the patent announcing the award to [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] of the title of Duke of Edinburgh on November 19, 1947, the day before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt 1944-1953&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston’s pupil, [[Anna Simons]], was instrumental in sparking off interest in calligraphy in Germany with her German translation of ''Writing and Illuminating, and Lettering'' in 1910.&lt;ref name="ejf" /&gt; Austrian [[Rudolf Larisch]], a teacher of lettering at the Vienna School of Art, published six lettering books that greatly influenced German-speaking calligraphers. Because German-speaking countries had not abandoned the Gothic hand in printing, Gothic also had a powerful effect on their styles.

[[Rudolf Koch]] was a friend and younger contemporary of Larisch. Koch's books, type designs, and teaching made him one of the most influential calligraphers of the 20th century in northern Europe and later in the U.S. Larisch and Koch taught and inspired many European calligraphers, notably [[Karlgeorg Hoefer]], and [[Hermann Zapf]].&lt;ref&gt;Cinamon 2001; Kapr 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary typefaces used by computers, from word processors like [[Microsoft Word]] or [[Apple Pages]] to professional designers' software like [[Adobe InDesign]], owe a considerable debt to the past and to a small number of professional typeface designers today.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Mediaville|first=Claude|title=Calligraphy: From Calligraphy to Abstract Painting|year=1996|publisher=Scirpus-Publications|location=Belgium|isbn=9080332518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henning, W.E.|year=2002|title=An Elegant Hand: The Golden Age of American Penmanship and Calligraphy|editor-last=Melzer|editor-first=P.|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, Delaware|isbn=978-1584560678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unicode]] provides "Script" and "[[Fraktur]]" Latin alphabets that can be used for calligraphy. See [[Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols]].

'''Central Saint Martins''', often abbreviated to '''CSM''', is a [[public university|public]] [[tertiary education|tertiary]] [[art school]] in London, England. It is a constituent college of the [[University of the Arts London]].{{r|bus|times}} It offers full-time courses at foundation, [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] levels, and a variety of short and summer courses.

It was formerly known as '''Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design''', and before that as '''Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design'''.{{r|aim2}}

==History==
Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design was formed in 1989 from the merger of the [[Central School of Art and Design]], founded in 1896, and [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], founded in 1854.{{r|aim2|alex}} Since 1986 both schools had been part of the [[London Institute]], formed by the [[Inner London Education Authority]] to bring together seven London art, design, fashion and media schools.{{r|hist}} The London Institute became a legal entity in 1988, could award taught degrees from 1993, was granted university status in 2003 and was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004.{{r|hist}} It also includes [[Camberwell College of Arts]], [[Chelsea College of Arts]], the [[London College of Communication]], the [[London College of Fashion]] and [[Wimbledon College of Arts]].

The [[Drama Centre London]], founded in 1963, joined Central Saint Martins in 1999 as an integral school, maintaining its name and teaching approaches. The [[Byam Shaw School of Art]], founded in 1910, was merged into Central Saint Martins in 2003.

===Central School of Art and Design===
[[File:Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design - Blue Plaque.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Central School of Art and Design, Southampton Row, Holborn, London WC1B 4AP: [[Blue Plaque]] for [[William Lethaby]], first Principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts, placed by [[London County Council]] in 1957]]
{{main|Central School of Art and Design}}
The Central School of Art and Design was established as the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896 by [[London County Council]]. It grew directly from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] of [[William Morris]] and [[John Ruskin]]. The first principal, from 1896 until 1911, was [[William Richard Lethaby]]; a [[blue plaque]] in his memory was erected in 1957.{{r|plaque}} The school was at first housed in Morley Hall, rented from the [[Regent Street Polytechnic]]. It moved to purpose-built premises in [[Southampton Row]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]], in 1908.{{r|oxford}} In the same year the [[Royal Female School of Art]], established in 1842, was merged into the school.{{r|aim25b}} Central became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Saint Martin's in 1989.{{r|frieze}}

===Saint Martin's School of Art===
{{main|Saint Martin's School of Art}}
Saint Martin's School of Art was established in 1854 by [[Henry Mackenzie (bishop)|Henry Mackenzie]], [[vicar]] of the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]]. It became independent from the church in 1859.{{r|oxford2}} Frank Martin became head of the [[sculpture]] department in 1952; he brought in young sculptors and recent graduates of the department as teachers. Among these, [[Anthony Caro]] was particularly influential. The group around him came to be known as the New Generation of British sculptors and the sculpture department of Saint Martin's became, in the words of [[Tim Scott (artist)|Tim Scott]]: "the most famous in the art world".{{r|mclean}} Saint Martin's became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Central in 1989.

===Drama Centre London===
{{Main|Drama Centre London}}
The [[Drama Centre London]] was founded in 1963 by a breakaway group of teachers and students from the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], led by John Blatchley, [[Yat Malmgren]] and Christopher Fettes. The school is a member of [[Drama UK]]{{r|dramauk}} and its undergraduate [[Acting]] course is accredited by Drama UK.{{r|dramauk2}} The Drama Centre London merged with Central Saint Martins in 1999.

===Byam Shaw School of Art===
{{main|Byam Shaw School of Art}}

Byam Shaw School of Art was founded by the artists [[Byam Shaw|John Byam Shaw]] and [[Rex Vicat Cole]] in 1910 as a school of [[drawing]] and [[painting]]. It was originally located in Campden Street, [[Kensington]], and moved to larger premises in [[Archway, London|Archway]] in 1990. It was subsumed by Central Saint Martins in 2003.

==Awards and assessment==
In 1998 the London Institute received a [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for the "massive contribution" of Central Saint Martins College of Art &amp; Design to the growth of the fashion industry in Britain.{{r|royal}}  The University of the Arts London received a Queen's Anniversary Prize in 2013, for the contribution of CSM industrial and product design graduates to commerce, industry and the design profession.{{r|rat}}

CSM does not receive independent assessment in the ''[[Complete University Guide]]'' league tables, but is ranked as part of the University of the Arts London. In 2014 the university received an overall ranking of 67 out of 124 institutions, with a rank of 102 for graduate prospects and 123 for student satisfaction with teaching.{{r|indepedent|cug}} In 2018 it was placed 83rd out of 129 universities, with a rank of 125 for student satisfaction.{{r|cug2}} 

==Schools and location==
Teaching at Central Saint Martins is organised into nine programmes, which include acting, art, design, fashion, graphics and jewellery and textiles, as well as foundation courses.{{r|programmes}}

Central Saint Martins moved to a converted warehouse complex on [[Granary Square]] at [[King's Cross, London|King's Cross]] in 2011. Most of the college is housed there, but it also uses the former Byam Shaw building in Elthorne Road, [[Archway, London|Archway]], and premises in Richbell Place, [[Holborn]].{{r|locations}}

'''Dafen''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|大|芬}}|p={{linktext|Dà|fēn}}|j=daai6 fan1}}) is a suburb of [[Buji Town|Buji]], [[Longgang District, Shenzhen|Longgang]], [[Shenzhen]] in [[Guangdong]] province, [[China]]. The area is an artist village for the production of replicas of masterworks and [[Business process outsourcing in China|outsourcing]] of original art creation.&lt;ref name="crave"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Not Outsource All Your Art Ideas to China|work=Crave|date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
In the early 1990s a group of about twenty artists under the leadership of the painter and businessman Huang Jiang took up residence in this town. They specialised in the making of large numbers of replicas of [[oil painting]]s by masters such as [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]], [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]], [[Rembrandt]] or [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/12/workshop_of_the_world_fine_art.php "Workshop of the world, fine arts division", theatlantic.com (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replicas==
These replicas were sold in many countries for relatively low prices. The endeavor was quite successful and the demand for replicas increased. In order to fulfill the demand more and more artists took up residence and started to make a living, the estimate (2006) being in the thousands.

Many of the artists are trained at art academies in the required techniques and produce dozens of replicas daily.

The official policy states that these replicas are of paintings of artists who have died more than seventy years ago and consequently out of [[copyright]]. An obvious exception to this would be Andy Warhol (cited above) who died in 1987, and Dalí, who died in 1989.

The only requirement is that it is made clear that these paintings are replicas. Currently, the village sells both originals and replicas. It is possible to commission paintings for low prices. The village is a gated development, recognizable by the large sculpture of a hand holding a paintbrush outside its gates.

The '''Garden of the Missing in Action''' ({{lang-he|גן הנעדרים}}, ''Gan HaNe'edarim'', Garden of the Missing ones) is an [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|unknown soldier memorial]] and commemorative garden on [[Mount Herzl]] in [[Jerusalem]] dedicated to [[Israeli MIAs]].

The garden memorializes fighters and officers of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and [[Land of Israel|pre-state]] MIAs starting from 1914, whose resting place is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeliem.com/content/2004/704.html Mount Herzl: The Creation of Israel's National Cemetery Mount Herzl]&lt;/ref&gt; The garden was inaugurated in February 2004 in a ceremony attended by army chiefs, the Israeli [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Defense Minister]] [[Shaul Mofaz]], and members of the [[Jerusalem Municipality]]. The garden also contains memorials to those lost aboard the submarine [[INS Dakar|INS ''Dakar'']] and the [[Operation Boatswain|''"23 Who Went Down at Sea"]] of May 1941. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, over 400 Israeli soldiers have been declared "Missing in Action."{{fact|date=June 2013}} The construction of the Garden of the Missing on Mt. Herzl was initiated and headed by [[Moshe Oren]], as head of the Ministry of Defense Commemoration Division.

An annual memorial service for the Missing Soldiers of Israel takes place in the garden's main plaza on the [[Seventh of Adar]], the day in the Hebrew calendar which marks the traditional date of the death of [[Moses]], whose grave is known only to God, according to the [[Hebrew Bible]].

'''''The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel''''' ({{lang-fr|La vie de Gargantua et de Pantagruel}}) is a [[pentalogy]] of novels written in the 16th century by [[François Rabelais]], which tells of the adventures of two [[giant (mythology)|giants]], Gargantua ({{IPAc-en|g|ɑːr|ˈ|g|æ|n|tj|u|ə}}; {{IPA-fr|ɡaʁɡɑ̃tya|lang}}) and his son Pantagruel ({{IPAc-en|p|æ|n|ˈ|t|æ|g|r|u|ɛ|l|,_|-|əl|,_|ˌ|p|æ|n|t|ə|ˈ|g|r|uː|əl}}; {{IPA-fr|pɑ̃taɡʁyɛl|lang}}). The text is written in an amusing, extravagant, and [[satire|satirical]] vein, and features much crudity, [[scatological humor]], and violence (lists of explicit or vulgar insults fill several chapters).

The censors of the [[Collège de la Sorbonne]] stigmatized it as obscene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | publication-place = Chicago, USA | title = Rabelais | publication-date = 1952 | first1 = François | last1 = Rabelais | series = Great Books of the Western World | volume = 24 | others = Robert Maynard Hutchins (editor-in-chief), Mortimer J. Adler (associate editor), Sir Thomas Urquhart (translator), Peter Motteux (translator) | chapter = Biographical Note }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a social climate of increasing [[religious oppression]] in a lead up to the [[French Wars of Religion]], it was treated with suspicion, and contemporaries avoided mentioning it.&lt;ref name="LeCadet09"&gt;Le Cadet, Nicolas (2009) ''[http://crm.revues.org/index11852.html Marcel De Grève, La réception de Rabelais en Europe du XVIe au XVIIIe siècle]'', Cahiers de recherches médiévales et humanistes, Comptes rendus (par année de publication des ouvrages), 2009, [En ligne], mis en ligne le 20 avril 2010. Consulté le 22 novembre 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rabelais, the philosophy of his giant Pantagruel, "Pantagruelism", is rooted in "a certain gaiety of mind pickled in the scorn of fortuitous things" (French: ''une certaine gaîté d'esprit confite dans le mépris des choses fortuites'').

Rabelais had studied [[Ancient Greek]] and he applied it in inventing hundreds of new words in the text, some of which became part of the French language.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail. ''Rabelais and his World''. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1984. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Wordplay and risqué humor abound in his writing.

==Initial publication==
Although different editions divide the work into a varying number of tomes, the original book is a single novel consisting of five volumes.

==Plot summary==

{{Wikisource|Pantagruel|''Pantagruel''}}
The full [[modern English]] title for the work commonly known as '''''Pantagruel''''' is '''''The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Very Renowned Pantagruel King of the Dipsodes, Son of the Great Giant Gargantua''''' and in French, ''Les horribles et épouvantables faits et prouesses du très renommé Pantagruel Roi des Dipsodes, fils du Grand Géant Gargantua''. The original title of the work was ''Pantagruel roy des dipsodes restitué à son naturel avec ses faictz et prouesses espoventables''.&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033&gt;{{cite book | last = Rabelais | first = François | authorlink = François Rabelais |author2=Jacques Boulenger | title = Rabelais Oeuvres Complètes | publisher = Gallimard | year = 1955 | location = France | pages = 1033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most modern editions of Rabelais's work place Pantagruel as the second volume of a series, it was actually published first, around 1532 under the [[pen name]] "Alcofribas Nasier",&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt; an [[anagram]] of ''François Rabelais''.

''Pantagruel'' was a sequel to an anonymous book entitled ''The Great Chronicles of the Great and Enormous Giant Gargantua'' (in French, ''Les Grandes Chroniques du Grand et Enorme Géant Gargantua''). This early ''Gargantua'' text enjoyed great popularity, despite its rather poor construction. Rabelais's giants are not described as being of any fixed height, as in the first two books of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', but vary in size from chapter to chapter. For example, in one chapter Pantagruel is able to fit into a courtroom to argue a case, but in another the narrator resides inside Pantagruel's mouth for 6 months and discovers an entire nation living around his teeth.

At the beginning of this book, Gargantua's wife dies giving birth to Pantagruel, who grows to be as giant and scholarly as his father. Rabelais gives a catalog of his reading, mostly humorously-titled books, and judgements in nonsensical legal cases. "The lion's share of ''Pantagruel''{{'}}s seventh chapter consists of a concluding catalog attributed to the Abbey of Saint-Victor," states Bodemer in his essay, "Rabelais and the Abbey of Saint-Victor Revisited".&lt;ref&gt;Brett Bodemer. "Rabelais and the Abbey of Saint-Victor Revisited." ''Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History'' 47.1 (2012): 4–17&lt;/ref&gt;

He befriends hard-partying jokester [[Panurge]]. Together with a group of friends, they intoxicate an army of invading giants, burn their camp, and drown survivors in urine. Epistemon, decapitated in the fray, recovers when Panurge sews his head back to his body. He reports that souls in hell are poorly paid and work bad jobs, but that's the extent of their torments. Another battle is missed by the narrator, who is exploring the civilization in Pantagruel's mouth at the time.

[[File:Gustave Doré - Gargantua.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Gargantua]] and "Pilgrims eaten in salads'', illustration [[Gustave Doré]], 1873.]]
After the success of ''Pantagruel'', Rabelais revisited and revised his source material. He produced an improved narrative of the life and acts of Pantagruel's father in '''''The Very Horrific Life of Great Gargantua, Father of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''La vie très horrifique du grand Gargantua, père de Pantagruel''), commonly known as '''''Gargantua'''''. This volume begins with the miraculous birth of Gargantua after an 11-month pregnancy.

The labor is so difficult, his mother threatens to castrate his father, Lord [[Grandgousier]]. The giant Gargantua emerges at his mother's left ear, calling for ale, while 17,913 cows were required for the provision of his daily milk. His first garment featured a codpiece whose "exiture, outjecting or outstanding ... was of the length of a yard",&lt;ref&gt;Gargantua and Pantagruel, Rabelais, Urquhart translation, Chapters 1.VII and VIII&lt;/ref&gt; its contents providing so much delight that his three nurses squabble over claims to it.&lt;ref&gt;Urquhart, Chapter 1.XI&lt;/ref&gt; After some indifferent education at home, he is sent to Paris where the crowds so annoy him that he drowns thousands of them in a flood of urine (the survivors laugh so much, the city is renamed "Par Ris").

He steals the bells of St. Anthony, but gives them back after a sophist makes ludicrously self-centered appeals for their return. While he studies diligently in Paris, the neighboring Lord [[Picrochole]]'s bakers are insulted and attacked by Grandgousier's shepherds. A massive retaliatory strike against Grandgousier's lands is finally halted at Seville by the merciless Friar John. Grandgousier sues for peace, but Picrochole arrogantly rebuffs him. Gargantua and Friar John rally the troops and (after Gargantua nearly swallows 6 pilgrims who accidentally fell in his salad) they win a great battle, drive Picrochole back to his city, then overthrow it. As a reward he gives Le Coudray to Gymnaste, Montpensier to Eudemon, Le Rivau to Tolmere, [[Château de Montsoreau|Montsoreau]] to Ithybole, and [[Candes-Saint-Martin|Candes]] to Acamas.

Also as a reward, Friar John is given funds to establish the "anti-church" [[Abbey of Thélème]], which has become one of the most notable parables in Western philosophy. It can be considered a point-by-point critique of the educational practices of the age, or a call for free schooling, or a defense of all sorts of notions on human nature.

===''The Third Book''===
{{Wikisource|The Third Book|''The Third Book''}}
Rabelais then returned to the story of Pantagruel himself in the last three books. In '''''The Third Book of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''Le tiers-livre de Pantagruel''; the original title is ''Le tiers livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel''&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt;), the narrative style changes to a parody of the philosophical dialogue, where the earthy [[Panurge]] gets the last word. He sermonizes against moral restraint and in favor of indebtedness, yet accepts Pantagruel's offer to repay all of his creditors.

Now financially solvent for the first time, Panurge stops wearing his long codpiece and seeks advice about whom to marry. Various auguries (opening Virgil to a random page, inducing prophetic dream through half-hearted fasting) and councillors – the Sibyl of Panzoust, the mute Goatnose, the old poet Raminagrobis, Friar John, a group of learned doctors and lawyers, and a fool – all agree that if he marries, his wife will cheat on him, beat him, and rob him. But he egregiously reinterprets their prophecies in a more favorable light.

In a brief interlude, Pantagruel defends Judge Brindlegoose, who has pronounced sentence by rolling dice for 40 years, on the grounds that he is an old idiot and therefore favored by Fortune. As a last attempt to settle the question of marriage, Pantagruel and Panurge take a sea voyage to consult the Oracle of Bacbuc ("Divine Bottle"). Their ship is well-provisioned with the phallic herb Pantagruelion, for which Rabelais gives a ribald natural history.

===''The Fourth Book''===
{{Wikisource|The Fourth Book|''The Fourth Book''}}
[[File:Dingdong and Panurge.jpg|thumb|left|Dingdong and Panurge]]

The sea voyage continues for the whole of '''''The Fourth Book of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''Le quart-livre de Pantagruel''; the original title is ''Le quart livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel''&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt;). The whole book can be seen as a comical retelling of the [[Odyssey]], or of the story of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]. In ''The Fourth Book'', perhaps his most satirical, Rabelais criticizes the arrogance and wealth of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the political figures of the time, and popular superstitions, and he addresses several religious, political, linguistic, and philosophical issues.

The group sails to East Asia and buys many exotic animals. Panurge quarrels with the sheep merchant Dingdong, and takes his revenge by drowning him and his flock. They pass by the islands of the Bailiffs, whose peasants charge to be beaten. During a terrible storm at sea, Panurge is paralyzed with fear but feigns insufferable bravura afterwards. After slaying a sea-monster and being informed of the death of the giant Lent, they arrive at Wild Island, where the half-sausage inhabitants (called [[Chitterlings]]) mistake Pantagruel for their enemy Lent and attack.

The battle is stopped by a divine winged pig, who excretes mustard on the battlefield. They proceed to Ruach, whose people eat air, to barren Pope-Figland where a farmer and his wife outwit the devil, and to the arrogantly Catholic Papimania, where the people worship the Pope and his [[Decretal]]s. After sailing through a cloud of frozen words and sounds, they come to an island that worships Gaster, the god of food. The book ends when Pantagruel fires a salute at the island of the Muses, and Panurge befouls himself for fear of the sound, and of the "celebrated cat Rodilardus".

===''The Fifth Book''===
{{Wikisource|The Fifth Book|''The Fifth Book''}}
'''''The Fifth Book of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''Le cinquième-livre de Pantagruel''; the original title is ''Le cinquiesme et dernier livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel''&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt;) was published posthumously around 1564, and chronicles the further journeyings of Pantagruel and his friends. At Ringing Island, the company find birds living in the same hierarchy as the Catholic Church.

On Tool Island, the people are so fat they slit their skin to allow the fat to puff out. At the next island they are imprisoned by Furred Law-Cats, and escape only by answering a riddle. Nearby, they find an island of lawyers who nourish themselves on protracted court cases. In the Queendom of Whims, they uncomprehendingly watch a living-figure chess match with the miracle-working and prolix Queen Quintessence.

Passing by the abbey of the sexually prolific Semiquavers, and the Elephants and monstrous Hearsay of Satin Island, they come to the realms of darkness. Led by a guide from Lanternland, they go deep below the earth to the oracle of Bacbuc. After much admiring of the architecture and many religious ceremonies, they come to the sacred bottle itself. It utters the one word "trinc". After drinking liquid text from a book of interpretation, Panurge concludes wine inspires him to right action, and he forthwith vows to marry as quickly and as often as possible.

The last volume's attribution to Rabelais is debatable. The Fifth Book was not published until nine years after his death and includes much material that is clearly borrowed (such as from [[Lucian]]'s ''[[True History]]'' and [[Francesco Colonna]]'s ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]''&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Francon, "Francesco Colonna's 'Poliphili Hypnerotomachia' and Rabelais", ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 50, No. 1 (January 1955), pp. 52–55&lt;/ref&gt;) or of lesser quality than the previous books. In the notes to his translation of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', [[Donald M. Frame]] proposes that the Fifth Book may have been formed from unfinished material that a publisher later patched together. This interpretation has been largely supported by Mireille Huchon in "Rabelais Grammairien",&lt;ref&gt;"Rabelais grammairien. De l'histoire du texte aux problèmes d'authenticité", Mirelle Huchon, in Etudes Rabelaisiennes XVI, Geneva, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; the first book to provide a rigorous grammatical analysis of the matter.

J. M. Cohen, in his Introduction to the [[Penguin Classics]] edition, states that chapters 17–48 were written by another hand using notes left by Rabelais and the general drift of what Rabelais had written of the Fifth Book.

==Analysis==
===Bakhtin's analysis of Rabelais===
&lt;div class="thumb tright"&gt;
&lt;div class="thumbinner" style="width:152px;"&gt;
{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"
|[[Image:Pantagruel01.jpg|150px]]
|-
|[[Image:Gargantua02.jpg|150px]]
|}
&lt;div class="thumbcaption"&gt;An example of the giants' shift in body size, above where people are the size of Pantagruel's foot, and below where Gargantua is hardly twice the height of a human.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
[[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s book ''[[Rabelais and His World]]'' explores Gargantua and Pantagruel and is considered a classic of Renaissance studies.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin declares that for centuries Rabelais' book had been misunderstood. Throughout ''Rabelais and His World'', Bakhtin attempts two things. First, to recover sections of Gargantua and Pantagruel that in the past were either ignored or suppressed. Secondly, to conduct an analysis of the Renaissance [[Social structure|social system]] in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language which was not.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist, pp. 297–299"&gt;Clark and Holquist, pp. 297–299&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts in Rabelais' work: the first is [[carnivalesque]] which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is [[grotesque body|grotesque realism]], which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'', Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist, pp. 297–299"/&gt;

Bakhtin explains that ''carnival'' in Rabelais' work and age is associated with the collectivity, for those attending a [[carnival]] do not merely constitute a crowd. Rather the people are seen as a whole, organized in a way that defies socioeconomic and political organization.&lt;ref name=CH302&gt;Clark and Holquist, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakhtin, "[A]ll were considered equal during carnival. Here, in the town square, a special form of free and familiar contact reigned among people who were usually divided by the barriers of caste, property, profession, and age".&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

At carnival time, the unique [[sense of time]] and space causes the individual to feel he is a part of the collectivity, at which point he ceases to be himself. It is at this point that, through costume and mask, an individual exchanges bodies and is renewed. At the same time there arises a heightened awareness of one's sensual, material, bodily unity and community.&lt;ref name=CH302 /&gt;

Bakhtin says also that in Rabelais the notion of carnival is connected with that of the grotesque. The collectivity partaking in the carnival is aware of its unity in time as well as its historic immortality associated with its continual death and renewal. According to Bakhtin, the body is in need of a type of clock if it is to be aware of its timelessness. The grotesque is the term used by Bakhtin to describe the emphasis of bodily changes through eating, evacuation, and sex: it is used as a [[Measuring instrument|measuring device]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
[[Thomas Urquhart]] first translated the work into English in the mid-17th century, although his translation was incomplete, and [[Peter Anthony Motteux]] completed the translation of the fourth and fifth books. The Urquhart/Motteux version is far from literal, but Urquhart's work was described by [[J. M. Cohen]] in the preface to his 1955 translation as "more like a brilliant recasting and expansion than a translation", although Motteux's contribution was criticised as "no better than competent hackwork... [W]here Urquhart often enriches, he invariably impoverishes". The Urquhart/Motteaux translation is out of copyright, and so it has been used for many reprinted editions, including that of Britannica's ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]''.

William Francis Smith (1842–1919) made a new translation in 1893, trying to match Rabelais' sentence forms exactly, which renders the English obscure in places. For example, the convent prior exclaims against Friar John when the latter bursts into the chapel,

&lt;blockquote&gt;What will this drunken Fellow do here? Let one take me him to prison. Thus to disturb divine Service!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith's version includes copious notes. 

Also well annotated is an abridged but vivid translation of 1946 by Samuel Putnam, which appears in a Viking Portable edition that was still in print as late as 1968. Putnam omitted sections he believed of lesser interest to modern readers, including the entirety of the fifth book.  The annotations occur every few pages, explain obscure references, and fill the reader in as to  original content by him excised.  

John Michael Cohen's modern translation, first published in 1955 by Penguin, "admirably preserves the frankness and vitality of the original", according to its back cover, although it provides limited explanation of Rabelais' word-plays and allusions.

Penguin published a translation by [[M. A. Screech]] in 2006 with an explanatory section preceding each chapter and brief footnotes explaining some of the allusions and puns used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Rabelais |first= François |title=Gargantua and Pantagruel |others= Translated by M.

==Illustrations==
The most famous and reproduced illustrations for ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' were done by [[List of French artists|French artist]] [[Gustave Doré]] and published in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bry Ainé, Paris, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt; Several appear in this article. Over 400 additional drawings were done by Doré for the 1873 second edition of the book. An edition published in 1904 was illustrated by [[Heath Robinson|W. Heath Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of Mr. Francis Rabelais'' published by Grant Richards, London, 1904. Reprinted by The Navarre Society, London, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; Another set of illustrations was done by French artist [[Joseph Hémard]] and published in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Crès, Paris, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In a positive review, ''[[Heavy.com|Heavy]]''{{'}}s Jack Fennimore comended the series saying, "''Good Game'' so far has me impressed. This was clearly a show made by game players, for game players, which is a rarity in most entertainment media. It also made me care about my YouTube Red subscription. And if you have a subscription, I definitely recommend checking the show out. It’s going in a good direction and I can’t wait to see what happens to eSports People."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fennimore |first1=Jack |title=Good Game by Game Grumps Impressions: How Is the&amp;nbsp;Show? |url=https://heavy.com/games/2017/08/good-game-grumps-impressions-youtube-red-esports-jesse-cox/ |website=[[Heavy.com|Heavy]] |accessdate=September 28, 2018 |date=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another favorable critique, ''[[Wikia|Fandom]]''{{'}}s Drew Dietsch praised the series saying, "The plot itself is a little threadbare, but it clearly gives Arin and Dan a chance to showcase their unique comedic chops.

'''Hélène Durand''' (9 August 1883 [[Watermael-Boitsfort]] - 4 August 1934 [[Ukkel]]) was a Belgian botanical illustrator.

She was the daughter of Theophile Durand, a Director of the [[National Botanic Garden of Belgium]] between 1901 and 1912, and Sofie Van Eelde. Her training included courses in both art and botany, and for a while she worked at the [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]]. In 1912 she was employed on a full-time basis at the Garden, which is located in the grounds of [[Bouchout Castle]] in the town of [[Meise]], just north of Brussels. From here she produced illustrations showing great scientific accuracy - these included line drawings and illustrations for the wood museum.

Her unpublished images on the [[gymnosperms]] are particularly attractive, and effectively capture the subtle colours and textures of their cones. The time devoted to her drawing of a cone of ''[[Abies procera]]'' amounted to more than 105 hours. Several of her illustrations have been published in scientific journals.

Hélène Durand shared an apartment with her sister Louise. She suffered from a lung condition which did not respond to the treatments tried. A stay at [[Keerbergen]] in the countryside led only to temporary relief, and she died in the night of 4 August 1934.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bestor.be/wiki_nl/index.php/Durand,_H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_(1883-1934)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plantentuinmeise.be/PUBLIC/GENERAL/HISTORY/durandhelene.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fIPj8NRvuNAC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;dq=helene+durand+1883-1934&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bg-5e11P7Y&amp;sig=k8-ap0XLQze22FOvA8A-zIJWwFk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=crgbVIXEGITA7AbPoICABw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=helene%20durand%201883-1934&amp;f=false "Dictionnaire des femmes belges: XIXe et XXe siècles"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iconoclasm'''&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Literally, "image-breaking", from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:εἰκών|εἰκών]] and [[wikt:κλάω|κλάω]]}}. ''Iconoclasm'' may be also considered as a [[back-formation]] from iconoclast (from Greek εἰκοκλάστης). The corresponding Greek word for iconoclasm is εἰκονοκλασία – ''eikonoklasia''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the social belief in the importance of the destruction of [[icon]]s and other images or monuments, most frequently for religious or political reasons. People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called ''iconoclasts'', a term that has come to be applied figuratively to any individual who challenges "cherished beliefs or venerated institutions on the grounds that they are erroneous or pernicious".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Iconoclast, 2", see also "Iconoclasm" and "Iconoclastic".&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conversely, one who reveres or venerates religious images is called (by iconoclasts) an ''iconolater''; in a [[Byzantine]] context, such a person is called an ''[[iconodule]]'' or ''iconophile''.

The term does not generally encompass the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow (''[[damnatio memoriae]]'').

Iconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion, but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion. Within Christianity, iconoclasm has generally been motivated by those who adopt a literal interpretation of the [[Ten Commandments]], which forbid the making and worshipping of "graven images or any likeness of anything".&lt;ref&gt;"You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them&amp;nbsp;..." (Exodus 20:4–5a, ESV.)&lt;/ref&gt; The later [[Church Fathers]] identified [[Jews]], fundamental iconoclasts, with [[heresy]] and saw deviations from orthodox Christianity and opposition to the veneration of images as heresies that were essentially "Jewish in spirit".&lt;ref name=RobertM1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michael|first1=Robert|title=A history of Catholic antisemitism : the dark side of the church|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-11131-8|pages=28–30|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZnFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=anti-semitism+jews+jewish+heretics+heresy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wc7_FQaTAj&amp;sig=CzUEubnkVNbs8SedIKEa3US63yg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l7_YVMjmKYX5yQO_m4LIBw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=heretic&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of iconoclasm among Christian branches greatly varies. [[Islam]], in general, tends to be more iconoclastic than Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hs.ias.edu/files/Crone_Articles/Crone_Islam_Judeo-Christianity_and_Byzantine_Iconoclasm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Sunni Islam]] being more iconoclastic than [[Shia Islam]].

==Religious iconoclasm==

===Ancient era===
{{Main|Akhenaten}}
[[File:Amun.JPG|thumb|[[Amun]]]]

In the [[Bronze Age]], the most significant episode of iconoclasm occurred in Egypt during the [[Amarna Period]], when [[Akhenaten]], based in his new capital of [[Akhetaten]], instituted a significant shift in Egyptian artistic styles alongside a campaign of intolerance towards the traditional gods and a new emphasis on a state [[monolatry|monolatristic]] tradition [[Atenism|focused on the god]] [[Aten]], the Sun disk— many temples and monuments were destroyed as a result:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In rebellion against [[Egyptian polytheism|the old religion]] and [[High Priest of Amun|the powerful priests]] of [[Amun]], Akhenaten ordered the eradication of all of Egypt's traditional gods. He sent royal officials to chisel out and destroy every reference to Amun and the names of other deities on tombs, temple walls, and cartouches to instill in the people that the [[Aten]] was the one true god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Akhenaten.aspx |title=Akhenaten |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public references to Akhenaten were destroyed soon after his death.

Comparing the [[ancient Egypt]]ians with the [[Israelites]], Jan Assmann writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For Egypt, the greatest horror was the destruction or abduction of the cult images.  In the eyes of the [[Israelites]], the erection of images meant the destruction of [[divine presence]]; in the eyes of the Egyptians, this same effect was attained by the destruction of images.  In Egypt, iconoclasm was the most terrible religious crime; in Israel, the most terrible religious crime was [[idolatry]].  In this respect Osarseph alias Akhenaten, the iconoclast, and the [[Golden Calf]], the paragon of idolatry, correspond to each other inversely, and it is strange that [[Aaron]] could so easily avoid the role of the religious criminal.  It is more than probable that these traditions evolved under mutual influence.  In this respect, [[Moses]] and Akhenaten became, after all, closely related.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann, ''From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change'', pg. 76, 2014, [[The American University in Cairo Press]], {{ISBN|977-416-631-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Byzantine era===
{{Main|Byzantine Iconoclasm}}
[[File:Clasm Chludov detail 9th century.jpg|thumb|[[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], [[Chludov Psalter]], 9th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/1320Hist&amp;Civ/slides/14islam/iconoclasm.JPG |title=Byzantine iconoclasm |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although [[Christian art|widespread use of Christian iconography]] only began as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles after the legalization of Christianity by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] (c. 312 AD), scattered expressions of opposition to the use of images were reported (e.g. Spanish [[Synod of Elvira]]). The period after the reign of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian]] (527–565) evidently saw a huge increase in the use of images, both in volume and quality, and a gathering aniconic reaction.

In the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]], government-led iconoclasm began with [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo&amp;nbsp;III]], following what seems to have been a long period of rising [[Aniconism in Christianity|opposition to the use or misuse of images]].  The religious conflict created political and economic divisions in Byzantine society.  It was generally supported by the Eastern, poorer, non-Greek peoples of the Empire&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Mango, ''The Oxford History of Byzantium,'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; who had to deal frequently with raids from the new Muslim Empire.  On the other hand, the wealthier Greeks of [[Constantinople]], and also the peoples of the Balkan and Italian provinces, strongly opposed iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Byzantine Empire the government had probably been adopting Christian images more frequently. One notable change came in 695, when [[Justinian II]]'s government added a full-face image of Christ on the [[obverse]] of imperial gold coins. The change caused the [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] to stop his earlier adoption of Byzantine coin types. He started a purely Islamic coinage with lettering only.&lt;ref name="RC"&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A letter by the Patriarch Germanus written before 726 to two Iconoclast bishops says that "now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter" but there is little written evidence of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;C Mango, "Historical Introduction", in Bryer &amp; Herrin, eds., ''Iconoclasm'', pp. 2–3., 1977, Centre for Byzantine Studies, [[University of Birmingham]], {{ISBN|0-7044-0226-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- this should come out since there is a main article on the subject - it just needs to be introduced here
===The first iconoclastic period: 730–787===
Sometime between 726 and 730, the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] began the iconoclast campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. (ed.) F. GIOIA, ''The Popes – Twenty Centuries of History'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana (2005), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ordered the removal of an image of [[Jesus]] prominently placed over the [[Chalke]] gate, the ceremonial entrance to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]], and its replacement with a cross.  Some of those assigned to the task were killed by a band of [[iconodules]].&lt;ref name="theoph1"&gt;see Theophanes, ''Chronographia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years conflict developed between those who wanted to use the images, claiming that they were "icons" to be "venerated", and the iconoclasts who claimed they were simply idols. [[Pope Gregory&amp;nbsp;III]] "convoked a synod in 730 and formally condemned iconoclasm as heretical and excommunicated its promoters.  The papal letter never reached Constantinople as the messengers were intercepted and arrested in Sicily by the Byzantines".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. (ed.) F. GIOIA, ''The Popes – Twenty Centuries of History'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana (2005), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine&amp;nbsp;V]] convened the [[Council of Hieria]] in 754.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinstitute.org/index.php/chm/eighth-century/icons/ |title=Issue 54: Eastern Orthodoxy &amp;#124; Christian History Magazine |publisher=Chinstitute.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 338 bishops assembled concluded, "the unlawful art of painting living creatures blasphemed the fundamental doctrine of our salvation—namely, the Incarnation of Christ, and contradicted the six holy synods&amp;nbsp;... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, etc&amp;nbsp;... let him be anathema". This Council claimed to be the legitimate "Seventh Ecumenical Council".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/icono-cncl754.asp |title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Council of Nicaea 787===
[[File:Seventh ecumenical council (Icon).jpg|thumb|An [[icon]] of the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] (17th century, [[Novodevichy Convent]], Moscow).]]
{{Main|Second Council of Nicaea}}
In 780, Constantine&amp;nbsp;VI ascended the throne in Constantinople, but being a minor, was managed by his mother Empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]].  She decided that an ecumenical council needed to be held to address the issue of iconoclasm and directed this request to [[Pope Adrian I]] (772–795) in Rome.  He announced his agreement and called the convention on 1 August 786 in the presence of the Emperor and Empress.  The initial proceedings were interrupted by the violent entry of iconoclast soldiers faithful to the memory of the prior Emperor Constantine&amp;nbsp;V.  This caused the council to be adjourned until a reliable army could be assembled to protect any proceedings. The council was reassembled at [[Nicaea]] 24 September 787.  During those proceedings the following was adopted:

{{quote|... we declare that we defend free from any innovations all the written and unwritten ecclesiastical traditions that have been entrusted to us. One of these is the production of representational art; this is quite in harmony with the history of the spread of the gospel, as it provides confirmation that the becoming man of the Word of God was real and not just imaginary, and as it brings us a similar benefit.  For, things that mutually illustrate one another undoubtedly possess one another's message.

 ... we decree with full precision and care that, like the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, the revered and holy images, whether painted or made of mosaic or of other suitable material, are to be exposed in the holy churches of God, on sacred instruments and vestments, on walls and panels, in houses and by public ways; these are the images of our Lord, God and saviour, Jesus Christ, and of our Lady without blemish, the holy God-bearer, and of the revered angels and of any of the saintly holy men.  The more frequently they are seen in representational art, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these images the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred cult objects.&lt;ref name="Tanner, Norman P. p. 132–136"&gt;Tanner, Norman P., Alberigo, G., Dossetti, J. A., Joannou, P. P., Leonardi, C., and Prodi, P., ''Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils Volume OneNicaea I to Lateran V'', p. 132–136, Sheed &amp; Ward and Georgetown University Press, London and Washington, D.C., {{ISBN|0-87840-490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

(Note:see&lt;ref name="Tanner, Norman P. p. 132–136"/&gt; also for the original pretranslation text of this council in Greek and Latin)

===Views in Byzantine iconoclasm===
Accounts of iconoclast arguments are largely found in iconodule writings.  To understand iconoclastic arguments, one must note the main points:
# Iconoclasm condemned the making of any lifeless image (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;painting or statue) that was intended to represent Jesus or one of the saints. The "Epitome of the Definition of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum" ([[Synod of Hiereia]]) held in 754 declared:&lt;ref name="hieria1"/&gt; 

{{quote|Supported by [[the Holy Scriptures]] and the Fathers, we declare unanimously, in the name of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed one of the [[Christian Church]] every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters&amp;nbsp;... If anyone ventures to represent the divine image (χαρακτήρ, ''charaktēr'') of the Word after the Incarnation with material colours, let him be anathema!&amp;nbsp;... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, let him be anathema!}}

#  For iconoclasts, the only real religious image must be an exact likeness of the prototype—of the same substance—which they considered impossible, seeing wood and paint as empty of spirit and life.  Thus for iconoclasts the only true (and permitted) "icon" of Jesus was the [[Eucharist]], which was believed to be his body and blood.
#  Any true image of Jesus must be able to represent both his divine nature (which is impossible because it cannot be seen nor encompassed) as well his human nature.  But by making an icon of Jesus, one is separating his human and divine natures, since only the human can be depicted (separating the natures was considered [[nestorianism]]), or else confusing the human and divine natures, considering them one (union of the human and divine natures was considered [[monophysitism]]).
#  Icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an innovation in the Church, a Satanic misleading of Christians to return to pagan practice. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Satan misled men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the Creator. The Law of Moses and the Prophets cooperated to remove this ruin.&amp;nbsp;... But the previously mentioned demiurge of evil&amp;nbsp;... gradually brought back idolatry under the appearance of Christianity.&lt;ref name="hieria1"&gt;{{citation |title=Epitome of the Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754 AD |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/icono-cncl754.html |publisher=[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook.html Internet Medieval Sourcebook] |postscript=,}} also available from [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xvi.x.html Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was also seen as a departure from ancient church tradition, of which there was a written record opposing religious images.
[[File:Triumph of Orthodoxy.jpg|thumb|288px|Triumph of Orthodoxy]]
The chief theological opponents of iconoclasm were the monks Mansur ([[John of Damascus]]), who, living in Muslim territory as advisor to the Caliph of Damascus, was far enough away from the Byzantine emperor to evade retribution, and [[Theodore the Studite]], abbot of the [[Stoudios]] monastery in Constantinople.  John declared that he did not venerate matter, "but rather the creator of matter".  However he also declared, "But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me, as if filled with divine energy and grace". He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the Body and Blood of Jesus.

The iconodule response to iconoclasm included:
#  Assertion that the biblical commandment forbidding images of God had been superseded by the incarnation of Jesus, who, being the Second Person of the Trinity, is God incarnate in visible matter. Therefore, they were not depicting the invisible God, but God as He appeared in the flesh. This became an attempt to shift the issue of the incarnation in their favor, whereas the iconoclasts had used the issue of the incarnation against them.
#  Further, in their view idols depicted persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons. Essentially the argument was "all religious images not of our faith are idols; all images of our faith are icons to be venerated". This was considered comparable to [[Old Testament|the Old Testament]] practice of offering burnt sacrifices only to God, and not to any other gods.
#  Moses had been instructed by God according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:18–22|NKJV}} to make golden statues of [[cherubim]] angels on the lid of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:31|NKJV}} God instructed Moses to embroider the curtain which separated the [[Holy of Holies]] in the [[Tabernacle]] with cherubim. Moses had also been told by God to embroider the tent walls of the Tabernacle with cherubim angels according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:1|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|36:8|NKJV}}.
#  Regarding the written tradition opposing the making and veneration of images, they asserted that icons were part of unrecorded oral tradition (''parádosis'', sanctioned in Christianity as authoritative in doctrine by reference to {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:15|NKJV}}, [[Basil the Great]], etc.).
#  Arguments were drawn from the miraculous [[Acheiropoieta]], the supposed icon of the Virgin painted with her approval by St.&amp;nbsp;Luke, and other miraculous occurrences around icons, that demonstrated divine approval of Iconodule practices.
#  Iconodules further argued that decisions such as whether icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved the issue of the proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor.

The first iconoclastic wave happened in [[Wittenberg]] in the early 1520s under reformers [[Thomas Müntzer]] and [[Andreas Karlstadt]]. It prompted [[Martin Luther]], then concealing as ''Junker Jörg'', to intervene.

In contrast to the [[Lutheran]]s who favoured sacred art in their churches and homes,&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Felix2015"/&gt; the [[Reformed]] (Calvinist) leaders, in particular [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven (sculpted) images of God.&lt;ref name="Felix2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Felix|first=Steven|title=Pentecostal Aesthetics: Theological Reflections in a Pentecostal Philosophy of Art and Aesthetics.|date=30 January 2015|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]]|language=English|isbn=9789004291621|page=22|quote=Luther's view was that biblical images could be used as teaching aids,and thus had didactic value. Hence Luther stood against the destruction of images wheras several other reformers (Karlstadt, Zwingli, Calvin) promoted these actions. In the following passage, Luther harshly rebukes Karlstadt on his stance on iconoclasm and his disorderly conduct in reform.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, individuals attacked statues and images. However, in most cases, civil authorities removed images in an orderly manner in the newly Reformed Protestant cities and territories of Europe. 

Significant iconoclastic riots took place in [[Basel]] (in 1529), [[Zurich]] (1523), [[Copenhagen]] (1530), [[Münster]] (1534), [[Geneva]] (1535), [[Augsburg]] (1537), [[Scotland]] (1559), [[Rouen]] (1560) and [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] and [[La Rochelle]] (1562).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekSkZXXjVWUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA148 |title=Neil Kamil, ''Fortress of the soul: violence, metaphysics, and material life'', p. 148 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voracious Idols and Violent Hands|last=Wandel|first=Lee Palmer|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1995|isbn=0-521-47222-9|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvinist iconoclasm in Europe "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany and "antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox" in the Baltic region.&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventeen Provinces]] (now the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of Northern France) were disrupted by widespread Calvinist iconoclasm in the summer of 1566.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise History of Western Art|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|language=English |isbn=9781424069224|page=254|quote=In an episode known as the Great Iconoclasm, bands of Calvinists visited Catholic churches in the Netherlands in 1566, shattering stained-glass windows, smashing statues, and destroying paintings and other artworks they perceived as idolatrous.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]'' and began with the destruction of the statuary of the Monastery of [[Saint Lawrence]] in [[Steenvoorde]] after a ''"Hagenpreek"'', or field sermon, by Sebastiaan Matte. Hundreds of other attacks included the sacking of the Monastery of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]] after a sermon by Jacob de Buysere. The ''Beeldenstorm'' marked the start of the [[Eighty Years' War|revolution]] against the Spanish forces and [[Roman Catholic Church|the Catholic Church]].

The iconoclastic belief caused havoc throughout [[Europe]]. In 1523, specifically due to the Swiss reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]], a vast number of his followers viewed themselves as being involved in a spiritual community that in matters of faith should obey neither the visible Church nor lay authorities. According to Peter George Wallace:

{{quote|"Zwingli's attack on images, at the first debate, triggered iconoclastic incidents in [[Zurich]] and the villages under civic jurisdiction that the reformer was unwilling to condone."  And due to this action of protest against authority, "Zwingli responded with a carefully reasoned treatise that men could not live in society without laws and constraint."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Peter George. ''The Long European Reformation: Religion, Political Conflict, and the Search for Conformity, 1350–1750''. Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the [[Reformation in England]] started during the reign of Anglican monarch [[Henry VIII]], and urged on by reformers such as [[Hugh Latimer]] and [[Thomas Cranmer]], limited official action was taken against religious images in churches in the late 1530s. Henry's young son, [[Edward VI]], came to the throne in 1547 and, under Cranmer's guidance, issued Injunctions for Religious Reforms in the same year and in 1550, an [[Act of Parliament]] "for the abolition and putting away of divers books and images".&lt;ref&gt;Heal, Felicity (2005), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mtGoSCVhRFIC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=1550+statute+for+abolishing+images&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=19oOGbcpPr&amp;sig=r7TeKMsCL2HThPLGZaWl1p-pUIU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2wq0VIHpG5PA7Abw9IDIDw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1550%20statute%20for%20abolishing%20images&amp;f=false ''Reformation in Britain and Ireland''], Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-928015-5}} (pp. 263–4)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[English Civil War]], Bishop [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] of [[Norwich]] described the events of 1643 when troops and citizens, encouraged by a Parliamentary ordinance against superstition and [[idolatry]], behaved thus:

And what a hideous triumph in the market-place before all the country, when all the mangled organ pipes, vestments, both copes and surplices, together with the leaden cross which had newly been sawn down from the Green-yard pulpit and the service-books and singing books that could be carried to the fire in the public market-place were heaped together.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- destruction of another religion's images is not iconoclasm

Within [[Muslim history]], the act of removing idols from the [[Ka'ba]] in Mecca is considered by all believers to be of great symbolic and historical importance.

In general, Muslim societies have [[Aniconism in Islam|avoided the depiction]] of living beings (animals and humans) within such sacred spaces as [[mosque]]s and [[madrasah]]s. This opposition to figural representation is based not on the [[Qur'an]], but on traditions contained within the [[Hadith]]. The prohibition of figuration has not always extended to the secular sphere, and a robust tradition of figural representation exists within [[Islamic art|Muslim art]].&lt;ref name="flood2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flood |first=Finbarr Barry |title=Between cult and culture: Bamiyan, Islamic iconoclasm, and the museum |journal=The Art Bulletin |volume=84 |year=2002 |pages=641–659 |doi=10.2307/3177288}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Western authors have tended to perceive "a long, culturally determined, and unchanging tradition of violent iconoclastic acts" within [[Islamic culture|Islamic society]].&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt;

===Early Islam in Arabia===
The first act of Muslim iconoclasm dates to the beginning of Islam, in 630, when the various statues of [[Arabian mythology|Arabian deities]] housed in the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] were destroyed. There is a tradition that Muhammad spared a fresco of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Muhammad.  A translation of Ishaq's "Sirat Rasul Allah".|publisher=Oxford University Press | last=Guillaume | first=Alfred | authorlink=Alfred Guillaume | year=1955 | page=552 | isbn=978-0-19-636033-1 | quote=Quraysh had put pictures in the Ka'ba including two of Jesus son of Mary and Mary (on both of whom be peace!).&amp;nbsp;... The apostle ordered that the pictures should be erased except those of Jesus and Mary. | url=https://archive.org/details/IbnIshaq-SiratRasulAllah-translatorA.Guillaume | accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was intended to bring an end to the [[idolatry]] which, in the Muslim view, characterized [[Jahiliyya]].

The destruction of the idols of Mecca did not, however, determine the treatment of other religious communities living under Muslim rule after the expansion of the [[caliphate]]. Most Christians under Muslim rule, for example, continued to produce icons and to decorate their churches as they wished. A major exception to this pattern of tolerance in early Islamic history was the "Edict of Yazīd", issued by the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Yazid&amp;nbsp;II]] in 722–723.&lt;ref&gt;A. Grabar, ''L'iconoclasme byzantin: le dossier archéologique'' (Paris, 1984), 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt;
This edict ordered the destruction of crosses and Christian images within the territory of the caliphate. Researchers have discovered evidence that the order was followed, particularly in present-day [[Jordan]], where [[archaeological]] evidence shows the removal of images from the mosaic floors of some, although not all, of the churches that stood at this time. But, Yazīd's iconoclastic policies were not continued by his successors, and Christian communities of the Levant continued to make icons without significant interruption from the sixth century to the ninth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = G.

===Egypt===
[[File:Sphinx of Giza 9059.jpg|thumb|The Sphinx profile in 2010, sans nose]]The [[Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr|missing nose]] on the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] is attributed to iconoclasm by a Sufi Muslim fanatic in the mid-1300s.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;[[al-Maqrīzī]], writing in the 15th century, attributes the damage to [[Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr]], a Sufi Muslim fanatic from the khanqah of Sa'id al-Su'ada, in 1378.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic conquests===
Certain conquering Muslim armies have used local temples or houses of worship as mosques. An example is [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]), which was converted into a mosque in 1453. Most icons were desecrated and the rest were covered with plaster. In the 1920s, Hagia Sophia was converted to a museum, and the restoration of the mosaics was undertaken by the American Byzantine Institute beginning in 1932.

More dramatic cases of iconoclasm by Muslims are found in parts of India where [[Hindu]] and Buddhist temples were razed and mosques erected in their place. Aurangzeb destroyed the famous Hindu temples at [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pauwels|first=Heidi|last2=Bachrach|first2=Emilia|date=2018|title=Aurangzeb as Iconoclast?

Certain Muslim denominations continue to pursue iconoclastic agendas.

A recent act of iconoclasm was the 2001 destruction of the giant [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] by the then [[Taliban]] government of [[Afghanistan]]. The act generated world-wide protests and was not supported by other Muslim governments and organizations. It was widely perceived in the Western media as a result of the Muslim prohibition against figural decoration. Such an account overlooks "the coexistence between the Buddhas and the Muslim population that marveled at them for over a millennium" before their destruction.&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt; The Buddhas had twice in the past been attacked by [[Nadir Shah]] and [[Aurengzeb]]. According to the art historian F.B. Flood, analysis of the Taliban's statements regarding the Buddhas suggest that their destruction was motivated more by political than by theological concerns.&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt; Taliban spokespeople have given many different [[Buddhas of Bamyan#Destruction|explanations of the motives]] for the destruction.

==Political and revolutionary iconoclasm==
[[File:Johannes Adam Simon Oertel Pulling Down the Statue of King George III, N.Y.C. ca. 1859.jpg|thumb|The [[Sons of Liberty]] pulling down the statue of [[George&amp;nbsp;III of the United Kingdom]] on [[Bowling Green (New York City)]], 1776]]

===''Damnatio memoriae''===
{{main|damnatio memoriae}}
Revolutions and changes of regime, whether through uprising of the local population, foreign invasion, or a combination of both, are often accompanied by the public destruction of statues and monuments identified with the previous regime. This may also be known as ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'', the ancient Roman practice of official obliteration of the memory of a specific individual. Stricter definitions of "iconoclasm" exclude both types of action, reserving the term for religious or more widely cultural destruction. In many cases, such as [[Revolutionary Russia]] or [[Ancient Egypt]], this distinction can be hard to make.

Among Roman emperors and other political figures subject to decrees of ''damnatio memoriae'' were [[Sejanus]], [[Publius Septimius Geta]], and [[Domitian]]. Several Emperors, such as [[Domitian]] and [[Commodus]] had during their reigns erected numerous statues of themselves, which were pulled down and destroyed when they were overthrown.

===Iconoclasm in the French Revolution===
&lt;!-- this should be broken out into a separate article --&gt;
Throughout the radical phase of the [[French Revolution]], iconoclasm was supported by members of the government as well as the citizenry.  Numerous monuments, religious works, and other historically significant pieces were destroyed in an attempt to eradicate any memory of the [[Old Regime]].  At the same time, the republican government felt responsible to preserve these works for their historical, aesthetic, and cultural value.  One way the republican government succeeded in their paradoxical mission of preserving and destroying symbols of the Old Regime was through the development of museums.

During the Revolution, a statue of [[King Louis XV]] in the Paris square which until then bore his name, was pulled down and destroyed. This was a prelude to the [[guillotine|guillotining]] of his successor [[Louis XVI]] in the same site, renamed "Place de la Révolution" (at present [[Place de la Concorde]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Idzerda|first=Stanley J.|year=1954|title="Iconoclasm during the French Revolution"|url=|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=60/1|pages=13–26|via=|doi=10.2307/1842743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] on the column at [[Place Vendôme]], Paris was also the target of iconoclasm several times: destroyed after the [[Bourbon Restoration]], restored by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], destroyed during the [[Paris Commune]] and restored by [[Adolphe Thiers]].

===Roland and the Monuments Commission===
The Monuments Commission had a responsibility of preserving art despite its problematic political symbolism. Jean Roland was installed as the Minister of Interior in 1792 and was faced with pressure from the National Convention to destroy symbols of the Old Regime. Roland, given the responsibility of simultaneously preserving and destroying art, found his solution in the form of public museums. The museum served as a representation of France's rich artistic heritage. Roland had an idealistic vision for the opening of the Louvre as a means of showcasing the glory and power of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Bette W. Oliver. From Royal to National: The Louvre Museum and the Bibliotheque Nationale (Lantham: Lexington Book, 2007), p. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public museums===
The Louvre was first opened to the public on August 10, 1793. Its collection was almost entirely composed of art from the monarchy's collection in Versailles. Although the radical government's official purpose of installing this art was to "avoid favoritism among artists," the paintings were "secretly held in high regard."&lt;ref&gt;Emmet, Kennedy. A Cultural History of the French Revolution. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1989): pp. 221, 223&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics believed that the art from the royalist era was superior to the work of contemporary artists and therefore believed that the works served a greater historical and aesthetic purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Emmet 1989, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; These artistic symbols of "royalty, feudalism, and superstition" lost their significance in the passive and detached environment of the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley J. Idzerda, "Iconoclasm during the French Revolution." In The American Historical Review, Vol. 60, No. 1 (Oct., 1954), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Louvre, along with other French museums, was a compromise between the political push to preserve and destroy art. Consequently, the museum represented one form of iconoclasm, as it destroyed the essence and meaning of artistic images while preserving its physical form. French museums stripped art of its culturally specific meaning, separating the great artworks from their potentially counterrevolutionary context. Subsequently, politically controversial works were allowed to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Of Other Spaces." Diacritics. (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the museum freed images from their intended symbolic meaning and allowed French citizens to appreciate the art merely for its aesthetic and technical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari. A Thousand Plateaus. (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1987): 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum houses, defends, preserves, and abstracts by its very nature, and as such, was one of the most significant architectural and conceptual structures to have been conceived in the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;de Certeau, Michel. The Practice of Everyday Life. (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1984): 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Premier Musée des Monuments opened to the public in the year 1795, having been commissioned in October of 1790 to hold artworks collected by the revolutionary government. It eventually became one of the most popular museums in Europe. Its curator, Alexandre Lenoir, preserved religious sculptures and tombs for his museum. He was able to preserve relics of the feudal system by convincing revolutionary leaders of their stylistic merit, and minimizing reverence toward the societies the works portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Christopher M., "Alexandre Lenoir and the Musée des monuments français during the French Revolution," French Historical Studies 12, no. 2 (1981): p. 200–222.&lt;/ref&gt; "Revolutionary museums did not so much eliminate meanings as provide new ones." &lt;ref&gt;Greene 1981, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records compiled by Muslim historian Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai attest to the iconoclasm of [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]]. The first mosque built in Delhi, the "[[Qutb complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque|Quwwat al-Islam]]" was built after the demolition of the Hindu temple built previously by Prithvi Raj and certain parts of the temple were left outside the mosque proper.&lt;ref name="Hai"&gt;Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai "Hindustan Islami Ahad Mein" (Hindustan under Islamic rule), Eng Trans by Maulana Abdul Hasan Nadwi.&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of iconoclasm was common during his reign, although an argument goes that such iconoclasm was motivated more by politics than by religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routes/1200_1299/index_1200_1299.html Index_1200-1299],''Columbia.edu''.&lt;/ref&gt;

No aspect of Aurangzeb's reign is more cited—or more controversial—than the numerous desecrations and even the destruction of Hindu temples.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"&gt;[http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Aurangzeb.htm The South Asian] ''Aurangzeb profile''.&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, tens of thousands of temples were desecrated: their facades and interiors were defaced and their murtis (divine images) looted.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"/&gt; In many cases, temples were destroyed entirely; in numerous instances mosques were built on their foundations, sometimes using the same stones. Among the temples Aurangzeb destroyed were two that are most sacred to Hindus, in [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"&gt;[http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/modern/temple_aurangzeb.html Rajiv Varma] ''Destruction of Hindu Temples by Aurangzeb.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, he had large mosques built on the sites.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"/&gt;

[[File:Benares well.jpg|thumb|The original holy well – Gyanvapi in between temple and mosque.]]
The [[Kesava Deo]] temple in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], marked the place that Hindus believe was the birthplace of Shri [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt; In 1661 Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of the temple, and constructed the Katra Masjid mosque. Traces of the ancient Hindu temple can be seen from the back of the mosque. Aurangzeb also destroyed what was the most famous temple in [[Varanasi]] – the [[Vishwanath Temple]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt;

The temple had changed its location over the years, and in 1585 [[Akbar]] had authorized its location at Gyan Vapi. Aurangzeb ordered its demolition in 1669 and constructed a mosque on the site, whose minarets stand 71&amp;nbsp;metres above the Ganges. Traces of the old temple can be seen behind the mosque. Centuries later, emotional debate about these wanton acts of cultural desecration continues. [[Aurangzeb]] also destroyed the [[Somnath]] temple in 1706.&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt;

[[Hindu nationalists]] claim that Mughals destroyed the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ram Mandir]] in [[Ayodhya]], located at the birthplace of [[Rama]], and built the [[Babri Masjid]] on the holy site, which has since been a source of tension between the Hindu and Muslim communities.

Writer Fernand Braudel wrote in ''A History of Civilizations'' (Penguin 1988/1963, pp.&amp;nbsp;232–236), Islamic rule in India as a "colonial experiment" was "extremely violent", and "the Muslims could not rule the country except by systematic terror. Cruelty was the norm – burnings, summary executions, crucifixions or impalements, inventive tortures. Hindu temples were destroyed to make way for mosques. On occasion there were forced conversions. If ever there were an uprising, it was instantly and savagely repressed: houses were burned, the countryside was laid waste, men were slaughtered and women were taken as slaves."

===During Goa inquisitions===
Diago de Boarda, a priest, and his advisor Vicar General, Miguel Vaz, had made a 41-point plan for torturing Hindus. Under this plan Viceroy Antano de Noronha issued in 1566, an order applicable to the entire area under Portuguese rule:&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgweb.org/unethicalconversion/GoaInquisition.htm |title=The Goa Inquisition by Christian Historian Dr. T. R. de Souza |publisher=Vgweb.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the king, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without my permission. If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1567 the campaign of destroying temples in Bardez met with success. At the end of it 300 Hindu temples were destroyed. In 1583 Hindu temples at [[Assolna]] and [[Cuncolim]] were destroyed through army action.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshipped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers&lt;/blockquote&gt;,

wrote [[Filippo Sassetti]], who was in India from 1578 to 1588.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

An order was issued in June 1684 eliminating the [[Konkani language]] and making it compulsory to speak [[Portuguese language]].  Following that law all the symbols of non-Christian sects were destroyed and the books written in local languages were burnt.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

===In Pakistan===
{{Further|Decline of Hinduism in Pakistan}}
Several Hindu temples have been destroyed in Pakistan. A notable incident was the destruction of the [[Ramna Kali Mandir]] in former [[East Pakistan]]. The temple was bulldozed by the Pakistani Army on March 27, 1971. The [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] was severely damaged during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and over half of the temple's buildings were destroyed. In a major disrespect of the religion, the main worship hall was taken over by the [[Pakistan]] Army and used as an ammunitions storage area. Several of the temple custodians were tortured and killed by the Army though most, including the Head Priest, fled first to their ancestral villages and then to India and therefore escaped death.

In 2006 the last Hindu temple in [[Lahore]] was destroyed to pave the way for construction of a multi-story commercial building. The temple was demolished after officials of the Evacuee Property Trust Board concealed facts from the board chairman about the nature of the building. When reporters from Pakistan-based newspaper ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' tried to cover the incident, they were accosted by the henchmen of the property developer, who denied that a Hindu temple existed at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2006/05/28/nat23.htm Another temple is no more], ''Dawn''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several political parties in Pakistan have objected to this move, such as the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistani Muslim League-N.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.rediff.com/news/2006/jun/13temple.htm Hindu temple in Lahore demolished],''Rediff.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-06-13/pakistan/27788614_1_hindu-temple-hindus-and-sikhs-eptb Only Hindu Temple in Lahore demolished],''Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; The move has also evoked strong condemnation in India from minority bodies and political parties, including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], as well as Muslim advocacy political parties such as the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1651762.cms India protests demolition of Hindu temple in Pak], ''Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; A firm of lawyers representing the Hindu minority has approached the Lahore High Court seeking a directive to the builders to stop the construction of the commercial plaza and reconstruct the temple at the site. The petitioners maintain that the demolition violates section 295 of the Pakistan Penal Code prohibiting the demolition of places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/06/16/10047337.html Order for temple's reconstruction sought],''Gulf News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2005, following the arrest of an illiterate Christian janitor on allegations of allegedly burning Qur'an pages, a mob of between 300 and 500 Muslims destroyed a Hindu temple and houses belonging to Christian and Hindu families in [[Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]]. Under the terms of a deal negotiated between Islamic religious leaders and the Hindu/Christian communities, Pakistani police later released all previously arrested perpetrators without charge.&lt;ref name="usdep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71443.htm |title=US Department of State International Religious Freedom Report 2006 |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Malaysia===
Between April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row – a dab of sensibility please], ''malaysiakini.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatago.com/talk/politics/mideast/12428067.html Muslims Destroy Century-Old Hindu Temple,''gatago.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built "illegally". However, several of the temples are centuries old.&lt;ref name="Finexp"&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 Hindu group protests "temple cleansing" in Malaysia], ''Financial Express''.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2006, armed city hall officers from [[Kuala Lumpur]] forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus.&lt;ref name="Finexp"/&gt;

===In Saudi Arabia===
On March 24, 2005, [[Government of Saudi Arabia|Saudi authorities]] destroyed religious items found in a raid on a makeshift Hindu shrine found in an apartment in [[Riyadh]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Paul. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060522223359/http://www.freedomhouse.org/religion/news/bn2005/bn-2005-00-16.htm Saudi Arabia's Religious Police Crack Down]''. Freedom House.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Fiji===
In Fiji according to official reports, attacks on Hindu institutions increased by 14% compared to 2004. This intolerance of Hindus has found expression in anti-Hindu speeches and destruction of temples, the two most common forms of immediate and direct violence against Hindus. Between 2001 and April 2005, one hundred cases of temple attacks have been registered with the police. The alarming increase of temple destruction has spread fear and intimidation among the Hindu minorities and has hastened immigration to neighboring Australia and New Zealand. Organized religious institutions, such as the Methodist Church of Fiji, have repeatedly called for the creation of a theocratic Christian State and have propagated anti-Hindu sentiment.&lt;ref name="Hindusin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hafsite.org/pdf/hhr_2005_html/fijiislands.htm |title=Hindus in South Asia and the Diaspora: A Survey of Human Rights 2005 |publisher=Hafsite.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; State favoritism of Christianity, and systematic attacks on temples, are some of the greatest threats faced by Fijian Hindus. Despite the creation of a human rights commission, the plight of Hindus in Fiji continues to be precarious.&lt;ref name="Hindusin" /&gt;
 --&gt;

===Chinese iconoclasm===
{{further|Anti-Western sentiment in China}}
There have been [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|a number of anti-Buddhist campaigns]] in [[Chinese history]] that led to the destruction of [[Buddhist temple]]s and images. One of the most notable of these campaigns was the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]] of the [[Tang dynasty]].

During and after the [[Xinhai Revolution]], there was widespread destruction of religious and secular images in [[China]].

During the [[Northern Expedition]] in [[Guangxi]] in 1926, [[Kuomintang]] General [[Bai Chongxi]] led his troops in destroying Buddhist temples and smashing Buddhist images, turning the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai%20smashing%20idols%20decapitating%20statues&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=98|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that almost all of the [[vihara]]s in Guangxi were destroyed and the [[bhikkhu|monks]] were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxDUeWdMubkC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=bai+chongxi+buddhist+temples#v=onepage&amp;q=bai%20chongxi%20buddhist%20temples&amp;f=false|title=Toward a modern Chinese Buddhism: Taixu's reforms|author=Don Alvin Pittman|year=2001|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=|page=146|isbn=0-8248-2231-5|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bai also led a wave of anti-foreignism in Guangxi, attacking Americans, Europeans, and other foreigners, and generally making the province unsafe for foreigners and [[missionaries]]. Westerners fled from the province and some [[Chinese Christians]] were also attacked as imperialist agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=snippet&amp;q=missionary%20crowd&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three goals of the movement were anti-foreignism, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[anti-religion]]. Bai led the anti-religious movement against [[superstition]]. [[Huang Shaohong]], also a Kuomintang member of the [[New Guangxi clique]], supported Bai's campaign. The anti-religious campaign was agreed upon by all Guangxi Kuomintang members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai's%20as%20a%20moslem%20other%20religions&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was extensive destruction of religious and secular imagery in [[Tibet]] after it was [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1910)|invaded]] and [[occupation of Tibet|occupied]] by China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9376-6_23|title=The Changing World Religion Map|last=Karan|first=P.

Many religious and secular images were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] of 1966-1976, ostensibly because they were a holdover from China's traditional and capitalist past (which the Communist regime led by [[Mao Zedong]] reviled). The Cultural Revolution included widespread destruction of historic artworks in public places and private collections, whether religious or secular. Objects in state museums were mostly left intact.

===Iconoclasm in Eastern Europe===
[[File:Christ saviour explosion.jpg|thumb|Demolition of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Moscow]], 5 December 1931]]
During and after the [[October Revolution]], widespread destruction of religious and secular imagery took place, as well as the destruction of imagery related to [[House of Romanov|the Imperial family]]. The Revolution was accompanied by destruction of monuments of past [[tsar]]s, as well as the destruction of [[Coat of arms of Russia|imperial eagles]] at various locations throughout [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. According to Christopher Wharton, "In front of a Moscow cathedral, crowds cheered as the enormous statue of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;III]] was bound with ropes and gradually beaten to the ground. After a considerable amount of time, the statue was decapitated and its remaining parts were broken into rubble".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wharton, [http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=2514&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4797 "The Hammer and Sickle: The Role of Symbolism and Rituals in the Russian Revolution"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528035402/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=2514&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4797 |date=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] actively destroyed religious sites, including [[Russian Orthodox]] churches and [[Jewish cemeteries]], in order to discourage religious practice and curb the activities of religious groups.
 
During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and during the [[Revolutions of 1989]], protesters often attacked and took down sculptures and images of [[Joseph Stalin]], such as the [[Stalin Monument (Budapest)|Stalin Monument]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Auyezov|first=Olzhas|title=Ukraine says blowing up Stalin statue was terrorism|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/05/us-ukraine-stalin-idUSTRE7043D920110105|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of communism in 1989 was also followed by the destruction or removal of statues of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other Communist leaders in the [[former Soviet Union]] and in other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Particularly well-known was the destruction of "[[Felix Dzerzhinsky#Iron Felix|Iron Felix]]", the statue of [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] outside the [[KGB]]'s headquarters. Another statue of Dzerzhinsky was destroyed in a [[Warsaw]] square that was named after him during [[communist Poland|communist rule]], but which is now called [[Bank Square, Warsaw|Bank Square]].

===Other examples===

Other examples of political destruction of images include:
* During the [[American Revolution]], the [[Sons of Liberty]] pulled down and destroyed the [[gilding|gilded]] lead statue of [[George&amp;nbsp;III of the United Kingdom]] on [[Bowling Green (New York City)]], melting it down to be recast as [[Musket#Ammunition|ammunition]]. Similar acts have accompanied the independence of most ex-colonial territories.  Sometimes relatively intact monuments are moved to a collected display in a less prominent place, as in India and also post-Communist countries.
* From the 16th through the 19th centuries, many of the polytheistic religious deities and texts of pre-colonial Americas, Oceania and Africa were destroyed by Christian missionaries and their converts, such as during the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] and the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]].
* In 1942 the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy Government of France]] took down and melted Clothilde Roch's statue of the 16th-century dissident  intellectual [[Michael Servetus]], who had been burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] at the instigation of [[John Calvin|Calvin]]. The Vichy authorities disliked the statue, as it was a celebration of freedom of conscience. In 1960, having found the original molds, the municipality of Annemasse had it recast and returned the statue to its previous place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Goldstone, Nancy Bazelon |author2=Goldstone, Lawrence |title=Out of the Flames: The Remarkable Story of a Fearless Scholar, a Fatal Heresy, and One of the Rarest Books in the World |publisher=Broadway |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-7679-0837-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}pp. 313-316&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israel Tsvaygenbaum''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Исраил Иосифович Цвайгенбаум}}; {{lang-he|ישראל צווייגנבאום}}; born February 1, 1961), is a [[Russian American|Russian-American]] artist of [[Jew]]ish descent. A number of his works are in the Museum of Imitative Arts,&lt;ref&gt;A new name of the museum is: ''Historic and Archaeologist Museum Reserve''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two graphical works (ink on paper) ''The Sarcasm of Fate'' and ''The Grief of People''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derbent]].

==Biography==

Tsvaygenbaum was born in the Southern Russian city of [[Derbent]], one of the oldest cities in the world. The population is predominantly Muslim, but there are also Jewish families residing there.  Tsvaygenbaum's parents are Jewish. His father, from [[Będzin|Bedzin]], [[Poland]], escaped to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]]. Tsvaygenbaum's mother was a [[Mountain Jews|Mountain Jew]] from [[Dagestan]], Russia.

The culture and dynamic of the life of the area where Tsvaygenbaum grew up and his Jewish background are reflected in his paintings. The Russian newspaper ''Derbentskie izvestiya'' (Russian: [[:ru:Районные газеты Дагестана|''Дербентские известия'']])&lt;ref name='rhapsody'&gt;Derbentskie izvestiya –  ''Jewish Rhapsody'', M. Matatova. May 6.1994.P.4&lt;/ref&gt; once wrote about Tsvaygenbaum's work:

{{quote|The theme of loneliness and melancholy is prevalent in many of the paintings, such as ''Nostalgia'', ''Lonely'', ''The Nailed Men'', and others. This theme is inspired by images from the artist's father, who is from Poland. In 1939, at the age of 29, he fled Poland to escape the brown plague [Nazis]. His other relatives were killed. The composition of the pictures reveals sadness and melancholy.}}

Another paragraph in the newspaper says:

{{quote|The palette of the colors in the paintings is moderate and muffled. This is a palette of autumn, in which the gold of the birch harmonizes with the copper of the oak tree's leaves. The crimson of the maple tree harmonizes with the darkness of bare branches.}}

From 1976 to 1980 Tsvaygenbaum studied art at Izberbash College, [[Izberbash]], Dagestan. In 1991, he completed his masters in Fine Arts at Kuban State University, [[Krasnodar]]. Tsvaygenbaum organized ''Coloring'',&lt;ref&gt;Znamya Kommunizma – ''The Meeting of Muse'', I. Tsvaygenbaum, December 1, 1988. P4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='coloring'&gt;Znamya Kommunizma – ''The Artist's Lounge'', B. Menaev&lt;/ref&gt; an association of artists, in Derbent in 1986. ''Coloring'' had art shows in Derbent and in the Art Gallery in [[Makhachkala]], [[Dagestan]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Znamya Kommunizma – The Exhibition of ''Coloring'', S. Lekova&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Znamya Kommunizma – ''The Relationship Is Getting Stronger'', S. Lekova&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Znamya Kommunizma – Presents  ''Coloring'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1993 and April 1994 Tsvaygenbaum had his last two shows in Russia. Both shows were two solo exhibitions held in Moscow, the first at East Gallery&lt;ref&gt;Vatan – ''The Philosophy of Life'', M. Matatova. December 14, 1993. P3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TV-6 (Russia)|TV-6]], Moscow – [[Ostankino Tower|''Ostankino'']]. [[:ru:Северная корона (телекомпания)|Channel "North Crown"]], Interviewed by journalist: D. Botonogov, November 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second, ''JEWISH RHAPSODY'', at The Central House of Artist on Krymsky Val.&lt;ref&gt;Vatan — ''Jewish Rhapsody'', M. Matatova. May 13, 1994. P3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonid Babushkin — ''Jewish Rhapsody'', Moscow, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TV-6 (Russia)|TV-6]], Moscow – [[Ostankino Tower|''Ostankino'']]. [[:ru:Северная корона (телекомпания)|Channel "North Crown"]], Interviewed by journalist: D. Botonogov, March 18 &amp; 22, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Channel One (Russian TV channel)|Channel One]], Moscow – [[Ostankino Tower|''Ostankino'']]. TV Program: [[:ru:Доброе утро (телепередача)|"Morning"]], Interviewed by journalist: D. Botonogov, March 28, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The artist dedicated ''JEWISH RHAPSODY'' to his father.&lt;ref name='rhapsody' /&gt;

In July 1994, Tsvaygenbaum and his family left Russia because it had become very dangerous for his family to continue to live in the republic of [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref name='art'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelartgod.com/Bio.html |title=The Biography of Israel Tsvaygenbaum |publisher=Israelartgod.com |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, he is a resident of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York. In the USA Tsvaygenbaum has continued to work with oil on canvas. His paintings continue to portray both universal and Jewish themes, but noticeably, his palette has shifted from browns to yellows.

On December 25, 2016 in Europe and in Israel and on January 15, 2017 in the USA, [[RTVi]] broadcast an interview with Tsvaygenbaum in the program "In New York with Victor Topaller," where the artist talked about his artwork, life and interesting people that he encountered in his life.&lt;ref name='rtvi'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qq4m9xLN9U|title=Israel Tsvaygenbaum on the RTVi program "In New York with Victor Topaller"|publisher=rtvi.com|date=|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] as a sin. Judaism teaches that to sin is a part of life, since there is no perfect man and everyone has an [[Yetzer harah|inclination]] to do evil "from his youth".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis:8:21|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.torah.org/learning/mlife/ch1law1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins committed with willful intentions go without consequence. Sins committed out of lack of knowledge are not considered sins, since a sin can't be a sin if the one who did it didn't know it was wrong. Unintentional sins are considered less severe sins.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/qorbanot.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism.org"&gt;http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/answers/jewish-polemics/texts/scriptural-studies/leviticus-1711/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sins between people are considered much more severe in [[Judaism]] than sins between man and God. [[Yom Kippur]], the main day of repentance in [[Judaism]], can atone for sins between man and God, but not for sins between man and his fellow, that is until he has appeased his friend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishnah]], [[Yoma]],8:9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks.org"&gt;http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9670&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=310&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleazar ben Azariah]] derived [this from the verse]: "From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed" ([[Book of Leviticus]], 16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.&lt;ref name="mechon-mamre.org"&gt;http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0316.htm#30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuster 1986"&gt;Simon and Schuster, 1986, Nine Questions People Ask About Judaism, New York: Touchstone book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thetorah.com"&gt;http://thetorah.com/historical-uniqueness-and-centrality-of-yom-kippur/&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer [[Karbanot]] (sacrifices) for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of ''karbanot'' is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, ''karbanot'' only expiate unintentional sins, that is, sins committed because a person forgot that this thing was a sin or by error. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress or through lack of knowledge, and for the most part, ''karbanot'' cannot atone for a malicious, deliberate sin. In addition, ''karbanot'' have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely [[Repentance in Judaism|repents]] of his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism.org"/&gt;

The completely righteous (means a man who did nothing wrong in his life) enjoy in this life and in the life after. The not completely righteous or completely wicked suffer for their sins in this world in order to atone for their sins through the humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them. If the repentance is not complete in this world, the suffering will continue in the life after (hell).  After the repentance is complete they join the righteous. The completely wicked (a man who did nothing good in his life) cannot correct their sins in this world or in the other, and hence do not suffer for them here, but in ''[[Gehenna|gehinom]]'' (hell). The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave ''gehinom'', because they don't or can't repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this, but God's justice is long, precise and just.&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16693.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tanakh==
The first mention of sin as a noun is a [[zoomorphism]], with sin (''hattath'') crouching at [[Cain]]'s door. The first as a verb is [[Abimelech]] being prevented from sinning (''khata'') against God in a dream. In fact the whole [[Tanakh]] is full of references to sins committed by leading people. This is to teach us that no one is perfect, everyone standing in trials/tests, and the thing is to try your best to learn from their mistakes.

People do have the ability to master this inclination ({{bibleverse||Genesis|4:7|HE}}) and choose good over evil (conscience)({{bibleverse||Psalm|37:27|HE}}).&lt;ref name="englishhandbook"&gt;[http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/library/document-library/handbook/The-Jewish-Response-to-Missionaries---English/ English Handbook of Jews for Judaism]&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism uses the term "sin" to include violations of [[halakha|Jewish law]] that are not necessarily a lapse in morality. According to the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]: "Man is responsible for sin because he is endowed with free will ("behirah"); yet he is by nature frail, and the tendency of the mind is to evil: "For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth" (Gen. viii. 21; Yoma 20a; Sanh. 105a). Therefore God in His mercy allowed people to [[repent]] and be [[Forgiveness|forgiven]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=812&amp;letter=S&amp;search=sin JewishEncyclopedia.com - SIN:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism holds that all people sin at various points in their lives, and hold that [[God]] tempers [[justice]] with [[mercy]].

==Terminology==
Hebrew has several other words for sin beyond ''hata'', each with its own specific meaning.  The word ''pesha'', or "trespass", means a sin done out of rebelliousness. The word ''aveira'' means "transgression".  And the word ''avone'', or "iniquity", means a sin done out of moral failing.  The word most commonly translated simply as "sin", ''hata'', literally means "to go astray." Just as Jewish law, ''halakha'', provides the proper "way" (or path) to live, sin involves straying from that path.

Judaism teaches that humans are born with [[free will]], and morally neutral, with both a ''[[yetzer hatov]]'', (literally, "the good inclination", in some views, a tendency towards goodness, in others, a tendency towards having a productive life and a tendency to be concerned with others) and a ''[[yetzer hara]]'', (literally "the evil inclination", in some views, a tendency towards evil, and in others, a tendency towards base or animal behavior and a tendency to be selfish). The yetzer hara in some forms of Judaism means that [[Satan]] is merely an idiom or parable, rather than the [[fallen angel]] of traditional Christianity.

==In rabbinical literature==
[[Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno]] suggests that the verse about a leader begins with the term "when," which implies that committing a sin is inevitable because powerful and wealthy people—the leaders—are also likely to sin. This Torah verse concludes with the words "realizes his guilt" (Leviticus 4:22) because it is essential that powerful people acknowledge and feel remorse for their sin, lest they sin again.

==Transgression==
The generic [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for any kind of sin is ''avera'' (literally: transgression). Based on verses in the [[Hebrew Bible]], Judaism describes three levels of sin. There are three categories of a person who commits an avera. The first one is someone who does an avera intentionally, or "B'mezid." This is the most serious category. The second is one who did an avera by accident. This is called "B'shogeg," and while the person is still responsible for their action it is considered less serious. The third category is someone who is a "[[Tinok Shenishba]]", which is a person who was raised in an environment that was assimilated or non-Jewish, and is not aware of the proper Jewish laws, or halacha. This person is not held accountable for his or her actions.
*''Pesha'' (deliberate sin; in modern Hebrew: crime) or ''Mered'' (lit.: rebellion) - An intentional sin; an action committed in deliberate defiance of God; ([[Strong's Concordance]] :H6588 (''פשע pesha', peh'shah'').  According to Strong it comes from the root (:H6586); rebellion, transgression, trespass.
*''Avon'' (lit.: iniquity) - This is a sin of lust or uncontrollable emotion. It is a sin done knowingly, but not done to defy God; ([[Strong's Concordance]] :H5771 (''avon, aw-vone'').  According to Strong it comes from the root (:H5753); meaning perversity, moral evil:--fault, iniquity, mischief.
*''Cheit'' - This is an unintentional sin, crime or fault. ([[Strong's Concordance]] :H2399 (''חַטָּא chate''). According to Strong it comes from the root ''khaw-taw'' (:H2398, H2403) meaning "to miss, to err from the mark (speaking of an archer), to sin, to stumble."

==States==
Judaism holds that no human being is perfect, and all people have sinned many times. The [[Talmud]] says: "Everyone is responsible to be as great as [[Moses]]", But then the [[Torah]] tells us in [[Deuteronomy]] 34:10 that "No one will ever be as great as Moses". This is to clarify that [[Moses]] fulfilled his own personal potential, so too we are expected to fulfill ours. Each person is born with a unique set of talents and tools. Some are rich, others are poor. Some are tall and some are short. One person can sing, another can write, etc. But these qualities are not what determine your greatness. Rather, it's how you deal with your particular circumstances. That's why Judaism says: It's not important where you are on the ladder, but how many rungs you've climbed. The crucial concept is the effort.&lt;ref name="As Great as Moses"&gt;[http://www.aish.com/atr/As_Great_as_Moses.html As Great as Moses]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is told of [[Zusha of Hanipol|Zusha]], the great [[Chassidic]] master, who lay crying on his deathbed. His students asked him, "Rebbe, why are you so sad? After all the mitzvahs and good deeds you have done, you will surely get a great reward in heaven!". "I'm afraid!" said Zusha. "Because when I get to heaven, I know God's not going to ask me 'Why weren't you more like Moses?' or 'Why weren't you more like King David?' But I'm afraid that God will ask 'Zusha, why weren't you more like Zusha?' And then what will I say?!" &lt;ref name="As Great as Moses"/&gt;

[[Joseph Hertz]] said that sin is not an evil power whose chains the children of flesh must helplessly drag towards a weary tomb. We can always shake off its yoke; and what is more, we need never assume its yoke. An ancient fable tells us of distant oceans with mountainous magnetic rocks of such terrific power that wreck and ruin would befall any ship venturing near them. Instantly the iron nails would fly out of the ship, bolts and fastenings would be torn away by that magnetic force, the vessel would become nothing more than so many planks of wood, and all on board fall a prey to the hungry waters. Sins there are that, likewise, unhinge all our stays of character, rob us of the restraints of past habits and education, and leave us helpless playthings on the billows of temptation and passion. Yet a man is the pilot of his life’s barque, and can at all times steer it so as never to come near those mountains of destruction, darkness, and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oztorah.com/2013/09/penitence-prayer-charity-an-anthology-for-rosh-hashanah-yom-kippur/ ''Rabbi Raymond Apple, Penitence, Prayer &amp; Charity: An anthology for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur''], Publications Committee of the United Synagogue, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the views of [[Rabbeinu Tam]] in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (tractate Rosh HaShanah 17b), God is said to have [[Thirteen Attributes of Mercy]]:

# God is merciful before someone sins, even though God knows that a person is capable of sin. 
# God is merciful to a sinner even after the person has sinned. 
# God represents the power to be merciful even in areas that a human would not expect or deserve. 
# God is compassionate, and eases the punishment of the guilty. 
# God is gracious even to those who are not deserving. 
# God is slow to anger. 
# God is abundant in kindness. 
# God is the God of truth, thus we can count on God's promises to forgive repentant sinners. 
# God guarantees kindness to future generations, as the deeds of the righteous patriarchs ([[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]) have benefits to all their descendants. 
# God forgives intentional sins if the sinner repents. 
# God forgives a deliberate angering of Him if the sinner repents. 
# God forgives sins that are committed in error. 
# God wipes away the sins from those who repent.

As Jews are commanded in ''[[imitatio Dei]]'', emulating God, [[rabbi]]s take these attributes into account in deciding [[Halakha|Jewish law]] and its contemporary application.

==Role of orthopraxy==
Jews recognize two kinds of sin, offenses against other people, and offenses against God. Offenses against God may be understood as violation of a contract (the covenant between God and the Children of Israel). Since the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], Jews have believed that [[orthopraxy|right action]] (as opposed to [[orthodoxy|right belief]]) is the way for a person to atone for one's sins. [[Midrash]] ''Avot de Rabbi Natan'' states the following:

:One time, when Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai was walking in Jerusalem with Rabbi Yehosua, they arrived at where the Temple now stood in ruins. "Woe to us" cried Rabbi Yehosua, "for this house where atonement was made for Israel's sins now lies in ruins!" Answered Rabban Yochanan, "We have another, equally important source of atonement, the practice of ''gemilut hasadim'' ("loving kindness"), as it is stated "I desire loving kindness and not sacrifice" ([http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=16160&amp;showrashi=true Hosea 6:6]).

In Judaism all human beings are believed to have free will and can choose the path in life that they will take.  It does not teach that choosing good is impossible - only at times more difficult.  There is almost always a "way back" if a person wills it. (Although texts mention certain categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, the habitual gossip, and the malicious person)

==Sins between man and his fellow==
Sins between people are considered much more severe in [[Judaism]] than sins between man and God. [[Yom Kippur]], the main day of repent in [[Judaism]] can atones for [[Sins between man and God(Judaism)|Sins between man and God]], but not for [[Sins between man and his fellow(Judaism)|Sins between man and his fellow]], that is until he has appeased his friend.([[Mishnah]], [[Yoma]],8:9).&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks.org"/&gt; [[Eleazar ben Azariah]] derived [this from the verse]: "From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed" ([[Book of Leviticus]],16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.&lt;ref name="mechon-mamre.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuster 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thetorah.com"/&gt;

The [[Gemara]] (87a) continues: "R. Yitzchak said: Whoever aggravates his fellow even through words is required to placate him… R. Yosi bar Chanina said: Whoever beseeches forgiveness from his friend should not beseech him more than three times.  And if he died, [the offender] brings ten people and must stand them by his grave and he says, "I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and so-and-so whom I wounded.""

==Many small sins vs. One big sin==
Two Jews came to a Chassidic Rabbi to ask advice about sins they had committed. One had committed a great sin for which he was sure God would never forgive him; the other was less worried, because he had never been guilty of anything so grave, but only of the normal collection of lesser sins. The Rabbi told them to go out to a field and select stones corresponding to the size and number of their sins, and later to return to the field and scatter the stones. This done, they came back to the Rabbi. “Now go to the field once more,” he told them both, “pick up the stones you scattered, and bring them to me.”

He who had committed the one big sin knew at once which was his stone, and brought it to the Rabbi. The other, however, had scattered so many little stones that he could not be certain of identifying them again. He had a most difficult time in finding his stones and bringing them to the Rabbi. The Rabbi then told them: “Your deeds are like your stones. You who brought one large stone, committed a grave sin. But you were conscious of what you had done, and with a determined effort at repentance you could be forgiven by God. But you, whose sins were many and small, like those of most human beings, have found how hard it is to catch up with one’s minor lapses. And no repentance of yours can possibly be effective until you realise that small things matter.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oztorah.com/2013/09/penitence-prayer-charity-an-anthology-for-rosh-hashanah-yom-kippur/ ''Rabbi Raymond Apple, Penitence, Prayer &amp; Charity: An anthology for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur''], Publications Committee of the United Synagogue, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selflessness vs. selfishness==
{{See also|Golden mean (Judaism)}}
The rabbis recognize a positive value to the ''[[yetzer hara]]'': one tradition identifies it with the observation on the last day of creation that God's accomplishment was "very good" (God's work on the preceding days was just described as "good") and explain that without the ''yetzer ha'ra'' there would be no marriage, children, commerce or other fruits of human labor; the implication is that ''yetzer ha'tov'' and ''yetzer ha'ra'' are best understood not as moral categories of good and evil but as selfless versus selfish orientations, either of which used rightly can serve God's will.

Or as [[Hillel the Elder]] famously summarized the Jewish philosophy:
:"If I am not for myself, who will be for me?
:And if I am only for myself, what am I?
:And if not now, [then] when?"

Another explanation is, without the existence of the ''yetzer ha'ra'', there would be no merit earned in following God's commandments; choice is only meaningful if there has indeed been a choice made. So whereas creation was "good" before, it became "very good" when the evil inclination was added, for then it became possible to truly say that man could make a true choice to obey God's "mitzvot" (commandments). This is because Judaism views the following of God's ways as a desirable end in and of itself rather than a means to an end.

==Value of repentance==
{{See also|Repentance in Judaism}}
The Babylonian Talmud teaches that "Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Eleazar both explain that as long as the Temple stood, the altar atoned for Israel, but now, one's table atones [when the poor are invited as guests]." (Tractate Berachot, 55a.)

Repentance in itself is also a means of atonement (See [[Ezekiel]] 33:11, 33:19, [[Jeremiah]] 36:3, etc.) The Hebrew word for repentance is ''teshuvah'' which literally means to "return (to God)." The prophet Hosea (14:3) said, "Take with you words, and return to God."

Judaism teaches that our personal relationship with God allows us to turn directly to Him at any time, as [[Malachi]] 3:7 says, "Return to Me and I shall return to you," and Ezekiel 18:27, "When the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive." Additionally, God is extremely compassionate and forgiving as is indicated in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 9:18, "We do not present our supplications before You because of our righteousness, but because of Your abundant mercy."

The [[siddur|traditional liturgy]] of the ''Days of Awe'' (the [[High Holy Days]]; i.e. [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]) states that [[prayer]], repentance and tzedakah (charitable actions) are ways to repent for sin. In Judaism, sins committed against people (rather than against God or in the heart) must first be corrected and put right to the best of a person's ability; a sin which has not also been put right as best as possible cannot truly be said to be repented.

===True repentance===
To a man who says “I will sin and repent, I will sin and repent,” the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]] brings no forgiveness. For sins against God the Day of Atonement brings forgiveness; for sins against one’s fellowman, the Day of Atonement brings no forgiveness till he has become reconciled with the fellowman he wronged (Mishnah Yoma 8:9).

According to [[Maimonides]] in order to achieve true repentance the sinner must abandon his sin and remove it from his thoughts and resolve in his heart never to repeat it, as it is said, “Let the wicked forsake his way and the man of iniquity his thoughts” (Isaiah 55:7). Likewise must he regret the past, as it is said: “Surely after I turned I repented” (Jer. 31:18). He must also call Him who knows all secrets to witness that he will never return to this sin again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oztorah.com/2013/09/penitence-prayer-charity-an-anthology-for-rosh-hashanah-yom-kippur/ ''Rabbi Raymond Apple, Penitence, Prayer &amp; Charity: An anthology for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur''], Publications Committee of the United Synagogue, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atonement in the Temple period===
{{See also|Repentance in Judaism|Korban}}
Atonement for sins is discussed in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], known to Christians as the [[Old Testament]]. Rituals for atonement occurred in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], and were performed by the ''[[Kohen|Kohanim]]'', the Israelite priests. These services included song, prayer, offerings and animal [[sacrifice]]s known as the ''[[korbanot]]''. The rites for [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement, are prescribed in the book of [[Leviticus]] chapter 16. The ritual of the [[scapegoat]], sent into the wilderness to be claimed by [[Azazel]], was one of these observances (Lev. 16:20-22).

===Liturgical norms===
The liturgy of the Days of Awe (the High Holy Days; i.e. [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]) states that prayer, repentance and [[tzedakah]] (the dutiful giving of charity) atone for sin. But prayer cannot atone for wrongs done, without an honest sincere attempt to rectify any wrong done to the best of one's ability, and the sincere intention to avoid repetition. Atonement to Jews means to repent and set aside, and the word "T'shuvah" used for atonement actually means "to return". Judaism is optimistic in that it always sees a way that a determined person may return to what is good, and that God waits for that day too.

A number of animal sacrifices were prescribed in the [[Torah]] (five books of Moses) to make atonement: a [[sin-offering]] for sins, and a [[guilt offering]] for religious trespasses. The significance of animal sacrifice is not expanded on at length in the Torah, though [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9:4 and [[Leviticus]] 17 suggest that blood and vitality were linked. Conservative Jews and Christians argue at the present era that the Jews never believed that the aim of all sacrifice is to pay the debt for sins - only the [[sin offering]] and the [[guilt offering]] had this purpose; modern scholars of early Jewish history, however, often disagree and argue that this division came later.

Later Biblical [[prophet]]s occasionally make statements to the effect that the hearts of the people were more important than their sacrifices - "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams" (I Samuel 15:22); "For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgement of God rather than burnt offerings" ([[Hosea]] 6:6); "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart" (Psalm 51:17) (see also [[Isaiah]] 1:11, Psalm 40:6-8).

Although the animal sacrifices were prescribed for atonement, there is no place where the Hebrew Bible says that animal sacrifice is the ''only'' means of atonement. Hebrew Bible teaches that it is possible to return to God through repentance and prayer alone. For example, in the books of Jonah and Esther, both Jews and gentiles repented, prayed to God and were forgiven for their sins, without having offered any sacrifices.&lt;ref name="englishhandbook" /&gt; Additionally, in modern times, most Jews do not even consider animal sacrifices.

On the High Holy Days of [[Rosh Hashana]], [[Yom Kippur]] - also known as the Day of Atonement-, and the ten-day period between these holidays, repentance of sins committed is based on specialized prayers and hymns, while some Jews continue the ancient methods of sacrifice.  An example of a common method of "sacrificing" for the sake of repentance is simply to drop bread into a body of water (as in the ceremony of [[Tashlikh]]), to signify the passing of sins and the hope for one to be written into the Book of Life by God once again. This is especially emphasized on what is arguably the holiest Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur.

'''Koonalda Cave''' is  a [[cave]] in the Australian state of [[South Australia]], on the [[Nullarbor Plain]] in the locality of [[Nullarbor, South Australia|Nullarbor]].  It is notable as an [[archeological site]].&lt;ref name="Koonalda Cave"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321989/Koonalda-Cave "Koonalda Cave"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://austhrutime.com/koonalda_cave.htm "Koonalda Cave"] ''Australia Thru Time''. Retrieved 2014-3-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

I.D. Lewis described the cave in 1976 as:&lt;ref name="LMV"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Large doline 60m in diam. and 25m deep; talus slope to two main large passages connected by a high window; total length of cave 1200m; three lakes at -80m; narrow airspace beyond third lake leads to 45m diam. dome and lake; another 30m sump leads off this...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thousands of square metres in the cave are covered in parallel finger-marked geometric lines and patterns, [[Indigenous Australian]] artwork which has been dated as 20,000 years old,&lt;ref name="Koonalda Cave"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koonalda"&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/pacific/koonalda.html "Koonalda"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609030320/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/pacific/koonalda.html |date=9 June 2008 }}, [[Minnesota State University, Mankato|Minnesota State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; making it older than any known [[prehistoric art]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey|BLAINEY, Geoffrey]], ''Triumph of the Nomads: A History of Aboriginal Australia'', 1976, {{ISBN|0-87951-084-6}}, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; It is located about {{convert|99|km}} west of the [[Nullarbor, South Australia| Nullarbor roadhouse]]&lt;ref name="LMV"/&gt; and about {{convert|60|mi|km|0|order=flip}} north east from [[Eucla, Western Australia|Eucla]]&lt;ref name=R1/&gt; within the [[Nullarbor Wilderness Protection Area]].&lt;ref name=PA2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Protected Areas of South Australia September (Map) 2014 Edition|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/bf6977cb-f1f9-4700-9b5f-a35500fda94f/protected-areas-of-south-australia-map.pdf|publisher=Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cave was abandoned 19,000 years ago, and rediscovered by [[archeology|archeologists]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="Koonalda"/&gt;

The cave was explored by an expedition led by Captain J. M. Thompson in 1935. The team entered the cave by a ladder and found themselves in a chamber some {{convert|800|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in circumference and walked down tunnels over {{convert|1200|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in length.&lt;ref name=R1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17221733 |title=Caves and Lakes. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 November 1935 |accessdate=6 June 2014 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}'''Laura Harding''' is an architectural practitioner and critic based in Sydney. Harding works across architecture and [[urban design]], with a particular focus on the public realm. She is also an architectural critic and an active participant in the public culture of architecture. Harding regularly contributes to architectural education as a visiting critic at the [[University of New South Wales]] and the [[University of Sydney]]. From 2006 to 2012 she taught with [[Glenn Murcutt]] in the third year design program at the University of New South Wales.

==Biography==

Harding was born in Sydney in 1975. She studied architecture at the [[University of Sydney]], graduating with a Bachelor of Science (Architecture) in 1995 and a Bachelor of Architecture in 1998. She has worked at the Sydney-based practice Hill Thalis Architecture + Urban Projects for eighteen years, having joined the practice in 1996 as a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hillthalis.com.au/index.php?id=35|title = Hill Thalis|date = |accessdate = |website = Hill Thalis Architecture and Urban Projects|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Harding began writing architectural criticism in 2004, first for ''[[Architecture Australia]]'', the journal of record of Australian architecture, and subsequently for a range of professional publications and mainstream media outlets. She was appointed a contributing editor to ''Architecture Australia'' in 2005, a position she continues to hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://architectureau.com/contributors/Harding-Laura/|title = Laura Harding|date = |accessdate = 8 March 2015|website = ArchitectureAU|publisher = Architecture Media|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding has had criticism published in [[The Guardian]] and is a regular contributor to [[The Saturday Paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/contributor/laura-harding#.VPu7qGTLdZE|title = Contributor's page, The Saturday Paper|date = |accessdate = |website = The Saturday Paper|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/profile/laura-harding|title = Contributor's page, The Guardian|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harding was guest editor, alongside Philip Thalis, of a special issue of ''[[Architecture Australia]]'' on Urban Housing (''Architecture Australia'' (May 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://architectureau.com/tags/2014-aa-urban-housing-dossier/|title = Urban Housing Dossier|last = Laura Harding|first = Philip Thalis|date = May 2014|journal = Architecture Australia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural work==

Harding's project work crosses architecture and urban design, with a particular focus on multi-residential and urban projects. Her work includes the award-winning project Substation No. 175, which converted a remnant substation building in Surry Hills into a 'tiny urban tower'. This intensified the use of the tiny site and aimed to show that "no lot need be too small to be used effectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://naomistead.com/?p=201|title = Substation No 175, Surry Hills|last = Stead|first = Naomi|date = June 2005|journal = Architectural Review Australia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harding was project urban designer on the winning entry in the international design competition for East Darling Harbour ([[Barangaroo, New South Wales|Barangaroo]]) by Hill Thalis Architecture + Urban Projects, Paul Berkemeier Architects and Jane Irwin Landscape Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://architectureau.com/articles/competition-9/|title = East Darling Harbour|last = Mossop|first = Elizabeth|date = July 2006|journal = Architecture Australia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed a new urban street pattern, waterfront park and urban grain for the Millers Point wharves. The scheme did not go ahead.

{{cleanup-reorganize|date=August 2016}}
The music articles in [[Rees's Cyclopaedia|Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'']] were written by [[Charles Burney]] (1726–1814), with additional material by [[John Farey, sr]] (1766–1826), and [[John Farey, Jr]] (1791–1851), and illustrated by 53 plates as well a numerous examples of music typset within the articles.

Charles Burney was well known as the author of a ''General History of Music'', 4 vol 1776–1789 and two travel diaries recording his Musical Tours collecting information in France and Italy, and later Germany, 1+2 vol, 1771 and 1773, as well as the ''Commemoration of Handel'', 1785 and his ''Musical Memoirs of Metastasio'', 1796. John Farey, sr was a polymath, well known today for his work as a geologist and for his investigations of the mathematics of sound, and the schemes of temperamant used in tuning musical instruments then. His son, John Farey, jr, was also polymathic in his interests. He contributed numerous drawings for the illustrations of mostly technological and scientific topics in Rees's Cyclopaedia.

The index to plates in Vol 39 of the work notes that plates XXXIV — XLIV were intended to include selections from the works of Haydn and Mozart, and also various National Airs. Since they were readily accessible elsewhere they were omitted to save expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rees|first1=Abraham|title=Rees's Cyclopaedia|date=1819|publisher=Longmans|location=London|edition=|url=https://archive.org/stream/cyclopaediaorun39rees#page/n697/mode/1up|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plate XLV was also omitted.

[[Wilson Lowry]] engraved a number of the general plates in Miscellany and with [[John Farey Jr]], the draughtsman, those on the Hawkins's Claviole and the set on the Organ.&lt;ref&gt;Woolrich, A. P., "John Farey, Jr., technical author and draughtsman: his contribution to Rees's ''Cyclopædia''". ''Industrial Archaeology Review'', 20, (1998), 49-68 [http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm AIA Abstracts 1998. ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207111214/http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm |date=2006-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The examples of music notation in the Music section must be presumed to have been originally written out by Burney, and were engraved by a Jno [John] Lee.&lt;ref&gt;Lee has not been identified, but there was a wood engraver of that name, who died in 1804.&lt;/ref&gt;  All the plates of musical instruments were also engraved by Lee. A number were drawn by a T. Webster. One was drawn by [[Edward Francis Burney|Edward Francesco Burney]], Charles Burney's nephew, and another by an artist named Strange.

'''Maashaus''' ({{lang-de|Maßhaus}}) is a spacious room taking the whole front part of a ground floor of a multi-storied [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] town house.

This room was used mainly for serving beer, or other kinds of trade and craft. It was not heated. It also worked to link together other parts of the house, since it held a staircase to the first floor above ground (where the owner lived) and to the basement, an archway or similar passage to the courtyard and so on. The ceiling was almost always [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] and was often supported by an asymmetrically placed central [[column]]. It was separated from the street or the arcade by a wall with a doorway and one or more windows.

==Origins==

Maashauses started to appear in the 13th century as a manifestation of the trend to sequester the living quarters of a burgers' house to the first floor. What used to be a main living room of the house, the so-called smoke abode, kept only its public, trade and craft functions, which remained on the ground floor, because they required the proximity of the cellar, the courtyard and especially the street entrance. The trade activities involved mainly the aforementioned serving of beer, which is related to the [[brewing right]]s (in the [[Middle Ages]] a vast majority of burgers' houses were granted this right), but other trade and crafts were performed there also.

==Maashauses in Bohemia==

In the 19th century most maashauses were converted to private shops. Later, they were being renovated in many historic cities as part of restoration activities in the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–89)|socialist period]]. To this day, maashauses are found in many buildings in the centers of [[Český Krumlov|Česky Krumlov]], [[Slavonice]] and so on. After 1989 many maashauses were again employed for retail or by pubs and restaurants.

==Etymology==
"[[Maß]]“ is  an old unit of volume (approximately equivalent to 1.4 [[Litre|l]]), used for measuring mainly [[beer]], ''haus'' means a "house“ in German, but in the past it could also stand for the main living room of a house. Therefore, maashaus could be translated as a "beer house".

[[File:La ParcaGarciaVega.jpg|thumb|La Parca by Mexican artist [[Antonio García Vega]].]]
In [[Roman mythology]], '''Morta''' was the goddess of death. She is one of the [[Parcae]], related to the Roman conception of the Fates in [[Greek mythology]], the [[Moirai]]. Her Greek equivalent is [[Atropos]]. She is responsible for the pain and/or  death that occur in a half-wake, half-sleep time frame. Her father is the god of darkness and her mother is the goddess of night. She visits and warns in advance of the pain and/or death about to be endured.

The '''Nursing Madonna''', '''''Virgo Lactans''''', or '''Madonna Lactans''', is an [[iconography]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] in which the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] is shown [[breastfeeding]] the infant [[Jesus]].

The depiction is mentioned by Pope [[Gregory the Great]], and a mosaic depiction probably of the 12th century is on the facade of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome, though few other examples survive from before the late Middle Ages.  It continued to be found in Orthodox icons (as ''Galaktotrophousa'' in Greek, ''Mlekopitatelnitsa'' in Russian), especially in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tradigo|first=Alfredo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uODOkMgUZKYC&amp;pg=PA183|title=Icons And Saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church, A Guide to Imagery|page=183|year=2006|publisher=Getty|isbn=9780892368457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the depiction seems to have revived with the [[Cistercian Order]] in the 12th century, as part of the general upsurge in [[Mariology|Marian theology]] and devotion.  Milk was seen as "processed blood", and the milk of the Virgin to some extent paralleled the role of the [[Blood of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Eucharist in Romanesque France: Iconography And Theology|last=Saxon|first=Elizabeth|pages=205-207|year=2006|publisher=Boydell|isbn=9781843832560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DwQB4_6tG0C&amp;pg=PA206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, the middle and upper classes usually contracted breastfeeding out to [[wetnurse]]s, and the depiction of the Nursing Madonna was linked with the [[Madonna of Humility]], a depiction that showed the Virgin in more ordinary clothes than the royal robes shown, for instance, in images of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], and often seated on the ground.  The appearance of a large number of such depictions in [[Tuscany]] in the early 14th century was something of a visual revolution for the theology of the time, compared to the [[Queen of Heaven]] depictions; they were also popular in [[Iberia]]. After the [[Council of Trent]] in the mid-16th century, clerical writers discouraged nudity in religious subjects, and the use of the Madonna Lactans iconography began to fade away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From the Pews in the Back|first1=Mary Ann|last1=Hinsdale|first2=Kate|last2=Dugan|first3=Jennifer|last3=Owens|year=2009|isbn=0-8146-3258-0|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of depiction, also deprecated after Trent, showed Mary baring her breast in a traditional gesture of female supplication to Christ when asking for mercy for sinners in [[Deesis]] or [[Last Judgement]] scenes. A good example is the fresco at S. Agostino in [[San Gimignano]], by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], painted to celebrate the end of the plague. {{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

The nursing Virgin survived into the Baroque some depictions of the [[Holy Family]], by [[El Greco]] for example,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:El Greco - Holy Family with St Anne - WGA10565.jpg|El Greco in Budapest]]&lt;/ref&gt; and narrative scenes such as the ''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt]]'', for example by [[Orazio Gentileschi]] (versions in Birmingham and Vienna).

==Lactatio Bernardi==
[[File:BernhardClairvaux Lactatio SourceUnknown.jpg|thumbnail|right|Bernard receiving milk from the breast of the Virgin Mary. The scene is a legend which allegedly took place at [[Speyer Cathedral]] in 1146.]]
A variant, known as the '''Lactation of St Bernard''' ('''''Lactatio Bernardi''''' in Latin, or simply '''Lactatio''') is based on a miracle or vision concerning St [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] where the Virgin sprinkled milk on his lips (in some versions he is awake, praying before an image of the Madonna, in others asleep).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=La lactation de saint Bernard: Legende et iconographie|last1=Dewez|first1=Léon|last2=van Iterson|first2=Albert|journal=Citeaux in de Nederlanden|volume=7|year=1956|pages=165–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In art he usually kneels before a Madonna Lactans, and as Jesus takes a break from feeding, the Virgin squeezes her breast and he is hit with a squirt of milk, often shown travelling an impressive distance. The milk was variously said to have given him wisdom, shown that the Virgin was his mother (and that of mankind generally), or cured an eye infection. In this form the Nursing Madonna survived into [[Baroque art]], and sometimes the [[Rococo]], as in the high altar at [[Kloster Aldersbach]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Aldersbach Pfarrkirche - Hochaltar 2 Altarbild.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On the Sublime''''' (Περì Ὕψους Perì Hýpsous) is a [[Roman Greece|Roman-era Greek]] work of [[literary criticism]] dated to the 1st century AD. Its author is unknown, but is conventionally referred to as '''Longinus''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɒ|n|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|n|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Λογγῖνος}} ''Longĩnos'') or '''Pseudo-Longinus'''. It is regarded as a classic work on [[aesthetics]] and the effects of good writing. The treatise highlights examples of good and bad writing from the previous millennium, focusing particularly on what may lead to the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

The author's identity has been debated for centuries. The oldest surviving manuscript, from the 10th century, indicates the original author was named "Dionysius or Longinus", which was later misread as "Dionysius Longinus". Subsequent interpretations have attributed the work to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (1st century) or [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Cassius Longinus]] (c. 213–273 AD), though neither is now widely accepted.

==Authorship ==
The author is unknown. In the 10th-century reference manuscript (Parisinus Graecus 2036), the heading reports "Dionysius or Longinus", an ascription by the  medieval [[copyist]] that was misread as "by Dionysius Longinus." When the manuscript was being prepared for printed publication, the work was initially attributed to [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Cassius Longinus]] (c. 213–273 AD). Since the correct translation includes the possibility of an author named "Dionysius", some have attributed the work to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a writer of the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Grube"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grube|first=G.M.A|title=On Great Writing (On the Sublime) |publisher=The Liberal Arts Press|location=New York|year=1957|isbn=978-0-87220-080-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There remains the possibility that the work belongs to neither Cassius Longinus nor Dionysius of Halicarnassus, but, rather, some unknown author writing under the [[Roman Empire]], likely in the 1st century. The error does imply that when the [[codex]] was written, the trails of the real author were already lost. Neither author can be accepted as the actual writer of the treatise. Dionysius maintained ideas which are absolutely opposite to those written in the treatise; with Longinus, there are problems with chronology.

Among further names proposed, are Hermagoras (a rhetorician who lived in Rome during the 1st century AD), [[Aelius Theon]] (author of a work which had many ideas in common with those of ''On the Sublime''), and Pompeius Geminus (who was in epistolary conversation with Dionysius).

===Dionysius of Halicarnassus===
[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] wrote under Augustus, publishing a number of works. Dionysius is generally dismissed as the potential author of ''On the Sublime'', since the writing officially attributed to Dionysius differs from the work ''On the Sublime'' in style and thought.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Andrew Russell|title='Longinus' on the Sublime|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassius Longinus===
Credited with writing a number of literary works, Longinus was disciple of [[Plotinus]], and considered "the most distinguished scholar of his day." He received his education at Alexandria and then went to Athens to teach. He later moved to Asia Minor, where he achieved the position of advisor to [[Zenobia]], the queen of [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;Longinus. (1851, Jul 01). Robert Merry's Museum (1841-1851), 22, 179. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/135926705&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longinus. 9 Vol. Detroit: The Gale Group Inc, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius is a dubious possibility for author of the treatise because he wrote in the 3rd century, and no literature later than the 1st century AD is mentioned (the latest is [[Cicero]], who died in 43 BC){{clarify|date=April 2017|Last citations are 1st C AD by Cicero who died 1st C BC?}} and the work is now usually dated to the early 1st century AD. The work ends with a dissertation on the decay of oratory, a typical subject for the time when authors such as [[Tacitus]], [[Petronius]] and [[Quintilian]], who also dealt with the subject, were alive.  Cassius was executed by Aurelian, the Roman emperor who conquered Palmyra in 273 AD were on charges of conspiring against the Roman state. This was most likely because of what he had written for Queen Zenobia of Palmyra while she was still in power. Longinus is reported to have written answers for the Queen, which were used in response to Aurelian, the man who would soon rise to power as the Roman emperor.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt;

==Contents==
''On the Sublime'' is both a treatise on [[aesthetics]] and a work of literary criticism. It is written in an epistolary form and the final part, possibly dealing with public speaking, has been lost.

The treatise is dedicated to Posthumius Terentianus, a cultured Roman and public figure, though little else is known of him. ''On the Sublime'' is a compendium of literary exemplars, with about 50 authors spanning 1,000 years mentioned or quoted.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=William Rhys|title=Longinus on the Sublime|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the expected examples from [[Homer]] and other figures of Greek culture, Longinus refers to a passage from ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'', which is quite unusual for the 1st century:

{{quote|A similar effect was achieved by the lawgiver of the Jews—no mean genius, for he both understood and gave expression to the power of the divinity as it deserved—when he wrote at the very beginning of his laws, and I quote his words: "God said,"—what was it?—"Let there be light, and there was. Let there be earth, and there was."|''On the Sublime'' 9.9}}

Given his positive reference to Genesis, Longinus has been assumed to be either a Hellenized Jew or readily familiar with the Jewish culture.&lt;ref name="Leitch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leitch|first=Vincent B.|title=The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism|publisher=Norton|year=2001|pages=135–154|isbn=978-0-393-97429-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Longinus emphasizes that, to be a truly great writer, authors must have "moral excellence".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; In fact, critics speculate that Longinus avoided publication in the ancient world "either by modesty or by prudential motives".&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Moreover, Longinus stresses that transgressive writers are not necessarily shameless fools, even if they take literary risks that seem "bold, lawless, and original".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; As for social subjectivity, Longinus acknowledges that complete liberty promotes spirit and hope; according to Longinus, "never did a slave become an orator".&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blair|first=Hugh |author2=Abraham Mills |title=From Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|publisher=T. Zell|year=1866|edition=2nd|pages=950–979}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, too much luxury and wealth leads to a decay in eloquence—eloquence being the goal of the [[sublimity|sublime]] writer.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

===The sublime===
Longinus critically applauds and condemns certain literary works as examples of good or bad styles of writing.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Longinus ultimately promotes an "elevation of style"&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; and an essence of "simplicity".&lt;ref name="Brody"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brody|first=Jules|title=Boileau and Longinus|publisher=E. Droz|year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; To quote this famous author, "the first and most important source of sublimity [is] the power of forming great conceptions."&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt; The concept of the [[sublimity|sublime]] is generally accepted to refer to a style of writing that elevates itself "above the ordinary". Finally, Longinus sets out five sources of sublimity: "great thoughts, strong emotions, certain figures of thought and speech, noble diction, and dignified word arrangement".&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt;

The effects of the Sublime are: loss of rationality, an alienation leading to identification with the creative process of the artist and a deep emotion mixed in pleasure and exaltation. An example of sublime (which the author quotes in the work) is a poem by [[Sappho]], the so-called ''Ode to Jealousy'', defined as a "Sublime ode". A writer's goal is not so much to express empty feelings, but to arouse emotion in her audience.&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt;

In the treatise, the author asserts that "the Sublime leads the listeners not to persuasion, but to ecstasy: for what is wonderful always goes together with a sense of dismay, and prevails over what is only convincing or delightful, since persuasion, as a rule, is within everyone's grasp: whereas, the Sublime, giving to speech an invincible power and [an invincible] strength, rises above every listener".&lt;ref&gt;''On the Sublime'' 1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this statement, one could think that the sublime, for Longinus, was only a moment of evasion from reality. But on the contrary, he thought that literature could model a soul, and that a soul could pour itself out into a work of art. In this way the treatise becomes not only a text of literary inquiry, but also one of ethical dissertation, since the Sublime becomes the product of a ''great soul'' ({{lang|grc|μεγαλοφροσύνης ἀπήχημα}}, ''megalophrosunēs apēchēma''). The sources of the Sublime are of two kinds: inborn sources ("aspiration to vigorous concepts" and "strong and enthusiastic passion") and acquirable sources (rhetorical devices, choice of the right lexicon, and "dignified and high composition").&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt;

===Decay of rhetoric===
The author speaks also about the decay of oratory, as arising not only from absence of personal freedom but also from the corruption of morals, which together destroy that high spirit which generates the Sublime. Thus the treatise is clearly centred in the burning controversy which raged in the 1st century AD in Latin literature. If [[Petronius]] pointed out excess of rhetoric and the pompous, unnatural techniques of the schools of eloquence as the causes of decay, [[Tacitus]] was nearer to Longinus in thinking&lt;ref name="Grube"/&gt; that the root of this decadence was the establishment of Princedom, or Empire, which, though it brought stability and peace, also gave rise to censorship and brought an end to freedom of speech. Thus oratory became merely an exercise in style.

===Misleading translations and lost data===
Translators have been unable to clearly interpret the text, including the title itself. The "sublime" in the title has been translated in various ways, to include senses of elevation and excellent style. The word [[sublimity|sublime]], argues Rhys Roberts, is misleading, since Longinus' objective broadly concerns "the essentials of a noble and impressive style" than anything more narrow and specific. Moreover, about one-third of the treatise is missing;&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Longinus' segment on similes, for instance, has only a few words remaining.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; Matters are further complicated in realizing that ancient writers, Longinus' contemporaries, do not quote or mention the treatise in any way.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

===Limitations of the writing===
Despite Longinus' critical acclaim, his writing is far from perfect. Longinus' occasional enthusiasm becomes "carried away" and creates some confusion as to the meaning of his text. Furthermore, 18th-century critic [[Edward Burnaby Greene]] finds Longinus, at times, to be "too refined".&lt;ref name="Greene" /&gt; Greene also claims that Longinus' focus on hyperbolical descriptions is "particularly weak, and misapplied."&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Occasionally, Longinus also falls into a sort of "tediousness" in treating his subjects.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; The treatise is also limited in its concentration on spiritual transcendence and lack of focus on the way in which language structures determine the feelings and thoughts of writers.&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt; Finally, Longinus' treatise is difficult to explain in an academic setting, given the difficulty of the text and lack of "practical rules of a teachable kind."&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

===Writing style and rhetoric===
Despite its faults, the treatise remains critically successful because of its "noble tone," "apt precepts," "judicious attitude," and "historical interests".&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; One of the reasons why it is so unlikely that known ancient critics wrote ''On the Sublime'' is because the treatise is composed so differently from any other literary work. Since Longinus' rhetorical formula avoids dominating his work, the literature remains "personal and fresh," unique in its originality. Longinus rebels against the popular rhetoric of the time by implicitly attacking ancient theory in its focus on a detailed criticism of words, metaphors, and figures. More explicitly, in refusing to judge tropes as entities unto themselves, Longinus promotes the appreciation of literary devices as they relate to passages as a whole.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Essentially, Longinus, rare for a critic of his time, focuses more on "greatness of style" than "technical rules."&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Despite his criticism of ancient texts, Longinus remains a "master of candor and good-nature".&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Edward Burnaby|title=Critical Essays: 1770|year=1973|isbn=978-0-85417-911-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the author invents striking images and metaphors, writing almost lyrically at times.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; In general, Longinus appreciates, and makes use of, simple diction and bold images.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

As far as the language is concerned, the work is certainly a unicum because it is a blend of expressions of the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek]] to which are added elevated constructions, technical expressions, metaphors, classic and rare forms which produce a literary pastiche at the borders of linguistic experimentation.

===Influences===
In reading ''On the Sublime'', critics have determined that the ancient philosopher and writer Plato is a "great hero" to Longinus.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; Not only does Longinus come to Plato's defense, but he also attempts to raise his literary standing in opposition to current criticisms. Another influence on the treatise can be found in Longinus' rhetorical figures, which draw from theories by a 1st-century BC writer, [[Caecilius of Calacte]].&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

==Historical criticism and use of ''On the Sublime''==
*10th century - The original treatise, before translation, is copied into a medieval manuscript and attributed to "Dionysius or Longinus."&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt;
*13th century - A Byzantine rhetorician makes obscure references to what may be Longinus' text.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt;
*16th century - The treatise is ignored by scholars until it is published by [[Francis Robortello]] in [[Basel]], in 1554, and Niccolò da Falgano, in 1560.&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt; The original work is attributed to "Dionysius Longinus" and most European countries receive translations of the treatise.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;
*17th century - Sublime effects become a desired end of much [[Baroque]] art and literature, and the rediscovered work of "Longinus" goes through half a dozen editions in the 17th century. It is [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]'s 1674 translation of the treatise into French that really starts its career in the history of criticism. Despite its popularity, some critics claim that the treatise was too "primitive" to be truly understood by a "too civilized" 17th-century audience.
*18th century - [[William Smith (scholar)|William Smith's]] 1739 translation of ''Longinus on the Sublime'' established the translator and once more brought the work into prominence. Longinus' text reaches its height in popularity.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; In England, critics esteem Longinus' principles of composition and balance second only to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' and Immanuel Kant's ''Critique of the Power of Judgment''&lt;ref&gt;Clewis, Robert R. (2009). ''The Kantian Sublime and the Revelation of Freedom''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; owe a debt to Longinus' concept of the [[sublimity|sublime]], and the category passes into intellectual discourse. As "Longinus" says, "The effect of elevated language upon an audience is not persuasion but transport," a fitting sentiment for Romantic thinkers and writers who reach beyond logic, to the wellsprings of the Sublime. At the same time, the Romantics gain some contempt for Longinus, given his association with the "rules" of classical poets. Such contempt is ironic, given the widespread influence of Longinus on the shaping of 18th-century criticism.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;
*19th century - Early in the 19th century, doubts arise to the authorship of the treatise. Thanks to Italian scholar Amati, Cassius Longinus is no longer assumed to be the writer of ''On the Sublime''.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Simultaneously, the critical popularity of Longinus' work diminishes greatly; though the work is still in use by scholars, it is rarely quoted. Despite the lack of public enthusiasm, editions and translations of ''On the Sublime'' are published at the end of the century.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt;
*20th century - Although the text is still little quoted, it maintains its status, apart from Aristotle's ''Poetics'', as "the most delightful of all the critical works of classical antiquity."&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Also see [[Neil Hertz]]'s essay on Longinus in his book, ''The End of the Line.'' Hertz is in part responding to [[Thomas Weiskel]]'s book ''The Romantic Sublime'', probably the most influential recent account of British and German Romantic attitudes towards the Sublime of both Burke and Longinus.&lt;ref name="Hertz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertz|first=Neil|title=The End of the Line|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-231-05708-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiskel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Weiskel|author2=Portia Williams Weiskel |title=The Romantic Sublime|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1976|isbn=978-0-8018-1770-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Quinney treats the attractions grim demystification in analyzes of Longinus, particularly Weiskel's.&lt;ref name="Quinney2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quinney|first=Laura|title=Weiskel's Sublime and the Impasse of Knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Culler has an appreciation of Hertz on Longinus in "The Hertzian Sublime."&lt;ref name="Culler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|title=The Hertzian sublime|journal=[[MLN]]|volume=120|issue=5|pages=969–985|doi=10.1353/mln.2006.0007|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anne Carson]] and [[Louis Marin (philosopher)|Louis Marin]] have occasion to discuss Longinus as well and [[Harold Bloom]] and William J. Kennedy have significant accounts of his work. [[William Carlos Williams]] also uses three lines from the work as an epigraph to the Prologue to [[Kora in Hell]].&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Anne|title=Conjunctions|year=2001|pages=96–104|chapter=Foam: (Essay with Rhapsody) On the Sublime in Longinus and Antonioni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marin|first=Louis|author2=Nicolas Poussin |author3=Catherine Porter |title=The Sublime Poussin|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8047-3477-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=William J.|author2=Brenda Deen Schildgen |title=The Rhetoric Canon|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1997|chapter=Interest in the Canon: Kant in the Context of Longinus and Adorno|isbn=978-0-8143-2632-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German film director [[Werner Herzog]] claims to have an affinity with the work of Longinus, in a talk entitled "On the Absolute, the Sublime and Ecstatic Truth", presented in Milan. Herzog says that he thinks of Longinus as a good friend and considers that Longinus's notions of illumination has a parallel in some moments in his films. He quotes from Longinus: "For our soul is raised out of nature through the truly sublime, sways with high spirits, and is filled with proud joy, as if itself had created what it hears."

'''Permian bronze casts'''—[[Perm]]ic and Western [[Siberia]]n [[animal style]] cult cast figurines—were the predominant form of Finno-Ugrian [[toreutics]] of the 3–12th centuries CE. It was spread throughout a large area of forests of the north-eastern Urals and western Siberia from the basins of the Kama and Vyatka to the Ob. In the Middle Ages, these territories were inhibited mostly by the Ugrian tribes, ancestors of the present day Hungarians and Ob-Ugrians – the [[Khanty]] and the [[Mansi people|Mansi]] people. Their style is referred to as the 'Permian [[animal style]].'&lt;ref name="Autio 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Eero Autio|year=2001|title=THE PERMIAN ANIMAL STYLE|url=http://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol18/permian.pdf|journal=Folklore|location=Tartu|volume=18&amp;19|pages=162–186|issn=1406-0957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First collections of these works of arts and their scholarly research date back to the end of the 19th century. Despite over a century of research into the field, Perm animal style still remains one of the most mysterious cultural phenomena of Eurasia. This can be explained by the absence of written tradition of its creators and lack of external historic evidence about the creators of the bronze images in the heyday of the animal style. The golden age of cult metallurgy began immediately after the period of the Great Migrations (4-5th centuries CE) and continued in the epoch of the medieval Urals and Siberia of 6-11th centuries CE. A large collection was amassed by the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]] family in [[Perm]].&lt;ref name="Autio 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stroganoff - collectors of antiquities in Perm |work=ARTinvestment.RU |date=2010-11-28 |url=http://artinvestment.ru/en/news/exhibitions/20101128_stroganovy_hermitage_perm.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers point to the influence of Scytho-Sarmatian animal style on the development of cult toreutics of the forests of the north: famous animal battle scenes, vertical model of the Universe in the form of three worlds – three levels of the plaques and the cult of the great mother-goddess are present in both styles.Perm animal style objects include metalwork of bronze with the usage of single- or double-sided forms for casting, bone and wooden carvings, engravings on metal and bone objects. Figures depicted on the images are elks, rain-deers, bears, fur-bearing and other types of animals, horses, different waterfowl and birds of prey, snakes, insects and a number of “complex creatures” of mixed nature (hybrids), mixed zoomorphic and anthropomorphic half-human creatures; there are also a number of images of horsemen. The stories, which the Perm animal style plaques tell, are numerous and diverse.The objects are found in the hoards, on the sites of the temples, among the skeletons, in burials, as part of sacrificial complexes or on the sites of metallurgical workshops. Most of the bronze artifacts were used as a cult figures for the sacred rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/v/ob-etnicheskoy-prinadlezhnosti-permskogo-srednevekovogo-zverinogo-stilya|title=On the Ethnicity of the Permian Medieval Animal Style|last=Belavin|first=A.M.|date=2001|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that the sculptural embodiment of a spirit or an ancestor  is not the monument for him, neither it is the place where the spirit dwells, but the deity itself. Wooden or metal ingots and the spirits or souls cocooned inside them are inseparable unit, so that the figurine becomes a divine piece of wood or metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Religion der Jugra-Vlker 1–2: Mit Untersttzun des staatlichen Literaturfondes.

The images were made for “tonx”. “After a piece of wood has been given a shape of a human or after a tin cast, having a certain human form, has hardened, it is important to transfer or to indwell in it a “tonx” of the spirit which the figurine depicts, and only after that the image becomes a “tonx” to which necessary honours can be given".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Religion der Jugra-Vlker 1–2: Mit Untersttzun des staatlichen Literaturfondes.

Raw material for copper casting were cupriferrous sandstones of the Upper Kama. The alloys mostly consisted of copper (up to 86%), tin (10-17%), sometimes zinc (up to 7%) and arsenic. In the first millennium CE in the Upper Kama, as well in other regions of European North-East and Ob region, the coppers used were high in tin and zinc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lomovatovskaja kul’tura v Verhnem Prikam’e (Lomovatovo culture in the Upper Kama region)|last=Goldina|first=R.D.|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=Irkutsk|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objects of the animal style are usually divided into two groups, according to their function and the sphere of usage. The first group is Perm-[[Pechora River|Pechora]] bronze open-work objects having worship purpose. Certain objects from this group have a complicated composition, a sophisticated story behind them and many-leveled structure.Most artistically expressive compositions are 3-leveled cosmological compositions with a goddess in the center. Upper level consists of the heads of elks, heavenly faces, and soul birds associated with the Higher World of heavenly creatures, middle level is an earthly world of people and animals. The ruler of the Middle world is a deity (mother goddess) depicted in the center, and an animal at her feet is as a rule hybrid animal consisting of parts of different terrestrial animals – it marks the borders of Lower invisible world.The hallmark of the Perm animal style is the images of elk peoples, and to be more precise, the image of man-bird-elk, found nowhere else in the territory of Eurasia.The second group is the Transural, Western-Siberia animal style. There are a lot of applied and decorative artifacts – decorations, including costume decorations – belt plates, buckles, clasps, bracelets with zoomorphic images, pendants, beads, pommels, sheaths, needle cases, ear-picks, stills and combs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enc.permculture.ru/showObject.do?object=1803686781|title=Source of the bibliography Ural Historical Encyclopedia. - 2 nd ed., Pererab. and additional.|last=Viktorova|first=V.D.|last2=Fedorova|first2=N.V.|date=2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mythological stories could be seen on the plaques, depicting “complex animals” – mixed bears and fur-bearing animals, on figured pendants in the form of waterfowl, horses, in the images of birds of prey on the pommels.

According to the sphere of usage, cult metalwork objects can be devised into groups: for instance, the ones protecting against diseases (they were as a norm kept at home), the others – “spirits of the happiness” – bringing luck as a response to the sacrifices (they were inside community temples).The diversity of cult artifacts and mythological stories on the plaques presuppose the existence of developed mythology of the creators of the animal style. Perm Animal Style appeared on the territory of Scytho-Sarmatian world at the beginning of the first millennium CE and disappeared at the beginning of the second millennium, on the eve of the Mongolian invasions. The last traces of this civilization can be observed in the traditional culture of the Ob-Ugrians – the Khantys and the Mansis. Casting of objects for worship existed for over a thousand years and ensured the unity of the pagan world of the Urals and Western Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ural-Siberian cultic casting in myth and ritual|last=Balakin|first=Yu.V.|publisher=Novosibirsk Science|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''Percival Ulysses "Perry" Cox''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rateyourdoc.org/bios/cox.htm |title=RateYourDoc.org at Sacred Heart Hospital |date=December 9, 2007 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209151616/http://www.rateyourdoc.org/bios/cox.htm |archivedate= December 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a fictional character played by [[John C. McGinley]] on the American television [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. Dr. Cox appeared in every episode except "[[My Last Words]]," "[[My Comedy Show]]," and "[[My Full Moon]]," all in [[Scrubs (season 8)|Season 8]].

McGinley, [[Zach Braff]], and [[Donald Faison]] were the only cast members who returned as regulars for [[Scrubs (season 9)|Season 9]].

==Character profile==
Dr. Cox is sarcastic, bitter, cynical, uncaring, snobbish, and has a quick, cruel wit, normally expressed through frequent and sometimes incredibly long rants. At the beginning of the series, he is the chief attending physician at Sacred Heart Hospital; he is later promoted to residency director and, by the eighth season, to chief of medicine. In the ninth and final season, he becomes a professor when Sacred Heart is turned into a medical school. He is the superior and unwilling mentor of the series' protagonist, [[J.D. (Scrubs)|John "J.D." Dorian]] ([[Zach Braff]]). He has a "married but not married" relationship with his ex-wife, Jordan Sullivan ([[Christa Miller]]), with whom he has a son, Jack, and a daughter, Jennifer Dylan. He treats virtually everyone in the hospital with derision, especially his longtime nemesis, Chief of Medicine [[Bob Kelso]] ([[Ken Jenkins]]).

Cox is athletic, often found playing [[basketball]] in the hospital's parking lot with younger employees. In "[[My Friend the Doctor]]", he shows off by [[slam dunk|slam-dunking]] a basketball, but injures his back when he lands, a reminder that he is middle-aged. Out of vanity, he tries to hide his injury. He is also extremely [[egocentric]]; when named by a magazine as the best doctor in the city, he lines up every staff member beneath him, and his ex-wife, to consecutively praise him.

Cox grew up in an [[Irish Catholic]] family and has a younger sister, Paige ([[Cheryl Hines]]). Their family was extremely dysfunctional; their father was an [[child abuse|abusive]] [[alcoholic]], and their mother did nothing to prevent the abuse. Cox has a strained relationship with his born-again Christian sister, who reminds him of the childhood he has tried to forget.&lt;ref name="My New God"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=My New God|episodelink=My New God|series=Scrubs|network=NBC|airdate=January 17, 2006|season=5|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ironically, while he goes out of his way to distance himself from others, Cox often gets mixed up in the lives of both his patients and those around him. This personal involvement often manifests in destructive ways, with Cox either internalizing his feelings or externalizing them by targeting those around him. Despite this, he has intervened in some situations, with no expectation of personal gain and often to his own detriment, to help others. A notable example is when he punches Kelso in the face in front of the entire staff when Kelso berates [[Elliot Reid]] ([[Sarah Chalke]]).&lt;ref name="My Dream Job"&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Dream Job | episodelink = My Dream Job | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = April 17, 2003 | season  = 2  | number = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McGinley in the Season 1 [[DVD]] bonus features, Dr. Cox's habit of often touching his nose is a homage to [[Paul Newman]]'s character in ''[[The Sting]]'', although Cox also uses it as a sign of irritation on occasion, rather than just a sign signifying "it's going to be OK", as it was used in the film. Dr. Cox has also been compared to [[Gregory House]]. This is further explored in "[[My House (Scrubs)|My House]]", during which Cox acquires a temporary limp. At the end of the episode, through a series of circumstances, Dr. Cox walks into the room where the other characters are sitting and in a very House-esque way, gives them the answers to everything they have been trying to figure out through the whole episode.

Cox accepts the position of chief of medicine after Kelso retires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=My Dumb Luck|episodelink=My Dumb Luck|series=Scrubs|airdate=April 24, 2008|season=7|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position, however, does not come easily. He temporarily holds the position until the board finds a replacement, Dr. Taylor Maddox ([[Courteney Cox]]). After concluding that Dr. Maddox is, in fact, worse than Kelso, Dr. Cox teams up with [[Janitor (Scrubs)|the Janitor]] and Kelso to oust her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Saving Grace | episodelink = My Saving Grace | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = January 13, 2009 | season  = 8  | number = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dr. Maddox is fired, the position is vacant until Dr. Kelso, behind Cox's back, recommends him for the job. Dr. Cox is initially hesitant to take the job out of fear of losing the connection he has with his patients. Although it takes a few days, Kelso convinces him to accept the position.&lt;ref name="My Cookie Pants"&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Cookie Pants | episodelink = My Cookie Pants | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = January 27, 2009 | season = 8| number = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Season 2 DVD commentary of [[His Story (Scrubs episode)|"His Story"]], series creator [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]] stated that one of Dr. Cox's quirks is that he knows if someone is standing behind him and who it is, without turning around to check. This quirk is defied in "[[My Finale]]" when J.D. stands behind Cox as he tells one of the new interns how he really feels; throughout the speech, he gives no sign that he knows that J.D. is behind him.

He is also a very good golfer, regularly besting Kelso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Two Dads | episodelink = My Two Dads | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = October 23, 2001| season  = 1| number = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox harbors an intense hatred for [[Hugh Jackman]], mentioning him frequently in his rants about things he hates throughout the series. According to a 2006 interview with McGinley, Cox's reason for hating Jackman may be that Bill Lawrence envies the actor's talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johns |first1=Anna |title=John C. McGinley: The TV Squad Interview - TV Squad |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/05/16/john-c-mcginley-the-tv-squad-interview/ |publisher=TV Squad |date=May 16, 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615042303/http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/05/16/john-c-mcginley-the-tv-squad-interview/ |archivedate=June 15, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox is occasionally seen wearing a [[Detroit Red Wings]] jersey. McGinley is a Red Wings fan and a close friend of former Detroit defenseman [[Chris Chelios]], whose name can be seen on the back of Cox's jersey. He has also been seen wearing a T-shirt for Cheli's Chili Bar, a small chain of restaurants owned by Chelios.

Cox is a graduate of Hale University and [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], the former being a fictional adaptation of [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My New Role | episodelink = My New Role | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = February 3, 2009 | season  = 8  | number = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Cox is often seen drinking [[Scotch whisky|scotch]] and has acknowledged (humorously) that he has a drinking problem. Cox drinks so much that J.D. fears that Cox will die of [[liver]] disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=My Mentor|episodelink=My Mentor|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=October 4, 2001|season=1|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After making a mistake about a transplant patient that results in three deaths, a guilt-ridden Cox goes to work drunk and falls into a deep depression.&lt;ref name="My Lunch"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=My Lunch|episodelink=|series=Scrubs|airdate=April 25, 2006|season=5|number=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; J.D. eventually helps him forgive himself, however.&lt;ref name="My Fallen Idol"&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Fallen Idol | episodelink = My Fallen Idol | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = May 6, 2006 | season  = 5  | number = 21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His son Jack's first full sentence is "Daddy drinks a lot".&lt;ref name="My Fallen Idol"/&gt;

==Relationships with other characters==

===In Sacred Heart===
Dr. Cox constantly berates the residents, giving [[J.D. (Scrubs)|John "J.D." Dorian]] female nicknames (e.g. "Tiffany", "Jennifer", "Carol", "Betsy", "Lindsey") and regularly calling him "Newbie". He also calls [[Elliot Reid]] ([[Sarah Chalke]]) "[[Barbie]]", [[Turk (Scrubs)|Turk]] ([[Donald Faison]]) "[[Gandhi]]" and [[Bob Kelso]] ([[Ken Jenkins]]) "Bob-O", "Bobcat", and "Beelzebob". The one person he openly admits to tolerating is head nurse [[Carla Espinosa]] ([[Judy Reyes]]). Throughout Season 1, he and Turk compete for her affections, with Cox eventually bowing out when he sees that Turk and Carla are in love. In one episode, it is seen that Cox helped Turk with how to deal with women when they are mad, Turk eventually taking Perry's advice. Turk soon learns that Carla and Cox went on a date before Turk came to the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Quarantine | episodelink = My Quarantine | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = May 6, 2006 | season  = 4  | number = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his contempt for Turk in early seasons, Cox develops a restrained level of respect for him, and even occasionally gets along with and relates to him. Being reluctant at first, he even appoints Turk as the Chief Surgeon of Sacred Heart. Cox makes this decision after being told by Kelso that his own promotions by Kelso were against the latter's personal disdain for Cox, yet Cox's excellent medical knowledge made him the best candidate nonetheless - a feature that Turk shares with Cox.

He berates Elliot almost as much as J.D., frequently making fun of her insecurity, hairstyle and [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] background. However, he has also been known to stand up for her: he punches Kelso in the face when he yells at her in front of the staff.&lt;ref name="My Dream Job"/&gt;

Cox despises Kelso, Sacred Heart's chief of medicine. They disagree constantly about the best way to provide care, with Cox advocating for patients and Kelso adhering to the hospital's [[bottom line]]. At one point, he even punches Kelso in the face.&lt;ref name="My Dream Job"/&gt; On occasion, however, they have acknowledged the necessity of the other's position, and Kelso has admitted that they need each other.&lt;ref name="My Fallen Idol"/&gt; When Kelso retires and Cox succeeds him as chief of medicine, Cox confides in him about the pressures of the job, and the two form a "secret friendship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My New Role | episodelink = My New Role | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = February 3, 2009 | season  = 8  | number = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Dr. Cox has had limited interactions with veteran nurse [[Laverne Roberts]] ([[Aloma Wright]]), his cynicism drives him to mock her strong religious beliefs on occasion. This culminates in Cox confronting her about a seemingly "miraculous" accident, unwilling to accept it as [[Miracle|divine intervention]]. Visibly upset, Laverne replies that after 24 years as a nurse, she has to believe in a "bigger plan", otherwise she'd lose all hope. Taken aback, Cox uncharacteristically apologizes and sincerely replies that he wishes he could also believe that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My No Good Reason | episodelink = My No Good Reason | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = March 15, 2007 | season  = 6  | number = 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When she dies in the following episode, he joins the rest of the staff in bidding her farewell and drinking in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Long Goodbye | episodelink = My Long Goodbye | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = April 5, 2007 | season  = 6  | number = 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He berates J.D. from their first meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My First Day | episodelink = My First Day | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = October 6, 2001 | season  = 1  | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and emphatically denies being his mentor, despite J.D.'s repeated attempts to win his favor. Nonetheless, Cox has shown concern for J.D.'s welfare, such as telling him not to blame himself for a patient's death&lt;ref name="My Lunch"/&gt; and (reluctantly) comforting him when his father dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Cake | episodelink = My Cake | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = October 12, 2004 | season  = 4  | number = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also tells J.D. that he trusts him as a doctor and a person and has taken an interest in him from the start because he seems "to actually give a crap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Last Day | episodelink = My Last Day (Scrubs) | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = May 21, 2002 | season  = 1  | number = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox also recommends him as a promising, skilled, and hard-working doctor to a review board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Fifteen Minutes| episodelink = My Fifteen Minutes| series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = November 15, 2001 | season  = 1  | number = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[My Finale]]", Cox finally admits that he considers J.D. a talented doctor, a good person, and a friend, although he has to be tricked to do it. He refuses to say this directly to J.D. or to hug him. A flash-forward scene at the end of the episode suggests that Cox will be a part of J.D.'s life well into the future (reluctantly, of course).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Finale| episodelink = My Finale| series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = May 6, 2009 | season  = 8  | number = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ninth season, Sacred Heart has become a medical school, and Cox is hired as a professor. He immediately begins berating the series' new protagonist, Lucy Bennett ([[Kerry Bishé]]), and takes an interest in one of his students, Drew Suffin ([[Michael Mosley (actor)|Michael Mosley]]). He calls the latter "Number 1" and makes him his protégé, much to J.D.'s chagrin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Our First Day of School| episodelink = Our First Day of School| series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = December 1, 2009 | season  = 9  | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he still provides advice and support to J.D. (albeit in his usual sarcastic fashion) by telling him that he has to learn to let his students make their own mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Our Role Models| episodelink = Our Role Models| series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = December 8, 2009 | season  = 9  | number = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family life===
Cox's family is from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. He has a sister, [[List of minor characters of Scrubs#Dr. Cox and Jordan|Paige]] ([[Cheryl Hines]]), who is a [[born-again Christian]].&lt;ref name="My New God"/&gt; Cox is presented as an ardent [[skeptic]]&lt;ref name="My New God" /&gt; who says that he does not "technically believe" in God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Half-Acre | episodelink = My Half-Acre | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = February 7, 2006 | season  = 5  | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His political views are varied; he has expressed disdain for members of both political parties, as well as "registered Independents". He opposes the [[Iraq War]] and is disgusted when Elliot reveals that she is a [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]].&lt;ref name="His Story IV"&gt;{{cite episode | title = His Story IV | episodelink = His Story IV | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = February 1, 2007 | season  = 6  | number = 07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also uses "Republican" as an insult for Paige.&lt;ref name="My New God"/&gt;

Cox's father was an [[child abuse|abusive]] [[alcoholic]], and his mother would "watch silently while he drunkenly knocked [Dr. Cox and Paige] from room to room." At the end of one episode, he admits to his sister that seeing her reminds him of the childhood he has tried so hard to forget.&lt;ref name="My New God"/&gt;

Cox was apparently legally [[divorce]]d from [[Jordan Sullivan]] ([[Christa Miller|Christa Miller Lawrence]]), but the two have lived together in an exclusive relationship since Jordan discovered she was [[pregnant]].&lt;ref name="My Fruit Cups"&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Fruit Cups | episodelink = My Fruit Cups | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = November 14, 2002
 | season  = 5  | number = 102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As revealed in flashbacks, the marriage appears to have started out strongly, but went downhill and eventually ended when Jordan slept with Dr. Cox's then-protégé Peter Fisher ([[Jay Mohr]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Own Private Practice Guy | episodelink = My Own Private Practice Guy | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = March 13, 2003 | season  = 2  | number = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the series, it is revealed that Ted did not submit the divorce papers properly, so Cox and Jordan have been married during the entire run of the show. They immediately resume the role of husband and wife since they have already reconciled, but they quickly become dissatisfied with being an ordinary married couple, so they agree to go back to acting as though they were divorced, even going so far as to actually legally divorce with Ted (again) ending their marriage. In later seasons, Cox quietly resumes wearing his wedding ring, and Jordan soon acquiesces to the marriage title after the birth of their second child, and it is implied that they have remarried.

He has two children with Jordan: a son named Jack and, after an unsuccessful [[vasectomy]], a daughter named Jennifer Dylan (J.D.). Jack is played by Andrew Miller and his twin brother (although in a cameo appearance in "[[My Missed Perception]]", he is played by Bill Lawrence and Christa Miller's son, William). When Jordan first becomes pregnant with Jack, she tells Cox that she was impregnated by a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[bellboy]], wanting Cox to stay because he wants to rather than out of obligation to his child.&lt;ref name="My Fruit Cups"/&gt; At first, Cox feels nothing for the then-nameless boy, but begins to feel a connection after the child responds to the name Jack, which Cox had been trying to impress upon him for some time. J.D.'s college friend Spencer ([[Ryan Reynolds]]) accidentally tells Cox that he is actually Jack's biological father,&lt;ref name="My Dream Job"/&gt; and he takes on the role of father much more seriously. Cox has a very unorthodox way of raising Jack, often treating him like his "drinking buddy". Nonetheless, Cox loves his son and tries fervently to be a better father than his own was. He often talks to Jack in lieu of a [[psychotherapy|therapist]].

Cox is best friends with Jordan's brother, Ben ([[Brendan Fraser]]), and is hit hard when he is diagnosed with [[leukemia]]; he is initially too afraid to treat him because he fears he will lose him.

'''Peter Vaudreuil Lamarque''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|m|ɑr|k}}; born 21 May 1948) is a [[philosopher]] of [[art]], working in the [[analytic tradition]]. Since 2000&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Lamarque  Professor|url=https://www.york.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/peter-lamarque/|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  he has been a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of York]]. He is known primarily for his work in [[philosophy of literature]] and on the role of [[emotions]] in [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Lamarque, studies of|url=https://www.york.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/peter-lamarque/#research|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life and work==
Lamarque was educated at [[Marlborough College]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[English literature|English]] and [[Philosophy]] from the [[University of East Anglia]]. He then completed a [[BPhil]] in Philosophy at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] in 1972, where he worked under the supervision of [[L. Jonathan Cohen]].

From 1972 to 1995 Lamarque taught in the Philosophy Department at the [[University of Stirling]], and from 1995 to 2000 he held the [[Ferens Chair in Philosophy]] at the [[University of Hull]]. In 2000, he moved to the University of York to take up his current position. He has held visiting positions in several universities around the world, including [[Cornell University]] (USA) and the [[Australian National University]] (Australia).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lamarque has published extensively on various philosophical topics, mostly in the area of analytic [[philosophy of art]]. He put forward the first systematic articulation of an approach to the [[paradox of fiction]] usually referred to as 'thought theory'.&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Lamarque (1981), "How Can We Fear and Pity Fictions?", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'' '''21''', pp. 291-304.&lt;/ref&gt; He was editor of the ''[[British Journal of Aesthetics]]'' from 1995 to 2008. In 2009 he was chosen to give the first ever BSA/ASA Wollheim Memorial Lecture at the [[American Society for Aesthetics]] Annual Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://british-aesthetics.org/richard-wollheim-lectures-bsa-annual-meeting/|title=Richard Wollheim Lectures: BSA Annual Meeting – The British Society of Aesthetics|website=british-aesthetics.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401231938/http://www.aesthetics-online.org/events/index.php?events_id=193|title=ASA Annual Meeting|date=2014-04-01|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 he was awarded the "Premio Internazionale d'Estetica" by the Italian Society of Aesthetics (SIE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fattoadarte.corriere.it/2018/05/03/a-peter-lamarque-il-premio-estetica-2018/|title=A Peter Lamarque il Premio Estetica 2018|access-date=2018-05-08|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10133">'''Plains hide painting''' is a traditional [[Plains Indian]] artistic practice of painting on either tanned or raw animal hides. [[Tipi]]s, tipi liners, shields, [[parfleche]]s, robes, clothing, drums, and [[winter count]]s could all be painted.
[[File:Gilcrease - Parfleche.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Sioux]] parfleche, ca. 1900, [[Gilcrease Museum]]]]

==Genres==
Art historian Joyce Szabo writes that Plains artists were concerned "with composition, balance, symmetry, and variety."&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 4&lt;/ref&gt; Designs can be similar to those found in earlier [[rock art]] and later [[quillwork]] and [[beadwork]].

===Geometric painting===
[[File:Kiowa parfleche 1890 OHS.jpg|thumb|[[Kiowa]] parfleche, ca. 1890, [[Oklahoma History Center]]]]
Plains women traditionally paint abstract, geometric designs.&lt;ref name=s5&gt;Szabo, 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nmah&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/kids/buffalo/abouthides_frmset.html "More About Buffalo Hide Painting."] ''National Museum of American History''. (retrieved 4 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Bright colors were preferred and areas were filled with solid fields of color. [[Cross-hatching]] was a last resort used only when paint was scarce. [[Negative space]] was important and designs were discussed by women in terms of their negative space. Dots are used to break up large areas.&lt;ref name=s5/&gt;

[[Buffalo robe]]s and parfleches were frequently painted with geometrical patterns. Parfleches are rawhide envelopes for carrying and storing goods, including food. Their painted designs are thought to be stylized maps, featuring highly abstract geographic features such as rivers or mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Goes in Center, John. [http://www.conservationgis.org/native/native1.html "Native American and First Nations' GIS."] ''Native Geography''. 2000 (retrieved 4 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Feathered Sun" is a reoccurring motif of stylized feathers in several concentric circles. It visually connects a feather [[War bonnet|warbonnet]] to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, 236-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Representational painting===
[[File:PawneeVillasur1720.jpg|thumb|Buffalo hide painting of [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]]s battling the [[Villasur expedition]]]]
Traditionally, men painted representational art.&lt;ref name=nmah/&gt;&lt;ref name=s7&gt;Szabo, 7&lt;/ref&gt; They painted living things.&lt;ref name=s5/&gt; Plains Indian male artists use a system of pictographic signs, characterized by two-dimensionality, readily recognizable by other members of their tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; This picture writing could be used for anything from directions and maps to love letters. Images were streamlined and backgrounds were minimal for clarity. Representational painting typically fell into two categories: [[heraldic]] accounts or calendars.&lt;ref name=s7/&gt;

====Heraldic painting====
Men recorded their battle and hunting exploits on hide tipi liners, robes, and even shirts.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Figures were scattered across the hide and semi-transparent images sometimes overlapped each other.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 31&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative hides were often read right to left, with the protagonist emerging from the right.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 32&lt;/ref&gt; Allies are on the right with enemies on the left.&lt;ref&gt;Penney, 114&lt;/ref&gt; Men and horses were commonly painted, and other popular motifs included footprints, hoofprints, name glyphs, bullets, and arrows. An 1868 [[Blackfoot]] buffalo hide features the protagonist no fewer than eight times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/b/buffalo_robe.aspx "Buffalo Robe."] ''British Museum''. (retrieved 4 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Painted hides also commemorate historical events, such as treaty signings.

After 1850, hide painting grew in complexity with finer lines and additional details added.&lt;ref name="Szabo, 12"&gt;Szabo, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced technologies influenced hide painting, and a 19th-century [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]] tipi featured steamboats.&lt;ref name="Szabo, 12"/&gt;

====Calendars====
[[File:Calendari kiowa.jpg|thumb|Kiowa winter count by Anko, ca. 1895]]
{{Main|Winter count}}
Traditional Plains calendars are called [[winter counts]] because among most Plains tribes they feature a single [[pictogram]] that defined the entire year. Prior to using the [[Gregorian calendar]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]] people counted years from first snow to first snow. Kiowas were unique in choosing two images per year– one for the winter and one representing the summer Sun Dance.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the late 19th century when buffalo became scarce, winter counts were painted in buffalo hides. The annual pictograms could be arranged in a linear, spiral, or serpentine pattern.&lt;ref name=s8&gt;Szabo, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visionary painting===
Visions and dreams could inspire designs. [[Buckskin (leather)|Buckskin]] covers for circular rawhide hide shields, in particular, are inspired by men's visions and can include paintings of humans, animals, or spirit beings, reflecting the owner's personal powers and providing protection.&lt;ref name=s5/&gt;&lt;ref name=p112&gt;Penney, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Designs could be obtained from the warriors who received the visions or from medicine men. [[Cheyenne]] men who received visions were allowed to make four shields with the design. Among the [[Kiowa]] and [[Kiowa-Apache]] about 50 possible shield designs existed.&lt;ref name=s6&gt;Szabo, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tipi]]s could be painted with visionary designs. The design and related power belonged to the tipi-owner, which could be transferred by inheritance, marriage, or, among some tribes such as the [[Blackfeet]], sale.&lt;ref name=s6/&gt;

Followers of the [[Ghost dance]] religion painted visionary designs on their clothing. [[Arapaho]] and Lakota ghost dance shirts were painted with crows, [[magpies]], turtles, and cedar trees.&lt;ref name=p112/&gt;

==Process and materials==
Buffalo hides, as well as deer, elk, and other animal hides, are painted. Clothing and robes are often brain-tanned to be soft and supple. Parfleches, shields, and [[moccasin]] soles are rawhide for toughness.

In the past, Plains artists used a bone or wood [[stylus]] to paint with natural mineral and vegetable pigments. Sections of buffalo rib could be ground to expose the marrow, which was absorbent and worked like a contemporary ink marker.&lt;ref&gt;Penney, 124&lt;/ref&gt; Swelling [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]] buds provided brown pigment.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Lakota artists used to burn yellow clay to produce ceremonial red paint. Lakotas associated blue pigments with women.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, 246&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier times, all members of a tribe might paint but highly skilled individuals might be commissioned by others to create artwork.&lt;ref name=s6/&gt; Before the 20th century, when a Kiowa man needed to repaint his lodge, he would invite 20-30 friends to paint the entire tipi in a single day. He would then treat them all to a feast.&lt;ref name=s7/&gt;

==Related art forms==
Many tribes throughout North America, besides those on the Plains, also painted hides, following different aesthetic traditions. Subarctic tribes are known for their painted caribou hides. On the Plains, when buffalo herds were being slaughtered in the late 19th century, other painting surfaces became available, such as muslin, paper, and canvas, giving birth to [[Ledger art]].&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 16&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Plains beadwork and jewelry used designs from hide painting.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, 263&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23363">'''Post-expressionism''' is a term coined by the German [[art critic]] [[Franz Roh]] to describe a variety of movements in the post-war art world which were influenced by [[expressionism]] but defined themselves through rejecting its aesthetic. Roh first used the term in an essay in 1925, "Magic Realism: Post-Expressionism", to contrast to [[Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub]]'s "[[New Objectivity]]", which more narrowly characterized these developments within German art. Though Roh saw "post-expressionism" and "[[Magic Realism (painting)|magic realism]]" as synonymous, later critics characterized distinctions between magic realism and other artists initially identified by Hartlaub and have also pointed out other artists in Europe who had different stylistic tendencies but were working within the same trend.

==Background==

Leading up to [[World War I]], much of the art world was under the influence of [[Futurism]] and [[Expressionism]]. Both movements abandoned any sense of order or commitment to objectivity or tradition.

The sentiment of Futurists was most vocally expressed by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Filippo Marinetti]] in the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'', where he called for a rejection of the past, a rejection of all imitation &amp;mdash; of other artists or of the outside world &amp;mdash; and praised the virtue of originality and triumph of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Umbro Apollonio (ed.), ''Futurist Manifestos'', MFA Publications, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-87846-627-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, along these lines, said “After seeing electricity, I lost interest in nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Greaves, Zaller, and Roberts 1997, p.779&lt;/ref&gt; Marinetti and other Futurists glorified war and violence as a way to revolution &amp;ndash; bringing freedom, establishing new ideas, and rallying one to fight for one's own people &amp;ndash; and as war was shaping up in Europe, many saw it and encouraged a way to “purify” the culture and destroy old, obsolete elements of society.

Expressionists, likewise abandoning imitation nature, sought to express emotional experience, but often centered their art around [[angst]] &amp;mdash; inner turmoil; whether in reaction to the modern world, to alienation from society, or in the creation of personal identity. In concert with this evocation of angst, expressionists also echoed some of the same feelings of revolution as did Futurists. This is evidenced by a 1919 anthology of expressionist poetry titled ''[[Menschheitsdämmerung]]'', which translates to “Dawn of Humanity” &amp;mdash; meant to suggest that humanity was in a 'twilight'; that there was an imminent demise of some old way of being and beneath it the urgings of a new dawning.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Both futurism and expressionism were always met by opposition, but the destruction that occurred in the war had heightened the criticism against them. Following the war, in and throughout different artistic circles there was a call for a [[Return to Order|return to order]] and re-appreciation of tradition and of the natural world. In Italy, this was encouraged by the magazine ''[[Valori Plastici]]'' and came together in the [[Novecento Italiano|Novecento]], a group that exhibited in the Venice Biennale and was joined by many Futurists who had rejected their former work. [[Mario Sironi]], a member of this group, stated that they “would not imitate the world created by God but would be inspired by it.” The “New Objectivity” or ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', as coined by Hartlaub, described the developments in Germany and became the title of an exhibition that he staged in 1925. ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' was influenced not only by the “return to order” but also a call to arms among more left-leaning artists who wanted to use their art in a forward, political manner that expressionism didn't enable them to do. In Belgium, there was another vein in the common trend, which would later be referred to as a “retour à l’humain”.

==Movements==

When Hartlaub defined the idea of the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', he identified two groups: the ''verists'', who “[tore] the objective form of the world of contemporary facts and represent current experience in its tempo and fevered temperature,” and the ''classicists'', who “[searched] more for the object of timeless ability to embody the external laws of existence in the artistic sphere.”

Although Roh originally meant the term 'Magic Realism' to be more or less synonymous with ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', the artists identified by Hartlaub as 'classicists' later became associated with Roh's term. These 'Magic Realists' were all influenced by the classicism developed in Italy by the Novecento, and in turn by [[de Chirico]]'s concept of ''[[metaphysical art]]'', which had also branched into surrealism. Art critic [[Wieland Schmeid]] in 1977 posited that despite the fact that the terms were meant to refer to the same thing, the understanding of them as different groups derives from the fact that the movement had a right and left wing, with the Magic Realists on the right &amp;mdash; many later supporting fascism or accommodating to it&amp;mdash; and the ''verists'' we associate as the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' on the left &amp;mdash; fighting against fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Crockett 1998, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups in addition to having different political philosophies likewise had different artistic philosophies.

The third movement that is important to include in post-expressionism, and which Roh excluded, is the reaction to [[Flemish Expressionism]], as opposed to strains of German expressionism and Italian futurism. This is typically referred to as ''animism''.

===Magic Realism===

{{Main|Magic Realism (painting)}}
[[File:Donghi antonio-due canarini in gabbia-reduced size.jpg|thumb|275px|left|''Due canarini in gabbia'' by Antonio Donghi, 1932]]
[[File:Anton Raderscheidt, 1926, Tulpen auf der Fensterbank.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''Tulpen auf der Fensterbank'' by Anton Räderscheidt, 1926]]
'Magic Realism' for Roh, as a reaction to expressionism, meant to declare “[that] the autonomy of the objective world around us was once more to be enjoyed; the wonder of matter that could crystallize into objects was to be seen anew.”&lt;ref&gt;Zamora and Ferris 1995&lt;/ref&gt; With the term, he was emphasizing the “magic” of the normal world as it presents itself to us &amp;mdash; how, when we really look at everyday objects, they can appear strange and fantastic.

In Italy, the style that Roh identified was created by a confluence of a renewed focus on harmony and technique called for by the “return to order” and ''metaphysical art'', a style which had been developed by Carlo Carrà and Giorgio de Chirico, two members of the Novecento. Carrà described his purpose as to explore the imagined inner life of familiar objects when represented out of their explanatory contexts: their solidity, their separateness in the space allotted to them, the secret dialogue that may take place between them.

The leading painter in Italy associated with this style is perhaps [[Antonio Donghi]], who kept to traditional subject matter &amp;mdash; popular life, landscapes, and still life &amp;mdash; but presented it with strong composition and spatial clarity to give it gravity and stillness. His still lifes often consist of a small vase of flowers, depicted with the disarming symmetry of [[naive art]]. He also often painted birds carefully arranged for display in their cages, and dogs and other animals ready to perform for circus acts, to suggest an artificial arrangement placed on top of nature. In Germany, [[Anton Räderscheidt]] followed a style similar to Donghi, turning to magic realism after abandoning constructivism. [[Georg Schrimpf]] is somewhat like the two, working in a style influenced by [[primitivism]].

[[Filippo De Pisis]], who is often associated with ''metaphysical art'', can also be seen as a magic realist. Like Donghi, he often painted traditional subjects, but rather than developing a strict classical style, used a more painterly brush to bring out the intimacy of the objects, similar to the Belgian ''animists''. His association with ''metaphysical art'' comes from the fact that he would often contrapose objects in his still lifes, and set them in a scene that gave them context.

Another artist in Italy considered a [[magic realism|magic realist]] is [[Felice Casorati]], whose paintings are rendered with fine technique but often distinguished by unusual perspective effects and bold colorfulness. In 1925, Rafaello Giolli summarized the disconcerting aspects of Casorati's art — “The volumes have no weight in them, and the colors no body. Everything is fictitious: even the living lack all nervous vitality. The sun seems to be the moon ... nothing is fixed or definite.”

Other German artists who worked within this style are [[Alexander Kanoldt]] and [[Carl Grossberg]]. Kanoldt painted still lifes and portraits, while Grossberg painted urban landscapes and industrial sites rendered with chilly precision.

===New Objectivity and Verism===

{{Main|New Objectivity}}
[[File:George grosz-the eclipse of the sun.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''The Eclipse of the Sun'' by George Grosz, 1926]]
The artists most associated with the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' today are those Hartlaub identified as 'verists'. These artists tended to oppose expressionism, but did not so much exemplify the “return to order” as much as they opposed what they saw as the political impotence of expressionist art. They sought to involve themselves into revolutionary politics and their form of realism distorted appearances to emphasize the ugly, as they wanted to expose what they considered the ugliness of reality. The art was raw, provocative, and harshly satirical.

[[Bertolt Brecht]], a German dramatist, was an early critic of Expressionism, referring to it as constrained and superficial. Just like in politics Germany had a new parliament but lacked parliamentarians, he argued, in literature there was an expression of delight in ideas, but no new ideas, and in theater a 'will to drama', but no real drama. His early plays, ''Baal'' and ''Trommeln in der Nacht'' (Drums in the Night) express repudiations of fashionable interest in Expressionism. Opposed to the focus on individual emotional experience in expressionist art, Brecht began a collaborative method to play production, starting with his ''[[Man Equals Man]]'' project.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the ''verist'' critique of expressionism was influenced by [[Dadaism]]. The early exponents of Dada had been drawn together in Switzerland, a neutral country in the war, and in common cause, they wanted to use their art as a form of moral and cultural protest &amp;mdash; shaking off not only the constraints of nationality, but also of artistic language, in order to express political outrage and encourage political action.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Expressionism, to Dadaists, expressed all of the angst and anxieties of society, but was helpless to do anything about it.

Out of this, Dada cultivated a “satirical hyperrealism”, as termed by [[Raoul Hausmann]], and of which the best known examples are the graphical works and photo-montages of [[John Heartfield]]. Use of collage in these works became a ''compositional'' principle to blend reality and art, as if to suggest that to record the facts of reality was to go beyond the most simple appearances of things.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; This later developed into portraits and scenes by artists such as [[George Grosz]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Rudolf Schlichter]]. Portraits would give emphasis to particular features or objects that were seen as distinctive aspects of the person depicted. Satirical scenes often depicted a madness behind what was happening, depicting the participants as cartoon-like.

Other ''verist'' artists, like Christian Schad, depicted reality with a clinical precision, which suggested both an empirical detachment and intimate knowledge of the subject. Schad's paintings are characterized "an artistic perception so sharp that it seems to cut beneath the skin", according to Schmied.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied 1978, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Often, psychological elements were introduced in his work, which suggested an underlying unconscious reality to life.

===Animism===

{{Main|Animism (art)}}
[[File:Wolvens, Bont strandzicht, reduced size.jpg|thumb|430px|left|''Bont strandzicht'' by Henri-Victor Wolvens, 1959. Wolvens began his style in the 1920s but worked until his death in 1977.]]
In Belgium, expressionism had been influenced by artists like [[James Ensor]] and [[Louis Pevernagie]] who had combined expressionism with [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. Ensor, known for his paintings of people in masks, carnival outfits, and side-by-side with skeletons, also often painted realistic scenes, but imbued them with a fevered brush, garish colors, and strong contrasts to suggest a strange unreality present in them, as did Pevernagie. Expressionism was also exhibited in the [[Latemse School]], where adherents like [[Constant Permeke]] and [[Hubert Malfait]] used brushwork in painting and loose form in sculpture to show a mystic reality behind nature.

In what had been called a “retour à l’humain” (return to the human), many artists working in Belgium after the war had kept the expressive brush of their forebearers, but had rejected what they had seen as the anti-human, unreal distortions in their subject matter. The goal was to use the expressive brush to depict the soul or spirit of the objects, people, and places they were painting, rather than a hyperbolic, externalized, displaced angst of the artist. These artists were often characterized as 'introverts', as opposed to the 'extroverts' of expressionism.
[[File:Jespers, floris-still life with coffeepot.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Stillleben mit Kaffeekanne'' by Floris Jespers, 1932. Jespers was influenced by animism after the war.]]
Belgian art critic [[Paul Haesaerts]] later gave this movement the title ''animism'', which he took from anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]]'s book ''Primitive Culture'' (1871) describing '[[animism]]' as primitive religion that based itself on the idea a soul inhabited all objects. Later, Haesaerts, driven by criticism to do so, also used the terms ''réalisme poétique'' and ''intimism'', although ''animism'' is still most commonly used in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumhermandecuyper.be/evolutie_animisme_en.htm|title= ''Artistic evolution: animism'' |publisher = Museum Herman De Cuyper}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intimism'' will more often refer to the art practiced by some members of the [[Les Nabis|Nabis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/291874/Intimism|title= ''Intimism'' |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recognized painter of these artists is [[Henri-Victor Wolvens]], who painted many scenes of the beach and ocean at [[Oostende]]. In his beach scenes, harsh waves are painted with a rough brush, clouds in patches &amp;mdash; rougher when in storm &amp;mdash; and the sand with a scraped quality. Figures are painted as simply as possible, often as stick figures, and given translucency and movement &amp;mdash; so his bathers show the activity of the beach and it the activity of the bathers blend in with the motion of the waves crashing ashore.

The work of [[Floris Jespers]] was strongly influenced by an animist spirit after the war. He uses form and color to give different degrees of vividness to the subjects in his paintings, each to the degree that one would associate them with in life.

Other painters associated with this movement are [[Anne Bonnet]], [[Albert Dasnoy]], [[Henri Evenepoel]], [[Mayou Iserentant]], [[Jacques Maes]], [[Marcel Stobbaerts]], [[Albert Van Dyck]], [[Louis Van Lint]], [[War Van Overstraeten]] and [[Jozef Vinck]].

Filippo De Pisis, referenced above, exhibited animist tendencies.

[[George Grard]] is the sculptor most associated with animism. Like expressionists, he went against both naturalism and classical tendencies, but used exaggerations from his models to heighten the feeling and sensuality of the form, and chose lyrical subjects. Grard was friends with [[Charles LePlae]], who had a similar style, but kept more in line with natural and classical forms.

[[Herman De Cuyper]] is also associated with animism, and abstracted to a more extreme degree than did Grard or LaPlae, and in some ways is more similar to [[Henry Moore]].

==Counter-movements==

An early revolt against the imposed classicism that was popular in the Novecento took place with the founding of the ''[[Scuola Romana]]''.

===Romantic Expressionism===

{{Main|Scuola Romana}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mafai, fantasia no 9 , 1942.jpg|thumb|400px|right|''Fantasia n.9 &amp;mdash; Fucilazione'' by Mario Mafai, 1942]] --&gt;
[[Corrado Cagli]] was a member of this group, and identified himself and others whom he met as members of the “New Roman School of Painting”, or ''nuovi pittori romani'' (new Roman painters).&lt;ref&gt;''Anticipi sulla Scuola di Roma (Anticipations on the School of Rome)'' on "Quadrante" (I, 1933 n.6)&lt;/ref&gt; Cagli spoke of a spreading sensitivity and an ''Astro di Roma'' (Roman Star) which guided them, affirming it as the poetic basis of their art:
{{quote|''In a primordial dawn all has to be reconsidered, and Imagination relives all wonders and trembles for all mysteries.''}}

Sometimes referred to as ''romantic expressionism'', art from this group exhibits a wild painting style, expressive and disorderly, violent and with warm ochre and maroon tones. Contrary to early expressionism, the focus isn't on angst and turmoil, but rather seeing the world anew, as Cagli described, through romantic imagination. Yet, the formal rigour of the Novecento was replaced by a distinctly expressionist visionariness.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Renato Barilli, ''L'arte contemporanea: da [[Cézanne]] alle ultime tendenze'', Feltrinelli, 2005, p.248: "... a savage and reductive raffiguration dominates, which recalls distant baroque trends, or even closer to the expressionist furores of artists such as [[Chagall]], made viable to them thanks to Antonietta Raphaël, who had known him in [[Paris]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scipione]] brought to life a sort of Roman baroque expressionism, where often decadent landscapes appear of Rome's historical baroque centre, populated by priests and cardinals, seen with a vigorously expressive and hallucinated eye.

[[Mario Mafai]] painted many scenes of Rome and its suburbs, and used warm chromatic colors to convey a sense of freshness and pictorial curiosity. This bent is particularly emphasised in his 1936-1939 work, in a series paintings entitled ''Demolitions'', where in order to make a political statement he painted urban restructuring being carried out by the fascist regime. During the Second World War he painted a series of ''Fantasies'' depicting horrors committed by the fascists.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. F. Negri Arnoldi, ''Storia dell'Arte Moderna'', [[Milan]] 1990, pp.613-616&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonietta Raphaël]], Mafai's wife and a sculptor, was also a member of this group.

Another member was [[Renatto Guttuso]], who like Mafai made paintings which denounced the fascist regime. Guttuso's works are generally bright, lively, and verging on abstraction.

[[Emanuele Cavalli]] and [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]] have associations both with the ''Scuola Romana'' and with Magic Realism.

A '''postface''' is the opposite of a [[preface]], a brief article or explanatory information placed at the end of a [[book]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postface | title=Postface | work=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfaces are quite often used in books so that the non-pertinent information will appear at the end of the literary work, and not confuse the reader.

A postface is a text added to the end of a book or written as a supplement or conclusion, usually to give a comment, an explanation, or a warning. The postface can be written by the author of a document or by another person. The postface is separated from the main body of the book and is placed in the appendices pages. The postface presents information that is not essential to the entire book, but which is considered relevant.

'''Postmodern theatre''' is a recent phenomenon in world theatre, coming as it does out of the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[philosophy]] that originated in Europe in the middle of the twentieth century. Postmodern theatre emerged as a reaction against modernist theatre. Most postmodern productions are centered on highlighting the fallibility of definite truth, instead encouraging the audience to reach their own individual understanding. Essentially, thus, postmodern theatre raises questions rather than attempting to supply answers.

==Postmodern techniques==
A postmodern theatrical production might make use of some or all of the following techniques:

# The accepted norms of seeing and representing the world are challenged and disregarded, while experimental theatrical perceptions and representations are created.
# A [[pastiche]] of different textualities and [[Media (arts)|media]] forms are used, including the simultaneous use of multiple [[art]] or media forms, and there is the 'theft' of a heterogeneous group of artistic forms.
# The narrative needs not be complete but can be broken, [[paradox]]ical and imagistic. There is a movement away from linearity to multiplicity (to inter-related webs of stories), where acts and scenes give way to a series of peripatetic dramatic moments.
# Characters are fragmented, forming a collection of contrasting and parallel shards stemming from a central idea, theme or traditional character.
# Each new performance of a theatrical pieces is a new [[wiktionary:Gestalt|Gestalt]], a unique spectacle, with no intent on methodically repeating a play.
# The audience is integral to the shared [[meaning-making]] of the performance process and its members are included in the dialogue of the play.
# There is a rejection of the notions of "High" and "Low" art. The production exists only in the viewer's mind as what the viewer interprets - nothing more and nothing less.
# The rehearsal process in a theatrical production is driven more by shared meaning-making and improvisation, rather than the scripted text.
# The play steps back from reality to create its own self-conscious atmosphere. This is sometimes referred to as [[metatheatre]].

While these techniques are often found in postmodern productions they are never part of a centralised movement or style.  Rather, they are tools for authentic introspection, questioning and representation of human experience.

'''Roy Henry Vickers''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CM|OBC}} (born June 1946 in [[Laxgalts'ap|Laxgalts'ap (now known as Greenville)]], [[British Columbia]]) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[First Nations]] artist.  He owns and operates a gallery in [[Tofino, British Columbia]].

Vickers was born on the [[Nass River]] but raised in [[Kitkatla, British Columbia|Kitkatla]], [[Hazelton, British Columbia]], and [[Victoria (British Columbia)|Victoria]], B.C.  His father was a fisherman who was matrilineally [[Tsimshian]], also with [[Haida people|Haida]] and [[Heiltsuk]] ancestry.  His mother was a schoolteacher whose parents had emigrated from [[England]] and who was in the 1940s adopted into the [[Laxsgiik|Eagle clan]] at Kitkatla, B.C. (making Roy also Eagle).  His grandfather was a Kitkatla canoe-carver.  The paintings and works that he has created reflect this mixed heritage as his work has many elements of the traditional art of the First Nations peoples of the Pacific Northwest, but remains quite distinctive.

Vickers became interested in Northwest Coast art partly under the influence of the anthropologist [[Wilson Duff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=admin |url=http://www.firstnationsdrum.com/2002/12/referendum-ballots-go-out-to-bc-electorate/ |title=Referendum Ballots Go Out to BC Electorate |publisher=Firstnationsdrum.com |date=2002-12-28 |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work has been the official gift of the Province of British Columbia to visiting foreign leaders several times.  In 1987 the original of his painting ''A Meeting of Chiefs'' was the official gift to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and in 1993 artist's proofs of his print ''The Homecoming'' were the Province's gift to [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Boris Yeltsin]].

Vickers has been the artistic advisor to several events in British Columbia.  In 1994 he was the artistic advisor to the architects and designers of the [[1994 Commonwealth Games]].  For the Games Vickers also created more than 20 [[totem poles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megaphonemagazine.com/_peace_recovery_clarity%3c/ref ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, from 1987 to 1995, Vickers was the artistic advisor for the [[Vancouver International Airport]]'s new terminal. Some of his work is prominently displayed there for travellers to admire.

Once a substance abuser, in 1992 he created VisionQuest, a [[non-profit]] organization designed to help individuals with addictive personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacGregor|first1=Roy|title=The story of the Fraser River: A 'symbol of life' that can also be violent and deadly|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-story-of-the-fraser-river-a-symbol-of-life-that-can-also-be-violent-and-deadly/article31403733/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=12 July 2017|location=Hope, B.C.|language=en-ca|date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vickers has published several books which are collections of his art, and has illustrated many other works. Among these publications are:

"'''Snow Drifts'''" is the twenty-first episode of the [[Once Upon a Time (season 3)|third season]] of the American fantasy drama series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', and the show's 65th episode overall, which aired on May 11, 2014. The episode serves as the first of a two part episode for the third season finale and was written by [[David H. Goodman]] &amp; [[Robert Hull]] and directed by [[Ron Underwood]].
In this episode, everyone in Storybrooke joins Mary Margaret and David as they prepare to give their newborn son a coronation, while the time traveling portal that Zelena created before her demise comes to life, and takes [[Emma Swan]] and [[Captain Hook]] back to the Enchanted Forest before the events of the original curse. Emma and Hook must find a way to return to Storybrooke. But in their quest to return, they accidentally ruin Snow and Charming's first meeting, and they must repair the timeline with Rumplestiltskin's help before it is too late to undo the damage.

==Plot==

===Opening Sequence===
Zelena's time travel portal opens in the Enchanted Forest.

===Event chronology===
The Boston flashbacks happen years after "[[Awake (Once Upon a Time)| Awake]]" and before "[[Breaking Glass (Once Upon a Time)|Breaking Glass]]" while the Enchanted Forest past events happen after "[[A Tale of Two Sisters (Once Upon a Time)|A Tale of Two Sisters]]" and changing the events of "[[Snow Falls]]" and before "[[There's No Place Like Home (Once Upon a Time)|There's No Place Like Home]]".  

===In the Characters' Past===
In the past (our world) a young girl leaves with a couple in a car from an adoption agency, where an eleven-year-old [[Emma Swan]]&lt;ref&gt;According to "[[Selfless, Brave and True]]", Emma came to Storybrooke in October 2011 (the moment August started turning into wood, as stated in "[[The Stranger (Once Upon a Time)|The Stranger]]"). This was her 28th birthday, according to "[[Pilot (Once Upon a Time)|Pilot]]". Season Two and the first half of Season Three takes place a few months later, and the second half of Season Three takes place one year later, in 2013. In "[[The Tower (Once Upon a Time)|The Tower]]", David says that it's been nearly thirty years since Emma was born. This means that Emma has not turned 30 yet. The flashback takes place 18 years earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; is standing, looking upset that she'll never have a perfect family, but the foster manager comes up to her and tells Emma, "Don't worry, you'll find a home too, Emma."

===In Storybrooke===
In the present day, Emma looks happy and sees Mary Margaret holding her baby boy as she prepares for the upcoming coronation even though they haven't named him yet. Henry is looking for apartments and both Henry and Mary Margaret ask Emma what she thinks. Emma changes the subject and starts thinking why her parents are trying to expand the time they need to name the unnamed baby by using an age-old tradition. Meanwhile, Regina and Robin Hood are sharing some romantic time together. She tells him about how TinkerBell told her about them being soulmates, how she saw the lion tattoo but didn't approach him in the pub. However, Robin is happy to hear that, saying it must be the right time for them now. Later on at Granny's, everyone is recalling or retelling stories of how Mary Margaret and David originally met back in the Enchanted Forest and how they kept running into one another and were destined to be together. When Emma reveals her desire to return to New York City with Henry in an attempt to leave Storybrooke behind, Regina and the others exclaim in protest. Suddenly Gold notices an orange beam rising in the distance, which he tells them is the time portal. As this starts to happen, Emma tells everyone that she wants to go back to New York City and everyone including Regina doesn't like the idea. Emma then walks out and Hook follows her, taking the fairytale book with him. Meanwhile, Regina, David, Belle, Gold, Robin, and Mary Margaret visit the jail to see if Zelena had died around the same time as the portal's opening. They see on the jail's surveillance video that she committed suicide, but are unaware that Gold altered the video to make it look like she killed herself.

As they stop by the park, Emma tells Hook that she is confused about going back to New York City. Hook then hands Emma the book, telling her Henry hoped it would remind her where they're from. The conversation is cut short when they notice the time-travel orange beam forming and Emma runs towards the barn, where the doors burst open. The beam pulls Emma towards the vortex, and Hook tries to hold her back by digging his hook into the ground with Emma holding onto his leg. Emma can't hold on and is immediately sucked into the portal. Hook says "One of these days I'm going to have to stop chasing this woman,"  and jumps in after her. The portal closes as her cellphone, which is left behind in the barnyard, is ringing with a call from David, who was trying to warn her.

===In the Enchanted Forest's New Past===
Seconds later, both Emma and Hook land in the Enchanted Forest. It turns out that, while going through the portal, Emma was thinking of her parents' first meeting, which is how and where they ended up. The two then come across the wanted signs for Snow White from the past and then stumble onto a village, where they see Regina terrorizing the villagers demanding that they tell her where her stepdaughter is.  Regina proves that she is not kidding by having a woman arrested for helping Snow. Emma wants to help the woman, but Hook warns her about changing the future so they can't save the woman, since the villagers that were threatened by The Evil Queen included Pinocchio, Gepetto, and Granny. Around the same time, both Prince James (Charming) and Abigail are in the carriage in the moments before Snow and James are due to meet. Snow cuts a tree down to make her highway robbery, causing the carriage to stop as she is in a tree waiting. As Charming gets out the carriage to investigate, Emma makes the biggest mistake in altering the timeline by making an accidental noise and surprises Snow, who falls and runs aways, empty handed without taking the jewels from the carriage, and preventing her parents from meeting for the first time. Emma discovers that she screwed up the past and realizes that the only way to stop this altered timeline is by seeking out the only person capable of correcting this mistake, namely Rumplestiltskin. As the approach Rumplestiltskin's castle, Rumplestiltskin himself appears out of nowhere ready to kill Hook (as he still holds a grudge after Hook stole his wife, Milah, and [[The Crocodile (Once Upon a Time)|took the magic bean]] Rumplestiltskin was going to use to find his son, Baelfire) but Emma then reveals to him that he will create the curse that he hopes will one day find his son Baelfire, and killing Hook will further destroy the timeline. As the pages in the book start to become blank, time is starting to run out for Emma to fix what she has done, and Rumplestiltskin tells her the only way to correct this is to go to the ball that will be held at King Midas' palace.

Seeing that Snow wants passage after failing to secure one from Blackbeard, they hatch a plan to have her steal the ring for passage out of the forest by using Hook’s ship, which means they have to pay a visit to the tavern to distract a past version of Killian Jones, so Hook sends Emma to distract the Past Hook while he's drinking with his mates. The Future Hook suddenly becomes jealous of Past Hook for flirting with Emma, as she keeps Past Hook occupied while Future Hook offers Snow a deal, but things get out of hand when Smee first becomes confused by the difference in his captain, and second when Past Hook shows up while Future Hook is still there. Emma orders him to leave, and Hook looks on jealously as the Past Hook comes on and kisses her. The Future Hook then taps his previous life on the shoulder and punches him. Hook replies that he was asking for it, saying that he'll blame the rum for his actions.

Later that night at Midas' palace, Emma and Hook watch to see what happens when Rumplestiltskin appears. He gives them an invitation and alters their looks so they can blend in. As they enter the palace, Emma gives them the [[Pseudonym|aliases]] "[[Princess Leia]]" and "[[Prince Charles]]" in front of King Midas, and as they take a waltz together they see James and Abigail together but she doesn't want to dance with James. The Evil Queen arrives at the palace to ask Midas to search the place just in time for Snow to show up and take the ring. As expected, James captures Snow, altering the timeline of the first time they met (and she hits him, this time with a jewelry box instead of a rock). As she makes her escape, Emma sees her running and James yelling at her to stop and saying that he'll find her (another altered timeline in their encounter), only to have Emma (who finds the ring left behind by Snow and hides it from plain view) get caught by Regina and arrested. The story continues in the following episode.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
The episode, along with "There's No Place Like Home," pulled in respectable numbers, placing a 2.3/7 with 6.8 million viewers tuning in (as they were combined as a two-hour episode), winning in both the 8 pm and 9 pm timeslots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/05/12/tv-ratings-sunday-revenge-once-upon-a-time-finales-rise-the-simpsons-down-rosemarys-baby-low/262779/ "TV Ratings Sunday: 'Revenge' &amp; 'Once Upon A Time' Finales Rise, 'The Simpsons' Down, 'Rosemary's Baby' Low"] from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (May 12, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==References==

{{Italic title}}
'''''The Breakdown''''' was a 1926 painting by Scottish artist [[John Bulloch Souter]] (1890–1972) which stirred controversy in the [[United Kingdom]] during the [[Jazz Age]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2018}}{{sfn|Rendezvous Gallery|1918}} The work depicted a musician playing the [[saxophone]] while a naked woman dances in a trance.{{sfn|Shearer|2018}}{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=364}} Following widespread outrage, the painting was withdrawn from the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1926 after one week at the request of the British [[Colonial Office]] as the subject matter "was considered to be obnoxious to British subjects living abroad in daily contact with a coloured population".{{sfn|Tackley|2005|p=188}}{{sfn|Parsonage|2007|page=95}} The painting was then destroyed by its author and his wife,{{sfn|Rendezvous Gallery|1918}} but Souter preserved his preparatory drawings and made a second version in the 1960s.{{sfn|Shearer|2018}} The painting has been described as embodying the fears of Western civilization towards [[jazz]] music.{{sfn|Blake|1999|p=89}}

==Description==
In Souter's painting, an [[androgynous]] woman dancer has short [[bob cut|shingled]] hair,{{sfn|Tackley|2005|p=188}} and her eyes are closed, as if she is in a [[trance]].{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=364}} Her discarded clothes and shoes lie on the ground, with just one green earring visible. The musician is in full [[white tie]] evening dress with a [[top hat]]; he sits on a cast down and broken classical statue of possibly [[Minerva]], the goddess of virginity and traditional values.{{sfn|Tackley|2005|p=188}}{{sfn|Parsonage|2007|page=95}}{{sfn|Blake|1999|p=89}} The musician is black and the woman is white, playing on contemporaneous concerns about the popularity of (largely black) [[jazz music]] to the (largely white) British public, and the perceived threat posed by black men to white women.{{sfn|McKay|2018}} According to Karl Toepfer, "the musician gazes not at the woman but out toward the spectator, and the implication is that jazz and dance together allow man and woman to cross racial barriers and form a new and mysteriously intimate (or trusting) sort of couple, each immersed in separate aspirations."{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=364}}

Souter's stated intention was to "illustrate the tendency nowadays for Jazz influence to permeate our daily lives",{{sfn|Rendezvous Gallery|1918}} and to "suggest the fascination exercised by the primitive and savage upon the over-civilised".{{sfn|Shearer|2018}}  The title is a reference to a [[African-American dance|slave dance]] called the "break down", and to the breakdown of traditions.

==Exhibition==
The painting was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] starting on 3 May 1926, the day before the start of the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]].  The painting was viewed by King [[George V]] and praised by the [[President of the Royal Academy]], [[Frank Dicksee]], as "a work of great promise by executed with a considerable degree of excellence".{{sfn|Rendezvous Gallery|1918}} However, the world press fixated upon the painting and its exhibition quickly became controversial.{{sfn|Rendezvous Gallery|1918}} According to Catherine Tackley, professor of music at the [[University of Liverpool]], "the reaction to the painting epitomises the response to this new jazz music. Huge popular enthusiasm – and an undercurrent of suspicion that this was a dangerous new art form subverting decent society."{{sfn|Kennedy|2018}} The work was widely condemned in British newspapers and periodicals. In an early edition of the ''[[Melody Maker]]'', a British weekly [[music journalism|music magazine]], London-born critic Edgar Jackson demanded the painting be encindered:

{{quote|{{resize|90%|"‘Breakdown’ is not only a picture entirely nude of the respect due to the chastity and morality of the younger generation but in the degradation it implies to modern white woman there is the perversive danger to the community and the best thing that could happen to it is to have it … burnt!"{{sfn|McKay|2018}}{{sfn|Shearer|2018}}}}}}

In the [[United States of America]], the ''[[Boston Evening Transcript]]'' criticised the work under the headline "A Racial Outrage" and claimed the painting was designed "to horrify decent people".{{sfn|Kennedy|2018}} Likewise, in South Africa, the ''[[Cape Argus]]'' deemed the work to be a "problem picture … Negro Supersedes Minerva".{{sfn|Kennedy|2018}} Ultimately, the painting was removed after only five days at the request of the [[Colonial Office]] and replaced by a portrait of Lady [[Diana Manners]] by [[James Jebusa Shannon]].{{sfn|McKay|2005|pp=121-22}}

Souter and his wife Christian Grace Reid destroyed his original 1926 painting,{{sfn|Rendezvous Gallery|1918}} but Souter kept his preparatory drawings.{{sfn|Kennedy|2018}} For decades it was only known from a photograph published in the exhibition catalogue, but Souter made a second version in the 1960s.{{sfn|Shearer|2018}} A charcoal study was acquired by the Aberdeen Art Gallery in 2016, with funding from the Scottish [[National Fund for Acquisitions]].{{sfn|Aberdeen Art Gallery|1918}}

==Legacy and influence==
[[Evelyn Waugh]] attended the exhibition in its first week. The controversy over the painting may have inspired him to include a mixed-race relationship between the white Margot and black Chokey in his 1928 novel ''[[Decline and Fall]]''.

'''''The Holy Family with the Dragonfly''''', also known as '''''The Holy Family with the Mayfly''''', '''''The Holy Family with the Locust''''' and '''''The Holy Family with the Butterfly''''' is an [[engraving]] by the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528) from approximately 1495. It is quite small but full of intricate detail. A very popular image, subject to infringement within five years of creation, it appears in collections, including the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]&lt;ref name="ima"/&gt; and the UK [[Royal Collection]].&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{Royal Collection|800057|The Holy Family}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''The Holy Family with the Dragonfly'', alternately known as ''The Holy Family with the Butterfly'', ''The Holy Family with the Locust'',&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition of Albert Durer's engravings, etchings, and dry-points, and most of the woodcuts executed from his designs|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|date=1888|url=https://archive.org/stream/exhibitionalber00sewagoog/exhibitionalber00sewagoog_djvu.txt|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Virgin with the Dragonfly'',&lt;ref name="ima"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|date=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an early engraving by Dürer. It depicts both the [[Holy Family]] and the [[Holy Trinity]], as the [[Virgin Mary]] sits on a bench holding [[Jesus]] with [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] beside them, while [[God the Father]] and the [[Holy Ghost]] in the form of a dove look down from the clouds. In the lower right corner is an insect frequently identified as a dragonfly. However, Dürer may have intended it as a butterfly, a creature whose dramatically transformative life-cycle makes it a perfect symbol of resurrection and redemption.&lt;ref name="royal"/&gt; The abundance of beautifully-rendered textures in the richly detailed landscape show how early Dürer mastered the art of engraving.&lt;ref name="ima"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - The Holy Family with the Mayfly (NGA 1943.3.3453).jpg|thumb|upright|A variant: ''The Holy Family with the Mayfly'' (NGA 1943.3.3453)]]
The exact date of creation is not known. It may have been an imitative piece from his apprenticeship, a copy of older master such as [[Martin Schongauer]]. The precise shape of Dürer's monogram is most similar to works dated 1494-95, and the presence of a gondola in the background places it after his 1494 trip to Venice.&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; It is the first print on which he placed his monogram, and the only one in which the D is lowercase.&lt;ref name="royal"/&gt; By placing his mark on it, he claimed authorship of the work, unlike the numerous anonymous artists of his day. This act of ownership offered no protection, however, since his international renown as an artistic genius meant copies appeared throughout Italy and Germany by 1500.&lt;ref name="ima"/&gt;

In Dürer's Germany, Mary and Jesus were grounded and human, making them highly sympathetic for mere mortals.&lt;ref name="ima"/&gt; That meant tender scenes such as this were extremely popular. Dürer made many prints of this theme to be sold in shops and by traveling salesmen so worshipers could paste them into books or attach them to walls as devotional objects.&lt;ref name="royal"/&gt;

==Insect==
[[File:Insect in Dürer's Holy Family with the Mayfly detail.jpg|thumb|Insect in Dürer's ''The Holy Family with the Mayfly''. Detail of "[[mayfly]]" in lower right corner of engraving]]

The type of [[insect]] that Dürer depicted is unclear. While it is commonly named as a [[dragonfly]] ([[Odonata]]), Kate Heard and Lucy Whitaker in their book ''The Northern Renaissance. Dürer to Holbein'' (2011) suggest that he may have meant it to be read as a [[butterfly]] ([[Lepidoptera]]). They explain that the butterfly's familiar transformation from caterpillar to winged adult was a symbol of [[resurrection]] and the soul's redemption, referring to the infant Christ in the Virgin's arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heard |first1=Kate |last2=Whitaker |first2=Lucy |title=The Northern Renaissance. Dürer to Holbein |date=2011 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-1-905-68632-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|800057|The Holy Family|[[Albrecht Dürer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is indeed sometimes also called the ''Holy Family with the Butterfly''. The insect has also been taken to be a [[locust]] ([[Acrididae]]) or a [[praying mantis]] ([[Mantodea]]), "with the symbolic meaning in relation to the Virgin changing accordingly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albrecht Dürer The Holy Family with the Butterfly (B. 44; M., Holl. 142; S.M.S. 2), ca. 1495 |url=https://www.artsy.net/artwork/albrecht-durer-the-holy-family-with-the-butterfly-b-44-m-dot-holl-142-sms-2|quote=... with the symbolic meaning in relation to the Virgin changing accordingly. |publisher=Artsy.net |accessdate=14 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314141632/https://www.artsy.net/artwork/albrecht-durer-the-holy-family-with-the-butterfly-b-44-m-dot-holl-142-sms-2 | archivedate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E. Vulgata female.jpg|thumb|The common European mayfly ''[[Ephemera vulgata]]'']]
A similar engraving in the American [[National Gallery of Art]] is named ''The Holy Family with the Mayfly'', identifying the insect as a [[mayfly]] ([[Ephemeroptera]]).&lt;ref name=NGA&gt;{{cite web|title=The Holy Family with the Mayfly 1495/1496|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.6571.html|publisher=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics Larry Silver and Pamela H. Smith write that the image provides "an explicit link between heaven and earth.. to suggest a cosmic resonance between sacred and profane, celestial and terrestrial, macrocosm and microcosm."&lt;ref name="SmithFindlen2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Pamela|last2=Findlen |first2=Paula |title=Merchants and Marvels: Commerce, Science, and Art in Early Modern Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUuMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 |date=18 October 2013 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-1-135-30035-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hunters in the Snow''''' ({{lang-nl|Jagers in de Sneeuw}}), also known as '''''The Return of the Hunters''''', is a 1565 oil-on-wood painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. The [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|Northern Renaissance]] work is one of a series of works, five of which still survive, that depict different times of the year. The painting is in the collection of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. This scene is set in the depths of winter during December/January.

==Background and origins==
''The Hunters in the Snow'', and the series to which it belongs, are in the medieval and early Renaissance tradition of the [[Labours of the Months]]: depictions of various rural activities and work understood by a spectator in Breugel's time as representing the different months or times of the year. 

==Description and composition==
The painting shows a wintry scene in which three hunters are returning from an expedition accompanied by their dogs.  By appearances the outing was not successful; the hunters appear to trudge wearily, and the dogs appear downtrodden and miserable. One man carries the "meager corpse of a [[fox]]" illustrating the paucity of the hunt. In front of the hunters in the snow are the footprints of a rabbit or hare - which has escaped or been missed by the hunters. The overall visual impression is one of a calm, cold, overcast day; the colors are muted whites and grays, the trees are bare of leaves, and wood smoke hangs in the air. Several adults and a child prepare food at an inn with an outside fire. Of interest are the jagged mountain peaks which do not exist in Belgium or Holland.

The landscape itself is a flat-bottomed valley (a river meanders through it) with jagged peaks visible on the far side. A [[watermill]] is seen with its wheel frozen stiff. In the distance, figures [[ice skate]], play hockey with modern style sticks and [[curling|curl]] on a frozen lake; they are rendered as silhouettes.

==Interpretation and reception==
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=[[File:Jäger im Schnee - Gebirge und Burg.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3HdzOR2pY Pieter Bruegel the Elder, ''Hunters in the Snow'' (Winter), 1565], [[Smarthistory]]}}
The 1560s was a time of religious revolution in the Netherlands, and Bruegel (and possibly his patron) may be attempting to portray an ideal of what country life used to be or what they wish it to be.

Writing in the "opinion" section of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', art historian [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]] points out that [[Old Master]]s are popular subjects for [[Christmas cards]] and states that "probably no 'secular' subject is more popular than ... ''Hunters in the Snow''".&lt;ref name="kemp 2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1038/456876a| last=Kemp| first=Martin|  title=Looking at the face of the Earth|journal=Nature|date=December 2008| volume=456|issue=18| pages=876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hunters in the Snow'' is used extensively in Russian director [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s films ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (1974), and in [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]''. It appears also in [[Alain Tanner]]'s film ''[[Dans la ville blanche]]'' (1983). It was an inspiration for [[Roy Andersson]]'s 2014 film ''[[A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence]]'', and it is the basis for the first frame of [[Abbas Kiarostami#2010s|Abbas Kiarostami]]'s ''[[24 Frames (film)|24 Frames]]'' (2017).

'''"Youth"''' is an autobiographical short story by [[Joseph Conrad]]. Written in 1898, it was first published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', and included as the first story in the 1902 volume ''Youth, a Narrative, and Two Other Stories''. This volume also includes ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and ''The End of the Tether'', stories concerned with the themes of maturity and old age, respectively. "Youth" depicts a young man's first journey to the East. It is narrated by [[Charles Marlow]] who is also the narrator of ''[[Lord Jim]]'', ''[[Chance (Conrad novel)|Chance]]'', and ''Heart of Darkness''. The narrator's introduction suggests this is the first time, chronologically, the character Marlow appears in Conrad's works (the narrator comments that he thinks Marlow spells his name this way).

==Plot==
Similar to Joseph Conrad's better-known ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', ''Youth'' begins with a narrator describing five men drinking claret around a mahogany table. They are all veterans of the merchant navy. One of the men, Marlow speaks of his first voyage to the East as second mate on board the ''Judea''. The story is set twenty-two years earlier, when Marlow was 20. With two years of experience, most recently as third mate aboard a crack clipper, Marlow receives a billet as second mate on the [[barque]] ''Judea''. The skipper is Captain John Beard, a man of about 60. This is Beard's first command. The ''Judea'' is an old boat, belonging to a man "Wilmer, Wilcox or something similar", suffering from age and disuse in [[Shadwell Basin|Shadewell basin]]. The 400-ton ship is commissioned to take 600 tons of coal from England to Thailand. The trip should take approximately 150 days. The ship leaves London loaded with sand ballast and heads north to the Senn river to pick up the cargo of coal. On her way, the ''Judea'' suffers from her ballast shifting aside and the crew go below to put things right again. The trip takes 16 days because of 'the famous October gale of twenty-two years ago', and the battered ship must use a tug boat to get into port. The ''Judea'' waits a month on the [[river Tyne|Tyne]] to be loaded with coal. The night before she ships out she is hit by a steamer, the ''Miranda'' or the ''Melissa''. The damage takes another three weeks to repair. Three months after leaving London, the ''Judea'' ships off for [[Bangkok]].

The ''Judea'' travels through the [[North Sea]] and Britain. 300 miles west of [[the Lizard]] a fiery winter storm hits. The storm "guts" the ''Judea''; she is stripped of her stanchions, ventilators, bulwarks, cabin-door, and deck house. The oakum is stripped from her bottom seams and the men are forced to work at the pumps "watch and watch" to keep the ship afloat. After weathering the storm they must fight their way against the wind back to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] to be refitted. Despite three attempts to leave, the ''Judea'' ultimately remains in Falmouth for more than six months until she is finally overhauled, recaulked, and refitted with new copper hull sheathing. During the laborious overhaul, the cargo is wetted, knocked about, and reloaded multiple times. The rats abandon the reshipped barque and a new crew is brought in from Liverpool (because no sailor will sail on a ship abandoned by rats).

The ''Judea'' ships out to Bangkok, running at times 8 knots, but mostly averaging 3 miles per hour. Near the coast of Western Australia, the cargo spontaneously combusts. The crew attempts to smother the fire, but the hull cannot be made airtight. Then they attempt to flood the fire with water, but they cannot fill the hull. One hundred and ninety miles out from Java Head, the gases in the hull explode and blow up the deck; Marlow is hurled into the air and falls on the burning debris of the deck. The ''Judea'' hails a passing steamer, the ''Sommerville'', which agrees to tow the wounded ship to [[Anjer]] or [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. Captain Beard intends to scuttle the ''Judea'' there to put out the fire, and then resurface her and resume the voyage to Bangkok. However, the speed of the ''Sommerville'' fans the smoldering fire into flames. The crew of the ''Judea'' is forced to send the steamer on without them while they attempt to save possibly most of the ship's gear for the underwriters. The gear is loaded into three small boats, which head due north towards [[Java]]. Before the crew leaves the ''Judea'', they enjoy a last meal on deck. Marlow becomes skipper of the smallest of the ship's three boats. All the boats make it safely into a Java port, where they book passage on the steamer ''Celestial'', which is on her return trip to England.

The story is loosely based upon reality. One of Conrad's pen-pals, or friends, discovered the secret of the port at which the boats called: the port was Muntok. Conrad became angry with him, calling Muntok 'a beastly hole'. The boats of the real ship reached the safety only after several hours, Marlow was a bit younger than Conrad, etc.{{Citation needed|reason=Unclear where data is sourced from|date=March 2018}}

'''Walter Howlison Mackenzie "Zarh" Pritchard''' (26 March 1866 – 29 August 1956) was a British-American artist, known for painting underwater landscapes while underwater, using a diving suit and waterproof materials.

==Early life and education==
Walter Howlison Mackenzie Pritchard was born in [[Madras, India]], to British and Irish parents.  As a schoolboy in [[Scotland]] he read ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' by [[Jules Verne]], and later said that was an influence on his underwater pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=48YOVXgkq8QC&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;vq=Zarh&amp;pg=PA426 Henry Adams (2008). "Art and Technology", in Carroll Pursell, ed., ''A Companion to American Technology'' (John Wiley and Sons): 426.] {{ISBN|978-0-470-69533-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before becoming an artist, he briefly studied medicine, and worked in London, where he designed a sea-themed costume for [[Sarah Bernhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/164507378/ Antony E. Anderson, "Art and Artists: Flood Tide"], ''Los Angeles Times'' (May 27, 1906): VI2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Museu Maritim 2016 BCN - 11.jpg|thumbnail|Classic diving suit of the 19th century, similar to that used by Zahr Pritchard.]]
Pritchard used modified diving gear to paint underwater, setting up an easel at depths up to fifty feet, and using oil crayons and canvases specially treated to work in that environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Q0AQAAMAAJ&amp;vq=Submarine%20Artist&amp;pg=PA319 "The Submarine Artist: Waterproof Paints and Canvas and a Diver's Suit Applied to a New Phase of Art", ''Scientific American'' (May 1922): 319.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pritchard traveled the world looking for new underwater scenes, with trips to [[Bermuda]], [[Tahiti]], [[The Philippines]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], Brazil, and several locations in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kzQ_AQAAMAAJ&amp;vq=Zarh&amp;pg=PA683 Robert Moulton (1918). "A Painter Under the Sea", ''The Bellman'' (June 22, 1918): 683&amp;ndash;685.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&amp;d=CDS19250516.2.52&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN------ "Weird Paintings By Noted Artist Made Under Sea", ''Cornell Daily Sun'' 55(172)(May 16, 1925): 6.]&lt;/ref&gt; He described the colors underwater as extraordinarily intense, "so bright you step back from them", and the fish as "inquisitive".&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/103195428/ M. B. Levick, "Painting Under the Sea:  Art in a Diver's Suit Ten Fathoms Down Paintings"], ''New York Times'' (August 5, 1923): BR10.&lt;/ref&gt;  In another  interview, Pritchard mentioned ideas for further novelty:  he hoped someday to rig underwater electric lighting for "the most interesting effects".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o5UhAQAAMAAJ&amp;vq=Zarh&amp;pg=PA270 "The Painter of the Deeps", ''Popular Electricity Magazine'' 6(3)(July 1913): 270&amp;ndash;273.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Art critic and longtime admirer Antony Anderson of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' found his work "remarkable", and declared that "Truly, he is one artist among many thousands when it comes to imagination and inventiveness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/161917505/ Antony Anderson, "Of Art and Artists: Three Exhibits at Grace Nicholson's"], ''The Los Angeles Times'', (March 14, 1926): C19.&lt;/ref&gt; Pritchard himself rejected the label of "artist", saying "I am not an artist at all, I am a naturalist who happens to be a painter."&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/162185499/ Malcolm L. M. Vaughan, "Painting Beauty Under the Sea"], ''Los Angeles Times'' (July 8, 1928): K16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his lifetime, Pritchard's works were displayed both as art and as natural science documents, notably at the Galerie [[Georges Petit]] in [[Paris, France|Paris]], at the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015082578215;view=1up;seq=91 "Undersea Paintings,"] ''The Explorer'' 1(21)(December 1, 1924): 83&amp;ndash;84.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/101284865/ Howard Devree, "Briefs from a Reviewer's Notebook"], ''New York Times'' (December 8, 1935): X15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eKsUAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=Zarh&amp;pg=PA212 "Museum Notes", ''The American Museum Journal'' 16(1916): 212.]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] at the [[Grace Nicholson]] gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/161953100/ Antony Anderson, "Of Art and Artists"], ''Los Angeles Times'' (March 7, 1926): C16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other collectors, [[Albert I, Prince of Monaco]] and [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Sir Joseph Duveen]] purchased works from Pritchard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/575114593/ "Painting Pictures under the Sea"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (August 20, 1922):  SM6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/161915082/ "Buys Painting of Pasadena Artist: Noted Collector to Take Canvas to Great Museum in New York"], ''Los Angeles Times'' (January 21, 1927):  A10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another admirer, naturalist [[William Beebe]], said, "My ideal room would be one with several paintings of Mr. Pritchard's on each wall."&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/164720777 "Craftsmen, Painters, an Undersea Artist, Exhibit",] ''Los Angeles Times'' (March 14, 1937):  C11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Pritchard bought a home near [[Bishop, California]] in 1914, but abandoned it sometime in the 1930s, and refused to pay taxes for the property; it burned down in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C2RWGnMJ65EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=Zarh&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q=Pritchard&amp;f=false Pam Vaughan (2011). ''Bishop'' (Arcadia Publishing): 54.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pritchard died in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1956, age 90.  He was buried at the Austin Memorial Park Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Pritchard&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GSst=46&amp;GSob=c&amp;GRid=43124280&amp; Find A Grave memorial for Zahr Pritchard (1866&amp;ndash;1956).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Pritchard's "Bream in 25 Feet of Water Off the West Coast of Scotland" (1910) is in the collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/artists/1424/Zarh_H._Pritchard Brooklyn Museum Collections: Zarh H.

Scott Gallery in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://threeyearsatsea.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/the-voyage-or-three-years-at-sea-part-iii/ "The Voyage, or Three Years at Sea", Charles H.
