'''Angela Rockwood''' is an [[United States|American]] model and actress, best known for her roles in ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' and the syndicated television series ''[[V.I.P. (TV series)|V.I.P.]]''

==Early years==
Rockwood is the oldest of four children of German-Thai descent and was raised overseas in the Philippines, Spain, and Guam.  At the age of 22, she moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles, to finish art school and work with [[Michelle Bohbot]] and [[Bijan (designer)|Bijan]]. She would later turn down a job as a composite sketch artist for the [[LAPD]], and instead accepted a modeling job for designer Michelle of [[Bisou Bisou]].

==Car accident==
On September 3, 2001, Rockwood was involved in a car accident on California's [[Interstate 5]] Highway between San Francisco and Los Angeles during a labor day weekend. While they were returning late at night from visiting her maid of honor for her then-upcoming marriage to [[Dustin Nguyen]], the driver (also one of her bridesmaids) lost control. The car swerved violently across the road before hitting the roadside rock face and flipping several times before hitting the safety rail and plunging over the bank. Vietnamese actress [[Thuy Trang]] (who was 27 years old) was tragically killed in the crash after she suffered internal injuries. Rockwood was thrown out of the vehicle through a window before its final impact and survived, but sustained catastrophic injuries, rendering her a [[Tetraplegia|quadraplegic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modelmayhem.com/602020|title=NAMFAH-Angela Rockwood|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors gave her a 3% chance of regaining motor skills and feeling below her neck. Through physical therapy, she regained partial motion in her left index finger two months after the accident. Three months after the accident, she could touch the top of her head. In 2003, Rockwood received [[Stem cell treatments]] in [[Portugal]] that allowed her to eventually use a manual wheelchair.

==Post-accident career==
In 2012, [[Sundance Channel (United States)|The Sundance Channel]] announced the creation of the series ''[[Push Girls]]'', a [[reality television series]] about living with paralysis in [[Hollywood]] produced by Gay Rosenthal, which cast Rockwood among "four dynamic, outspoken and beautiful women" in the [[Los Angeles]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundancechannel.com/push-girls/about/|title=About|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2087916/Push-Girls-Meet-wheelchair-bound-stars-groundbreaking-new-reality-show.html|title=Sexy, spirited... and paralysed: Meet the wheelchair-bound stars of a groundbreaking new reality show|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Rockwood was married to actor [[Dustin Nguyen]] in February 2002. They separated and divorced in 2011.&lt;ref name="sd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundancechannel.com/push-girls/profiles/angela-rockwood/|title=Angela Rockwood|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body image''' is a person's perception of the [[aesthetics]] or [[sexual attractiveness]] of their own body. It involves how a person sees themselves according to the standards that have been set by society. The Austrian [[neurologist]] and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Paul Schilder]] coined the phrase ''body-image'' in his book ''The Image and Appearance of the Human Body'' (1935).&lt;ref name="Schilder1999"&gt;{{cite book|last= Schilder|first= Paul |authorlink= Paul Schilder|title= The Image and Appearance of the Human Body: Studies in the Constructive Energies of the Psyche|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L2CNWxKdWhMC&amp;pg=PA17|year= 1999|publisher= Psychology Press|isbn= 978-0-415-21081-2|orig-year= 1935|p=11 | quote = The body schema is the tri-dimensional image everyone has about himself. We may call it 'body-image'.}} This work translates and expands Schilder's 1923 work: {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Human society]] has at all times placed great value on beauty of the human body, but a person's perception of their own body may not correspond to society's standards.

The concept of body image is used in a number of disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[philosophy]] and [[Cultural studies|cultural]] and [[feminist studies]]; the media also often uses the term . Across these disciplines and media there is no consensus definition, but body image may be expressed as how people view themselves in the mirror, or in their minds. It incorporates the memories, experiences, assumptions, and comparisons of one's own appearance, and overall attitudes towards one's height, shape, and weight.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-body-image|title= What is Body Image?|publisher= National Eating Disorders Association|access-date= 2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's impression of their body is also assumed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to be a product of ideals cultivated by various social and cultural ideals.

The issues surrounding body image can be examined through body negativity and through [[body positivity]]. Negative body image consists of a disoriented view of one's shape; whereby one may often feel self-conscious or feel ashamed, and assume others are more attractive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aside from having low [[Self-Esteem, Self-Love|self-esteem]], sufferers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks of [[eating disorders]], isolation, and [[mental illnesses]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Having a negative body-image may lead to a more serious mental illness such as [[body dysmorphic disorder]]: "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), occasionally still called dysmorphophobia, is a mental disorder characterized by the obsessive idea that some aspect of one's own body part or appearance is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix their [[Body dysmorphic disorder|dysmorphic]] part on their person..."{{Better source|reason= per WP:CIRCULAR|date= May 2018}}
Positive body image on the other hand, is described as a clear true perception of one's figure. In addition to celebrating and appreciating the body, it also requires an understanding that an individual's appearance does not reflect their character or self-worth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2007 report by the [[American Psychological Association]] found that a culture-wide [[sexualization]] of girls and women was contributing to increased female [[anxiety]] associated with body image.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web |title= Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls |year= 2007 |format = PDF |publisher= American Psychological Association |url= http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Australian government]] [[Australian Senate committees|Senate Standing Committee]] report on the [[sexualization of children]] in the media reported similar findings associated with body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/Completed_inquiries/2008-10/sexualisationofchildren/report/index|title= Sexualisation of children in the contemporary media|date= June 26, 2008|publisher= Parliament of Australia |access-date= 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}  However, other scholars have expressed concern that these claims are not based on solid data.&lt;ref name="tamiu"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Ferguson |first= C. |author2= Winegard, B. |author3= Winegard, B.M. |title= Who is the fairest one of all: How evolution guides peer and media influences on female body dissatisfaction |journal= Review of General Psychology |date= March 2011 |volume= 15 |issue= 1 |pages= 11–28 |url= http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |doi= 10.1037/a0022607 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/65q5xHqLw?url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |archivedate= 2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Body image can have a wide range of psychological effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people to live up to the standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Many factors contribute to a person's body image; some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for [[obesity]] or [[malnutrition]], and cultural expectations (e.g., [[Media depictions of body shape|media]] and politics). People who are either underweight or overweight can have poor body image. However, when people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. This is something that can lead to a change in a person's body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Derenne|first= J. L.,|author2= Beresin E. V.|title= Body image, media, and eating disorders|journal= Academic Psychiatry|year= 2006|issue= 30|pages= 257–261|url= http://ap.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=50181|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130415161703/http://ap.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=50181|archivedate= 2013-04-15|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by [[dieting]] or by undergoing [[cosmetic surgery]]. "We expected women would feel worse about their bodies after seeing ultra-thin models, compared to no models if they have internalized the thin ideal, this replicating previous findings."&lt;ref name="DittmarHoward2004"&gt;

Society often constructs our behaviors and beliefs, such as personal developments, physiological and psychological interactions, and the common "perception of our bodies as a reflection of self worth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://livelifegetactive.com/blog/body-image-self-esteem|title=Body image, self-esteem and the influence of society|date=2016-08-01|publisher=Live Life Get Active|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body image struggles have been prevalent for many centuries now, especially with the rapid constant shifts in ideal body types. In the past, norms were typically set by cultural beliefs, genders, or social standings. Despite these being prevalent today, changes in the fashion and media industries are other influences at hand.

During [[Ancient Egyptian]] times, the perfect woman was said to have a slender figure, with narrow shoulders, and a tall waist. Yet, females were emboldened in their beauty habits and general independence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rehabs.com/explore/womens-body-image-and-bmi/|title=Women's Body Image and BMI: 100 Years in the US|publisher=rehabs.com|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standards were reformed in [[Ancient Greece]], when society began worshipping the male figure instead. As men faced greater pressures on beauty and perfection, women sported a fuller and plump figure, with fair skin tones becoming more popular.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The pale skin craze was soon adopted in the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]], but waist sizes narrowed. Overall figures shrunk, as the Chinese associated petite with [[femininity]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

With the need to reflect her husband's status, the behaviors and outward appearances of the wife grew incredible crucial during the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Since size was linked to wealth, women maintained bodies with full hips and an ample bosom.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]] witnessed a similar movement, but the popularity of the corset cinching the waist, led to the desirable hourglass figure.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The era also introduced the [[Gibson Girl]], which was the first sign of influence by the fashion and media industries. Created by [[Charles Gibson]], he envisioned femininity as slim and tall, with large busts and wide hips, but a narrow waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/perfect-body-change-beauty-ideals_n_4733378.html|title=It's Amazing How Much The 'Perfect Body' Has Changed In 100 Years|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=2014-02-06|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These girls were also often shown in magazines such as ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'', which resulted in a link between trendy fashions and styles, and the maintenance of active lifestyles and healthy well-beings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greatist.com/grow/100-years-womens-body-image|title=See How Much the "Perfect" Female Body Has Changed in 100 Years (It's Crazy!)|date=2015-01-15|publisher=Greatist|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], the Gibson Girl transformed into the [[Flapper]], which dominated the period of the "[[Roaring Twenties]]". Women transitioned towards [[Androgyny|androgynous]] looks, whereby hairstyles were kept short, and wore brassieres that flatten the chest.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/perfect-body-change-beauty-ideals_n_4733378.html|title=It's Amazing How Much The 'Perfect Body' Has Changed In 100 Years|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=2014-02-06|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose clothing was also a trend, as it downplayed the waist by lowering it below the navel, resulting in a straight boyish figure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greatist.com/grow/100-years-womens-body-image|title=See How Much the "Perfect" Female Body Has Changed in 100 Years (It's Crazy!)|date=2015-01-15|publisher=Greatist|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dress senses become more casual as well, and is said to have been a representation of the reduction in social or political tension after the war, or an extensive disagreement with the matron like image of the women behind the alcohol [[Prohibition]] movement in the USA.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scienceofpeople.com/ideal-body-types-throughout-history/|title=A Look Back at Beauty Through History|date=2016-05-10|publisher=Science of People|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advertisements increasingly advocating the need to achieve a thinner frame, many women therefore pursued diets and exercises.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Although slimmer body types were favoured, a sporty and healthy appearance was still prized above the frail and sickly look from the Victorian Era.

The 1930s and 1940s witnessed the devastating effects of the [[World War II|2nd World War]]. While men were out on the battlefield, females began entering the workforce. This resulted in more formal and traditional military dress styles for women, which caused another shift in body image. While waists remained thin but prominent, the media embraced a more curvaceous look similar to the [[hourglass figure]], through the addition of broad shoulders and large breasts as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Since this era was part of the [[Hollywood Golden Age|golden age of Hollywood]], many celebrities continued to influence this trend by wearing tight fitted clothing that emphasized their figures. [[Pin-up girls]] and sex symbols radiating glamour soon followed in the 1950s, and the proportions of the hourglass figure expanded. Notable names include [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Sophia Loren]], and [[Jessica Rabbit]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In order to achieve this ideal figure, women consumed weight-gain supplements.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Should Body-Shaming Ads Be Banned |magazine=Scholastic Choices |date=November–December 2016 |url=https://choices.scholastic.com/issues/2016-17/110116/should-body-shaming-ads-be-banned.html |pages=32(3), 2–5}}&lt;!-- Was book ref lacking URL; have I got the right ref? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The release of [[Playboy|''Playboy'' magazine]] and the [[Barbie|''Barbie'' doll]] during this era were other additions in the need to achieve this ideal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Depictions of the perfect woman slowly grew thinner from 1960s onwards. The "[[Swinging Sixties]]" saw a similar look to the Flapper&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; with the emergence of high-fashion model [[Twiggy]], who promoted the thin and petite frame, with long slender legs,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and an adolescent but androgynous figure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other characteristics include, small busts, narrow hips, and flat stomachs. Many women either underwent diets or switched to weight-loss supplements to achieve the new look.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This eventually resulted in an increase in [[anorexia nervosa]] sufferers during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Greater importance was soon placed on fitness. Actress [[Farrah Fawcett]] introduced a more toned and athletic body type.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The exercise craze continued in the 1980s with [[Jane Fonda]] and the release of workout videos, motivating women to be thin but fit and svelte.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This era also saw the rise of tall, long legged supermodels; such as [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Cindy Crawford]], dominating the industry, and setting a new beauty standard for females around the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Greater issues arose in the 1990s, when supermodel [[Kate Moss]] popularized the stick-thin figure instead. The fashion industry pushed her image further with the 'heroin-chic' look, which dominated the [[catwalks]] during that time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This was communicated through waifish appearances, bony structures, thin limbs, and an androgynous figure.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although this extreme period was only short-lived, the 2000s saw the rise of the [[Victoria's Secret]] models, who altered beauty norms to include slim but healthy figures, with large breasts and bottoms, flat and visible abs, and prominent [[thigh gap]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

More women pursued cosmetic surgery practices, on top of diets and exercise regimes, to attain the perfect appearance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As of 2017, positive measures are being taken to promote a better body image such as the emergence of fitness trends and plus-size models in the fashion and media industries. However, the advancement of technologies and pressures from the media have led to even greater importance being placed on the way we look as an indication of our personal value.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

On account of the evolution of society today; [[text messaging]], [[e-mails]], [[social media]], and other technological advancements have dominated an individual's sequence of physical interactions. Although technology provides the convenience of connecting with others, its association with the media has resulted in a "platform of delivery in which we intercept and interpret messages about ourselves, our self-worth, and our bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/information/eating-disorder/body-image-technology|title=How Technology Influences Body Image |publisher=Eating Disorder Hope |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by ''[[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]]'', only 4% of women thought they were beautiful,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Cindy |title=Sex, College, and Social Media: A Commonsense Guide to Navigating the Hookup Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZicxDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-81858-2|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; while approximately 70% of women and girls in the UK believed the media's portrayal of impractical beauty standards fueled their appearance anxieties.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dove-global-body-image-report_uk_5762a6a1e4b0681487dcc470|title=Dove's Largest Ever Body Image Report Proves The Media Needs To Up Its Game|date=2016-06-21|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the ''[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]'' reported that, 91% of women were mostly unhappy with their bodies,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/body-image-statistics/|title=Body Image Statistics|date=2017-02-19|publisher=Statistic Brain|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 40% will consider cosmetic surgery to fix their flaws.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Women "all over the world are evaluated and oppressed by their appearances";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/30205/1/how-should-we-tackle-fashion-s-body-image-issues|title=How should we tackle fashion's body image issues? |date=2016-03-04|publisher=Dazed|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; be it [[Ageism|age]], [[Colorism|skin tone]], or [[Anti-fat bias|size]]. A large facet of "[[social currency]] for girls and women continues to be rooted in physical appearance".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; With accessories and apparel designed to enhance a look, social media, magazines, and marketing campaigns and advertisements also add to the burden of perfection. This is still prevalent today, whereby female bodies are staged as the ultimate [[Commodification|commodity]], and used for the selling of products.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web | title = how the fashion industry affects the bodies of young women | last = Mair | first = Avril | publisher = i-D | date = November 21, 2014 | accessdate = 2017-11-16 | url = https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kybkv/how-the-fashion-industry-affects-the-bodies-of-young-women | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate purpose of many advertisements is thus to appeal to the insecurities of individuals, in hopes of selling them the solution. Marketers fueling negative body imagery are also highly aware that those who undergo these problems are more likely to purchase their products. For that reason, advertisements regularly advocate the ability to achieve a particular look through retouched images, the sexual objectification of women, and products accompanied with explicit messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|title=Advertising Sets Impossible Standards for Women|publisher=The Balance|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advertisements today display an image of the 'perfect' woman with an idealistic body and flawless facial features. This ideal woman creates an unrealistic image for women and puts pressure on them to live up to that certain standard. According to [[Naomi Wolf]] "our culture disempowers women by holding them prisoner to an unattainable beauty ideal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Eating Disorders and the Role of the Media|last1=Spettigue|first1=Wendy|first2= Katherine A. |last2=Henderson|pmc=2533817|journal=The Canadian Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Review|date=February 2004 |volume=13|issue=1|pp=16–19|pmid=19030149}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reference various researcher's experiments in this field and the results that were found. For example, they refer to Hargreaves &amp; Tiggemann (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hargreaves|first=Duane|date=|title=Longer-term implications of responsiveness to 'thin-ideal' television: support for a cumulative hypothesis of body image disturbance?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.509/full|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=11|pages=465–477|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/erv.509|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they look at how exposure to television adverts that contain women of a thin-ideal effects the body image of the women watching them. They found that the exposure led to an increase in body dissatisfaction.

The need for body satisfaction and appearance esteem continues to increase with the abundance of [[billboards]], magazines, and conversations displaying "unrealistic images of beauty" (LiveLifeGetActive, 2016). Weight prejudices brought up in the media or social settings are also prevalent within society. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. The very thin and beautiful models within the media are therefore seen as the most successful and socially desirable people on the planet''.[[Body image#cite note-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

In most societies, thinness is typically associated with happiness, success, youthfulness, and social acceptability. This ideal is heavily portrayed throughout the [[mainstream media]], whereby women are assumed to be perfect in every way. In addition, the idea that a person can never be too thin or too rich, makes it difficult for females to attain any sort of happiness about their personal appearance.[[Body image#cite note-12|&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Hence, a women's attitude towards her body are thus a result of comparing it with those depicted in the media, along with society's obsession with thinness.  A study was done by Rachel Cohen in 2015 to investigate if [[Facebook]] impacted the number of women experiencing body dissatisfaction, 'Since social media forums such as Facebook involve one's peers, the current study aimed to determine whether the relationship between appearance comparison and body image dissatisfaction would be stronger for those exposed to social media images, compared to conventional media images'

Body dissatisfaction creates negative attitudes, a [[The Thin Ideal|damaging mentality,]] and negative habits in young, adult females.

The emphasis on thinness and on an ideal female body shape and size is psychologically detrimental to the well-being of many young women.

Global eating disorder rates such as anorexia and [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] are gradually rising in adolescent girls. The ''[[National Eating Disorders Association]]'', reported that 95% of individuals who suffer from an eating disorder are aged 12 to 26,&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imperosoftware.com/uk/blog/national-eating-disorder-awareness-week-nedaw-what-you-need-to-know/|title=National Eating Disorder Awareness Week (NEDAW) {{!}} Impero|date=2016-02-22|publisher=Impero UK|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anorexia is the third most common illness among teenagers.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Based on another study by ''Dove'', 87% of individuals with low body-esteems often avoid eating, and would rather place their health at risk for the sake of beauty. With the habitual use of social media, teenage girls in particular, are most prone "to internalize negative messages and obsess about weight loss to obtain a thin appearance".&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rawhide.org/blog/infographics/body-image-issues/|title=Body Image Issues: The Teen Male Edition [Infographic]|date=2016-04-26|publisher=Rawhide|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, pressures from social media doubles for adolescent girls between the ages of 13 to 18 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghanavisions.com/news/world/86458-if-i-don-t-get-40-likes-on-my-selfies-my-self-esteem-plummets-the-truth-about-how-social-media-affects-teenage-girls-that-every-mother-needs-to-read-now%C2%A0.html|title='If I don't get 40 likes on my selfies my self esteem plummets': The truth about how social media affects teenage girls that EVERY mother needs to read now|publisher=Ghana Visions |access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than half of have already reported the need to diet. The pressure on females "to cope with the effects of culturally induced body insecurity" is therefore severe,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; with many others previously citing that "their lives would be better if they were not judged by their looks and body shape, [as] this is leading to low self-esteem, eating disorders, mental health problems and depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/06/body-image-concerns-men-more-than-women|title=Body image concerns more men than women, research finds|last=Campbell|first=Denis|date=2012-01-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the need to be thin and young, there is also a weight prejudice within our society that is brought up in media, social settings, with friends, or even by parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Triplett|first= L|date= May 23, 2007|title= The Blame Game: A first glimpse at the socially acceptable causes of female fatness|postscript=.

Even the average size of clothing women wear has changed drastically within the past decades, as a size 8 used to be considered small to average and is now nearly plus size. Actress/comedian [[Amy Schumer]] spoke out on the issue of size when she was featured in [[Glamour Magazine]] as a "Plus Size Woman".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/05/entertainment/amy-schumer-glamour-body-shaming-feat/index.html|title=Amy Schumer to Glamour: I'm not plus-size|last=CNN|first=Lisa Respers France|publisher=CNN|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the magazines publication, Schumer posted a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying, "I think there's nothing wrong with being plus size. Beautiful healthy women. Plus size is considered size 16 in America. I go between a size 6 and a 8."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Women who value this idea of having to be extremely thin and a size 2 or 4 have body dissatisfaction, and take part in cosmetic surgeries or weight loss behaviors (such as dieting) to try to become the standard that they so commonly see.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The problem in which people, specifically women, are constantly comparing themselves to the people and images in the media leads to individuals believing they are more overweight than they actually are.&lt;ref&gt;Brodie, D., Slade, P., &amp; Riley, V. (1991). Sex differences in body image perceptions. 	Perceptual and Motor Skills, 72(1), 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; unattainable. "Idealised media images are routinely subjected to computer manipulation techniques, such as airbrushing (e.g. slimming thighs and increasing muscle tone). The resulting images present an unobtainable 'aesthetic perfection' that has no basis in biological reality" Paraskeva et al. (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paraskeva|first=Nicole|date=|title=Consumer opinion on social policy approaches to promoting positive body image: Airbrushed media images and disclaimer labels|url=|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=22|pages=164–175|via=sage Journals|doi=10.1177/1359105315597052|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other researchers have contested the claims of the media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues that peer effects are much more likely to cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized.&lt;ref name="tamiu" /&gt; It also argues that one must be careful about making the leap from arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders.

Women are constantly exposed to the retouched bodies of celebrities, which reflect society's ideal thin body in the media. This leads to the women developing poor self-images. Women begin to see the thin ideal body, which they see constantly in the media, as the perfect body that they should aim to achieve.&lt;ref name="GrabeWard2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grabe|first1=Shelly|last2=Ward|first2=L.

=== Men ===
Males also face similar burdens in regards to attractiveness, whereby the media's depiction of the ideal muscular physique has caused numerous body dissatisfaction issues among young men. Teenage boys in particular, are now three times more likely to suffer from [[Body dysmorphic disorder|Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)]], with numbers reaching 45% since 1991.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; BDD is a mental illness whereby an individual compulsively focuses on physical self-perceived flaws.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; According to a study by Rawhide, 18% of adolescent males were most worried about their weight and physique (Malcore, 2016), while 29% frequently thought about their appearances.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Moreover, 50% had recently complained about the way they look.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

The main causes of male body issues include 25% being teased about their weight,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 33% specified social media as the source for self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; A factor that affects male body image on social media sites is "celebrity involvement". Following celebrities on social media sites makes it possible to interact personally with celebrities, which has been shown to influence male body image.&lt;ref name="HoLee2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Shirley S.|last2=Lee|first2=Edmund W. J.|last3=Liao|first3=Youqing|title=Social Network Sites, Friends, and Celebrities: The Roles of Social Comparison and Celebrity Involvement in Adolescents' Body Image Dissatisfaction|journal=Social Media + Society|volume=2|issue=3|year=2016|pages=205630511666421|issn=2056-3051|doi=10.1177/2056305116664216}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of respondents also admitted to being affected by negative body talk from others. Men may also suffer from the mental disorder bigorexia, also known as [[muscle dysmorphia]]. Sufferers of bigorexia tend to constantly chase their ideal muscular body. However, many sufferers never attain this ideal body due to never being fully satisfied with their physique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Philip E.|date=2009-05-01|title=Bigorexia: bodybuilding and muscle dysmorphia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.897/abstract|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=17|issue=3|pages=191–198|doi=10.1002/erv.897|issn=1099-0968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While women face expectations to be increasingly thin, endorsements featuring the muscular ideal therefore causes numerous problems for men. Granting both genders may share the idealised image of narrow waists and hips, other characteristics specific to the mesomorphic and muscular V-shaped body, include broad shoulders, a well-developed upper body, [and] toned six-pack abs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The importance men placed on muscle and weight may be traced back to the release of G.I. Joe. The "bulked-up action heroes, along with the brawny characters in many video games, present an anatomically impossible ideal for boys, much as Barbie promotes proportions that are physically impossible for girls."&lt;ref name="Adams2014"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/17/body-image-boys_n_5637975.html|title=It's Not Just Girls. Boys Struggle With Body Image, Too.|last=Adams|first=Rebecca|date=2014-09-17|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are thus exposed to extensive imaging of men with bulging muscles, who often act as warriors or fighters, solving problems with their fists. By watching their heroes fight and punch, boys learn that aggression is essential and that they should strive to have huge muscles too. If these role models were smiling, less hyper-masculinized, or less aggressive, boys would not learn from such a young age that hyper-masculinity is the only successful way to be a 'man'.&lt;ref name="Adams2014" /&gt; A new term named 'Fitspiration' has even come into play over recent years. 'Fitspiration,' a term that combines "fitness" and "inspiration", is an online trend designed to inspire viewers towards a healthier lifestyle by promoting exercise and healthy food'.&lt;ref name="TiggemannZaccardo2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiggemann|first1=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|title="Exercise to be fit, not skinny": The effect of fitspiration imagery on women's body image|journal=Body Image|volume=15|year=2015|pages=61–67|issn=1740-1445|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2015.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular slogan of 'Fitspiration' photos is "Strong is the New Skinny", an expression that encourages people to not be afraid of getting strong and working out.&lt;ref name="Tiggemann"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiggemann|first=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|date=2016-03-31|title='Strong is the new skinny': A content analysis of #fitspiration images on Instagram|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105316639436|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|doi=10.1177/1359105316639436|page=135910531663943}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of a desire to achieve a good body and healthy lifestyle has increased in the last decade due to fitness accounts of Facebook and [[Instagram]]. Although 'Fitspiration' accounts and pictures have the intention of motivating people to pursue healthy lifestyles, they oftentimes contain objectifying elements or only show a certain body type, which can negatively affect many women's body images. For instance, 'Fitspiration' images tend to focus on specific poses or features of a woman such as washboard abs, which in turn objectifies the person.&lt;ref name="Tiggemann"/&gt;

Regardless of the lower number of products targeting males, negative messages can be communicated through fitness websites, video games, pop culture, movies, and other types of media as well. Based on a report by the Picture of Health, 53% of boys cited advertisements as a "major source of pressure to look good; [though] social media (57%) and friends (68%) exerted more influence, while celebrities (49%) were slightly less persuasive".&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warc.com/NewsAndOpinion/News/Ads_add_to_boys_bodyimage_pressure/37212|title=Ads add to boys' body-image pressure |publisher=WARC |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, 22% of adolescent boys thought that the ideals depicted by the media were aspirational, while 33% cited it was healthy.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

With rising pressures to achieve a muscular physique, many teenage boys thus participate in extreme workouts and weight trainings for long periods of the day. Some eventually abuse supplements and steroids to further increase muscle mass. In 2016, 10.5% acknowledged the use of muscle-enhancing substances,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 5 to 6% of respondents admitted to the use of steroids.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Although dieting is often overlooked, a significant increase in eating disorders is present among men. Currently, 1 out of 4 men suffer from eating disorders,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 31% have admitted to [[Purging disorder|purging]] or [[binge eating]] in the past.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== The fashion industry ==
The [[fashion industry]] is a prime target of body image issues, with models often facing second-hand criticism. Fashion industry insiders believe that clothes hang better on tall, thin women; however, critics argue that catwalk models communicate an unhealthy and unrealistic body image to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41174739|title=Dior and Gucci ban super-skinny models|date=2017-09-06|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of fashion, it often seems as if measurements, or the number or alphabet carried defines an individual. Based on a survey participated by 13 to 17 year olds in the U.S., 90% "felt pressured by fashion and media industries to be skinny",&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teens, Social Media And Body Image|last=Gallivan|first=H|publisher=Park Nicollet Melrose Cente|year=2014|isbn=|location=MN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 65% believing that the body image portrayed were too thin.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Furthermore, more than 60% habitually compare themselves to models,&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; while 46% will strive to achieve it.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; The underlying issue with brands featuring underweight models, therefore revolves around expressing "the message that an unhealthy body type is the most socially valued".&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.health.com/anorexia/underweight-models-french-fashion-brands|title=French Fashion Brands Are Refusing to Hire Models Under Size 2.

The severity of this matter continues to rise as fashion magazines directed at females, subtly promote thinness and diet practices, and are heavily relied on by teenagers for beauty and fashion advice.

According to ''Dove's Global Beauty And Confidence'' report, "a total of 71% of women and 67% of girls want to call on the media to do a better job portraying women of diverse physical appearance, age, race, shape and size."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In addition, 67% of men now strongly believe that it is unacceptable for brands to use photo manipulation techniques to alter the body image of a model.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; To counter such issues, the fashion magazine industry has made efforts in including 'real' women, and reducing or banning the use of airbrushing tools. Despite the amount of feminist features in magazines though, "body [[fascism]] is [still] reinforced by the advertisements, fashion stories and beauty pages."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Likewise, fashion brands and retailers adopt vanity sizing in their assortments to intentionally raise a customer's self-esteem while shopping in stores. This involves labeling clothes with smaller sizes than the actual cut of the items, to trick and attract the consumer. The strategy was based on research reporting the lowering of customer self-esteems and interests, in products with larger sizing labels.

Less is usually known about the pressures models in the industry face, but striving hard to meet the requirements of their agency or brand is a main facet. Among the group, 69% were told to tone up,&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.northeastern.edu/2017/02/fashion-week-brings-questions-about-body-image-front-and-center/|title=Fashion Week brings questions about body image front and center|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 62% cited that their agencies required them to lose weight or change their body shape.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Another 54% of models revealed that they would be dropped by their agencies if they failed to comply.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  Hence, models habitually weigh themselves under the healthy [[Body Mass Index]] (BMI) level. A study published in the [[International Journal of Eating Disorders]], discovered that a majority of models had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.41,&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; which qualifies for anorexia.

In the past twenty years, runway models have also transformed from a typical size 6-8 to 0-2. The average weight of a typical model in the United States was ecorded to be twenty-three percent less than an average woman in society. This phenomenon has caused countless of models to suffer from illness such as eating disorders and anorexia nervosa. In extreme cases, some models have died due to complications caused by eating disorders. In 2006, the fashion industry came under fire due to the untimely death of two models; [[Luisel Ramos]], and [[Ana Carolina Reston]]. Both girls suffered complications from their eating disorders, and were severely underweight. Owing to the intensifying burdens, a high number of models are therefore willing to participate in intensive exercise regimes, diets, [[Fasting|fasts]], and detoxes; in order to maintain or lose weight. In addition, 17% have admitted to stimulant abuse,&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; while another 8% frequently engaged in self-induced vomiting.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

=== Attempts to improve ===
{{See|Body image law}}

With the aim of protecting models and projecting a healthier body image, [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Brazil]], and [[Israel]], passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/summer-rayne-oakes/the-skinny-of-fashions-body-image-issue_b_3308004.html|title=The Skinny of Fashion's Body-Image Issue|last=Oakes|first=Summer Rayne|date=2013-05-22|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models,&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; and the need for a medical certificate to verify their health.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/07/france-laws-thin-models-retouched-photographs|title=Digital fakery? My dear, that is just so last year |last=Ellen|first=Barbara|date=2017-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that these laws may not be effective as, majority of individuals are already aware of digital retouching techniques, and may even use it themselves.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising of eating disorders, brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; ''[[Kering]]'' and ''[[LVMH]]'', recently "announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2".&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Not only will this improve the working conditions of models, both companies hope it may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry is moving in the right direction, it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/9/6/16263360/lvmh-kering-skinny-model-ban|title=This Isn't the Answer to Fashion's Body-Image Issues|publisher=Racked|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to "send the message that super slim body types is the 'ideal'".&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lvmh-kering-pledge_uk_59b0f9d7e4b0354e440f56c9|title=Will French Fashion Brands' Ban On Size Zero And Underage Models Really Make A Difference?|date=2017-09-07|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attributable to the level of interest in women who do not match the proportions of average models, [[plus-size model]]s are slowly emerging in the mainstream media. With several utilising their positions to promote body positivity, their continued presence in the industry, undoubtedly reign beneficial to the health of other models and customers. Health reporter Philippa of&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29569473|title=Does social media impact on body image?|last=Roxby|first=Philippa|date=2014-10-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[BBC News]] discusses how the introduction of more diversity upon body images can be a helpful factor into improving self-confidence for all body types. Prominent names include [[Ashley Graham (model)|Ashley Graham]]; who is the face of popular plus-size retailer ''[[Lane Bryant]]'', and [[Iskra Lawrence]]; who is a classified role model for lingerie and swimwear retailer ''[[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]''. Fashion magazines are beginning to include plus-size models as well, with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' gaining worldwide attention when it showcased the first plus-size model on the cover of its [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue|swimsuit issue]].&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Real Women Have Curves |last=Bazilian |first=Emma |magazine=[[Adweek]] |date=April 25, 2016 |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA451229452&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=ko_k12hs_d73&amp;it=r&amp;p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=d7d9761b9b364c6d5dbff6ac2a615991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2018|reason=Article says attention was national not worldwide}}

Fashion designers are also strong supporters for embracing diversity and healthy body ideals in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-bites/plus-size-new-york-fashion-week-ashley-graham-candice-huffine-kelly-slater-itsnotok-teatum-jones-disabled-body|title=News Bites {{!}} NYFW Gets Real About Plus-Size, Kelly Slater Says #itsnotok and More...|date=2017-02-16|publisher=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Christian Siriano]]'' specifically, shocked the fashion world by casting five plus-size models for his [[New York Fashion Week]] shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.onbreaking.com/entertainment/interview-with-christian-siriano-about-his-runway-show-with-plus-size-models/2752/|title=Christian Siriano talk about Plus Size Models|date=2016-09-14|publisher=On Breaking|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the box-office success of ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', Siriano also made global headlines after he designed a gown for actress [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], because no one else would.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/style/christian-siriano-confirms-that-leslie-jones-is-a-pretty-woman-at-the-ghostbusters-premiere/|title=Christian Siriano Confirms that Leslie Jones Is a Pretty Woman at the Ghostbusters Premiere|date=2016-07-10|work=People |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a high number of plus-size models dominated the runways this year, print advertisements saw a decrease, with only 2.2% casted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/762095-diversity-report-fall-2017-ad-campaigns/|title=Diversity Report: The Fall 2017 Ads Were More Inclusive Than the Runways for the First Time Ever|date=2017-08-29|publisher=theFashionSpot|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models who publicly advocate their opinions of the fashion industry are growing as well, especially with the criticism and strain placed on their well-beings. Many have notably used ''Instagram'' as a tool to "encourage self-acceptance, fight back against body-shamers, and post plenty of selfies celebrating their figure".&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}  In the U.S., a group of plus-size models launched the ''#DearNYFW'' campaign, which targeted the fashion industry's harmful approach towards their bodies.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/started-breaking-ribs-fashion-week-models-hit-back-against-pressure/|title='I started breaking my ribs': Fashion week models hit back against the pressure to lose weight|last=Rahim|first=Lucy|date=2017-06-01|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement was broadcast across different social media platforms, with other models using the hashtag to share their experience, in hopes of persuading the American fashion industry to start "prioritizing health and celebrate diversity on the runway".&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In regards to men falling victims to body image issues, fashion photographer [[Tarik Carroll]] released a photo series titled the ''EveryMAN Project''. The project showcased large-framed [[queer]] and [[transgender men]] of color, with the purpose of "challenging [[Hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinity]] and [[gender norms]], while bringing body-positivity to the forefront".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/fashion-photographer-promotes-acceptance-everyman-n783881|title=Fashion photographer promotes acceptance of "EveryMAN"|publisher=NBC News|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthmore, Caroll aims to enlighten society about body image struggles in men, after hearing the complaints of male models.

The lack of fashion-forward plus-size clothing in the fashion industry on the other hand, has given rise to the ''#PlusIsEqual'' movement. There was often a misconception by retailers that full-figured women{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} were not interested in purchasing trendy styles. However, high-street brands such as [[Forever 21]], and [[ASOS.com|ASOS]], have increased product offerings to include plus-size options for their customers.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://digiday.com/marketing/loud-proud-social-media-pushed-retail-body-positive/|title='Loud and proud': How social media pushed retail to be more body-positive - Digiday|date=2016-02-25|publisher=[[Digiday]]|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other brands include, ''[[Victoria Beckham]]'' who plans to release a range of high-street clothing with sizes up to XXXL in the upcoming months,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/the-beauty-curve-here-s-how-the-fashion-industry-embraced-plus-sizes/story-A3zwYFeeZIMAsTs1vQWEpK.html|title=The beauty curve: Here's how the fashion industry is embracing plus sized clothes|date=2017-07-12|work=Hindustan Times |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'' who expanded their plus size collection to cater for sizes 1X to 3X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/nike-plus-size-range-xl-xxxl-body-positive-sportswear-clothing-a7609341.html|title=Nike has finally launched its first plus size range|date=2017-03-03|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the criticisms surrounding the term plus-size causing unnecessary labeling, ''[[Kmart]]'' therefore replaced its numerical sizing with positive tags such as, "lovely" and "fabulous" instead.&lt;ref name="NoSizeFitsAll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/lifestyle/article/nosizefitsall-the-rise-of-body-positive-fashion.html|title=#NoSizeFitsAll: The rise of body-positive fashion|publisher=Cafe Babel|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesting against photo retouching is another important aspect towards body positivity, with the most famous example being Aerie's ''ArieReal'' campaign. Since 2014, the movement promised to display "campaign spreads and brand imagery with stomach rolls, gapless thighs and other perceived flaws that would normally have been edited out of the ads".&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; Other brands such as ''Neon Moon'', which is a feminist lingerie brand from London, deeply believes in embracing and advocating the beauty of flaws, instead of the need to retouch their models for aesthetic purposes. Hence, campaigns often feature a range of "diverse models and lack of airbrushing as a marketing tool".&lt;ref name="NoSizeFitsAll" /&gt; U.S. e-tailer ''[[ModCloth]]'' on the other hand, explored other methods including, employing their staff as models for the swimwear collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/style/modcloth-proves-we-all-have-swimsuit-bodies-new-body-positive-t90081|title='We all have swimsuit bodies': See Modcloth's empowering new campaign|last=Murray|first=Rheana|work=Today |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social media ==
In the past, exposure to photos or articles were primarily found in traditional media; however, the accessibility of the internet today has resulted in an infinite array online. The world we inhabit is transpiring into a saturated place driven by imageries, which "force [narrower] standards of beauty than ever before".&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://verilymag.com/2017/03/body-image-beauty-standards-media|title=Here's How Body Image Issues Can Affect You (Even if You Don't Have an Eating Disorder)|publisher=Verily|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest influence the internet has on body image, is the creation of [[social media]]. Users are constantly bombarded by notifications, posts, and photos about the lives of others; "sending messages about what we could, should, or would be if we only purchased certain products, made certain choices, or engaged in certain behaviors".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Despite the ability to create and control content on social media, "the same unattainable body ideals we see in traditional media are also reflected in the online environment."&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unisa.edu.au/Media-Centre/Releases/2017-Media-Releases/The-beauty-myth-puts-big-users-of-social-at-risk-of-low-self-esteem-media/|title=The beauty myth puts big users of social media at risk of low self-esteem |publisher=University of South Austalia |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-engagement with social networking platforms and images will therefore, also "encourage a psychological adoption of unrealistic beauty ideals ..., [which] can lead to poor body image and low self-esteem".&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

In 2016, psychologists confirmed the relationship between social media usage and body image anxieties, dieting, and the goal towards thinness. Based on a survey, 56% of women acknowledged the effect of the "social media culture in driving the pressure for perfection and negative body image";&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; whereby it forces them to look a certain way. These platforms further reiterate the need for individuals to compare themselves with others online, resulting in higher expectations towards their standards of beauty.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Hence, 42% of women stated social media caused them to feel worse about their bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2016/04/107683/female-body-image-statistics-2016|title=This Is How Women Actually Feel About Their Bodies|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another study by the ''[[University of South Australia]]'', discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalise the thin ideal.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

Applications such as ''Instagram'' have become a "body-image battleground",&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; while the "selfie" is now the universal lens in which individuals use to criticise their bodies and others.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; ''Facebook'' and ''[[Snapchat]]'' also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the high points of their lives, a survey by ''[[Common Sense Media|Common Sense]]'' reported that 22% felt bad if their posts were ignored, or if it did not receive the amount of attention they hoped for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/girls-social-media-self-image-partner/index.html|title=How girls use social media to build up, break down self-image |author=Caroline Knorr |publisher=CNN|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could serve as a trigger for more insecurities, with many utilising digital manipulation techniques as well, to modify their photos in order to meet the media-crafted ideals of thinness and perfection. According to research by the ''[[Renfrew Center Foundation]]'', 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35-year-old women edited their images before uploading.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/05/friends-pictures-on-social-media-biggest-impact-body-image|title=Friends' pictures on social media have biggest impact on body image|last=Ratcliffe|first=Rebecca|date=2017-03-05|work=The Observer|access-date=2017-11-01 |issn=0029-7712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; Yet, with the presence of fake imagery, a majority of individuals still habitually fixate on the lifestyles and belongings of others.

With the growth of the wellness industry in recent years, social media platforms have witnessed an assortment of [[Fitness culture|fitness]] influencers{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} and trends. Followers obsessively pursue these diet and exercise regimes posted as a way to remain healthy, while the influencers{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} hope it generates body positivity in return. Yet, these [[bloggers]] and companies have received numerous criticism because the "drive for 'wellness' and 'clean eating' has become stealthy covers for more dieting and deprivation".&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/4459153/social-media-body-image/|title=How Social Media Is a Toxic Mirror|work=Time|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports have also shown that the messages delivered by "fitspiration" websites are sometimes identical to the "thinspiration" or pro-anorexia types.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/jm5nvp/ruby-tandoh-eat-clean-wellness|title=The Unhealthy Truth Behind 'Wellness' and 'Clean Eating'|date=2016-05-13|work=Vice|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident through "language inducing [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] about weight or the body, and promoted dieting".&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Although the wellness trend may not lead to eating disorders, the marketing of restrictive diets to young women as a form of self care could potentially cause "increasingly [[disordered eating]]",&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; whereby they became more concerned with ingredients and limited certain types of food. This illness is better known as [[Orthorexia nervosa|Orthorexia]]; which is the obsession with the right and wrong types of food.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

=== Attempts to improve ===
As an attempt to tackle such issues, the UK launched a national campaign called ''Be Real,'' after findings showed 76% of secondary school students who learnt about body confidence in class felt more positive about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://academytoday.co.uk/Article/almost-a-third-of-11-16-year-olds-have-body-image-anxiety|title=Almost a third of 11-16 year-olds have body image anxiety|publisher=Academy Today|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this movement was thus to improve body confidence through educational resources provided to schools, and persuading the media, businesses, and the diet industry to endorse different body shapes and sizes instead.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; Despite the negative outcomes of technological advancements altering the perceptions of an individual's body image and mental health, the cultivation of social media is still beneficial.

Parallel to traditional media, it may be employed as a tool to share and spread body positivity. Social networking sites and applications ultimately build a platform for users to speak out on issues, with many industry insiders utilising their online leverage to protest for change. Previous techniques brands and influencers have tested include, the promotion of a positive body image through popular [[hashtag]]s and marketing campaigns, and the formation of groups that support self-love and the banning of body shaming.

In response to the criticism of social media driving eating disorders, platforms such as ''Instagram'', have banned the use of '''thinspiration''' and '''thinspo''' related hashtags. Other solutions include transformation photos, and the promotion of hashtags such as ''#SelfLove'' and ''#BodyPositivity''&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.self.com/story/side-by-side-photos|title=20 Side-by-Side Photos That Show How Misleading Social Media Can Be|last=Lanquist|first=Lindsey|work=Self |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Transformation photos are side-by-side images displaying an individual's fitness or weight-loss progress. Although, it aims to "serve as inspiration for people looking to change themselves physically or live healthier lives",&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; some users have utilised this technique to showcase the level of deceptiveness within social media. Likewise, in an effort to actively help those suffering from eating disorders, ''[[Eating Disorder Hope]]'' launched the ''Pro-Recovery'' ''Movement''. The project involved hosting of live Twitter chat encouraging sufferers to celebrate self-love and a positive body image, through recovery subject matters.&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/positive-uses-social-media-body-image-advocacy|title=Positive Uses of Social Media in Body Image Advocacy |publisher=Eating Disorder Hope |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations such as [[Project HEAL|ProjectHEAL]], introduced a campaign called ''#WhatMakesMeBeautiful'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/clementine-desseaux/what-makes-me-beautiful-heal-project_b_9287398.html|title=#WhatMakesMeBeautiful Campaign With Heal Project|date=2016-02-22|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of celebrating different talents, personalities, and other non-appearance related attributes that also make one beautiful.&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; This movement was especially successful among the eating disorder community; hence, emphasising the "need for social media movements that celebrate self-love and looking at beauty through a different lens".&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;
[[Celebrity culture]] is known as one of the main influences on body image for this generation. Studies in this area have been carried out with the majority proving that viewing media images affects participants abilities to correctly estimate the size and parts of their own bodies. We are subjected to [[PhotoShop|photoshop]] so often when they were shown a range of photos of famous celebrities the women with body dissatisfaction consistently choose the photos of the celebrity being photoshopped to look skinnier than the original.{{Ambiguous|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="KingTouyz2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Natalie|last2=Touyz|first2=Stephen|last3=Charles|first3=Margaret|title=The effect of body dissatisfaction on women's perceptions of female celebrities|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|volume=27|issue=3|year=2000|pages=341–347|issn=0276-3478|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(200004)27:3&lt;341::AID-EAT12&gt;3.0.CO;2-P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==

Body image is often measured by asking the subject to rate their current and ideal body shape using a series of depictions. The difference between these two values is the measure of body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction in girls can have many negative effects, including an increased rate of [[smoking]] and a decrease in comfort with [[sexuality]] when they're older, which may lead them to consider cosmetic surgery.{{efn|An increase in women's weight dissatisfaction is found when women see idealized images of women viewed as passive sexual objects or angelic sexual subjects.{{cite journal|last1=Halliwell|first1=Emma|last2=Malson|first2=Helen|last3=Tischner|first3=Irmgard|title=Are Contemporary Media Images Which Seem to Display Women as Sexually Empowered Actually Harmful to Women?|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=35|issue=1|year=2011|pages=38–45|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1177/0361684310385217}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=Healthy body image: tips for guiding girls.|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/healthy-body-image/art-20044668|publisher=MayoClinic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, the dieting industry earns roughly 40 billion dollars per year. A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] study (Fat Talk, Harvard University Press) published in 2000 revealed that 86% of teenage girls are on a [[Dieting|diet]] or believe they should be on one. Dieting has become a very common thing to not only teenage girls but even younger children as well. The [[National Eating Disorders Association]] has found out that 51% of 9- and 10-year-old girls actually feel better about themselves when they are on a diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nault|first=Kelly|title=How the Media Affects Teen Girls|url=http://www.insteadoftv.com/how-the-media-affects-teen-girls.html|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently more than 40 "instruments" used to measure body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=J. K.|last2=Altabe|first2=M.|last3=Johnson|first3=S.|last4=Stormer|first4=S.

Because there are so many ways to measure body image, it makes it difficult to draw meaningful research generalizations. Many factors have to be taken into account when measuring body image, including gender, [[ethnicity]], culture, and age.&lt;ref name="Cullari 2002 221–232"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cullari|first=S.,|author2=Vosburgh, M.|author3=Shotwell, A.|author4=Inzodda, J.|author5=Davenport, W.|title=Body-image assessment: A review and evaluation of a new computer-aided measurement technique.|journal=North American Journal of Psychology|year=2002|issue=4(2)|pages=221–232|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;AN=2002-17480-006&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Figure preferences ===

In figure preferences the use of silhouettes is the most commonly used method. [[Silhouette]]s can be defined by a figures shape or dark outline upon a lighter background. There are many issues with this method though; for one, the drawings are not realistic looking and were originally portrayed as adults so it made them unsuitable for children.&lt;ref name="Cullari 2002 221–232"/&gt; Silhouettes are used to show to the subject and have them react to the different body types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=1d539162-5f98-4f55-bcb2-3670ba57a382@sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==|title=Body-image assessment: A review and evaluation of a new computer-aided meas...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe Photoshop to fit their personal preference upon their body image, altering body tones, shape or size.

=== Video projection techniques ===

In one study participants were shown a series of images flashing before them; each image was a picture of them but either increased weight or decreased weight. They were measured in self-report by responding to the pictures. Also they were measured by startle-based measures and testing their eyeblink response. "The startle response is a complex set of physiological changes that occur in response to unexpected and intense stimulus."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grillon|first=Christian|last2=Baas|first2=Johanna|date=2003-09-01|title=A review of the modulation of the startle reflex by affective states and its application in psychiatry|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=114|issue=9|pages=1557–1579|issn=1388-2457|pmid=12948786|doi=10.1016/s1388-2457(03)00202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measurements can be useful because "Objective, [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] measures, like the affect modulated startle eyeblink response, are less subject to reporting bias."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spresser|first=C.

=== Questionnaires ===

Questionnaires are another very commonly used method of measurement. One example of a questionnaire is BASS; it is a 9-item subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. It uses a rating scale from −2 to +2 and assesses eight body areas and attributes and overall appearance (face, hair, lower torso, mid-torso, upper torso, [[muscle tone]], height, and weight).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giovannelli|first=Thorayya Said|last2=Cash|first2=Thomas F.|last3=Henson|first3=James M.|last4=Engle|first4=Erin K.|date=2008-06-01|title=The measurement of body-image dissatisfaction-satisfaction: is rating importance important?|journal=Body Image|volume=5|issue=2|pages=216–223|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2008.01.001|issn=1873-6807|pmid=18463010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questionnaires can have confounding variable though.

== Gender differences ==

Gender differences related to body image are increasingly prevalent between men and women. Although dissatisfaction is more common in women, men are becoming more negatively affected than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Body image perceptions: Do gender differences exist? | journal = Psi Chi Journal of Undergraduate Research | year = 2010 | first = Maggie A. | last = Brennan |author2=Christopher E.

[[Adolescence]] is where this difference is most notable. One reason for this is because males are being targeted in the media more heavily today. Historically, and for a much longer period of time, the media has immoderately targeted females, which may explain why they are becoming less sensitized to the effects.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2010-24583-007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mellor|first=David|author2=Matthew Fuller-Tyszkiewicz|author3=Marita P.

Some research has suggested this relationship between muscle and masculinity may begin early in life, as boys' action figures are often depicted as super-muscular, often beyond the actual limits of [[Human Physiology|human physiology]]. The connection between masculinity and muscle is however a cultural trend traced as far back as the Classical antiquity and linked to the war performance and its peaceful substitutes, the athletic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sideris |first=A.|url=https://www.academia.edu/481380/The_Athletic_Body_Image_and_Power=|title=The Athletic Body: Image and Power|journal=Imeros|volume=5|issue=1|year= 2005|pages= 287–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, men with lower, more feminine, [[Waist–hip ratio]] (WHR) feel less comfortable and self-report lower body esteem and self-efficacy than men with higher, more masculine, WHRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Pazhoohi| first1=Farid| last2=Hosseinchari|first2=M.|last3=Doyle|first3=J.

In general, research shows that body image in regards to appearance becomes less of a [[Psychological stress|stress]] for women as they age. Studies show a decline in dissatisfaction of body image in college-aged women as they progress from the first semester of college to subsequent semesters. Their appearance rating of themselves tends to increase, while males' do not significantly change and often become worse. This suggests that the early years of [[college]] serve as a period for body image development, which can later affect the mental and physical well being of an individual.&lt;ref name='PsycInfo 2011-30272-014'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Gender and racial/ethnic differences in body image development among college students | journal = Body Image | date = January 2012 | first = Meghan M. | last = Gillen |author2=Eva S.

As men and women reach older age, body image takes on a different meaning.  Research studies show that the importance attached to physical appearance decreases with age.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2011-30272-014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esnaola 21–9"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Body dissatisfaction and perceived sociocultural pressures | journal = Salud Mental | date = February 21, 2010 | first = Igor | last = Esnaola |author2=Arantzazu Rodríguez|author3=Alfredo Goñi | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–9| id =  | type =  PDF | accessdate = 2012-06-26 |url=http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/sm/v33n1/v33n1a3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical appearance remains important later in life, but the functional aspects of the body take precedence over contentment with appearance.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2010-24583-007"/&gt; Women are reported to benefit from the [[Ageing|ageing process]], becoming more satisfied with their images, while men begin to develop more insecurities and issues.  Women reach a certain stage where they are no longer subject to the social pressures that heavily emphasize the importance of appearance.  Men from the same studies are reported as becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their physical appearance as they age. Men are also less likely to implement appearance-enhancing activities into their daily lives.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The older women become the more satisfied with their body image they are likely to become because of the relief of stress from societal pressures.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2009-11492-005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Lucie|author2=Eyal Gringart|date=August 2009|title=Body image and self-esteem in older adulthood|journal=Ageing &amp; Society|type=PDF|volume=29|issue=6|pages=977–95|doi=10.1017/S0144686X09008721|id=}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-27 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The older men become, the more dissatisfied they are likely to become due to increased physical and perceived incompetency.

Adrienne Adams and Eaaron Henderson-king claim that the rates of cosmetic surgery have increased in recent years. It has been proven that the majority of people that undergo cosmetic surgery is a highly gendered activity. However, rates are increasing for men. it is predominantly women who spend more time attending to their to their bodies. Cosmetic surgery was initially developed largely in response to the reconstructive needs of wounded soldiers, but it is now primarily used in a much more feminine way to improve people's physical appearance and attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Materialism, Sociocultural Appearance messages AND Paternal Attitudes Predict College Women's Attitudes About Cosmetic surgery&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weight ==

{{See also|Fat acceptance movement}}The desire to lose weight is highly correlated with poor body image, with more women than men wanting to lose weight. Kashubeck-West ''et al.'' reported that when considering only men and women who desire to lose weight, sex differences in body image disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kashubeck-West S, Mintz LB, Weigold I |title=Separating the Effects of Gender and Weight-Loss Desire on Body Satisfaction and Disordered Eating Behavior |journal=Sex Roles |volume=53 |issue=7–8, |pages=505–518 |date=October 2005 |doi=10.1007/s11199-005-7138-4 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/y07h74u11ug0x245/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'', [[Naomi Wolf]] reported that "thirty-three thousand women told American researchers they would rather lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal."&lt;ref name=Wolf1991 /&gt; Through repeated images of excessively thin women in media, advertisement, and modeling, thinness has become associated with not only beauty, but happiness and success. As [[Charisse Goodman]] put it in her article, "One Picture is Worth a Thousand Diets", advertisements have changed society's ideas of beauty and ugliness: "Indeed to judge by the phrasing of the ads, 'slender' and 'attractive' are one word, not two in the same fashion as 'fat' and 'ugly.'" This idea of beauty has become drastically more narrow and unachievable, putting increased pressure on people looking to satisfy society's standards.

Research by Martin and Xavier (2010) shows that people feel more pressure from society to be thin after viewing ads featuring a slim model. Ads featuring a larger sized model resulted in less pressure to be thin. People also felt their actual body size was larger after viewing a slim model as compared to a larger model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Martin Brett A.

Research by [[The Lancet Psychiatry|The Lancent Psychiatry]] discusses the relationship between mass media and eating disorders stating,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutiérrez|first=Emilio|last2=Carrera|first2=Olaia|date=February 2016|title=Anorexia nervosa and body-image disturbance|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(15)00581-7/fulltext|journal=The Lancet Psychiatry|language=English|volume=3|issue=2|pages=e9–e10|doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00581-7|issn=2215-0366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Body-image disturbance and weight and shape concerns are the result of an acculturation process spread through the therapeutic milieu and the mass media." The struggles caused by body imaging have led to the increase of Anorexia nervosa diagnosis. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that results in significant weight loss due to a persons own distorted body image. Its increasing rate shows the correlation between the effects body imaging through social media has on people especially upon women and how it effects the measures of weight loss.

Post-1997 studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Obesity Statistics: U.S. Obesity Trends|url = http://www.naaso.org/statistics/obesity_trends.asp|publisher = North American Association for the Study of Obesity|accessdate = 2008-03-08|year = 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060206185213/http://www.naaso.org/statistics/obesity_trends.asp|archivedate = 2006-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that around 64% of American adults are overweight, such that if the 56%/40% female/male dissatisfaction rates in the ''[[Psychology Today]]'' study have held steady since its release, those dissatisfaction rates are if anything disproportionately low: although some individuals continue to believe themselves to be overweight when they are not, those persons are now outnumbered by persons who might be expected to be dissatisfied with their body but are not.

In turn, although social pressure to lose weight has adverse effects on some individuals who do not need to lose weight, those adverse effects are arguably outweighed by that social pressure's ''positive'' effect on the overall population, without which the recent increases in obesity and associated health and social problems (described in both popular and academic parlance as an "[[obesity epidemic]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Statistics Related to Overweight and Obesity|url = http://www.win.niddk.nih.gov/statistics/|publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]|year = 2006|accessdate = 2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/mxm007v1|title = The obesity epidemic in the United States—gender, age, socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and geographic characteristics: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis|last1 = Wang|first1 = Youfa|last2 = Beydoun|first2 = May A|journal = Epidemiologic Reviews|year = 2007 |doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxm007|pmid = 17510091|volume = 29|pages = 6–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be even more severe than they already are.&lt;ref name="ThompsonHeinberg1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=J.

[[Miss Representation]]&lt;ref&gt;Synopsis. (January 1, 2014). Retrieved May 5, 2014, from http://film.missrepresentation.org/synopsis&lt;/ref&gt; is a documentary by [[Jennifer Siebel Newsom]], exploring and displaying the role that mainstream media plays in society today with regards to women and the under-representation of women in influential positions. Prominent women in today's society were featured in discussing how the media has impacted their life along with their views on how the media is impacting the lives of people from an early age. These media messages have a severe impact on how individuals carry themselves along with what aspects bog them down like insecurities with body image. This film encourages viewers to start to see beyond the message and not compare themselves to these picture perfect computer-generated images.

The 2007 documentary [[America the Beautiful (film)|America the Beautiful]] explores how the fashion and beauty industries are contributing to the problems that individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses a wide range of topics like [[plastic surgery]], dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young [[Middle school|middle-school]] aged girls were portrayed in the beginning of the film and asked if they found themselves beautiful. The girls who are around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting to see themselves as ugly at an earlier age than ever before. As individuals who identify as ugly increase, the number of body image issues also increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/america-the-beautiful-a-problem-of-self-image/82590/|title='America the Beautiful': A Problem of Self-Image|last=Snyder|first=S.

In a study performed by Leslie J. Heinberg of [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], and J. Kevin Thompson of the [[University of South Florida]], results showed that women exposed to appearance based advertisements experienced a significant growth in [[Depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, [[anger]], and body dissatisfaction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In a study done at [[Old Dominion University]], Thomas F. Cash, [[Julie Ancis|Julie R. Ancis]] and Melissa D. Strachan studied college women and their attitudes toward gender, feminist identity and body image. "Relative to men, women are considerably more psychologically invested in their appearance. Moreover, women's poor evaluations of and stronger investments in their looks potentiate greater body-image [[dysphoria]] in women's daily lives."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cash | first1 = T. F. | last2 = Ancis | first2 = J. R. | year = 1997 | title = Gender attitudes, feminist identity, and body image among college women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 36 | issue = 7/8| pages = 433–447 | doi=10.1007/bf02766682}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contributing factor in this scenario that leads women to greater objectification of their bodies are the images that are seen throughout media. Women who are portrayed in the media often possess unattainable beauty. "Furthermore, the social construct of femininity is partially tied to perceived beauty, as evinced by the 'what is beautiful sex-typed' stereotype."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"/&gt; These internalized ideals along with the pursuit for this unattainable beauty of one's body image can lead to [[body dysmorphic disorder]], body objectification, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and other related psychological difficulties.

In the same study from [[Arizona State University]], it was said that the idea of beauty is generated from these media messages. "Cultural messages about beauty (i.e. what it is, how it should be cultivated, and how it will be rewarded) are often implicitly conveyed through media representations of women."&lt;ref name="Rubin, L. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = L | year = 2004 | title = Exploring Feminist Women's Body Consciousness | url = | journal = Psychology Of Women Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 27–37 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00120.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study from Old Dominion University, the authors state the importance of research in this area. "Given the centrality of body image in clinical and sub clinical eating disturbances that are so prevalent among women, research on gender and body image has substantial importance."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"/&gt; Even though there is research being done, there is still much more work to be done to help individuals who struggle with their body image.

The link between body image and eating disorders is becoming increasingly prominent in the younger generations as the growth of social media and social influencers inhibits their perspective on their own bodies.&lt;ref name="NaeimiHaghighian2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naeimi|first1=Alireza Farsad|last2=Haghighian|first2=Hossein Khadem|last3=Gargari|first3=Bahram Pourghassem |last4=Alizadeh|first4=Mohammad|last5=Rouzitalab|first5=Tohid|title=Eating disorders risk and its relation to self-esteem and body image in Iranian university students of medical sciences|journal=Eating and Weight Disorders - Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity|volume=21|issue=4|year=2016|pages=597–605|issn=1124-4909|doi=10.1007/s40519-016-0283-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat unhealthy body image issues among women, in 2015, [[France]] passed a law requiring models to be declared healthy by a doctor to participate in fashion shows. It also requires re-touched images to be marked as such in magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Willsher (December 18, 2015), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/models-doctors-note-prove-not-too-thin-france Models in France must provide doctor's note to work], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight- The Psychosocial burden of childhood overweight and Obesity:
Children also have a hard time dealing with 'body image' and can face discrimination. According to (''[[European Journal of Pediatrics]]'' 2017 ) 
According to research, It has shown that the psychological, social and behavioral consequences of childhood obesity shows that children who are overweight experience not only discrimination but overall body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, [[social isolation]] and depression.

== Race ==
Perceptions of races have drastically changed over the years dating all the way back to the [[medieval era]] referencing light and dark, good and evil. Hundreds of years later perceptions would be changed again with the [[Atlantic slave trade]], which left ideas of idealism for [[White people|Caucasians]] and a negative idea of any other race. [[White nationalism|Caucasian nationalists]] such as Goldstein also believed that all races originated from the 'white' race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/graywhite1e/#t_823553____|title=Freedom on my mind: A history of African Americans|last=Bay|last2=White|first2=Deborah Gray|last3=Martin|first3=Waldo E.|date=|location=New York|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins |year=2013|last1=|first1=Mia|accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this extreme racism of the time the black body was studied, displayed and scrutinized for any minor difference. "The ideas about beauty we contend with in the twenty- first century draw in part on very old ways of thinking about human bodies and [[African people|African]] difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camp|first1=Stephanie|title=Black Is Beautiful: An American History|journal=Journal of Southern History|date=April 2015|volume=3|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s the [[Black is Beautiful]] movement and [[Black Power]] movement took form and shook the world in a display of racial pride. Today's perceptions of different races has come a long way in bringing a positive mentality to racial body image but there are still some core issues in today's society.

The [[fashion industry]] is known for not being inclusive of more races in their runways and ad campaigns, and several studies that have been conducted prove that the lack of racial diversity can contribute to body image issues amongst non-white minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://cswr.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryant.-The-beauty-ideal-The-effects-of-European-standards-of-beauty-on-Black-women..pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131210214658/http://cswr.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryant.-The-beauty-ideal-The-effects-of-European-standards-of-beauty-on-Black-women..pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2013-12-10|title = The Beauty Ideal: The Effects of European Standards of Beauty on Black Women|last = Bryant|first = Susan L|date = n.d.|journal = Columbia Social Work Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one such experiment, conducted in 2003, 3 photographs of attractive [[white people|white]], [[black people|black]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] women were shown to a group of white, black and Asian students. The study concluded that Asian women thought that the photograph of the white woman was the most attractive, and reported high levels of body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.allenmcconnell.net/pdfs/racialminorities-SAI-2003.pdf|title = Do Racial Minorities Respond in the Same Way to Mainstream Beauty Standards? Social Comparison Processes in Asian, Black, and White Women|last = McConnell|first = Allen|date = 2003|journal = Self and Identity| volume = 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such dissatisfaction may even cause these individuals to suffer psychologically due to the pressure to embody these ideals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Beauty Teaches Minorities To Look More White|url = http://www.refinery29.com/minority-beauty|publisher = Refinery29|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may result in them going through several means to change their physical appearance in order to match the [[Eurocentric]] idea of beauty.

[[Weight loss]] is one such method. For instance, [[Mexican American]] women who have been attuned to mainstream US culture reported greater body dissatisfaction and have described their ideal body types to be similar to the [[White normalcy|white norm]]. In spite of the fact that certain ethnicities naturally have different body types,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/race-is-part-of-the-body-image-conversation-so-why-dont-we-talk-about-it-8600605.htm|title = Race is part of the body image conversation, so why don't we talk about it?|date = May 2, 2013|accessdate = October 25, 2015|newspaper=The Independent |last = Devon|first = Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; this ideal has led to disordered eating amongst [[Latino|Latinas]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title = Beauty Whitewashed: How White Ideals Exclude Women of Color |url = http://www.beautyredefined.net/beauty-whitewashed-how-white-ideals-exclude-women-of-color/|publisher = Beauty Redefined |accessdate = 2015-11-07|language = en-US|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110306151312/http://www.beautyredefined.net/beauty-whitewashed-how-white-ideals-exclude-women-of-color/|archivedate = 2011-03-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plastic surgery]] is another method, and is especially popular in Asia for "[[Westernization|Westernizing]]" facial features. Two of the most popular treatments are [[rhinoplasty]] (nose lifts), and [[blepharoplasty]] (eyelid lifts), which are done to make these features look more Caucasian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asia's ideal beauty: Looking Caucasian - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/25/health/asian-beauty/index.html|publisher = CNN|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skin-lightening|Skin lightening]] products are also prevalent in countries where non-white ethnicities are the majority, and the industry makes billions of dollars every year.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In [[Racism in India|India]] alone, whitening products make up 45% of the skin care market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Skin lightening trend in Asia boosts global market|url = http://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/market-trends/skin-lightening-trend-in-asia-boosts-global-market|publisher = CosmeticsDesign-Asia.com|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plenty of these whitening cosmetics are known to have dangerous side effects due to the ingredients in them; [[hydroquinone]], for instance, is known to cause irritation and [[leukemia]]{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} while [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is known to cause [[rash]]es and pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Bob Fredericks |title=Health officials warn of mercury levels in skin-lightening creams |url=https://nypost.com/2018/04/06/health-officials-warn-of-mercury-levels-in-skin-lightening-creams/ |website=New York Post |accessdate=17 June 2018 |date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of these effects, industries like the fashion industry have not significantly featured women of color (and when they have, the women may have either been significantly "whitewashed" – with digitally lightened skin and hair – or may already have features that are considered "white").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fashion industry believes that by advertising unattainable standards of beauty, they fuel a customer demand by "creating a craving that can't be satisfied".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Can using different types of models benefit brands?|url = http://www.ellecanada.com/living/culture/can-using-different-types-of-models-benefit-brands/a/58327 |publisher = Elle Canada|accessdate = 2015-11-07|language = en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study by [[Elle Canada]] has proven the exact opposite: products featured by models that accurately represent the consumer's race – as well as weight and age – will increase the consumer's willingness to purchase a product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Booklist''''' is a publication of the [[American Library Association]] that provides critical reviews of books and audiovisual materials for all ages. ''Booklist’''s primary audience consists of libraries, educators, and booksellers. The magazine is available to subscribers in print and online. ''Booklist'' is published 22 times per year, and reviews over 7,500 titles annually. The ''Booklist'' brand also offers a blog, various newsletters, and monthly webinars.  The ''Booklist'' offices are located in the American Library Association headquarters in Chicago’s [[Gold Coast, Chicago|Gold Coast]] neighborhood.

==History==
''Booklist'', as an introduction from the [[American Library Association]] publishing board notes, began publication in January 1905 to "meet an evident need by issuing a current buying list of recent books with brief notes designed to assist librarians in selection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Introduction|journal=Booklist|date=Jan–Feb 1905|volume=1|issue=1-2|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFJHAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;ots=k0aJGGVNC5&amp;dq=%22current%20buying%20list%20of%20recent%20books%20with%20brief%20notes%22&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an annual subscription fee of 50 cents, ''Booklist'' was initially subsidized by a $100,000 grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]], known for its public and university library endowments, and at first mainly contained the briefest 25- to 50-word summaries. In 1913, the ''Booklist'' offices were moved from Boston to the ALA headquarters in Chicago's [[McCormick family|McCormick mansion]]. By the 1930s the reviews had become more in-depth, and the journal began to include some articles. In October 1939, just a few weeks after the start of [[World War II]], ''Booklist'' published an article entitled "Books for the 'Long and Calm View': On the Crisis, Its Background and Implications to the United States", intended to address "the demand for impartial books without the emotionalism of propaganda." Amidst a world crisis, the editor helped library patrons to have their questions answered while presenting various viewpoints. From the 1950s to the 1960s, ''Booklist'' reviews were limited to 150 words, generally three long sentences. Reviews were handwritten in pencil on yellow legal paper, edited and typed up for the printer. Artistic design choices for the magazine were minimal, with the only visual change between issues being the plain cover's solid colour.

The 1970s saw a great deal of change in the ''Booklist'' offices. As adolescent literature gained popularity, a [[Young adult fiction|Young Adult]] books editor was hired. The publication of such books as [[Judy Blume]]’s ''Forever'', [[Phyllis Reynolds Naylor]]'s Alice series, and [[S.E. Hinton]]'s ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'' marked a need to evaluate books not meant strictly for either children or adults. In 1973, new editor-publisher Paul Brawley was the first to print editions of the magazine with recreated book jackets on the cover. Some ''Booklist'' subscribers protested the flashy new covers, supposedly claiming they liked the plain covers and the space they afforded for listing potential book orders. Under Brawley’s editorship, beginning with 16mm film strips and spoken-word recordings, ''Booklist'' began to accept submissions and print reviews of audiovisual products. During the 1980s and 1990s, ''Booklist'' began its Editors’ Choice reviews and its first feature column, “Manley Arts”, by Will Manley. The 1990s issues of ''Booklist'' were the first to be composed on in-office computers.

The June 2005 issue of ''Booklist'' marked the magazine’s 100th anniversary. To celebrate the centennial, the acting editors published a feature article entitled “The Booklist Century”, wherein they chose a book from each year of the preceding hundred to highlight its social impact — ranging from [[Edith Wharton]]'s ''[[The House of Mirth]]'' (1905) to the ''[[9/11 Commission Report]]''.

Currently, the magazine can be found online and in print. The ''Booklist'' editorial team also creates supplemental products, such as ''Book Links'', webinars and the ''Booklist Reader''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booklistreader.com/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booklist offices are located in the 50 E. Huron building at the ALA headquarters. Current editor Bill Ott is the seventh to hold the position since ''Booklist'' was founded.

==Reviews and reviewers==
'''''Booklist'' Reviews''' ''Booklist'' reviews are said to be "the haiku of book reviewing." Reviews include a brief synopsis, plus mention of the most successful elements of style. Most reviews fall between 175 and 225 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booklistonline.com/writing-for-booklist|title=General Info - Booklist Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Starred Reviews''' The ''Booklist'' star indicates an outstanding title of a particular genre. All starred reviews are approved by the appropriate editor.

'''High-Demand''' ''Booklist'' recognizes that libraries wish to purchase new materials as soon as they become available, and therefore works to review titles as early as possible. The “High-Demand Backstory” symbol indicates titles likely to be surrounded by media coverage and patron popularity.

'''Adult Books with YA Appeal''' As an additional source for librarians, ''Booklist'' reviews certain adult titles and labels them for YA appeal. These materials tend to have young protagonists or themes relevant to teenage readers.

'''Recommendation-only system''' Since its founding in 1905, ''Booklist'' has followed a recommendation-only system. This means that every title reviewed would make a quality addition to library collections.

'''''Booklist'' Selection Policy''' The editors of ''Booklist'' magazine adhere to a selection policy consistent with the Library Bill of Rights. The process of choosing titles for reviews aims to promote readership, never censorship.

'''''Booklist'' Reviewers''' Titles are reviewed by a corps of librarians, freelancers, journalists, and educators, as well as ''Booklist'' editors and staff.

'''Buda''' (or '''bouda'''), in [[Ethiopia]]n [[folk religion]], is the power of the [[evil eye]] and the ability to [[werehyena|change into a hyena]].  Buda is generally believed to be a power held and wielded by those in a different social group, for example among the [[Beta Israel]] or metalworkers.&lt;ref name="finneran"&gt;Finneran, Niall. "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_3_114/ai_n6118470/ Ethiopian Evil Eye Belief and the Magical Symbolism of Iron Working.]" ''Folklore'', Vol. 114, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wagaw"&gt;Wagaw, Teshome G. ''For Our Soul: Ethiopian Jews in Israel''.  Detroit: Wayne State Univ. Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|20-21}}  The belief is also present in [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], and among the [[Berber people]] in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="woodward"&gt;{{cite book | author= Woodward, Ian | title=The Werewolf Delusion | year=1979 | isbn= 0-448-23170-0 | page= 256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belief in the evil eye, or buda, is widespread in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, John W. "Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity: Faith and practices". ''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/ettoc.html A Country Study: Ethiopia]''. Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, eds. Washington: Library of Congress Federal Research Division, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Beta Israel, or Ethiopian Jews, are often characterized by others as possessing buda.&lt;ref name="wagaw" /&gt;{{Rp|20-21}}  Other castes such as ironworkers are often labeled as bearing the buda.&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;  In fact, the word for manual worker, ''tabib'', is also used to denote "one with the evil eye."&lt;ref name="beckwith"&gt;Beckwith, Carol, Angela Fisher, and Graham Hancock. ''African Ark''. New York: Henry N. Abrams, Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|49}}  The alleged evil power of the tabib is believed to be at a level similar to that of [[Witchcraft|witches]].&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;

Buda's alleged prevalence among outsiders correlates with the traditional belief that evil eye curses themselves are rooted in envy.  As such, those allegedly possessing the power of buda might do so because of malevolent spirits.  One study specifies that they are believed to be "empowered by evil spirit".&lt;ref name="geleta"&gt;Geleta, Amsalu Tadesse.  "[http://www.lausanne.org/all-documents/ethiopian-case-study.html Case Study: Demonization and the Practice of Exorcism in Ethiopian Churches] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101104543/http://www.lausanne.org/all-documents/ethiopian-case-study.html |date=2010-01-01 }}".  Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, Nairobi, August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Niall Finneran describes how "the idea of magical creation underpins the perception of artisans in Ethiopia and in the wider African context. In many cases these skills have been acquired originally from an elemental source of evil via the paternal lineage, rather like a [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian pact]]."&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;  The power of the evil eye allows its bearer to change into a [[hyena]], allowing him or her to attack another person while concealing his or her human identity.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;

Some Ethiopian Christians carry an [[amulet]] or talisman, known as a ''[[kitab]]'', or will invoke God's name, to ward off the ill effects of buda.&lt;ref name="kemp"&gt;Kemp, Charles.  "[http://bearspace.baylor.edu/Charles_Kemp/www/ethiopian_refugees.htm Ethiopians &amp; Eritreans.]"  ''Refugee Health – Immigrant Health''. Waco, TX: Baylor University.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[debtera]], who is either an unordained priest or educated layperson, will create these protective amulets or talismans.&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;

[[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] priests continue to intervene and perform exorcisms on behalf of those believed to be afflicted by demons or buda.  Such persons are brought to a church or prayer meeting.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;  Amsalu Geleta, in a modern case study, relates elements that are common to Ethiopian Christian exorcisms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It includes singing praise and victory songs, reading from the Scripture, prayer and confronting the spirit in the name of Jesus. Dialogue with the spirit is another important part of the exorcism ceremony. It helps the counselor (exorcist) to know how the spirit was operating in the life of the demoniac. The signs and events mentioned by the spirit are affirmed by the victim after deliverance.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exorcism is not always successful, and Geleta notes another instance in which the usual methods were unsuccessful, and the demons apparently left the subject at a later time.  In any event, "in all cases the spirit is commanded in no other name than the name of Jesus."&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3628">{{Music of China}}

'''Chinese musicology''' is the academic study of traditional [[Chinese music]].  This discipline has a very long history. The concept of music ''yue'' stands among the oldest categories of Chinese thought, however, in the known sources it does not receive a fairly  clear definition until the writing of the ''[[Classic of Music]]'' (lost during the Han dynasty).

==Music scales==
The first [[musical scale]]s were derived from the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. On the [[Guqin]] (a traditional instrument) all of the dotted positions are equal string length divisions related to the open string like 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, etc. and are quite easy to recognize on this instrument. The Guqin has a scale of 13 positions all representing a natural harmonic position related to the open string.

The ancient Chinese defined, by mathematical means, a gamut or series of ''[[Shí-èr-lǜ]]'' (called the 十二律 12 ''lü'') from which various sets of five or seven frequencies were selected to make the sort of "do re mi" major [[scale (music)|scale]] familiar to those who have been formed with the [[Musical notation|Western Standard notation]]. The 12 ''lü'' approximate the frequencies known in the West as the chromatic scale, from A, then B-flat, through to G and A-flat.

==Scale and tonality==

Most Chinese music uses a [[pentatonic scale]], with the intervals (in terms of ''lǜ'') almost the same as those of the major pentatonic scale. The notes of this scale are called ''gōng'' 宫, ''shāng'' 商, ''jué'' 角, ''zhǐ'' 徵 and ''yǔ'' 羽. By starting from a different point of this sequence, a scale (named after its starting note) with a different interval sequence is  created, similar to the construction of [[Musical mode#Modern modes|modes]] in modern Western music.

Since the Chinese system is not an [[equal tempered]] tuning, playing a melody starting from the ''lǜ'' nearest to A will not necessarily sound the same as playing the same melody starting from some other ''lǜ'', since the [[wolf interval]] will occupy a different point in the scale. The effect of changing the starting point of a song can be rather like the effect of shifting from a [[major key|major]] to a [[minor key]] in Western music. The scalar tunings of [[Pythagoras]], based on 2:3 ratios (8:9, 16:27, 64:81, etc.), are a western near-parallel to the earlier calculations used to derive Chinese scales.

&lt;!--this image is not limited in width to 400px due to the amount of small detail--&gt;
[[File:Chinese_Music_Gamut_&amp;_Scales.svg|800px|left|thumb|How the scales are produced: Start with a fundamental frequency. (440 hertz is used here.) Apply the ratios to make the first column. Copy the second and all further elements in this column to the respective heads of the other eleven columns. Apply the ratios to make the second through the twelfth columns. So doing produces 144 frequencies (with some duplications). From each column five different selections of non-adjacent frequencies can be made. (See the colored blocks at the far left.) So each column can produce 60 different pentatonic scales.]]

{{Serbian culture}}
The '''Cinema of Serbia''' comprises the art of [[film]] and creative movies made within the nation of [[Serbia]] or by Serbian filmmakers abroad.

[[Serbia]] (both as an independent country and as of [[former Yugoslavia]]) has been home to many internationally acclaimed films and directors, and is considered to be the most successful Balkan nation in term of filming. Most of the prominent films from the Balkans are mainly from Serbia, and have acquired a great level of commercial successes.

==Serbian theatre and cinema==
Serbia has a well-established theatrical tradition with many theatres. The [[Serbian National Theatre]] was established in 1861 with its building dating from 1868. The company started performing opera from the end of the 19th century and the permanent opera was established in 1947. It established a ballet company.

[[Bitef]], Belgrade International Theatre Festival, is one of the oldest theatre festivals in the world. New Theatre Tendencies is the constant subtitle of the Festival. Founded in 1967, Bitef has continually followed and supported the latest theater trends. It has become one of five most important and biggest European festivals. It has become one of the most significant culture institutions of Serbia.

Serbian cinema dates back to 1896. with the release of the oldest movie in the Balkans, ''[[The Life and Deeds of the Immortal Vožd Karađorđe]]'', a biography about Serbian revolutionary leader, [[Karađorđe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/magazine/sr/story/411/Film/998168/Restauriran+najstariji+srpski+igrani+film.html |title=Restauriran najstariji srpski igrani film |language=sr |publisher=Rts.rs |date=26 November 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netsrbija.net/srpska-kultura-film-i-kinematografija.html |title=Razvoj filma i kinematografije u Srbiji |publisher=Netsrbija.net |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinema was established reasonably early in Serbia with 12 films being produced before the start of [[World War II]]. The most notable of the prewar films was Mihailo Popovic's The Battle of Kosovo in 1939.

Cinema prospered after World War II. The most notable postwar director was [[Dušan Makavejev]] who was internationally recognised for ''[[Love Affair: Or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator]]'' in 1969 focusing on Yugoslav politics. Makavejev's ''Montenegro'' was made in Sweden in 1981. [[Zoran Radmilovic|Zoran Radmilović]] was one of the most notable actors of the postwar period.

Serbian cinema continued to make progress in the 1990s and today despite the turmoil of the 1990s. [[Emir Kusturica]] won two Golden Palms for Best Feature Film at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], for ''[[When Father Was Away on Business]]'' in 1985 and then again for ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'' in 1995. In 1998, Kusturica won a Silver Lion for directing ''[[Black Cat, White Cat]]''.

As at 2001, there were 167 cinemas in Serbia (excluding [[Kosovo]]) and over 4 million Serbs went to the cinema in that year. In 2005, ''[[San zimske noći]]'' (A Midwinter Night's Dream ) directed by [[Goran Paskaljevic|Goran Paskaljević]] caused controversy over its criticism of Serbia's role in the [[Yugoslav wars]] in the 1990s.

Several Serbian-American filmmakers have established a loose, intellectual multi-mediamaking tradition, working within prominent academic institutions and also creating works marked by high stylistic experimentation.  Three figures here would include [[Slavko Vorkapic]], creator of famed montage sequences for Hollywood films and Dean of the USC Film School; Vlada Petric, television and film director, archivist, and founding curator of the [[Harvard Film Archive]]; and [[Vladan Nikolic]], creator of the [[Zenith (film)|Zenith film]] and transmedia project as well as Professor at the New School for Social Media in New York City.

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=July 2011}}
The film begins in [[Alexandria]] with [[Cleopatra VII]], Egypt's rightful Queen, in exile, while her sister [[Arsinoe IV of Egypt|Arsinoe]] and brother, [[Ptolemy XIII|Ptolemy]] have stolen the throne. Roman general [[Julius Caesar]] comes to collect Egypt's tax debt. After conversing with a courtesan, Cleopatra smuggles herself into the palace wrapped in a carpet; a gift from her to Caesar. He accepts the gift and the young queen is revealed to Caesar. The two spend the night together, and the next morning, Cleopatra and Ptolemy are betrothed to marry by Caesar. Shortly after the siblings are wed, Cleopatra is proclaimed [[Queen regnant|Queen]] of Egypt, forcing Ptolemy to join forces with Arsinoe and drive their sister out of Alexandria.

A war breaks out between the Romans and Ptolemy's Egyptian forces, and in the process, Alexandria's great library is burned to the ground. Even with this loss, Cleopatra soon celebrates the return of her Roman lover, the death of her brother, and the capture of her traitor sister. The two take a 2-month journey down the Nile aboard one of the Queen's elegant ships. Upon their return, Caesar breaks the news that he must leave for Rome. Unbeknownst to him, Caesar leaves Cleopatra pregnant with his child. A son is born to the queen roughly nine months later; he is named [[Caesarion]], in honor of his father.

Back in [[Roman Republic|Rome]], believing that he should hold the same status as his Egyptian lover, Caesar demands he be declared King of Rome. Although they are hesitant to do so, the senate eventually grants Caesar's request. Now having been declared king, Caesar invites Cleopatra to stay at one of his villas, just outside Rome. With her, she brings the couple's infant son. In front of his people (including wife [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]]), Cleopatra declares that Caesar is her son's father, publicly forcing his hand, and demanding that her son be allowed to rule both Egypt and Rome invoking the consternation of [[Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius|Cassius]].

Although he accepts Caesarion as his child, Caesar denies the queen's request, explaining that Egypt is only free from Rome because he wishes it to be. Just before her return to Egypt, Cleopatra soon learns that Caesar has been assassinated at the hands of Brutus, Cassius and other senators. The burdens of ruling fall on the shoulders of Caesar's Roman heir and nephew, [[Octavian]]. [[Mark Antony]] declares revenge and begins a war against Brutus and Cassius. In the process, both Cassius and Brutus commit suicide.

In spending time with together, Antony and Cleopatra fall in love. Although they wish to marry, Antony marries Octavian's sister, Octavia, in order to strengthen his alliance and co-ruling with the new emperor. Defying his Roman beliefs against [[polygamy]], Antony marries Cleopatra in Antioch, claiming that her son, Caesarion, is heir to not only Egypt, but also Rome.

Upon hearing of Antony's claim, Octavian wages war against the two lovers, trapping Cleopatra in her own city. Antony army is overwhelmed by Octavian's army. Antony returns with his defeated soldiers, badly wounded and soon dies of his injuries. Cleopatra is devastated. 

Octavian arrives in Egypt, demanding that Cleopatra join him in Rome as his prisoner. She agrees and askes that her son be allowed to rule Egypt. Octavian refuses, but allows Antony to have an Egyptian burial.

After sending her son to [[India]], Cleopatra's lets an Egyptian asp bite her, and dies shortly after. Her handmaidens quickly follow their queen's example. 

Octavian's men break through the doors, only to discover that the queen is dead. Octavian approaches Cleopatra and finds that she is dead. Then he says "You have won, Cleopatra" and then leaves.

The '''''Defensor minor''''' is a work by [[Marsilius of Padua]] written around 1342. The Defensor minor is a restatement and defense of Marsilius's best known work, the ''[[Defensor pacis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nederman, Cary J. [http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521408466 Marsiglio of Padua: 'Defensor minor' and 'De translatione imperii']&lt;/ref&gt; 

The text discusses civil and [[ecclesiastical]] jurisdiction, the [[Confession (religion)|confession]], [[penance]], [[indulgence]]s, the [[Crusades]], [[pilgrimage]]s, [[plenitudo potestatis]], legislative power, the origin of the sovereignty, [[wedding]], and [[divorce]].

==Civil jurisdiction==
With regard to jurisdiction, Marsilius distinguishes between divine and human laws, the first event which is independent of any human will and on the conduct of man in view of the afterlife, the second which determines the will of the people, endowed with coercive power and not modifiable by any clergyman.

This applies also to the Pope that even with his decrees may waive the law, manifestation of the people's sovereignty. While the beneficiaries of the two laws are identical, its object and purpose are different. The one seeks the good of the soul and the other cares for earthly well-being, with the result that the church is denied the power to make laws, even in the persistent silence of human legislation. The same applies to amendments and changes, which should remain solely with the people. The only thing that is relevant to the clergy is the non-legal rules that affect morality and resolve themselves into simple counsels and take effect with counsellors.

==The clergy==
The task and the main function of the clergy is to teach the sacred texts and preparing souls for the afterlife. The Church has repeatedly stated that for the sinner there is no other system of redemption from sin but confession. Marsilius, in an effort to bring man to God, regardless of any broker, says that confession should be done directly to God and that salvation comes only by true repentance. This anticipates what will be one of the tenets of Protestantism. The necessity of this Sacrament, that is only recommended and not required, is not detected from the Holy Scriptures. Only sincere repentance to the outside of any denominational gives you that peace in the soul that is the prelude of eternal salvation.  Absolution from sin belongs only to God and the priest, who may do so, does so only within the Church. ''Sufficit soli Deo confiteri peccata ipsa, videlicet recognoscendo, et de ipsis poenitendo cum proposito talia alterius non committendi.'' 
These words can be regarded as harbingers of what will be the principles of the Lutheran Reformation.

''Sufficit sola contritio et vera poenitentia de commisso absque omni confessione facta vel fienda sacerdoti, ut immediate absolvatur per Deum.'' Marsilio does not exclude absolutely confession: he says only that it is useful but not essential,  which it would be if it were a precept, therefore  he also denies the priestly power to inflict penalties.
Only contrition frees from sin not repentance of any material or spiritual character almost like a compensation for the sin.''Quamvis in hoc saeculo nullam realem aut personalem satisfactionem exhibeat pro peccatis.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14602">A '''demosaicing''' (also '''de-mosaicing''', '''demosaicking''' or '''debayering''') [[algorithm]] is a [[digital image processing|digital image process]] used to reconstruct a full color image from the incomplete color samples output from an [[image sensor]] overlaid with a [[color filter array]] (CFA). It is also known as ''CFA interpolation'' or ''color reconstruction''.

Most modern digital cameras acquire images using a single image sensor overlaid with a CFA, so demosaicing is part of the [[Color image pipeline|processing pipeline]] required to render these images into a viewable format.

Many modern digital cameras can save images in a [[raw image format|raw format]] allowing the user to demosaic them using software, rather than using the camera's built-in [[firmware]].

==Goal==
The aim of a demosaicing algorithm is to reconstruct a full color image (i.e. a full set of color triples) from the spatially undersampled [[Channel (digital image)|color channels]] output from the CFA. The algorithm should have the following traits:

* Avoidance of the introduction of false color artifacts, such as chromatic [[Aliasing|aliases]], [[Bayer filter#Zippering artifact|zippering]] (abrupt unnatural changes of intensity over a number of neighboring pixels) and [[purple fringing]]
* Maximum preservation of the [[image resolution]]
* Low [[Algorithmic efficiency|computational complexity]] for fast processing or efficient in-camera hardware implementation
* Amenability to analysis for accurate [[noise reduction]]

==Color filter array==
{{main|Color filter array}}
[[File:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|250px|The Bayer arrangement of color filters on the pixel array of an image sensor. Each two-by-two cell contains two green, one blue, and one red filter.]]

A color filter array is a mosaic of [[color]] filters in front of the image sensor.   Commercially, the most commonly used CFA configuration is the [[Bayer filter]] illustrated here. This has alternating [[red]] (R) and [[green]] (G) filters for odd rows and alternating green (G) and [[blue]] (B) filters for even rows. There are twice as many green filters as red or blue ones, catering to the [[human eye]]'s higher sensitivity to green light.

Since the color subsampling of a CFA by its nature results in [[aliasing]], an [[Anti-aliasing filter#Optical anti-aliasing filter|optical anti-aliasing filter]] is typically placed in the optical path between the image sensor and the lens to reduce the false color artifacts (chromatic aliases) introduced by interpolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Since each pixel of the sensor is behind a color filter, the output is an array of pixel values, each indicating a raw intensity of one of the three filter colors. Thus, an algorithm is needed to estimate for each pixel the color levels for all color components, rather than a single component.

==Illustration==
To reconstruct a full color image from the data collected by the color filtering array, a form of [[interpolation]] is needed to fill in the blanks. The mathematics here is subject to individual implementation, and is called demosaicing.

In this example, we use [[Adobe Photoshop]]'s bicubic interpolation to simulate the circuitry of a Bayer filter device such as a [[digital camera]].

The image below simulates the output from a Bayer filtered image sensor; each pixel has only a red, green or blue component. The corresponding original image is shown alongside the demosaiced reconstruction at the end of this section.

A digital camera typically has means to reconstruct a whole RGB image using the above information. The resulting image could be something like this:

|-

|}

The reconstructed image is typically accurate in uniform-colored areas, but has a loss of resolution (detail and sharpness) and has edge artifacts (for example, the edges of letters have visible color fringes and some roughness).

==Algorithms==

===Simple interpolation===
These algorithms are examples of [[multivariate interpolation]] on a uniform grid, using relatively straightforward mathematical operations on nearby instances of the same color component. The simplest method is [[nearest-neighbor interpolation]] which simply copies an adjacent pixel of the same color channel.  It is unsuitable for any application where quality matters, but can be useful for generating previews given limited computational resources. Another simple method is [[bilinear interpolation]], whereby the red value of a non-red pixel is computed as the average of the two or four adjacent red pixels, and similarly for blue and green.  More complex methods that interpolate independently within each color plane include [[bicubic interpolation]], [[spline interpolation]], and [[Lanczos resampling]].

Although these methods can obtain good results in homogenous image regions, they are prone to severe demosaicing artifacts in regions with edges and details when used with pure-color CFAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Hybrid color filter array demosaicking for effective artifact suppression | author1=Lanlan Chang | author2=Yap-Peng Tan | url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/CHAN0069/JEI013003.pdf | pages=2 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229063407/http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/CHAN0069/JEI013003.pdf | archivedate=2009-12-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, linear interpolation can obtain very good results when combined with a spatio-spectral (panchromatic) CFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sisl.seas.harvard.edu/files/pub/HirakawaWolfe2007.pdf |title=Spatio-Spectral Color Filter Array Design for Enhanced Image Fidelity |author1=Keigo Hirakawa |author2=Patrick J.

One could exploit simple formation models of images for demosaicing. 
In natural images within the same segment, the ratio of colors should be preserved. 
This fact was exploited in an image sensitive interpolation for demosaicing.

===Pixel correlation within an image===
More sophisticated demosaicing algorithms exploit the spatial and/or spectral correlation of pixels within a color image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hybrid color filter array demosaicking for effective artifact suppression |author1=Lanlan Chang |author2=Yap-Peng Tan |url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/CHAN0069/JEI013003.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229063407/http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/CHAN0069/JEI013003.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial correlation is the tendency of pixels to assume similar color values within a small homogeneous region of an image. Spectral correlation is the dependency between the pixel values of different color planes in a small image region.

These algorithms include:

* '''Variable Number of Gradients (VNG)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interpolation using a Threshold-based variable number of gradients |author=Ting Chen |url=http://scien.stanford.edu/pages/labsite/1999/psych221/projects/99/tingchen/main.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422035609/http://scien.stanford.edu/pages/labsite/1999/psych221/projects/99/tingchen/main.htm |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; interpolation computes gradients near the pixel of interest and uses the lower gradients (representing smoother and more similar parts of the image) to make an estimate.  It is used in first versions of [[dcraw]], and suffers from color artifacts.
* '''Pixel Grouping (PPG)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pixel Grouping for Color Filter Array Demosaicing |author=Chuan-kai Lin, Portland State University |year=2004 |url=https://sites.google.com/site/chklin/demosaic/}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses assumptions about natural scenery in making estimates. It has fewer color artifacts on natural images than the Variable Number of Gradients method; it was introduced in [[dcraw]] from rel. 8.71 as "Patterned Pixel Grouping".
* '''Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed (AHD)''' somewhat the industry standard. Interpolation selects the direction of interpolation so as to maximize a homogeneity metric, thus typically minimizing color artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Adaptive homogeneity-directed demosaicing algorithm | author=Kiego Hirakawa; [[Thomas W. Parks]] | url=http://nagykrisztian.com/store/hirakawa.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been implemented in recent versions of dcraw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/ Decoding raw digital photos in Linux], Dave Coffin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Aliasing Minimization and Zipper Elimination (AMaZE)''' designed by Emil J. Martinec, slow but with a great performance specially on low noise captures. An implementation of AMaZE  can be found in [[RawTherapee]].

===Video super-resolution/demosaicing===
It has been shown that [[super-resolution]] and demosaicing are two faces of the same problem and it is reasonable to address them in a unified context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.duke.edu/%7Esf59/TIP_Demos_Final_Color.pdf | title = Multi-Frame Demosaicing and Super-Resolution of Color Images |author1=Sina Farsiu |author2=Michael Elad |author3=Peyman Milanfar | journal= IEEE Trans. on Image Processing|year=2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=141–159 | doi = 10.1109/TIP.2005.860336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that both these problems address the aliasing issue. Therefore, especially in the case of video (multi-frame) reconstruction, a joint super-resolution and demosaicing approach provides the optimal solution.

===Trade-offs===
Some methods may produce better results for natural scenes, and some for printed material, for instance. This reflects the inherent problem of estimating pixels that are not definitively known. Naturally, there is also the ubiquitous trade-off of speed versus quality of estimation.

==Use in computer image processing software==
When one has access to the [[Raw image format|raw image data]] from a digital camera, one can use computer software with a variety of different demosaicing algorithms instead of being limited to the one built into the camera. A few raw development programs, such as [[RawTherapee]], give the user an option to choose which algorithm should be used. Most programs, however, are coded to use one particular method. The differences in rendering the finest detail (and grain texture) that come from the choice of demosaicing algorithm are among the main differences between various raw developers; often photographers will prefer a particular program for aesthetic reasons related to this effect.

The color artifacts due to demosaicing provide important clues for identifying photo forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~huangyz/cvpr08_Huang.pdf |title=Demosaicking recognition with applications in digital photo authentication based on a quadratic pixel correlation model |author1=YiZhen Huang |author2=YangJing Long |journal=Proc.

== History ==
''EASE Guidelines'' are a result of long discussions on the electronic [[European Association of Science Editors|EASE]] Forum and during the [[European_Association_of_Science_Editors#2009 conference: Integrity in Science Communication|2009 EASE conference in Pisa]], as well as subsequent consultations within the EASE Council.&lt;ref&gt;Ufnalska S. 2010.

)}} ''European Science Editing'' 36(2): 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==

The document includes a succinct set of practical guidelines explaining how to write complete, concise and clear manuscripts (see a [http://www.ease.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Sylwia-Ufnalska-EASE-2016.pdf short presentation]). It is supplemented with a list for further reading as well as several short appendices (Abstracts; Ambiguity; Cohesion; Ethics; Plurals; Simplicity; Spelling; Text-tables) that present selected issues in greater detail or provide more examples.

''EASE Guidelines'' emphasize the need for proper structuring of the [[Academic paper#Scholarly paper|article]] (e.g. making the tested hypothesis clear in the Introduction), making the [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] highly informative (including most important [[data]] and conclusions), and writing understandably, so that the readers are not discouraged or confused. Ethical issues are also taken into account, e.g. authorship criteria, [[plagiarism]], redundant publications, and other types of [[scientific misconduct]]. The 2013 edition of the publication ethics checklist ([https://web.archive.org/web/20140810105700/http://www.ease.org.uk/sites/default/files/ease_guidelines-june2014-ethics.pdf Appendix: Ethics], page 10 of ''EASE Guidelines'') was presented at the 3rd World Conference on Research Integrity in Montreal in May 2013. It can be used routinely during submission, as one short form instead of many separate forms to be filled by authors.

== Perspectives ==

The [[European Association of Science Editors|EASE]] Council plans to add more appendices on specific subjects and more translations (made mostly by volunteers), as well as to review ''EASE Guidelines'' annually.&lt;ref name=LP /&gt;

Non-commercial [[printing]] of the document is allowed, so it can be used as a [[handout]], e.g. for [[postgraduate education|courses]] in [[scientific literature|scientific writing]] and [[scientific misconduct|publication ethics]].&lt;ref name="CSE" /&gt;

'''Encoignure''' is a type of [[furniture]] located in a corner of a room. In French, it literally means the angle, or return, formed by the junction of two walls. Since the 20th century, the word is chiefly used to designate a small [[armoire]], [[commode]], [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] or [[cupboard]] made to fit a corner. A chair placed in a corner is referred to as a chaise encoignure.

Originally the object comes from France, hence the name, famous pieces by [[Louis Quinze]] or [[Louis Seize]] in [[lacquer]] or in [[mahogany]], elaborately mounted in gilded bronze, are delightfully alluring pieces from the period of grand French furniture. It was made in a vast variety of forms but is strictly limited by its destination. As a rule these delicate and dainty pieces were in pairs and placed in opposite angles; frequently the tops were finished in expensive colored [[marble]].

The '''[[flag]] of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]''' is an official symbol of the province. The flag was approved 17 February 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.provinciegroningen.nl/servicelinks-provincie-groningen/over-de-provincie/provincievlag/ Provincievlag], [[Groningen (province)#Government|Province of Groningen]]. Retrieved on 3 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and is based upon the flag of the town of [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] and the coat of arms of the region [[Ommelanden]]. The colours red, white and blue are derived from the [[coat of arms]] of the Ommelanden, and the white and green are shown in the Groningen town flag. The colours of the town are in the centre of the flag to represent the central location of Groningen town, which is the capital of the province.

==Design==
The ratio of the flag is 2:3, the same as the [[Flag of the Netherlands|Dutch flag]]. The white cross has the width of 1/3 of the height of the flag and the green cross 1/9 of the flag height. The colors are defined as the Pantone-colors 032U (red), 300U (blue) and 355U (green).

==History==
In the year 1913 Van der Laars did a proposal to use a flag for the province of Groningen. His proposal was a flag that was based upon the flag of the Ommelanden. The blue stripe in the middle was altered to the green of the flag from the [[Groningen (city)|city of Groningen]]. He also did two other proposals where he used the colors of the [[coat-of-arms]] of the province of Groningen.

The design of the current flag was made by [[Jan Tuin]], member of the Gedeputeerde Staten of the [[Groningen (province)|province of Groningen]] and later mayor of the [[Groningen (city)|city of Groningen]]. They couldn't agree upon which flag would become the flag of the province. [[Jan Tuin]] proposed to design a new flag, this design was accepted. On 17 February 1950 it was decided by Gedeputeerde Staten that this would become the flag of the [[Groningen (province)|province of Groningen]]. Six days later the ruling was officially published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591">The '''Fundred Dollar Bill Project''' is an art project implemented by [[Mel Chin]], and is aimed to connect and represent the voices of children across the United States, with the end goal to propose a funding solution for the [[lead poisoning|lead contamination]] in the soil of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].  People in the United States and around the globe are invited to draw their own 100 dollar bills and send to collection centers, or schools, for safekeeping. During a nationwide road-trip in an armored truck, the Fundred Dollar Bills will be collected.

The completed Fundred Dollar Bills will be presented to Congress for an even exchange of U.S. dollars to help the remediation of lead in the soil of New Orleans. This funding supports [[Operation Paydirt]], which is the program that, once implemented, will make the lead content in the soil safe for inhabitants of New Orleans and cities affected by lead poisoning-across the United States.

So far nearly half a million people have created and sent in their unique Fundreds. 

'''Armored Truck Tour'''

Throughout 2010, students at hundreds of schools across the country created Fundred Dollar Bills that were picked up in a specially designed armored truck. 
As students and educators handed their Fundreds over to truck guards for safekeeping, schools held events that raised awareness of the gravity and persistence of the lead in our environment. 

These events gave local elected officials and community organizations a chance to show their support for lead cleanup while giving local press brought the issue to larger audiences.

At every stop the armored truck tour connected the national campaign for lead awareness. Each event around the country not only provided public and impassioned demonstrations against lead poisoning, but brought people together to make connections around this public health health issue.

Grand Rapids

In the fall of 2014, the ArtPrize competition in Grand Rapids, Michigan featuring the Fundred Dollar Bill Project, offered an opportunity to raise visibility of local lead issues and invite participation from the tends of thousands of expected visitors. 

Visitors to the exhibit sat at bank teller tables and drew their unique Fundreds. Once drawn, their Fundreds were added to hundreds of others on a wall in the exhibit, making their artful demonstrations part of the exhibit for its duration. In addition to creating a public display of action-oriented art, the Grand Rapids initiative brought together local public health specialists, educators, and scientists to talk about the challenges and solutions to lead poisoning in Grand Rapids.

Art Academy in Cincinnati

In 2015, the Art Academy of Cincinnati partnered with the Fundred Dollar Bill Project and the Cincinnati Health Department Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program to create a course that used art and design to address and impact issues of lead contamination in Cincinnati. 

With the Fundred Dollar Bill Project as a common starting point and inspiration, students launched group projects to increase awareness of childhood lead poisoning and our ability to put an end to it. Students exhibited their projects at a publicly accessible end of semester block party. Students explored lead poisoning through dance performance and graphic design and created a learning-through-play area. The Health Department shared information about lead, and a public Fundred drawing table provided opportunity for attendees to sit together for conversation and to creatively put their values in action.

'''Initiatives'''

Fundred Reserve Open Lab at H-Space, located in DC, is a space to expand the Fundred program by continuing to amplify personal stories, having fact based dialogue about problems in DC, and engaging more people to take purposeful action. 

Open Lab continues the presence after the 2017 Fundred Reserve exhibition at The Corcoran.  Open Lab programming runs from October through April 2018, with space provided by Hamiltonian Artists, and support from The Kresge Foundation through our partnership with MIT CoLab. 

As an extension of Mel Chin’s multi-venue exhibition, All Over the Place (April 8 - September 5, 2018), the Fundred Project is on view at the Queens Museum as part of the exhibition.

'''Funerary art''' is any work of art forming, or placed in, a repository for the remains of the [[death|dead]]. The term encompasses a wide variety of forms, including [[cenotaph]]s ("empty tombs"), tomb-like monuments which do not contain human remains, and communal memorials to the dead, such as [[war memorial]]s, which may or may not contain remains, and a range of prehistoric [[Megalith|megalithic]] constructs. Funerary art may serve many cultural functions. It can play a role in burial rites, serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife, and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead, whether as part of kinship-centred practices of [[ancestor veneration]] or as a publicly directed [[Dynasty|dynastic]] display.  It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind, as an expression of cultural values and roles, and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead, maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the lives of the living.

The deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention is found in almost all cultures—[[Hinduism|Hindu]] culture, which has little, is a notable exception.  Many of the best-known artistic creations of past cultures—from the [[Egyptian pyramids]] and the [[KV62|Tutankhamun treasure]], to the [[Terracotta Army]] surrounding the tomb of the [[Qin Shi Huang|Qin Emperor]], the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], the [[Sutton Hoo]] ship burial and the [[Taj Mahal]]—are tombs or objects found in and around them.  In most instances, specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy, although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods, usually from their possessions.

An important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the funeral ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the chapter "Tombs for the Living and the Dead", Insoll 176–87.&lt;/ref&gt; The treasure of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]], for example, though exceptionally lavish, was never intended to be seen again after it was deposited, while the exterior of the pyramids was a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators.  A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures, nearly all the art connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended for later viewing by the public or at least those admitted by the custodians.  In these cultures, traditions such as the sculpted [[sarcophagus]] and [[tomb monument]] of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires, and later the [[Christendom|Christian]] world, have flourished. The [[mausoleum]] intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the classical world, and later common in Islamic culture.

==Common terms==
[[Tomb]] is a general term for any repository for human remains, while [[grave goods]] are other objects which have been placed within the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, 58–59 characterizes [[Dismemberment|disarticulated]] human skeletal remains packed in body bags and incorporated into [[Formative stage|Pre-Classic]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[mass burial]]s (along with a set of primary remains) at Cuello, [[Belize]] as "human grave goods".&lt;/ref&gt; Such objects may include the personal possessions of the deceased, objects specially created for the burial, or miniature versions of things believed to be needed in an [[afterlife]].  Knowledge of many non-literate cultures is drawn largely from these sources.

A [[tumulus]], mound, [[kurgan]], or [[long barrow]] covered important burials in many cultures, and the body may be placed in a sarcophagus, usually of stone, or a [[coffin]], usually of wood.  A mausoleum is a building erected mainly as a tomb, taking its name from the Mausoleum of Mausolus at [[Halicarnassus]].  [[Stele]] is a term for erect stones that are often what are now called [[gravestone]]s.  [[Ship burial]]s are mostly found in coastal Europe, while [[chariot burial]]s are found widely across [[Eurasia]]. [[Catacombs]], of which the most famous examples are those in [[Catacombs of Rome|Rome]] and [[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Alexandria]], are underground cemeteries connected by tunnelled passages.  A large group of burials with traces remaining above ground can be called a [[necropolis]]; if there are no such visible structures, it is a [[grave field]].  A [[cenotaph]] is a memorial without a burial.&lt;ref&gt;See any well-regarded survey of the [[history of art]] or of [[history of architecture|architecture]], such as ''[[Gardner's Art Through the Ages]]'' or the most recent edition of Sir [[Banister Fletcher]]'s ''A History of Architecture.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "funerary" strictly means "of or pertaining to a [[funeral]] or burial",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|funerary, adj. }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a long tradition in English of applying it not only to the practices and artefacts directly associated with funeral rites, but also to a wider range of more permanent memorials to the dead. Particularly influential in this regard was [[John Weever]]'s ''Ancient Funerall Monuments'' (1631), the first full-length book to be dedicated to the subject of tomb memorials and [[epitaph]]s. More recently, some scholars have challenged the usage: Phillip Lindley, for example, makes a point of referring to "tomb monuments", saying "I have avoided using the term 'funeral monuments' because [[Effigy#Funeral effigies|funeral effigies]] were, in the Middle Ages, temporary products, made as substitutes for the encoffined corpse for use during the funeral ceremonies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Phillip |last=Lindley |title=Tomb Destruction and scholarship: medieval monuments in early modern England |place=Donington |publisher=Shaun Tyas |year=2007 |isbn= 978-1900289-870|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, have found this distinction "rather pedantic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Cockerham |title=Reformation, reaction, reception: a 21st-century view of monumental destruction |journal=Church Monuments |volume=23 |year=2008 |pages=137–41 (137) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related genres of commemorative art for the dead take many forms, such as the ''[[moai]]'' figures of [[Easter Island]], apparently a type of sculpted [[ancestor portrait]], though hardly individualized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/h/hoa_hakananaia.aspx Hoa Hakananai'a] British Museum, accessed {{Nowrap|26 April}} 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  These are common in cultures as diverse as Ancient Rome and China, in both of which they are kept in the houses of the descendants, rather than being buried.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 47–48, on Ancient Rome. Stewart and Rawski's book is entirely devoted to Chinese ancestor portraits. See Chapter 1 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cultures have [[psychopomp]] figures, such as the Greek [[Hermes]] and Etruscan [[Charun]], who help conduct the spirits of the dead into the afterlife.

==History==

===Pre-history===
{{Main article|Megalith}}
[[File:paulnabrone.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Poulnabrone dolmen]] in Ireland covered at least 22 bodies of the [[Neolithic]] period]]

Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Although the purpose of megalithic structures is not always clear, and of the very oldest, while [[Nevali Cori]] in Turkey contains burials, [[Göbekli Tepe]] appears not to.&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly [[megalith]]ic, the earliest instances date to within a few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the [[Iberian peninsula]] have been dated through [[thermoluminescence]] to c. 4510&amp;nbsp;BCE, and some burials at the [[Carnac stones]] in [[Brittany]] also date back to the fifth millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Mohen, 70&lt;/ref&gt; The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from the earliest, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of [[ancestor-worship]], a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.&lt;ref&gt;Mohen, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] societies, a great variety of tombs are found, with tumulus mounds, megaliths, and pottery as recurrent elements. In Eurasia, a [[dolmen]] is the exposed stone framework for a [[chamber tomb]] originally covered by earth to make a mound which no longer exists.  Stones may be carved with geometric patterns ([[petroglyph]]s), for example [[cup and ring mark]]s.  Group tombs were made, the social context of which is hard to decipher. [[Urn]] burials, where bones are buried in a pottery container, either in a more elaborate tomb, or by themselves, are widespread, by no means restricted to the [[Urnfield culture]] which is named after them, or even to Eurasia.  [[Menhir]]s, or "[[standing stone]]s", seem often to mark graves or serve as memorials,&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer, "Menhir", 348&lt;/ref&gt; while the later [[runestone]]s and [[image stone]]s often are [[cenotaph]]s, or memorials apart from the grave itself; these continue into the Christian period. The [[Senegambian stone circles]] are a later African form of tomb markers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1226 Stone Circles of Senegambia – UNESCO World Heritage Centre], accessed 28 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egypt and Nubia===
{{Main article|Art of ancient Egypt}}
[[File:Egypte louvre 239 masque.jpg|thumb|Egyptian ceramic coffin mask|alt=An oversized, shallow mask depicting a large face. The face is roughly oval-shaped, but the top of the mask is a horizontal line just above the eyebrows, leaving the entire mask roughly triangular. The entire face is flattened, but the bulbous nose protrudes away from the face. The eyes are large and almond shaped, and both the eyes and braided eyebrows are disproportionally large in comparison with the mouth, which has full lips. The front of the face is clean-shaven, but below the chin, there is a long, narrow, pointed, braided false beard that was characteristic of ancient Egyptian royalty.]]

Egyptian funerary art was inseparably connected to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religious belief]] that life continued after death – even more, it expressed a belief that "death is a mere phase of life".&lt;ref&gt;Groenewegen-Frankfort, 80&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic objects and images connected with this belief were partially intended to preserve material goods, wealth and status for the journey between this life and the next,&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 37&lt;/ref&gt; and to "commemorate the life of the tomb owner&amp;nbsp;... depict performance of the burial rites, and in general present an environment that would be conducive to the tomb owner's rebirth."&lt;ref&gt;Kampen&amp;nbsp;et&amp;nbsp;al, 31&lt;/ref&gt; In this context are the Egyptian [[mummy|mummies]] encased in one or more layers of decorated coffin, and the [[canopic jar]]s preserving internal organs. A special category of [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts]] clarify the purposes of the burial customs.  The early [[mastaba]] type of tomb had a sealed underground burial chamber but an offering-chamber on the ground level for visits by the living, a pattern repeated in later types of tomb. A [[Ka statue]] [[effigy]] of the deceased might be walled up in a ''[[serdab]]'' connected to the offering chamber by vents that allowed the smell of [[incense]] to reach the effigy.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, 111–27, with ''serdabs'' 124–25&lt;/ref&gt;   The walls of important tomb-chambers and offering chambers were heavily decorated with [[relief]]s in stone or sometimes wood, or paintings, depicting religious scenes, portraits of the deceased, and at some periods vivid images of everyday life, depicting the afterlife. The chamber decoration usually centred on a "false door", through which only the soul of the deceased could pass, to receive the offerings left by the living.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, 51–55, 66–71, 218–19, and see index for other periods. Tomb styles changed considerably over the course of Egyptian history.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Representation (arts)|Representational art]], such as individual portraiture of the deceased, is found extremely early on and continues into the Roman period in the [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] [[Faiyum mummy portraits|Faiyum funerary portraits]] applied to coffins. However, it is still hotly debated whether there was realistic [[portraiture in Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Spanel, 23&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the life-sized [[reserve head]]s found in burial shafts or tombs of nobles of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth dynasty]] is not well understood; they may have been a discreet method of eliding an edict by [[Khufu]] forbidding nobles from creating statues of themselves, or may have protected the deceased's spirit from harm or magically eliminated any evil in it, or perhaps functioned as alternate containers for the spirit if the body should be harmed in any way.&lt;ref&gt;Atiya and El Shawahy, 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural works such as the massive [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] and two smaller ones built during the [[Old Kingdom]] in the [[Giza Necropolis]] and (much later, from about 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE) the tombs in the [[Valley of the Kings]] were built for royalty and the elite. The [[Theban Necropolis]] was later an important site for [[mortuary temple]]s and mastaba tombs.  The [[Kushite]] kings who conquered Egypt and ruled as pharaohs during the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth dynasty]] were greatly influenced by Egyptian funerary customs, employing mummification, canopic jars and ''[[ushabti]]'' funerary figurines. They also built the [[Nubian pyramids]], which in both size and design more closely resemble the smaller [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth dynasty]] pyramids at Thebes than those of the Old Kingdom near Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, Edwards ''et al'', 688–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Lower-class citizens used common forms of funerary art—including ''[[shabti]]'' figurines (to perform any labor that might be required of the dead person in the afterlife), [[Dung beetle#Scarab in ancient Egypt|models of the scarab beetle]] and [[ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary texts]]—which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;James, 122&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to tombs. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats and even military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===

The man's robe is open, exposing his penis. He holds the hand of the woman.]]

The ancient Greeks did not generally leave elaborate grave goods, except for a [[Charon's obol|coin to pay Charon]], the [[Charon (mythology)|ferryman to Hades]], and pottery; however the ''epitaphios'' or [[Funeral oration (ancient Greece)|funeral oration]]&amp;nbsp;from which the word [[epitaph]] comes&amp;nbsp;was regarded as of great importance, and [[animal sacrifice]]s were made.   Those who could afford them erected stone monuments, which was one of the functions of ''[[kouros]]'' statues in the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic period]] before about 500&amp;nbsp;BCE.  These were not intended as portraits, but during the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic period]], realistic portraiture of the deceased was introduced and family groups were often depicted in [[bas-relief]] on monuments, usually surrounded by an architectural frame.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 212, 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The walls of tomb chambers were often painted in [[fresco]], although few examples have survived in as good condition as the [[Tomb of the Diver]] from southern Italy or the tombs at [[Vergina]] in Macedon.  Almost the only surviving painted portraits in the classical Greek tradition are found in Egypt rather than Greece. The [[Fayum mummy portraits]], from the very end of the classical period, were portrait faces, in a [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] style, attached to mummies.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes and Gahlin, 236&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Greek burials were frequently marked above ground by a large piece of pottery, and remains were also buried in urns.  Pottery continued to be used extensively inside tombs and graves throughout the classical period.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 26 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;  The great majority of surviving [[ancient Greek pottery]] is recovered from tombs; some was apparently items used in life, but much of it was made specifically for placing in tombs, and the balance between the two original purposes is controversial.  The ''[[Larnax (Archaeology)|larnax]]'' is a small coffin or ash-chest, usually of decorated [[terracotta]]. The two-handled ''[[loutrophoros]]'' was primarily associated with weddings, as it was used to carry water for the [[nuptial]] bath. However, it was also placed in the tombs of the unmarried, "presumably to make up in some way for what they had missed in life."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 57&lt;/ref&gt; The one-handled ''[[lekythos]]'' had many household uses, but outside the household, its principal use was the decoration of tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 135&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes of a [[descent to the underworld]] of [[Hades]] were often painted on these, with the dead depicted beside [[Hermes]], Charon or both—though usually only with Charon.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 391&lt;/ref&gt; Small pottery figurines are often found, though it is hard to decide if these were made especially for placement in tombs; in the case of the [[Hellenistic]] [[Tanagra figurines]], this seems probably not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 212–13&lt;/ref&gt; But silverware is more often found around the fringes of the Greek world, as in the royal [[Macedon]]ian tombs of [[Vergina]], or in the neighbouring cultures such as those of [[Thrace]] or the [[Scythians]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 149–50&lt;/ref&gt;

The extension of the Greek world after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] brought peoples with different tomb-making traditions into the [[Hellenistic]] sphere, resulting in new formats for art in Greek styles.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 151–54, and throughout the section on the period&lt;/ref&gt;  A generation before Alexander, Mausolus was a Hellenized [[satrap]] or semi-independent ruler under the [[Persian Empire]], whose enormous tomb (begun 353&amp;nbsp;BCE) was wholly exceptional in the Greek world – together with the Pyramids it was the only tomb to be included in the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].  The exact form of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], which gave the name to the form, is now unclear, and there are several alternative reconstructions that seek to reconcile the archaeological evidence with descriptions in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 126–27. Apart from those at the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] article, there are several from Lethaby's 1908 work [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Turkey/_Periods/Greek/_Texts/LETGKB/Mausoleum*.html here], and one illustrated in Boardman.&lt;/ref&gt;  It had the size and some elements of the design of the [[Greek temple]], but was much more vertical, with a square base and a pyramidal roof.  There were quantities of large sculpture, of which most of the few surviving pieces are now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 126–27&lt;/ref&gt;  Other local rulers adapted the high-relief temple [[frieze]] for very large sarcophagi, starting a tradition which was to exert a great influence on Western art up to 18th-century [[Neo-Classicism]].  The late 4th-century [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] was in fact made for another Hellenized Eastern ruler, one of a number of important sarcophagi found at [[Sidon]] in the modern [[Lebanon]].  The two long sides show Alexander's great victory at the [[Battle of Issus]] and a lion hunt; such violent scenes were common on ostentatious classical sarcophagi from this period onwards, with a particular revival in Roman art of the 2nd century.  More peaceful mythological scenes were popular on smaller sarcophagi, especially of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 172–73, 339–44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etruscans===

There is a marked contrast between the high relief busts of their upper bodies and the very flattened lower bodies and legs. They have almond-shaped eyes and long braided hair, and are smiling widely. The man has a beard that is bobbed. The woman's hands are gesticulating in front of her as if she was holding something that is no longer there, or perhaps gesturing while speaking. The man has his right arm draped around the woman's shoulders in an intimate pose, and his right hand on her shoulder also appears to once have held some item. His left hand rests palm up in the crook of the woman's left elbow.
]]

Objects connected with death, in particular [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] and [[cinerary urn]]s, form the basis of much of current knowledge of the ancient [[Etruscan civilization]] and [[Etruscan art|its art]], which once competed with the [[culture of ancient Rome]], but was eventually absorbed into it.&lt;ref&gt;Holiday, 73&lt;/ref&gt; The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often incorporate a reclining image of the deceased. The reclining figures in some Etruscan funerary art are shown using the ''[[mano cornuta]]'' to protect the grave.&lt;ref&gt;de&amp;nbsp;Grummond 1997, 359&lt;/ref&gt;

The motif of the funerary art of the 7th and 6th centuries&amp;nbsp;BCE was typically a feasting scene, sometimes with dancers and musicians, or athletic competitions. Household bowls, cups, and pitchers are sometimes found in the graves, along with food such as eggs, pomegranates, honey, grapes and olives for use in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;de&amp;nbsp;Grummond 2006, 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de&amp;nbsp;Grummond&amp;nbsp;1997,&amp;nbsp;93&lt;/ref&gt; From the 5th century, the mood changed to more somber and gruesome scenes of parting, where the deceased are shown leaving their loved ones,&lt;ref&gt;Johnston,&amp;nbsp;489&lt;/ref&gt; often surrounded by underworld demons, and psychopomps, such as [[Charun]] or the winged female [[Vanth]]. The underworld figures are sometimes depicted as gesturing impatiently for a human to be taken away.&lt;ref name="D1985"&gt;Davies, 632&lt;/ref&gt; The handshake was another common motif, as the dead took leave of the living.&lt;ref name="D1985" /&gt; This often took place in front of or near a closed double doorway, presumably the portal to the underworld. Evidence in some art, however, suggests that the "handshake took place at the other end of the journey, and represents the dead being greeted in the Underworld".&lt;ref name="D1985" /&gt;

=== Ancient Rome ===

Marble, Roman artwork from the 1st century BC imitating the Greek classical style of the 5th century BC. From [[Rhodes]].]]

The burial customs of the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] were influenced by both of the first significant cultures whose territories they conquered as their state expanded, namely the Greeks of [[Magna Graecia]] and the Etruscans.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Chapter I&lt;/ref&gt;  The original Roman custom was [[cremation]], after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, ash-chest or urn, often in a ''[[columbarium]]''; pre-Roman burials around Rome often used hut-urns—little pottery houses.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 15&lt;/ref&gt;  From about the 2nd century&amp;nbsp;CE, [[inhumation]] (burial of unburnt remains) in sarcophagi, often elaborately carved, became more fashionable for those who could afford it.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;  Greek-style medallion portrait sculptures on a ''stela'', or small mausoleum for the rich, housing either an urn or sarcophagus, were often placed in a location such as a roadside, where it would be very visible to the living and perpetuate the memory of the dead.  Often a couple are shown, signifying a longing for reunion in the afterlife rather than a double burial (see [[married couple funerary reliefs]]).&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Chapter IV; Hall, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In later periods, life-size sculptures of the deceased reclining as though at a meal or social gathering are found, a common Etruscan style.  Family tombs for the grandest late Roman families, like the [[Tomb of the Scipios]], were large mausoleums with facilities for visits by the living, including kitchens and bedrooms.  The [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], built for [[Hadrian]], was later converted into a fortress.  Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 38&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancestor portraits, usually in the form of wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little cupboards,&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 31&amp;nbsp;(illustration)&lt;/ref&gt; although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the ''[[Domus|atrium]]''.  They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Polybius]].  Pliny also describes the custom of having a bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield (''[[clipeus]]''), and having it hung in a temple or other public place.  No examples of either type have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 15, 35, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] there was considerable competition among wealthy Romans for the best locations for tombs, which lined all the approach roads to the city up to the walls, and a variety of exotic and unusual designs sought to catch the attention of the passer-by and so perpetuate the memory of the deceased and increase the prestige of their family.  Examples include the [[Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker]], a [[freedman]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the Mausoleum of [[Caecilia Metella (daughter of Metellus Creticus)|Caecilia Metella]], all built within a few decades of the start of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, 95–105; see also Boardman, 240–41 on Eurysaces' tomb.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, sarcophagi were mostly intended to be set against the wall of the tomb, and only decorated on three sides, in contrast to the free-standing styles of Greece and the Eastern Empire. The relief scenes of Hellenistic art became even more densely crowded in later Roman sarcophagi, as for example in the 2nd-century [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]], and various styles and forms emerged, such as the columnar type with an "architectural background of columns and niches for its figures".&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 339&lt;/ref&gt;  A well-known Early Christian example is the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], used for an important new convert who died in 359. Many sarcophagi from leading centres were exported around the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 339–44; Hall, 78–80&lt;/ref&gt;  The Romans had already developed the expression of religious and philosophical ideas in narrative scenes from [[Greek mythology]], treated [[allegorically]];&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 54–61&lt;/ref&gt; they later transferred this habit to Christian ideas, using  biblical scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 77–82&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===

[[File:Tang Dynasty sancai pottery camel and man.JPG|thumb|[[Tang dynasty tomb figure]], ''[[sancai]]'' glazes, of a [[Bactrian camel]] and its foreign driver]]

Funerary art varied greatly across Chinese history. Tombs of early rulers rival the ancient Egyptians for complexity and value of grave goods, and have been similarly pillaged over the centuries by [[tomb robber]]s.  For a long time, literary references to [[jade burial suit]]s were regarded by scholars as fanciful myths, but a number of examples were excavated in the 20th century, and it is now believed that they were relatively common among early rulers.  Knowledge of pre-dynastic Chinese culture has been expanded by spectacular discoveries at [[Sanxingdui]] and other sites.  Very large tumuli could be erected, and later, mausoleums.  Several special large shapes of [[Shang dynasty]] [[Chinese ritual bronzes|bronze ritual vessels]] were probably made for burial only; large numbers were buried in elite tombs, while other sets remained above ground for the family to use in making offerings in [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration rituals]].  The [[Tomb of Fu Hao]] (c. BCE&amp;nbsp;1200) is one of the few undisturbed royal tombs of the period to have been excavated—most funerary art has appeared on the art market without archaeological context.&lt;ref&gt;See for example  Merriman, 297&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery in 1974 of the [[Terracotta army]] located the tomb of the [[First Qin Emperor]] (died 210&amp;nbsp;BCE), but the main tumulus, of which literary descriptions survive,  has not been excavated.  Remains surviving above ground from several imperial tombs of the [[Han dynasty]] show traditions maintained until the end of imperial rule.  The tomb itself is an "underground palace" beneath a sealed tumulus surrounded by a wall, with several buildings set at some distance away down avenues for the observation of rites of veneration, and the accommodation of both permanent staff and those visiting to perform rites, as well as gateways, towers and other buildings.

[[File:SAM Art Ladder military guardian.jpg|thumb|upright|"Military Guardian", Chinese funerary statue. Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington.]]
[[Tang dynasty tomb figures]], in "three-colour" ''[[sancai]]'' glazes or overglaze paint, show a wide range of servants, entertainers, animals and fierce tomb guardians between about 12 and 120 cm high, and were arranged around the tomb, often in niches along the sloping access path to the underground chamber. 

Chinese imperial tombs are typically  approached by a "[[spirit way|spirit road]]", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A  tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of [[Bixi (mythology)|Bixi]] in the form of a [[tortoise]], is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of "lions" and "[[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]]s"; in later periods they are much more varied.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman and Soper, 57–66; see also [https://books.google.com/books?id=4gNk5HzIIKgC&amp;pg=PA31 the diagram here]&lt;/ref&gt;  A looted tomb with fine paintings is the [[Empress Dowager Wenming tomb]] of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century [[Tang dynasty]] [[Qianling Mausoleum]] group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman and Soper, 155&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[complex of Goguryeo Tombs]], from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern [[Korea]], are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the [[Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties]] has been excavated, in 1956, with such [[Ming tombs#Excavation of Dingling tomb|disastrous results]] for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;Evasdottir, 158–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum]] in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of [[Jiaxiang County]], Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.&lt;ref&gt;Wu Hung, The Wu Liang Shrine: The Ideology of Early Chinese Pictorial Art (Stanford UPP, 1989))&lt;/ref&gt;  The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period.  A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman and Soper, 77–84&lt;/ref&gt;  After the introduction of Buddhism, carved "funerary couches" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman and Soper, 120–21&lt;/ref&gt; During the Han Dynasty, [[Science and technology of the Han Dynasty#Ceramic model buildings|miniature ceramic models]] of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture. Later, during the [[Six Dynasties]], sculptural miniatures depicting buildings, monuments, people and animals adorned the tops of the ''[[hunping]]'' funerary vessels.&lt;ref name=dien&gt;Dien, 214–15&lt;/ref&gt;  The outsides of tombs often featured monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que 闕); an example from 121&amp;nbsp;CE appears to be the earliest surviving Chinese architectural structure standing above ground.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman and Soper, 376 (illustrated)&lt;/ref&gt;  Tombs of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) are often rich in glazed pottery figurines of horses, servants and other subjects, whose forceful and free style is greatly admired today. The tomb art reached its peak in the Song and Jin periods; most spectacular tombs were built by rich commoners.&lt;ref&gt;Jeehee Hong, "Virtual Theater of the Dead: Actor Figurines and Their Stage in Houma Tomb No.1," Artibus Asiae Vol. 71-1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Early burial customs show a strong belief in an afterlife and a spirit path to it that needed facilitating.  Funerals and memorials were also an opportunity to reaffirm such important cultural values as [[filial piety]] and "the honor and respect due to seniors, the duties incumbent on juniors"&lt;ref&gt;Thorp &amp;amp;  Vinograd, 144&lt;/ref&gt; The common Chinese funerary symbol of a woman in the door may represent a "basic male fantasy of an elysian afterlife with no restrictions: in all the doorways of the houses stand available women looking for newcomers to welcome into their chambers"&lt;ref&gt;Goldin, 548&lt;/ref&gt; Han Dynasty inscriptions often describe the filial mourning for their subjects,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 44&lt;/ref&gt; for example text from a funeral [[stele]] for the daughter of a [[scholar-official]] of the dynasty, which described the "hurt and grief" of her two sons:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Murals painted on the walls of the [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|Goguryeo Tombs]] are examples of Korean painting from its [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] era. Although thousands of these tombs have been found, only about 100 have murals.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, ''Preservation of the Koguryo Kingdom Tombs'', 24&lt;/ref&gt; These tombs are often named for the dominating theme of the murals – these include the Tomb of the Dancers, the Tomb of the Hunters, the Tomb of the Four Spirits, and the Tomb of the Wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 64&lt;/ref&gt; Heavenly bodies are a common motif, as are depictions of events from the lives of the royalty and nobles whose bodies had been entombed. The former include the sun, represented as a [[three-legged bird]] inside a wheel,&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, ''Preservation of the Koguryo Kingdom Tombs'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; and the various constellations, including especially the [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four directional constellations]]: the [[Azure Dragon]] of the East, the [[Vermilion Bird]] of the South, the [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]]  of the West, and the [[Black Tortoise]] of the North.&lt;ref&gt;Park 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty]] in [[Korea]], built between 1408 and 1966, reflect a combination of Chinese and Japanese traditions, with a tomb mound, often surrounded by a screen wall of stone blocks, and sometimes with stone animal figures above ground, not unlike the Japanese ''haniwa'' figures (see below).  There is usually one or more T-shaped shrine buildings some distance in front of the tomb, which is set in extensive grounds, usually with a hill behind them, and facing a view towards water and distant hills.  They are still a focus for [[ancestor worship]] rituals.  From the 15th century, they became more simple, while retaining a large landscape setting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1319/ Unesco] Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[File:Caballo Haniwa Guimet 01.JPG|thumb|6th-century Japanese ''[[haniwa]]'' clay figure; these were buried with the dead in the [[Kofun]] period (3rd to 6th centuries CE)]]
The [[Kofun period]] of Japanese history, from the 3rd to 6th centuries CE, is named after ''[[kofun]]'', the often enormous keyhole-shaped Imperial mound-tombs, often on a moated island.  None of these have ever been allowed to be excavated, so their possibly spectacular contents remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 287–89&lt;/ref&gt;   Late examples which have been investigated, such as the [[Kitora Tomb]], had been robbed of most of their contents, but the [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]] retains mural paintings.  Lower down the social scale in the same period, [[terracotta]] ''haniwa'' figures, as much as a metre high, were deposited on top of aristocratic tombs as grave markers, with others left inside, apparently representing possessions such as horses and houses for use in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 24–26, 280–82&lt;/ref&gt;  Both ''kofun'' mounds and ''haniwa'' figures appear to have been discontinued as Buddhism became the dominant Japanese religion.&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 289. See also [[List of National Treasures of Japan (archaeological materials)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Japanese tombs have been typically marked by elegant but simple rectangular vertical gravestones with inscriptions.  Funerals are one of the areas in Japanese life where Buddhist customs are followed even by those who followed other traditions, such as [[Shinto]].  The ''[[bodaiji]]'' is a special and very common type of temple whose main purpose is as a venue for rites of ancestor worship, though it is often not the actual burial site.  This was originally a custom of the feudal lords, but was adopted by other classes from about the 16th century. Each family would use a particular ''bodaiji'' over generations, and it might contain a second "grave" if the actual burial were elsewhere.  Many later emperors, from the 13th to 19th centuries, are buried simply at the Imperial ''bodaiji'', the [[Tsuki no wa no misasagi]] mausoleum in the [[Sennyū-ji]] temple at [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, John Whitney, 381–86&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===

They surround one musician in the centre of the ring, and a second musician stands behind them.]]
Unlike many Western cultures, that of [[Mesoamerica]] is generally lacking in [[sarcophagi]], with a few notable exceptions such as that of [[Pacal the Great]] or the now-lost sarcophagus from the [[Olmec]] site of [[La Venta]].  Instead, most Mesoamerican funerary art takes the form of grave goods and, in [[Oaxaca]], [[funerary urn]]s holding the ashes of the deceased. Two well-known examples of Mesoamerican grave goods are those from [[Jaina Island]], a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site off the coast of [[Campeche]], and those associated with the [[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition]].&lt;!-- read the FAC before putting a {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} tag here --&gt;  The tombs of Mayan rulers can only normally be identified by inferences drawn from the lavishness of the grave goods and, with the possible exception of vessels made from stone rather than pottery, these appear to contain no objects specially made for the burial.&lt;ref&gt;Chase and Chase, Chapter 3, especially p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Funerary Mask, 300 B.C.E.-1.,64.94.jpg|thumb|Funerary Mask, c. 300 BC, painted ceramic]]
The Jaina Island graves are noted for their abundance of clay figurines.  Human remains within the roughly 1,000 excavated graves on the island (out of 20,000 total)&lt;ref&gt;Muren.&lt;/ref&gt; were found to be accompanied by glassware, slateware, or pottery, as well as one or more ceramic figurines, usually resting on the occupant's chest or held in their hands.  The function of these figurines is not known: due to gender and age mismatches, they are unlikely to be portraits of the grave occupants, although the later figurines are known to be representations of goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called shaft tomb tradition of western Mexico is known almost exclusively from grave goods, which include hollow ceramic figures, obsidian and shell jewelry, pottery, and other items (see [https://www.flickr.com/photos/petwerewolf/85154232/ this Flickr photo] for a reconstruction).  Of particular note are the various ceramic tableaux including village scenes, for example, players engaged in a [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].  Although these tableaux may merely depict village life, it has been proposed that they instead (or also) depict the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;See Taylor for discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic dogs are also widely known from looted tombs, and are thought by some to represent [[psychopomp]]s (soul guides),&lt;ref&gt;Coe et al., 103–104, or Mason, 182. In Richardson, 48–49 ("The dog, among the Maya, was considered to be connected with death, and to be the messenger to prepare the way to the hereafter.")&lt;/ref&gt; although dogs were often the major source of protein in ancient Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, 45 ("The only domestic animals were dogs—the principal source of meat for much of Preclassic Mesoamerica—and turkeys—understandably rare because that familiar bird consumes very large quantities of corn and is thus expensive to raise".)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Funerary Urn from Oaxaca.jpg|right|thumb|A funerary urn in the shape of a "bat god" or a jaguar, from Oaxaca, dated to AD&amp;nbsp;300–650.&lt;ref&gt;Height: 9.5&amp;nbsp;in (23&amp;nbsp;cm). "The Bat God was one of the important deities of the Maya, many elements of whose religion were shared also by the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]]. The Bat God in particular is known to have been revered also by the Zapotec&amp;nbsp;... He was especially associated&amp;nbsp;... with the underworld." Mason, 182.

It squats on four legs each with four clawed toes, with a perfectly round belly.]]
The [[Zapotec civilization]] of Oaxaca is particularly known for its clay funerary urns, such as the "bat god" shown at right.  Numerous types of urns have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, 163&lt;/ref&gt; While some show deities and other supernatural beings, others seem to be portraits.  Art historian [[George Kubler]] is particularly enthusiastic about the craftsmanship of this tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No other American potters ever explored so completely the plastic conditions of wet clay or retained its forms so completely after firing&amp;nbsp;... [they] used its wet and ductile nature for fundamental geometric modelling and cut the material, when half-dry, into smooth planes with sharp edges of an unmatched brilliance and suggestiveness of form.&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Maya [[Naj Tunich]] cave tombs and other sites contain paintings, carved stelae, and grave goods in pottery, [[jade]] and metal, including [[death mask]]s. In dry areas, many ancient textiles have been found in graves from South America's [[Paracas culture]], which wrapped its mummies tightly in several layers of elaborately patterned cloth.  Elite [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] graves, containing especially fine pottery, were incorporated into large [[adobe]] structures also used for [[human sacrifice]]s, such as the [[Huaca de la Luna]].  [[Cultural periods of Peru|Andean cultures]] such as the [[Sican Culture|Sican]] often practiced mummification and left grave goods in precious metals with jewels, including [[tumi]] ritual knives and gold funerary masks, as well as pottery.

The Mimbres of the [[Mogollon culture]] buried their dead with bowls on top of their heads and ceremonially "killed" each bowl with a small hole in the centre so that the deceased's spirit could rise to another world. Mimbres [[Mogollon culture#Mimbres pottery|funerary bowls]] show scenes of hunting, gambling, planting crops, fishing, sexual acts and births.&lt;ref&gt;Giammattei  and Reichert, 3. Cited in the Introduction to ''The Mimbres of the Mogollon culture: A people of mystery'' by Andrew Gulliford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Wooden grave-markers topped by animals have survived in small numbers from various locations from Florida to the Pacific North-West.--&gt;

Some of the [[Mound builder (people)|North American mounds]], such as [[Grave Creek Mound]] (c. 250–150&amp;nbsp;BCE) in [[West Virginia]], functioned as burial sites, while others had different purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvculture.org/history/mounds.html Mounds &amp; Mound Builders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623005836/http://www.wvculture.org/history/mounds.html |date=23 June 2008 }} Accessed 25 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional societies==

There is an enormous diversity of funeral art from traditional societies across the world, much of it in perishable materials, and some is mentioned elsewhere in the article.  In traditional African societies, [[African traditional masks|masks]] often have a specific association with death, and some types may be worn mainly or exclusively for funeral ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qmvR2YVCtLEC&amp;pg=PA133 Masks in West African Traditional Societies], Bonnefoy, pp. 133–37&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral ceremonies of the [[Indigenous Australians]] typically feature [[body painting]]; the [[Yolngu]] and [[Tiwi people|Tiwi]] people create carved ''[[pukumani]]'' burial poles from [[ironwood]] trunks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3622670/Viewfinder-Aboriginal-burial-poles.html|title=Viewfinder: Aboriginal burial poles|last=Davies|first=Serena|date=23 August 2004|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while elaborately carved [[burial tree]]s have been used in south-eastern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Oxenham.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Toraja]] people of central [[Sulawesi]] are famous for [[Toraja#Funeral rites|their burial practices]], which include the setting-up of effigies of the dead on cliffs.  The 19th- and 20th-century royal [[Kasubi Tombs]] in [[Uganda]], destroyed by fire in 2010, were a circular compound of thatched buildings similar to those inhabited by the earlier [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]]s when alive, but with special characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kasubitombs.org/en/description/index.php Kasubi tombs website]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop.jpg|right|thumb|Custom coffins displayed at the [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop]] in [[Teshie]]]]

==Funerary art and religion==

===Hinduism===
[[Cremation]] is traditional among Hindus, who also believe in [[reincarnation]], and there is far less of a tradition of funerary monuments in Hinduism than in other major religions.&lt;ref&gt;Groseclose, 23&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are regional, and relatively recent, traditions among royalty, and the ''samādhi mandir'' is a memorial temple for a saint.  Both may be influenced by Islamic practices.  The mausoleums of the kings of [[Orchha]], from the 16th century onwards, are among the best known. Other rulers were commemorated by memorial temples of the normal type for the time and place, which like similar buildings from other cultures fall outside the scope of this article, though [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]], the most spectacular of all, must be mentioned.

===Buddhism===
Buddhist tombs themselves are typically simple and modest, although they may be set within temples, sometimes large complexes, built for the purpose in the then-prevailing style.  According to tradition, the remains of the [[Buddha]]'s body after [[cremation]] were entirely divided up into relics (''[[cetiya]]''), which played an important part in early Buddhism.  The ''[[stupa]]'' developed as a monument enclosing deposits of relics of the Buddha from plain hemispherical mounds in the 3rd century BCE to elaborate structures such as those at [[Sanchi]] in India and [[Borobudur]] in [[Java]].  Regional variants such as the [[pagoda]] of China and Japan and the [[candi of Indonesia]] evolved from the Indian form.  However, none of these can strictly be called tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Le Phuoc, 140–42; 147–56 on Sanchi; 192–204, especially 196, on ''candi'' in Indonesia, and Borodudur (196–204)&lt;/ref&gt; Some important [[Tibet]]an [[lama]]s are buried in relatively small ''chortens'' (Tibetan stupas), sometimes of precious metal, inside or outside monasteries, sometimes after mummification. There are examples at [[Kursha Monastery]] in [[Zanskar]] and [[Tashiding Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], as well as the [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]] and many other monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Dowman, 54–55 for the Potala, and see index for other locations.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, most chortens do not function as tombs.

=== Christianity ===

The [[Catacombs of Rome]] contain most of the surviving [[Christian art]] of the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] period, mainly in the form of [[fresco]]s and [[Early Christian sarcophagi|sculpted sarcophagi]]. They show a Christian [[iconography]] emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs.  Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the [[Chi Rho]] monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, Chapter 1; Hall, 77–82&lt;/ref&gt; The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously [[St Peter's, Rome]]) over the burial places of [[martyr]]s who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 39, 72–90&lt;/ref&gt; The beliefs of many cultures, including [[Tumah|Judaism]] and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead [[Ritual purification|ritually impure]] and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture).&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 48–49. An exception in the Classical World were the [[Lycia]]ns of [[Anatolia]]. There are also the Egyptian mortuary-temples, where the object of worship was the deified royal person entombed, but Egyptian temples to the major gods contained no burials. For an extreme example, see [[Prohibition of death#In antiquity|ancient Delos]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Venezia - Chiesa dei SS. Giovanni e Paolo (S. Zanipolo) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 2 lug 2006 - 08.jpg|thumb|upright|Medieval and Renaissance wall tombs in [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]], including an [[equestrian statue]] at the left]]

Christians believed in a bodily [[resurrection of the dead]] at the [[Second Coming of Christ]], and the Catholic Church only relaxed [[Cremation#Roman Catholicism|its opposition to cremation]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;It was allowed in times of plague however. See [[Cremation in the Christian World]] for more details—the [[Orthodox church]]s still forbid cremation.&lt;/ref&gt; Although mass [[ossuaries]] have also been used, burial has always been the preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a [[crypt]] or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the [[shrine]]s of saints, which became the destinations of [[pilgrimage]]s. The monument to [[Maximilian&amp;nbsp;I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in the [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck]] took decades to complete,&lt;ref&gt;Board of Trustees for The Hofkirche in Innsbruck.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Arca di San Domenico|tomb of Saint Dominic]] in [[Bologna]] took several centuries to reach its final form.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

If only because its strong prejudice against free-standing and life-size sculpture, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] could not have developed the tomb monument in the same way as the Western Church, and the burials of rich or important individuals continued the classical tradition of sarcophagi carved in relief, with the richness of the carving tending to diminish over the centuries, until just simple religious symbols were left.  [[Constantine&amp;nbsp;I]] and most later [[Byzantine Emperor]]s up to 1028 were buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople, which was destroyed after the [[fall of Constantinople]] of 1453.  Some massive but mostly plain [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] sarcophagi from the church are now placed outside the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;Downey.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII]] in [[Florence]] is a grand [[Early Renaissance]] wall tomb by [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]]; although classical in style, it reflects the somewhat inharmonious stacking up of different elements typical of major Gothic tombs.  It has a life-size effigy, also known as a [[gisant]], lying on the sarcophagus, which was common from the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period through to the [[Baroque]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Levey 1967, 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruling dynasties were often buried together, usually in monasteries; the [[Chartreuse de Champmol]] was founded for that purpose by the [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]] in 1383.  The [[Scaliger tombs]] in [[Verona]] are magnificent free-standing [[Gothic art|Gothic]] canopied tombs—they are outside the church in a special enclosure, and so are unrestricted in height.&lt;ref&gt;Though they are exceeded in scale by [[Gothic revival]] monuments like the [[Albert Memorial]] and the [[Scott Monument]], neither containing a tomb.&lt;/ref&gt; Important churches like Saint Peter's in Rome, [[Saint Paul's Cathedral, London]], [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]] (twenty-five [[Doge]]s), and the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]] contain large numbers of impressive monuments to the great and the good, created by the finest architects and sculptors available.  Local [[parish church]]es are also often full of monuments, which may include large and artistically significant ones for local landowners and notables.  Often a prominent family would add a special chapel for their use, including their tombs; in Catholic countries, [[mass bequest|bequests would pay for masses]] to be said in perpetuity for their souls.  By the [[High Renaissance]], led by [[Michelangelo]]'s tombs, the effigies are often sitting up, and later may stand.  Often they turn towards the altar, or are kneeling facing it in profile.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 325&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MULO-Philippe Gueldre Death Mirror.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"The Mirror of Death": Detail from a French [[Renaissance]] monument of 1547|alt=Close-up of a rectangular-shaped carving in stone. In the centre of the rectangle is a circle representing a mirror, and within the circle is a grinning skull. The circle is framed by ram's horns.]]
In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the [[Black Death]] and devotional writers, explicit ''[[memento mori]]'' imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the ''[[transi]]'' tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the [[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]] and works like the ''[[Ars moriendi]]'', or "Art of Dying".&lt;ref&gt;Cohen throughout, see Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;  It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of [[Pope Urban&amp;nbsp;VIII]] by [[Bernini]] (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 324–26&lt;/ref&gt;  As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in [[ossuaries]] where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the [[Capuchin Crypt]] in Rome or the Czech [[Sedlec Ossuary]], which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones.

The church struggled to eliminate the pagan habits of leaving grave goods except for the clothing and usual jewellry of the powerful, especially rings.  Kings might be buried with a [[sceptre]], and bishops with a [[crozier]], their respective symbols of office.&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier and Mane, 112–13&lt;/ref&gt;  The 7th-century [[Stonyhurst Gospel]], with a unique [[Insular art|Insular]] original leather binding, was recovered from [[St Cuthbert's coffin]], itself a significant object; it was probably Cuthbert's personal copy, which he had very likely scribed himself.&lt;ref&gt;Bloxham, Jim and Rose, Krisine; [http://www.gbwny.org/news/2007/11/st-cuthbert-gospel-of-st-john-formerly-known-as-the-stonyhurst-gospel/ ''St. Cuthbert Gospel of St. John, Formerly Known as the Stonyhurst Gospel''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726074901/http://www.gbwny.org/news/2007/11/st-cuthbert-gospel-of-st-john-formerly-known-as-the-stonyhurst-gospel/ |date=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The armour and sword of a knight might be hung over his tomb, as those of [[Edward the Black Prince|the Black Prince]] still are in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The Early Christian Church, to the frustration of historians of costume, encouraged burial in a plain white [[winding-sheet]], as being all that would be required at the Second Coming.  For centuries, most except royalty followed this custom, which at least kept clothing, which was very expensive for rich and poor alike, available for the use of the living.  The use of a rich cloth [[Pall (funeral)|pall]] to cover the coffin during the funeral grew during the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only later black.  They were usually then given to the Church to use for [[vestment]]s or other decorations.&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier and Mane, 34–35; 112–13&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 13th century to the 16th, a popular form of monument north of the Alps, especially for the smaller landowner and merchant classes, was the [[monumental brass]], a sheet of brass on which the image of the person or persons commemorated was engraved, often with inscriptions and an architectural surround.  They could be on the floor or wall inside a church. These provide valuable evidence as to changes in costume, especially for women.  Many bishops and even some German rulers were commemorated with brasses.&lt;ref&gt;"Brasses, Monumental"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompe funebre for Katarzyna Opalińska.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Castrum doloris]]'' for Queen [[Katarzyna Opalińska]] of Poland, erected in [[Notre Dame de Paris]] in 1747]]
The ''[[castrum doloris]]'' was a temporary [[catafalque]] erected around the coffin for the [[lying in state]] of important people, usually in a church, the funerary version of the elaborate temporary decorations for other court festivities, like [[royal entries]].  These began in the late Middle Ages, but reached their height of elaboration in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;The corpse was in fact not always present. Bagliani, 158–59&lt;/ref&gt; A particular feature in Poland was the [[coffin portrait]], a bust-length painted portrait of the deceased, attached to the coffin, but removed before burial and often then hung in the church.  Elsewhere, death masks were used in similar fashion. [[Funerary hatchment|Hatchment]]s were a special lozenge-shaped painted [[coat of arms]] which was displayed on the house of the deceased for a mourning period, before usually being moved to hang in the church.  Like [[mourning|mourning clothes]], these fall outside a strict definition of art.&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier and Mane, 113 for the origins of mourning clothes.&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time after the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[English church monuments]] formed the majority of large-scale artworks added to Protestant churches, especially in sculpture.  The English upper classes ceased to commission altarpieces and other religious art for churches, but their tomb monuments continued to grow in size to fill the empty wall spaces; similar trends were seen in [[Lutheran]] countries, but [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] tended to be more disapproving of figure sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Michalski, xi. Here Michalski refers to this rejection of religious imagery within Calvinism as "iconophobia". See also Gäbler, 72, 76–77 and Potter, 130–31 regarding the religious disputations in Zürich (1523) concerning (among other things) the removal of statues of saints and other icons. Participants included [[Leo Jud]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many portraits were painted after death, and sometimes dead family members were included along with the living; a variety of indications might be used to suggest the distinction.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=3821 ''Saltonstall Family''] is a well-known example. The [[Arnolfini Portrait]] has been claimed to be such a work&lt;/ref&gt;

The large [[Baroque]] tomb monument continued likely to include a portrait of the deceased, and was more likely to include personified figures of Death, Time, Virtues or other figures than angels.  The late medieval [[transi]] tomb vocabulary of images of bodily decay, such as skulls and skeletons, was sometimes re-introduced, but in a less confrontational manner.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 324–27&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neo-Classicism]], led by [[Antonio Canova]], revived the classical ''stela'', either with a portrait or a personification; in this style there was little or no difference between the demands of Catholic and Protestant patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 347–49; Berresford, 36–38&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, many [[Old World]] churchyards and church walls had completely run out of room for new monuments, and cemeteries on the outskirts of cities, towns or villages became the usual place for burials.&lt;ref&gt;"Cemetery"&lt;/ref&gt;  The rich developed the classical styles of the ancient world for small family tombs, while the rest continued to use gravestones or what were now usually false sarcophagi, placed over a buried coffin.  The cemeteries of the large Italian cities are generally accepted to have outdone those of other nations in terms of extravagant statuary, especially the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]] in [[Genoa]], the [[Cimitero Monumentale di Milano]] and the [[Certosa di Bologna]].&lt;ref&gt;Berresford, throughout, and Prefaces&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italy at least, funerary sculpture remained of equal status to other types during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was made by the leading artists, often receiving reviews in the press, and being exhibited, perhaps in [[maquette]] form.&lt;ref&gt;Berresford, 13, and 58 on exhibitions&lt;/ref&gt;  Monuments kept up with contemporary stylistic developments during the 19th century, embracing [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] enthusiastically, but then gradually became detached from the [[avant-garde]] after [[Art Nouveau]] and a few [[Art Deco]] examples.&lt;ref&gt;Berresford, 77–78 on "Liberty" (Italian term for "Art Nouveau") and 99–104 on Art Deco.&lt;/ref&gt;  Where burials in church crypts or floors took place, memorial [[stained glass]] windows, mostly on normal religious subjects but with a commemorative panel, are often found.  [[War memorial]]s, other than on the site of a battle, were relatively unusual until the 19th century, but became increasingly common during it, and after [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] were erected even in villages of the main combatant nations.&lt;ref&gt;Mosse, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
Islamic funerary art is dominated by architecture.  Grave goods are discouraged to the point that their absence is frequently one recognition criterion of Muslim burials.&lt;ref&gt;Insoll, 172&lt;/ref&gt; Royalty and important religious figures were typically buried in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a religious inscription.  However, funerary architecture often offered a means of "moving beyond the strictures of formal Muslim burial rites" and expressing social dimensions such as status, piety, love for the deceased, and Muslim identity.&lt;ref&gt;Insoll, 177–80&lt;/ref&gt; A number of distinct architectural traditions arose for expressing these social elements.  The Islamic tradition was slow in starting; the ''[[hadith]]'' "condemn the building of tombs, and [[Muhammad]] himself set the example of requesting burial in an unmarked grave in one of the chambers of his house" in [[Medina]],&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, 103&lt;/ref&gt; though by at least the 12th century, buildings of the vast [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] complex already marked the site.  The earliest identified Muslim monumental tomb, in [[Samarra]] in Iraq, only dates from 862, and was commissioned by the Byzantine princess whose son was buried there.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;  At some point, the tradition incorporated the idea of a garden setting, perhaps following the Islamic concept of [[Paradise]], an association certainly made when the tradition was mature, although the difficulty of reconstructing gardens from archaeology makes the early stages of this process hard to trace.  At any rate, gardens surrounding tombs became established in Islamic tradition in many parts of the world, and existing pleasure gardens were sometimes appropriated for this purpose.  Versions of the formal Persian ''[[charbagh]]'' design were widely used in India, Persia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence may have been the octagonal [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], not a mausoleum itself, but "the earliest Islamic model for centrally planned commemorative buildings", adapting the Byzantine form of the martyrium in a building standing alone, though on a stone platform rather than in a garden.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Persianate society|Persian sphere]], a tradition of relatively small mausoleums evolved, often in the shape of short hexagonal or octagonal [[dome]]d towers, usually containing a single chamber, like the [[Malek Tomb]].  These single-chambered tombs developed into larger buildings in the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires,&lt;ref name="Insoll, 177"&gt;Insoll, 177&lt;/ref&gt; like the [[Gur-e Amir]] tomb of [[Timur]] at [[Samarkand]] and the famous Mughal tombs of India, which culminated in the [[Taj Mahal]]. The Mughal tombs are mostly set in a large walled ''charbagh'' (''chahar-bagh'') or [[Mughal gardens]], often with [[pavilion]]s at the corners&lt;ref name="Insoll, 177"/&gt; and a gatehouse. The Taj Mahal is atypically placed at the end of the garden, backing onto the river [[Yamuna]]; a central placing is usual.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, 112 and 122. Her Chapter 10 includes a detailed description of the Taj with special reference to its gardens.&lt;/ref&gt;  They may have [[minaret]]s, although they do not normally function as mosques.  The [[Tomb of Jahangir]] lacks any dome,&lt;ref&gt;An interesting contrast with the Taj Mahal, given they were both built by [[Shah Jahan]].&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Tomb of Akbar the Great]] has only small decorative ones.  Other Islamic Indian rulers built similar tombs, such as [[Gol Gumbaz]].

In all this tradition, the contemporary architectural style for mosques was adapted for a building with a smaller main room, and usually no courtyard.  Decoration was often tilework, and could include ''[[pietra dura|parchin kari]]'' inlays in semi-precious stone, painting, and decorative carving.  No animals would be represented, but geometric patterns and written inscriptions were common.  The sarcophagus might be in a small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room.  Money would be bequeathed to pay for continuous readings of the [[Qur'an]] in the mausoleum, and they were normally open for visitors to pay their respects. The [[Mausoleum of Khomeini]], still under construction in a [[Tehran]] cemetery, and intended to be the centre of a huge complex, continues these traditions.&lt;ref name="NYT K"&gt;The New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/08/world/khomeini-s-tomb-attracts-pilgrims.html ''Khomeini's Tomb Attracts Pilgrims''], Philip Shenon, Published: 8 July 1990, accessed 25 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition evolved differently in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] world, where smaller single-roomed ''[[türbe]]'' typically stand on the grounds of mosque complexes, often built by the deceased.  The sarcophagi (often purely symbolic, as the body is below the floor) may be draped in a rich pall, and surmounted by a real cloth or stone [[turban]], which is also traditional at the top of ordinary [[Turkish people|Turkish]] gravestones (usually in stylised form). Two of the most famous are in the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]]; the [[Yeşil Türbe]] ("Green Tomb") of 1421 is an unusually large example in [[Bursa]], and also unusual in having extensive tile work on the exterior, which is usually masonry, whereas the interiors are often decorated with brightly colored tiles.&lt;ref&gt;Levey 1975, 29–33 on Bursa, 83–84 on Istanbul; all the leading Ottoman tombs are covered in the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parts of the Islamic world reflected local techniques and traditions.  The 15th-century royal [[Tomb of Askia]] in [[Mali]] used the local technique of mud-building to erect a 17 metre high pyramidal tomb set in a mosque complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1139 Tomb of Askia], [[UNESCO]] page with aerial view.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the other end of the Islamic world, [[Java]]nese royalty are mostly buried in royal graveyards such as those at [[Kota Gede]] and [[Imogiri]].

In the Arab world, mausoleums of rulers are more likely to be a side-room inside a mosque or form part of a larger complex containing perhaps a hospital, ''[[madrasah]]'' or library. Large domes, elaborately decorated inside, are common.  The tomb-mosque of Sultan [[Qaitbay]] (died 1496) is a famous example, one of many in [[Cairo]], though here the tomb chamber is unusually large compared to the whole.&lt;ref&gt;See Fletcher and Cruickshank, 596. The [[madrassa]] is labeled "the ultimate achievement of architectural development in Cairo" and its tomb chamber described as "immense."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern period==
[[File:Rachel whitereadwien holocaust mahnmal wien judenplatz.jpg|thumb|The [[Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial]] to the 65,000 Austrian Jews killed in the [[Holocaust]], designed by [[Rachel Whiteread]] and completed in 2000]]
Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect [[modernism]] or other recent styles.  Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially [[war memorials]], and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], and several [[Holocaust memorials]], such as [[Yad Vashem]] in Jerusalem, the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup#Memorials and monuments – Paris|Vel d'Hiv Memorial]] in Paris (1994), the [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]] in Berlin (2004), and the [[Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial]] in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War&amp;nbsp;I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Mosse, 103–106 on conservatism, and generally throughout Chapter 5 on war memorials.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated [[Neue Wache]] in Berlin &lt;ref&gt;Mosse, 97–98; Carrier, 201&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in Tokyo, which is [[Controversies surrounding Yasukuni Shrine|internationally controversial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1399087/japan-wants-talks-china-korea-yasukuni-shrine "Japan wants talks with China, Korea on Yasukuni Shrine"], [[Associated Press]] story, [[South China Morning Post]] website, 6 January 2014, accessed 4 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to [[genocide]], at least on the Western side of the [[Iron Curtain]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, 19–22; Benton throughout, especially p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eastern Bloc|Communist East]] the established style of [[Socialist Realism]] was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Benton throughout, especially Chapter 1 on Soviet War Memorials (pp. 12–13 on Socialist Realism), but also noting deviations in the Warsaw Pact satellites, as on p. 194, and Chapter 7 on West Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; The generation of abstracted and [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] war and [[Holocaust]] memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, throughout, especially Chapter 8.  See also the copious literature on the Washington Vietnam Veterans Memorial.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] and those for [[Anıtkabir|Atatürk]], [[Mazar-e-Quaid|Jinnah]], [[Kumsusan Memorial Palace|Kim Il-Sung]], [[Mausoleo Che Guevara|Che Guevara]] and several [[Presidential memorials in the United States]], although the actual burials of recent presidents are very simple, with their [[Presidential library]] and museum now usually their largest commemorative memorial.  The Mausoleum of Khomeini is a grand mosque complex, as large as any medieval example, not least because it includes a 20,000 place parking lot.&lt;ref name="NYT K"/&gt;

'''Haukur Halldórsson''' (The Hawk) (born 1937 in Reykjavík) is an [[Iceland]]ic artist and member of the [[Íslenska Ásatrúarfélagið]].

His first exhibition was in Gallery Djupið in [[Reykjavík]] in 1978 with [[Einar Þorsteinn Ásgeirsson]], His first solo exhibition was in [[Reykjavík]] in 1980 in Gallery Torg run by the composer [[Jóhann G. Jóhannson]]. Since then he has made numerous exhipbitons in Europe, China and in the USA. He works in various media, painting, sculpture, jewel making and explores most any media.

== Themes ==

Halldorsson explored for a long time the theme of folklore of his  home country Iceland, the [[Brothers Grimm]], [[Celtic mythology]] and [[Nordic mythology]] in his art practice. He has made numerous drawings an illustrations on the subjects. Halldórsson has traveled widely to examine art, to [[China]], various countries in [[Europe]], and the [[United States]]. In [[New Mexico]] he encountered  the [[Navajo people|Navajo Indians]], and observed the art of sand-casting which he later applied in his own art practice.

His current practice evolves around the North-European mythology and Nordic mythology.
His website presents his version of the Viking myth of [[Asgard]], [[Yggdrasil|Yggdrasil, The Tree of Live]] and the bewitching underworld.

His selection of works from 1989 until 2001 combines disparate elements from the worlds of fantasy, myth and everyday experience.
His paintings often contain mysterious magical characters, fire-spewing primeval titans, sections of peculiar structures, living skulls, Viking ships in strange surroundings etc. &lt;!-- Other works present rearing horses or reclining nudes obviously based on classical models removed to an anomalous environments.

'''Skull symbolism''' is the attachment of [[symbol]]ic meaning to the [[human skull]]. The most common symbolic use of the skull is as a representation of death and mortality.

Humans can often recognize the buried fragments of an only partially revealed [[Human skull|cranium]] even when other bones may look like shards of stone.  The human brain has a specific region for recognizing faces,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangor.ac.uk/news/BrainArea.htm (University of Wales, Bangor) "New function identified for an area of the brain"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206061817/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/news/BrainArea.htm |date=December 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is so attuned to finding them that it can see faces in a few [[Smiley|dots and lines]] or [[Emoticon|punctuation marks]]; the human brain cannot separate the image of the human skull from the familiar human face. Because of this, both the death and the now past life of the skull are symbolized.

Moreover, a human skull with its large eye sockets displays a degree of [[neoteny]], which humans often find [[cuteness|visually appealing]]—yet a skull is also obviously [[death|dead]]. As such, human skulls often have a greater visual appeal than the other bones of the [[human skeleton]], and can fascinate even as they repel. Our present society predominantly associates skulls with death and evil. However, to some ancient societies it is believed to have had the opposite association, where objects like crystal skulls represent "life": the honoring of humanity in the flesh and the embodiment of consciousness.

[[Unicode]] reserves character U+1F480 (💀) for a human skull [[pictogram]].

==Examples==

The skull that is often engraved or carved on the head of early [[New England]] tombstones might be merely a symbol of mortality, but the skull is also often backed by an angelic pair of wings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prairieghosts.com/grave_symbols.html Tony Taylor, "The Mystery of Graveyard Art &amp; Symbols"]&lt;/ref&gt; lofting mortality beyond its own death.
[[Image:Allisvanity.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=lady at round mirror and dressing table resembling a skull "All is Vanity" by C. Allan Gilbert|''All is Vanity'' by [[C. Allan Gilbert]], 1873-1929]]
One of the best-known examples of skull symbolism occurs in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', where the title character recognizes the skull of an old friend: "Alas, poor [[Yorick]]! I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest. . ." Hamlet is inspired to utter a bitter soliloquy of despair and rough ironic humor.

Compare Hamlet's words "Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft" to [[Talmudic]] sources: "...Rabi Ishmael [the High Priest]... put [the severed head of a martyr] in his lap... and cried: oh sacred mouth!...who buried you in ashes...!". The skull was a symbol of [[Melancholia|melancholy]] for Shakespeare's contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s ''[[Melencolia I|Melencolia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Elizabethan]] [[England]], The Death's-Head [[Human skull|Skull]], usually a depiction without the lower jawbone, was emblematic of bawds, rakes, Sexual Adventurers and prostitutes; The term Deaths-Head was actually parlance for these rakes, and most of them wore half-skull rings to advertise their station, either professionally or otherwise. The original Rings were wide silver objects, with a half-skull decoration not much wider than the rest of the band; This allowed it to be rotated around the finger to hide the skull in polite company, and to reposition it in the presence of likely conquests.

[[Image:Calavera.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Sugar skull given for the Day of the Dead, made with chocolate and amaranth from Mexico|Sugar skull given for the Day of the Dead, made with [[chocolate]] and [[amaranth]]]]Skulls and skeletons are the main symbol of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[holiday]], [[Day of the Dead]].

[[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] painters of the 16th century elaborated moral allegories for their patrons, and ''memento mori'' was a common theme. The theme carried by an inscription on a rustic tomb,  "[[Et in Arcadia ego]]"&amp;mdash;"I too [am] in [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]]", if it is Death that is speaking&amp;mdash;is made famous by two paintings by [[Nicholas Poussin]], but the motto made its pictorial debut in [[Guercino]]'s version, 1618-22 (in the [[Galleria Barberini]], Rome): in it, two awestruck young shepherds come upon an inscribed plinth, in which the inscription &lt;small&gt;ET IN ARCADIA EGO&lt;/small&gt; gains force from the prominent presence of a wormy skull in the foreground.

Next to [[Mary Magdalene]]'s dressing-mirror, in a convention of Baroque painting {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, the Skull has quite different connotations and reminds the viewer that the Magdalene has become a symbol for repentance. In [[C. Allan Gilbert]]'s much-reproduced lithograph of a lovely [[Gibson Girl]] seated at her fashionable toilette, an observer can witness its transformation into an alternate image. A ghostly echo of the worldly Magdalene's repentance motif lurks behind this turn-of-the 20th century icon.

The skull becomes an [[icon]] itself when its painted representation becomes a substitute for the real thing. [[Simon Schama]] chronicled the ambivalence of the Dutch to their own worldly success during the [[Dutch Golden Age]] of the first half of the 17th century in ''[[The Embarrassment of Riches]].'' The possibly frivolous and merely decorative nature of the [[still life]] genre was avoided by [[Pieter Claesz]] in his ''[[Vanitas]]'' (illustration, below right): Skull, opened case-watch, overturned emptied wineglasses, snuffed candle, book: "Lo, the wine of life runs out, the spirit is snuffed, oh Man, for all your learning, time yet runs on: Vanity!" The visual cues of the hurry and violence of life are contrasted with [[eternity]] in this somber, still and utterly silent painting.
[[Image:Pieter Claesz 002b.jpg|left|thumb|250px|alt=Skull on table ''Vanitas'', by Pieter Claesz, painted in 1630 from the Mauritzhuis, The Hague|''Vanitas'', by Pieter Claesz, 1630 (Mauritzhuis, The Hague)]]

When the skull appears in Nazi SS insignia, the death's-head (''[[Totenkopf]]'') represents loyalty unto death. However, when [[tattoo]]ed on the forearm its [[apotropaic]] power helps an [[outlaw motorcycle club|outlaw biker]] cheat death.&lt;ref&gt;Margo DeMello, ''Bodies of Inscription: A Cultural History of the Modern Tattoo Community'', (Duke University Press) 2000, ch. "Creation of Meaning" explores the semiotics of modern tattooing.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]] signify "Poison" when they appear on a glass bottle containing a white powder, or any container in general. But it is not the same [[emblem]] when it flies high above the deck as the [[Jolly Roger]]: there the pirate death's-head epitomizes the pirates' ruthlessness and despair; their usage of death imagery might be paralleled with their occupation challenging the natural order of things.&lt;ref&gt;"In Virginia in 1720 one of the six pirates facing the gallows  "called for a Bottle of Wine, and taking a Glass of it, he drank Damnation to the Governour and Confusion to the Colony", which the Rest pledg'd". ([[Marcus Rediker]], "Under the Banner of King Death": The Social World of Anglo-American Pirates, 1716 to 1726" ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, '''38'''.2 (April 1981:203-227) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; "Pirates also affirmed their unity symbolically", Marcus Rediker asserts, remarking the skeleton or skull symbol with bleeding heart and hourglass on the black pirate ensign, and asserting "it triad of interlocking symbols— death, violence, limited time—simultaneously pointed to meaningful parts of the seaman's experience, and eloquently bespoke the pirates' own consciousness of themselves as preyed upon in turn. Pirates seized the symbol of mortality from ship captains who used the skull 'as a marginal sign in their logs to indicate the record of a death'"&lt;ref&gt;Rediker 1981:221, and 223, quoting S. Charles Hill, "Episodes of piracy in Eastern waters", ''Indian Antiquary'' '''49''' (1920:37).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ECB Hazard Symbol T.svg|ECB Hazard Symbol T|left|thumb|173px|Today, humans typically note the skull and crossbones sign as the almost universal symbol for [[toxicity]].]]

[[Image:Fra Angelico 090.jpg|thumb|alt=The skull of Adam at the foot of the Cross: detail from a ''Crucifixion'' by Fra Angelico, from 1435|The skull of Adam at the foot of the [[Cross]]: detail from a ''Crucifixion''  by [[Fra Angelico]], 1435]]
When a skull was worn as a trophy on the belt of the Lombard king [[Alboin]], it was a constant grim triumph over his old enemy, and he drank from it. In the same way a skull is a warning when it decorates the palisade of a city, or deteriorates on a pike at a [[Tower of London|Traitor's Gate]]. The [[Skull Tower]], with the embedded skulls of Serbian rebels, was built in 1809 on the highway near [[Niš]], Serbia, as a stark political warning from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government.  In this case the skulls ''are'' the statement:  that the current owner had the power to kill the former. "Drinking out of a skull the blood of slain (sacrificial) enemies is mentioned by [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] and [[Livy]],&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch is referring to Livy xxiii.24, of events of 216 BCE: "Postumius died there fighting with all his might not to be captured alive. The Gauls stripped him of all his spoils and the [[Boii]] took his severed head in a procession to the holiest of their temples.There it was cleaned and the bare skull was adorned with gold, as is their custom. It was used thereafter as a sacred vessel on special occasions and as a ritual drinking-cup by their priests and temple officials."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Solinus]] describes the Irish custom of bathing the face in the blood of the slain and drinking it."&lt;ref&gt;J.A. MacCulloch, ''The Religion of the Ancient Celts'' 1911:239f.&lt;/ref&gt; The rafters of a traditional [[Jívaro]] medicine house in Peru,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.head-hunter.com/account.html F.W. Up De Graff. ''Head hunters of the Amazon: Seven Years of Exploration and Adventure'', New York: Garden City 1925 p. 273-283]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321230147/http://www.head-hunter.com/account.html |date=March 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in New Guinea. The temple of [[Kali]] is veneered with skulls, but the goddess Kali offers life through the welter of blood. The late medieval and Early Renaissance Northern and Italian painters place the skull where it lies at the foot of the [[Cross]] at [[Golgotha]] ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for ''the place of the skull''). But for them it has become quite specifically the skull of [[Adam]].

The [[Serpent (symbolism)|Serpent]] crawling through the eyes of a skull is a familiar image that survives in contemporary [[Goth subculture]]. The serpent is a [[chthonic]] god of knowledge and of immortality, because he sloughs off his skin. The serpent guards the Tree in the Greek [[Hesperides|Garden of the Hesperides]] and, later, a Tree in the [[Garden of Eden]]. The serpent in the skull is always making its way through the socket that was the eye: knowledge persists beyond death, the emblem says, and the serpent has the secret.

The skull speaks. It says ''"[[Et in Arcadia ego]]"'' or simply ''"[[Vanitas]]."''  In a first-century mosaic tabletop from a [[Pompeii]]an [[triclinium]] (now in Naples), the skull is crowned with a [[carpenter's square]] and [[plumb bob|plumb-bob]], which dangles before its empty eyesockets (Death as the great leveller), while below is an image of the ephemeral and changeable nature of life: a butterfly atop a wheel&amp;mdash;a table for a philosopher's ''[[symposium]]''.

Similarly, a skull might be seen crowned by a chaplet of dried roses, a "''[[Carpe diem]]''", though rarely as bedecked as Mexican printmaker [[José Guadalupe Posada]]'s [[La Catrina|Catrina]].
In [[Mesoamerican architecture]], [[Tzompantli|stacks of skulls]] (real or sculpted) represented the result of [[human sacrifice in Aztec culture|human sacrifices]].
The skull speaks in the catacombs of the Capuchin brothers beneath the church of [[Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini|Santa Maria della Concezione]] in Rome,&lt;ref name="Cappucini"&gt;[http://www.cappucciniviaveneto.it/cappuccini_ing.html The Crypt: Church of the Immaculate]. Official site of the Capuchins  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710170530/http://www.cappucciniviaveneto.it/cappuccini_ing.html |date=July 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where disassembled bones and teeth and skulls of the departed Capuchins have been rearranged to form a rich [[Baroque architecture]] of the human condition, in a series of anterooms and subterranean chapels with the inscription, set in bones:

:''Noi eravamo quello che voi siete, e quello che noi siamo voi sarete.''
:"We were what you are; and what we are, you will be."

An old [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] folktale&lt;ref&gt;William R. Bascom: ''[[Ifá]] Divination: Communication Between Gods and Men in West Africa'' (Indiana) {{ISBN|0-253-20638-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; tells of a man who encountered a skull mounted on a post by the wayside.  To his astonishment, the skull spoke.  The man asked the skull why it was mounted there.  The skull said that it was mounted there for talking.  The man then went to the [[monarch|king]], and told the king of the marvel he had found, a talking skull.  The king and the man returned to the place where the skull was mounted; the skull remained silent.  The king then commanded that the man be [[beheading|beheaded]], and ordered that his head be mounted in place of the skull.

In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist iconography, skull symbolism is often used in depictions of [[wrathful deities]] and of [[dakinis]].

==In fashion==
[[Alexander McQueen]] is credited with popularizing a [[fashion trend]] with stylized skulls, starting with skull-decorated bags and [[scarf|scarves]]. The trend is extant by the early [[2010s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8511404.stm |title= Six ways Alexander McQueen changed fashion |last1= Vaidyanathan |first1= Rajini |date= 12 February 2010|website= [[BBC News]] Magazine|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hellogiggles.com/defend-the-trend-skulls|title=Defend the Trend:Skulls|last1=Gibson | first1=Crystal|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hybrid beasts''' appear in the [[folklore]] of a variety of cultures as [[legendary creature]]s.

==In burial sites==
Remains similar to those of mythological hybrids have been found in burial sites discovered by archaeologists. Known combinations include horse-cows, sheep-cows, and a six-legged sheep. The skeletons were formed by ancient peoples who joined together body parts from animal carcasses of different species. The practice is believed to have been done as an offering to their gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/weird-science/weird-horse-cows-6-legged-sheep-found-iron-age-burials-n395871|title=Horse-Cows? Bizarre 'Hybrid' Animals Found in Ancient Burials|publisher=LiveScience|author=Laura Geggel|date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
These forms' [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]s appear across cultures in many [[mythologies]] around the world.

Such hybrids can be classified as partly human hybrids (such as [[mermaid]]s or [[centaur]]s) or non-human hybrids combining two or more non-human animal species (such as the [[griffin]] or the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]]). Hybrids often originate as [[zoomorphic]] deities who, over time, are given an [[anthropomorphic]] aspect.

===Paleolithic===
Partly human hybrids appear in [[petroglyph]]s or [[cave painting]]s from the [[Upper Paleolithic]], in [[shamanism|shamanistic]] or [[totemism|totemistic]] contexts. Ethnologist Ivar Lissner theorized that [[cave paintings]] of beings combining human and animal features were not physical representations of mythical hybrids, but were instead attempts to depict [[shaman]]s in the process of acquiring the mental and spiritual attributes of various beasts or [[power animal]]s.&lt;ref name="Steiger 1999"&gt;{{cite book| last=Steiger| first= B.| year=1999| title=The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shape-Shifting Beings| location=Farmington Hills, MI| publisher=Visible Ink| isbn=1-57859-078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]] has observed that beliefs regarding animal identity and [[shapeshifting|transformation into animals]] are widespread.&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;{{cite book | last=Eliade | first=Mircea | title=Rites and Symbols of Initiation: the mysteries of birth and rebirth | publisher=Harper &amp; Row | year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the [[Vinca culture]] of [[Neolithic Europe]] in particular is noted for its frequent depiction of an owl-beaked "[[bird goddess]]".&lt;ref&gt;a term of [[Marija Gimbutas]]', see e.g. ''The language of the goddess: unearthing the hidden symbols of western civilization'' San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row; London: Thames and Hudson (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:Seth + Horus = 2 terres.jpg|thumb|The falcon-headed Horus and crane-headed Seth.]]
Examples of humans with animal heads ([[theriocephaly]]) in the [[ancient Egyptian pantheon]] include jackal-headed [[Anubis]], cobra-headed [[Amunet]], lion-headed [[Sekhmet]], falcon-headed [[Horus]], etc. Most of these deities also have a purely zoomorphic and a purely anthropomorphic aspect, with the hybrid representation seeking to capture aspects of both of which at once. Similarly, the [[Gaul]]ish ''[[Artio]]'' sculpture found in [[Berne]] shows a juxtaposition of a bear and a woman figure, interpreted as representations of the theriomorphic and the anthropomorphic aspect of the same goddess.

Non-human hybrids also appear in ancient Egyptian iconography as in [[Ammit]] (combining the [[crocodile]], the [[lion]], and the [[hippopotamus]]).

===Ancient Middle East===
Mythological hybrids became very popular in [[Luwian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian|Assyrian]] art of the [[Late Bronze Age]] to [[Early Iron Age]]. The angel (human with birds' wings, see [[winged genie]]) the mermaid (part human part fish, see [[Enki]], [[Atargatis]], [[Apkallu]]) and the [[Shedu]] all trace their origins to Assyro-Babylonian art. In [[Mesopotamian mythology]] the ''urmahlullu'', or lion-man served as a guardian spirit, especially of bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Black, Jeremy A. and Anthony Green |title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-292-70794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiggermann |first=F. A. M. |title=Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts |publisher=Styx |year=1992 |isbn = 90-72371-52-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Babylonian [[Lilitu]] demon, particularly as shown in the [[Burney Relief]] (part-woman, part-owl) prefigures the [[harpy]]/[[Siren (mythology)|siren]] [[Motif (narrative)|motif]].

===Mediterranean===
[[File:Zeus Typhon Staatliche Antikensammlungen 596.jpg|thumb|[[Zeus]] darting his lightning at [[Typhon]], shown as a hybrid with a human torso, bird's wings and a reptilian lower body (Chalcidian black-figured [[hydria]], c. 550 BC, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] Inv. 596).]]

In [[Archaic Greece]], Luwian and Assyrian motifs were imitated, during the [[Orientalizing Period]] (9th to 8th centuries BC), inspiring the monsters of the [[Greek mythology|mythology]] of the [[Classical Greek period]], such as the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], the [[Harpy]], the [[Centaur]], the [[Griffin]], the [[Hippocampus (mythology)|Hippocampus]], [[Talos]], [[Pegasus]], etc.

The motif of the winged man appears in the Assyrian [[winged genie]], and is taken up in the Biblical [[Seraphim]] and [[Chayot]], the Etruscan [[Vanth]], Hellenistic [[Eros]]-[[Cupid|Amor]], and ultimately the Christian iconography of [[angel]]s.

The motif of otherwise human figures sporting [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s may derive from partly [[goat]] hybrids (as in [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and the [[Devil]] in Christian iconography) or as partly [[Bull (mythology)|bull]] hybrids ([[Minotaur]]). The [[Gundestrup cauldron]] and the [[Pashupati]] figure have [[stag]]'s [[antlers]] (see also [[Horned God]], [[horned helmet]]). The Christian representation of [[Moses]] with horns, however, is due to a mistranslation of the Hebrew text of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:29–35 by [[Jerome]].

===Hinduism===
[[File:Ganesh mimarjanam EDITED.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Street festivities in [[Hyderabad, India]], during the festival of [[Ganesha Chaturthi]].]]
The most prominent hybrid in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] iconography is [[elephant]]-headed [[Ganesha]], god of wisdom, knowledge and new beginnings.

Both [[Nāga]] and [[Garuda]] are non-hybrid mythical animals ([[snake]] and [[bird]], respectively) in their early attestations, but become partly human hybrids in later iconography.

The [[Hindu deities|god]] [[Vishnu]] is believed to have taken his first four [[incarnation]]s in human-animal form, namely: [[Matsya]] ([[human]] form with [[fish]]'s body below waist), [[Kurma]] (human form with [[turtle]]'s body below waist), [[Varaha]] (human form with a [[boar]]'s head), [[Narasimha]] (human form with [[lion]]'s head).

[[Kamadhenu]], the [[mythical]] cow which is considered to be the mother of all other [[cattle]] is often portrayed as a cow with human head, [[peacock]] tail and bird wings.

An '''immram''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|m|r|əm}}; plural '''immrama'''; {{lang-ga|iomramh}}, {{IPA-ga|ˈʊmˠɾˠəw|pron}}, ''voyage'') is a class of [[Old Irish]] tales concerning a hero's sea journey to the [[Otherworld]] (see [[Tír na nÓg]] and [[Mag Mell]]). Written in the [[History of Ireland|Christian era]] and essentially Christian in aspect, they preserve elements of [[Irish mythology]].

The immrama are identifiable by their focus on the exploits of the heroes during their search for the Otherworld, located in these cases in the islands far to the west of Ireland. The hero sets out on his voyage for the sake of adventure or to fulfill his destiny, and generally stops on other fantastic islands before reaching his destination. He may or may not be able to return home again.

==Definition==

The immrama are generally confused with a similar Irish genre, the ''[[echtrae]]'' or "adventure". Both types of story involve a hero's journey to an "otherworld", whether a Christian paradise, a fairyland, the land of the gods or a utopia. They are distinguished by date; echtrai are older, dating from the 7th century, while the earliest immram dates only to the 8th century.{{sfn|Thrall|1917}} [[David Dumville]] argues that the immrama include more Christian thinking than the more pagan genre of echtrae,{{sfn|Dumville|1976}} and that, whereas the purpose of the echtrai is to enhance understanding of the old gods and the land in which they live, in an immram these pagan elements occur as a challenge to the hero's faith. In an echtrae the protagonist only ever goes to one location and may arrive in the otherworld with no explanation of the journey, whereas in an immram the hero always has multiple adventures on several islands.{{sfn|Dumville|1976|}}

==Stories==
Originally there were seven officially recognised Immram listed in a list of ancient texts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Of those seven only three survive: ''[[The Voyage of Mael Dúin]]'', ''[[The Voyage of the Uí Chorra]]'', and ''[[The Voyage of Snedgus and Mac Riagla]]''. ''[[The Voyage of Bran]]'' is classified in these same lists as an echtrae, though it also contains the essential elements of the immrama.{{sfn|Wooding|2000b|loc=Introduction}} The later [[Latin]] ''[[Brendan|Voyage of St. Brendan]]'' also contains a voyage across the sea to various otherworldly islands.

==Origins==
Immrama were first recorded as early as the 7th century by monks and scholars who fled Continental Europe before the barbarian invaders of the fifth century. These monks carried the learning of Western Europe and became the vanguard of the Christianizing of Europe.{{sfn|Thrall|1917}} On this account it is expected that Immram have their origins in pre-existing Christian voyage literature, pre-existing Celtic legends, or classical stories the monks would have known. The origins of these stories are attributed to three sources of preexisting stories: Irish myths, Christian genres, and Classic Stories.

The Otherworld in ''The Voyage of Bran'' is a distinctly Celtic feature but this is easily overlooked because the concept of the Christian [[paradise]] and the British and Irish otherworld are closely related. This difference is highlighted in the difference between sinless and sexless in the native and Christian mindset, like in the existing translation where an author may have turned the "Isle of Woman" into a chaste society, with some difficulty. Such an example was with a passage that described a man and a woman playing under a bush without sin or blame.{{sfn|Mac Cana|2000}} This passage in light of several others emphasises a Christian effort to create a sinless and sexless Otherworld.

Immrama may have borrowed heavily from preexisting Christian genres, such as the ''[[hagiography|sanctae vitae]]'' (saints' lives), the ''[[peregrinatio (disambiguation)|peregrinatio]]'' (pilgrimage stories), and the vision tales.{{sfn|Moylan|2007}} As early as the 5th century Irish monks would go on a pilgrimage, a ''peregrination'', sailing from island to island seeking isolation where they would meditate and purge themselves of their sins.{{sfn|Moylan|2007}} The source of inspiration behind the Immram may also be the Christian punishment of sending people adrift for their crimes to be judged by God.{{sfn|Byrne|1932}} Perhaps the largest piece of evidence that immram are Christian works is that the characters in the story are generally wandering priests, monks, and nuns, or at least related to them.

One of the first Celticists, Heinrich Zimmerman, attempted to link the immram with the ''[[Aeneid]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Some of the parallels they make are between the immortal women in the tales who bestow immortality on their lovers for the time they remain with them and the giant sheep on islands in both stories.{{sfn|Thrall|1917}} These parallels have since been debunked by William Flint Thrall.{{sfn|Wooding|2000b|loc=Introduction}}

On top of their literary and mythological precedents, some scholars have argued that the immrama may be exaggerated retelling of historical voyages. The early Irish, particularly [[monk]]s (see [[papar]]), were certainly far travelled, reaching the [[Orkney]], [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]], [[Faroe Islands]] at an early date and perhaps even reaching [[Iceland]]. Some places and things referenced in the immrama and the Brendan tale have been associated with real islands and real things, for instance Brendan's crystal pillar has been suggested to refer to an [[iceberg]].{{sfn|Wooding|2000}}

==Influence==
===Literature===
*The Inrams have been proposed as part inspiration for both [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'', and the poem ''Imram'' by contemporary [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Bedeviled: Lewis, Tolkien and the Shadow of Evil| first = Colin| last =Duriex| page = 181 | year  =2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Australian author [[Patrick Holland (author)|Patrick Holland]]'s novel ''Navigatio'' is a 21st Century Immram that re-imagines the Brendan Voyage. It accretes contradictory and repetitive episodes to create the impression of an unredacted collection of medieval texts.

*[[Anatole France]] satirised the Immram genre in the early part of his 1908 ''[[Penguin Island (novel)|Penguin Island]]'' (French: ''L'Île des Pingouins'').

===Other===
The popularity of ''The Voyage of St. Brendan'' inspired [[Tim Severin]] to undertake a voyage using 5th century technology to demonstrate that the early Irish could have made it as far as North America.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

'''''In a Roman Osteria''''' is a painting by the Danish painter [[Carl Bloch]]. It was painted in 1866.

One of Bloch's better-known genre scenes, the painting was commissioned by the merchant [[Moritz G. Melchior]], Bloch's friend and major supporter who is included in the background of the painting. He is sitting in an [[osteria]], at a table talking with his friends. The two figures sitting beside him are depicted, the figure turning his back to the viewers is the painter himself.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smk.dk/en/highlight/in-a-roman-osteria-1866/ |title=In a Roman Osteria, 1866.

{{Intellectual property}}
Layout designs (topographies) of [[integrated circuit]]s are a field in the protection of [[intellectual property]].

In [[United States]] intellectual property law, a "mask work" is a two or three-dimensional layout or topography of an [[integrated circuit]] (IC or "chip"), i.e. the arrangement on a chip of [[semiconductor devices]] such as [[transistor]]s and passive [[electronics|electronic]] components such as [[resistor]]s and interconnections. The layout is called a ''mask'' work because, in [[photolithography|photolithographic]] processes, the multiple etched layers within actual ICs are each created using a mask, called the [[photomask]], to permit or block the light at specific locations, sometimes for hundreds of chips on a [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] simultaneously.

Because of the functional nature of the mask geometry, the designs cannot be effectively protected under [[copyright]] law (except perhaps as decorative art). Similarly, because individual lithographic mask works are not clearly protectable subject matter, they also cannot be effectively protected under [[patent]] law, although any processes implemented in the work may be patentable. So since the 1990s, national governments have been granting copyright-like exclusive rights conferring time-limited exclusivity to reproduction of a particular layout. Term of integrated circuit rights are usually shorter than copyrights applicable on pictures.

== International law ==

A diplomatic conference was held at [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1989, which adopted a [[Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits]], also called the Washington Treaty or IPIC Treaty. The Treaty, signed at Washington on May 26, 1989, is open to States Members of [[WIPO]] or the [[United Nations]] and to intergovernmental organizations meeting certain criteria. The Treaty has been incorporated by reference into the [[TRIPS Agreement]] of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), subject to the following modifications: the term of protection is at least 10 (rather than eight) years from the date of filing an application or of the first commercial exploitation in the world, but Members may provide a term of protection of 15 years from the creation of the layout-design; the exclusive right of the right-holder extends also to articles incorporating integrated circuits in which a protected layout-design is incorporated, in so far as it continues to contain an unlawfully reproduced layout-design; the circumstances in which layout-designs may be used without the consent of right-holders are more restricted; certain acts engaged in unknowingly will not constitute infringement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.int/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm#6 TRIPS Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPIC Treaty is currently not in force, but was partially integrated into the TRIPS agreement.

Article 35 of TRIPS in Relation to the IPIC Treaty states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Members agree to provide protection to the layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits (referred to in this Agreement as "layout-designs") in accordance with Articles 2 through 7 (other than paragraph 3 of Article 6), Article 12 and paragraph 3 of Article 16 of the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits and, in addition, to comply with the following provisions.[http://www.wto.int/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm#6 TRIPS Document]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 2 of the IPIC Treaty gives the following definitions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(i) 'integrated circuit' means a product, in its final form or an intermediate form, in which the elements, at least one of which is an active element, and some or all of the inter-connections are integrally formed in and/or on a piece of material and which is intended to perform an electronic function,

(ii) 'layout-design (topography)' means the three-dimensional disposition, however expressed, of the elements, at least one of which is an active element, and of some or all of the interconnections of an integrated circuit, or such a three-dimensional disposition prepared for an integrated circuit intended for manufacture ...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under the IPIC Treaty, each Contracting Party is obliged to secure, throughout its territory, exclusive rights in layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits, whether or not the integrated circuit concerned is incorporated in an article. Such obligation applies to layout-designs that are original in the sense that they are the result of their creators' own intellectual effort and are not commonplace among creators of layout designs and manufacturers of integrated circuits at the time of their creation.

The Contracting Parties must, as a minimum, consider the following acts to be unlawful if performed without the authorization of the holder of the right: the reproduction of the lay-out design, and the importation, sale or other distribution for commercial purposes of the layout-design or an integrated circuit in which the layout-design is incorporated. However, certain acts may be freely performed for private purposes or for the sole purpose of evaluation, analysis, research or teaching.

== National laws ==

=== United States ===

The United States Code (USC) defines a mask work as "a series of related images, however fixed or encoded, having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product, and in which the relation of the images to one another is such that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product" [(17 U.S.C. § 901(a)(2))]. Mask work exclusive rights were first granted in the US by the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984]].

According to {{UnitedStatesCode|17|904}}, rights in semiconductor mask works last 10 years. This contrasts with a [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act|term of 95 years]] for modern copyrighted works with a corporate authorship; alleged infringement of mask work rights are also not protected by a statutory [[fair use]] defense, nor by the typical [[backup]] copy exemptions that {{UnitedStatesCode|17|117}} provides for [[computer software]]. Nevertheless, as fair use in copyrighted works was originally recognized by the judiciary over a century before being codified in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], it is possible that the courts might likewise find a similar defense applies to mask work.

The non-obligatory symbol used in a mask work protection notice is Ⓜ ([[M]] enclosed in a circle; [[Unicode]] code point &lt;code&gt;U+24C2&lt;/code&gt; or [[Unicode and HTML|HTML numeric character entity]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#9410;&lt;/code&gt;) or *M*.

The exclusive rights in a mask work are somewhat like those of [[copyright]]: the right to reproduce the mask work or (initially) distribute an IC made using the mask work. Like the [[first sale doctrine]], a lawful owner of an authorized IC containing a mask work may freely import, distribute or use, but not reproduce the chip (or the mask). Mask work protection is characterized as a ''[[sui generis]]'' right, i.e., one created to protect specific rights where other (more general) laws were inadequate or inappropriate.

Note that the exclusive rights granted to mask work owners are more limited than those granted to copyright or patent holders. For instance, modification (derivative works) is not an exclusive right of mask work owners. Similarly, the exclusive right of a patentee to "use" an invention would not prohibit an independently created mask work of identical geometry. Furthermore, reproduction for [[reverse engineering]] of a mask work is specifically permitted by the law. As with copyright, mask work rights exist when they are created, regardless of registration, unlike patents, which only confer rights after application, examination and issuance.

Mask work rights have more in common with copyrights than with other [[exclusive right]]s such as [[patent]]s or [[trademark]]s. On the other hand, they are used alongside copyright to protect a [[read-only memory]] (ROM) component that is encoded to contain computer software.

The publisher of software for a cartridge-based [[video game console]] may seek simultaneous protection of its property under several legal constructs:

* A trademark registration on the game's title and possibly other marks such as fanciful names of worlds and characters used in the game (e.g., PAC-MAN®);
* A copyright registration on the program as a literary work or on the audiovisual displays generated by the work; and
* A mask work registration on the ROM that contains the binary.

Ordinary copyright law applies to the underlying software (source, binary) and original characters and art.
But the expiration date for the term of ''additional'' exclusive rights in a work distributed in the form of a mask ROM would depend on an {{as of|2010|alt=as yet}} untested interpretation of the originality requirement of § 902(b):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(b) Protection under this chapter (i.e., as a mask work) shall not be available for a mask work that—
:(1) is not original; or
:(2) consists of designs that are staple, commonplace, or familiar in the semiconductor industry, or variations of such designs, combined in a way that, considered as a whole, is not original
({{UnitedStatesCode|17|902}}, {{As of|2010|11|lc=y}}).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under one interpretation, a mask work containing a given game title is either entirely unoriginal, as mask ROM in general is likely a familiar design, or a minor variation of the mask work for any of the [[launch title|first titles released for the console]] in the region.

=== Other countries ===

Equivalent legislation exists in [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[Hong Kong]].

In [[Canada]] these rights are protected under the [Integrated Circuit Topography Act (1990, c. 37)].

In the [[European Union]], a ''sui generis'' design right protecting the design of materials was introduced by the [[Directive 87/54/EEC]] which is transposed in all member states.

[[India]] has the Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout Design Act, 2000 for the similar protection.

[[Japan]] relies on "The Act Concerning the Circuit Layout of a Semiconductor Integrated Circuit".

[[Brazil]] has enacted Law No. 11484, of 2007, to regulate the protection and registration of integrated circuit topography.

The '''Ipuwer Papyrus''' (officially Papyrus Leiden I 344&lt;!--REDIRECT--&gt; ''recto'') is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[hieratic]] [[papyrus]] made during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]], and now held in the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden|National Museum of Antiquities]] in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Quirke|2014|p=167}} It contains the '''''Admonitions of Ipuwer''''', an incomplete [[Ancient Egyptian literature|literary work]] whose original composition is dated no earlier than the late [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt]] (c.1991–1803 BCE).{{sfn|Willems|2010|p=83}}

==Content==
In the poem, Ipuwer – a name typical of the period 1850-1450 BCE – complains that the world has been turned upside-down: a woman who had not a single box now has furniture, a girl who looked at her face in the water now owns a mirror, while the once-rich man is now in rags. He demands that the Lord of All (a title which can be applied both to the king and to the creator sun-god) should destroy his enemies and remember his religious duties. This is followed by a violent description of disorder: there is no longer any respect for the law and even the king's burial inside the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramid]] has been desecrated. The story continues with the description of better days until it abruptly ends due to the missing final part of the papyrus. It is likely that the poem concluded with a reply of the Lord of All, or prophesying the coming of a powerful king who would restore order.{{sfn|Gardiner|1961|p=109-110}}{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=138}}{{sfn|Quirke|2014|p=167}}

==Discussion==
The Ipuwer Papyrus has been dated no earlier than the [[Nineteenth Dynasty]], around 1250 BCE{{sfn|Quirke|2014|p=167}}{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=745}} but it is now agreed that the text itself is much older, and dated back to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], though no earlier than the late Twelfth Dynasty.{{sfn|Willems|2010|p=83}}

It was previously thought that the ''Admonitions of Ipuwer'' presents an objective portrait of Egypt in the [[First Intermediate Period]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1961|p=109-110}}{{sfn|Bresciani|1969|p=65}}{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=138}} In more recent times, it was found that the ''Admonitions'', along with the ''[[Khakheperresenb|Complaints of Khakheperresenb]]'', are most likely works of royal [[propaganda]], both inspired by the earlier ''[[Prophecy of Neferti]]'': the three compositions have in common the theme of a nation that has been plunged into chaos and disarray and the need for an intransigent king who would defeat chaos and restore ''[[maat]]''.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2010|p=174–175}} [[Toby Wilkinson]] suggested that the ''Admonitions'' and ''Khakheperresenb'' may thus have been composed during the reign of [[Senusret III]], a pharaoh well known for his use of propaganda.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2010|p=174–175}} In any case, the ''Admonitions'' is not a reliable account of early Egyptian history, because of the long time interval between its original composition and the writing of the Leiden Papyrus.{{sfn|Quirke|2014|p=167}}{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=745}}

The ''Admonitions'' is considered the world's earliest known treatise on [[political ethics]], suggesting that a good king is one who controls unjust officials, thus carrying out the will of the gods.{{sfn|Gabriel|2002|p=23}} It is a textual [[lamentation]], close to [[Sumeria]]n city laments and to Egyptian laments for the dead, using the past (the destruction of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] at the end of the [[Old Kingdom]]) as a gloomy backdrop to an ideal future.{{sfn|Morenz|2003|p=103–111}}

===Ipuwer and the Book of Exodus===
Ipuwer has often been put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the Biblical account, most notably because of its statement that "[[Plagues of Egypt#1. Water_into_blood_(דָם):_Ex._7:14–24|the river is blood]]" and its frequent references to servants running away, but there are also points in which the Ipuwer contradicts the Exodus story as found in the Bible, such as the fact that its Asiatics are arriving in Egypt rather than leaving. The "river is blood" phrase may also refer to the red sediment colouring the Nile during disastrous floods, or may simply be a poetic image of turmoil.{{sfn|Enmarch|2011|p=173–175}} The archeological evidence does not support the story of [[the Exodus]], and most historians no longer consider it relevant to the story of the emergence of Israel.{{sfn|Meyers|2005|p=5–6}}{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}}

The '''Jivantasvami''' images represent Lord [[Mahavira]] (and in some cases other Tirthankaras) as a prince, with a crown and ornaments. The Jina is represented as standing in the kayotsaga pose. Jivantasvami images have been used only in the Shvetambara Jain tradition, they are unknown in the Digambara tradition.

The earliest reference to the Jivantasvami images is found in the later commentaries on the Shvetambara Jain Agamas (c.mid 6th century AD onwards),  Vasudevahindi of Samghadasagani-(c.mid 6th century AD) the Avashyakachurni (c.AD 625) the Avashyakavritti of Haribhadrasuri-(c.AD 750) and the Trishashtishalakapurushacharita of Hemachandra (c.AD 1169-72). &lt;ref&gt;JIVANTASVAMI IMAGES A STUDY IN CONCEPT AND ICONOGRAPHY, MARUTI NANDAN TIWARI, Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Vol. 54 (1993), pp. 847-856&lt;/ref&gt;These mention the existence of Jivantasvami images at Ujjain, Dashapura (Mandsor), Vidisha, Vitabhayapattana, Puri and Koshala.

According to [[Hemachandra]], the  original image was made by god Vidyunmali, carved in sandalwood, during the time Lord Mahavira was still a prince.  According to the legend of the queen of Udayana of Vitabhaya worshipped this image.  This image was eventually installed at Vidisha, but was eventually lost.

The best known  images of [[Jivantasvami]] were found in the [[Akota Hoard]], and are widely mentioned examples of the early western Indian school of art. One of them is specifically inscribed as Jivantsvami installed by Nagisvari, which represents early phase of the Gupta style.&lt;ref&gt;Akota Bronzes, Bombay State Board for Historical Records and Ancient Monuments, Archaeological Series. no. 1. Umakant Premanand SHAH, 1959, p. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;  The images were dug out sometime before June 1951. A University of Baroda professor brought five of them to archaeologist U.P. Shah for examination. U.P. Shat eventually  purchased most of the images from local individuals and presented them to M.S. University, which are now in the Baroda Museum.

Other tirthankaras including Rishabhanath (1st Jina), Shantinath (16th Jina), Munisuvrata (20th Jina) and Parshvanatha (23rd Jina ), were also sometimes represented in the form of Jivantasvami.&lt;ref&gt;U.P. Shah, Akota Bronze, Bombay, 1959, p 26; Idem 'More Images of Jivantasvami', Jr. Indian Museum xi 1955, &lt;/ref&gt; 


==Museums==

The two famous Jivantasvami images along with the rest of the [[Akota Hoard]] bronzes are in the [[Baroda Museum &amp; Picture Gallery]].

'''''Klingen''''' (meaning ''Blade'' in English) was a [[Danish language|Danish]] art magazine based in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The magazine existed between 1917 and 1920.

The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]], painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings and celebrations. Oscar Björck first arrived in 
Skagen in 1882, encouraged by [[P. S. Krøyer]] whom he had met in Paris. He immediately became attached to the artists' community there, especially [[Michael Ancher]], his wife [[Anna Ancher|Anna]] and [[Holger Drachmann]].&lt;ref name=Svanholm2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Svanholm|first=Lise|title=Northern Light: The Skagen Painters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFBVtB1CTvkC&amp;pg=PA274|year=2004|publisher=Gyldendal A/S|isbn=978-87-02-02817-1|pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Björck spent several summers there, completing some of his best paintings under the influence of Krøyer and the French [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalism]] movement.&lt;ref name="Madsen1929"&gt;{{cite book|last=Madsen|first=Karl|title=Skagens Malere og Skagens Museum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j95CNQAACAAJ|year=1929|publisher=Gyldendal|page=103|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/oscar-bjoerck/|title=Oscar Björck (1860&amp;ndash;1929)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=25 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting description==
Measuring {{convert|160|x|194.5|cm|in}}, ''Launching the Boat'' is the largest of Björck's open-air paintings from Skagen. It presents the everyday work of the local fishermen. In contrast to Ancher's  ''[[Will He Round the Point?]]'', there is no sense of alarm or danger in his painting. The thick layers of paint on the canvas help to convey the foaming surf and the coarseness of the sand. The fisherman at the front of the boat is Ole Svendsen who can also be seen in many of Ancher's paintings of the Skagen fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/samlingen/vaerkerne/oscar-bjoerck/baaden-saettes-i-soeen/|title=Oscar Björck: Båden sættes i søen.

'''Marbleizing''' or '''faux marbling''' is the preparation and finishing of a surface to imitate the appearance of polished [[marble]]. It is typically used in buildings where the cost or weight of genuine marble would be prohibitive. Faux marbling is a special case of faux painting used to create the distinctive and varied patterns of marble - the most imitated stone by far.

[[Image:Marble fresco - Capella dei Scrovegni - Padua 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Giotto]], [[Scrovegni Chapel]].]]

==History==
Faux stone painting was widely used in [[Pompeii]], but it really took off in Europe during the [[Renaissance]] with two schools of faux painting developing. The Italian school was loose and artistic, the French school was formal and realistic. It typically took an apprentice 10 years or more to fully master the art.

The sophistication of the techniques are such that visitors are frequently unable to distinguish between false and real marble in many churches, palaces and public buildings in Europe. The techniques were perfected by the 17th century and have been used in all styles of construction well into the 20th century, including [[Baroque]], [[palladian]], [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] and historical [[revival style]]s as well as [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] buildings. Craftsmen who are able to replicate this work are still available, as evidenced, for example, by the extensive restorations of faux marble surfaces in important Eastern Europe buildings since 1990.

The art of marbling and graining reached its apogee in Britain between 1845 and 1870, and during this period the acknowledged master was [[Thomas Kershaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stewartmcdonald.co.uk/kershaw/kershaw.html| title = Thomas Kershaw 1819-1898 "Prince of Grainers &amp; Marblers"|accessdate = 2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thomas Kershaw==
Kershaw was born in Standish, Lancashire England in April 1819. At the age of 12 he was apprenticed to Mr. John Platt of Bolton who was paid the sum of £23 by Kershaw’s father in order that his son could be instructed in the craft of house painting. He worked 10 hours a day for six days a week. He completed his apprenticeship at the age of 21.
 
He achieved international fame, winning a number of the most prestigious awards at the major exhibitions of the age; The Great Exhibition, London, 1851 - a first prize medal; Exposition Universelle, Paris, 1855 - a first class medal; London Exhibition, 1862 - first prize.

Kershaw's work was so good that it was often considered to be indiscernible from the original. He undertook work in many large houses, mansions and stately homes throughout [[England]] and [[Wales]] and once declined an offer from the Russian Ambassador to imitate marbles on the interior of the Imperial Palace in [[St Petersburg]]. In 1858 he produced one of his important works in the Blue Room in [[Buckingham Palace]] where all the pillars were done in imitation marble.

==William Holgate==
In modern times, William Holgate (1931-2002) from Clitheroe, [[Lancashire]], was possibly the finest grainer and  marbler in the world since Thomas Kershaw held the title 150 years before.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} His achievements include the prestigious award known as the "Freedom of the City and Guilds of London" and he was very proud to be made "A Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Painter Stainers of Trinity Lane, London," on March 14, 1995. He was also given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2001 Paris Salon. His apprentice and protégé, Andrew Johnstone continues his tradition.

==Techniques==
[[image:sch_mar_2.jpg|thumb|Example of a faux painting in antique verde marble]]
Other techniques for producing faux marble include [[Scagliola]], a costly process which involves the use of specially pigmented plasters, and [[terrazzo]]. For flooring, marble chips are imbedded in cement, then ground and polished to expose the marble aggregate.

Some professional faux finishers are very skilled and will use a variety of techniques to reproduce the colors, veining and luster of real marble or other building materials. However, many decorators will merely suggest the appearance of marble rather than accurately imitate a particular stone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7177">The  term '''multilingual titling''' defines, in the field of [[titling]] for the performing arts (musical theatre, drama, audiovisual productions), the chance for the audience to follow more than one linguistic option.

==History==
In the audiovisual field, multilingual titling was made possible by the introduction of [[DVD]] (1996) &lt;ref name="DVD first appearance (1996)"&gt;DVD was first launched on the market by [[Warner Home Video]] both in the USA (1996) and in Europe (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; in which an integrated data-base gives access to several language channels dedicated to titling.&lt;br /&gt;
In the live performing arts, multilingual options (with possibility of individual choice) were introduced in 1998 at [[Santa Fe Opera]] by mean of custom individual displays set mainly on the back of the seats, as in airplanes.&lt;ref name=" set mainly on the back of the seats, as in the airplanes "&gt;This device, lately adopted by other international theatres, has been realized by [[Figaro Systems]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The introduction, at the end of the 1900s, of Web 2.0 and of the new mobile device technologies caused deep changes also in this field. &lt;br /&gt;
In Europe, in 2011, a significant innovation was provided by the [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]] Theatre in Florence, which started the testing of a new multilingual transmission system for mobile consumer devices,&lt;ref name="testing of a new multilingual transmission system for mobile consumer devices "&gt;OperaVoice devised the software.&lt;/ref&gt; that can be integrated to monolingual [[surtitles]].&lt;br /&gt;
In the same year, another multilingual software for mobile consumer devices was developed, as an alternative to the use of [[subtitles]] in cinemas and, the following year (2012), a new head-mounted display system (multimedia glasses) was introduced, serving the same function.&lt;ref name="starts off a new head mounted display system (multimedia glasses) which serves the same function"&gt;Both products (app and glasses) are by MovieReading.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011-2012, the Royal Opera House Muscat carried out the most advanced multilingual custom display system to date, interactive and integrated to surtitles screened on a central LED panel.&lt;ref name="multilingual custom display system nowadays, interactive and integrated to surtitles screened on a central LED panel"&gt;A [[Radio Marconi]] project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other solutions==
The simultaneous presentation of two languages is quite unusual within the more traditional surtitling system, which is used in most cases with monolingual function.

'''National Art Hate Week''' ran from 13–20 July 2009 and was a largely imaginary and highly humorous event created by the "non-organisation" [[The British Art Resistance]]. British artists [[Billy Childish]], [[Jimmy Cauty]] and art collective [[Harry Adams (artist)|Harry Adams]] created the week to promote the public questioning the bureaucratic nature of the contemporary art world.

==About==

The artists involved questioned the ideas of permission, curatorship, commercialism and consensus within the art world using satirical and confrontational strategies. The campaign was largely imaginary and through its fictions sought to raise awareness of the wider public's opinions of the art world, as well as the way the art world was promoted and disseminated by those within it. According to The Guardian, "the point [was] to take a closer, more honest look at what's on show in public galleries and be unafraid to loathe it violently".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/13/national-art-hate-week-billy-childish Guardian article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Music, posters, stamps, fake membership cards and graphic works were produced by the group as part of the week, including a limited edition 7" single with art work by [[Jamie Reid]] by a group made up of the artists involved under the name Silent Revolt.

The group failed to hand out propaganda leaflets outside the [[Tate Modern]] gallery in London on 15 July 2010.

==Future incarnations==

The movement has been altered to World Art Hate Day for 2010 and will occur on 21 June 2010.

==Releases==
July 2009
"God Save Marcel Duchamp"
[[Silent Revolt]] (band includes [[James Cauty]] and [[Billy Childish]] and [[Harry Adams (artist)|Harry Adams]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5993">'''No wave cinema''' was an [[underground film]]making movement that flourished on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[New York City]] from about 1976 to 1985. Sponsored by and associated with the artists group [[Collaborative Projects]] or "Collab",&lt;ref&gt;Marc Masters, (2007) ''No Wave'', Black Dog Publishing, London, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; no wave cinema was a stripped-down style of [[guerrilla filmmaking]] that emphasized mood and texture above other concerns -- similar to the parallel [[no wave]] music movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxonline.org.uk/articles/no_wavelength(1).html NO WAVELENGTH: THE PARA-PUNK UNDERGROUND: [[Village Voice]] film critic [[Jim Hoberman]] discusses the New York New Wave film scene, including lo-fi super 8 films of [[Vivienne Dick]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent figures==

This brief movement, also known as New Cinema (after a short-lived screening room on [[St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|St. Mark’s Place]] run by several filmmakers on the scene), had a significant impact on underground film. No wave cinema spawned the [[Cinema of Transgression]] ([[Scott B and Beth B]], [[Richard Kern]], [[Nick Zedd]], [[Tessa Hughes-Freeland]] and others) and a new generation of independent filmmaking in New York ([[Jim Jarmusch]], [[Tom DiCillo]], [[Steve Buscemi]], and [[Vincent Gallo]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxonline.org.uk/articles/no_wavelength(1).html NO WAVELENGTH: THE PARA-PUNK UNDERGROUND: [[Village Voice]] film critic [[Jim Hoberman]] discusses the New York New Wave film scene, including lo-fi super 8 films of [[Vivienne Dick]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other filmmakers associated with the movement included [[Charlie Ahearn (director)|Charlie Ahearn]], [[Manuel DeLanda]], [[Vivienne Dick]], [[Eric Mitchell (filmmaker and actor)|Eric Mitchell]], [[James Nares (artist)|James Nares]], [[Amos Poe]], [[Susan Seidelman]] and [[Casandra Stark Mele]].

In 1978, Nares released a well-known [[no wave]] Super 8 film titled ''Rome 78'', his only venture into feature-length, plot-driven film. Despite its large cast in period costumes, the work was not intended as a serious undertaking, as the actors interject self-conscious laughter into scenes and deliver seemingly improvised lines with over-the-top bravado. The film features no wave cinema regular [[Lydia Lunch]] along with Mitchell, [[James Chance]], [[John Lurie]], [[Judy Rifka]], Jim Sutcliffe, [[Lance Loud]], [[Mitch Corber]], [[Patti Astor]], artist David McDermott of [[McDermott &amp; McGough]], and [[Kristian Hoffman]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thevillager.com/villager_263/rebellionof.html Rebellion of the quiet Retrospective of James Nares, No Wave’s subtlest filmmaker]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coleen Fitzgibbon]] and [[Alan W. Moore]] created an 11:41-minute film in 1978 (finished in 2009) of a no wave concert to benefit [[Colab]] called "X Magazine Benefit”, documenting performances of [[DNA (American band)|DNA]], [[James Chance and the Contortions]], and [[Boris Policeband]] in NYC in the late 1970s. Shot in black and white Super 8 and edited on video, the film captures the gritty look and sound of the music scene during that era. In 2013 it was exhibited at Salon 94, an art gallery in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon94.com/video-wall COLEEN FITZGIBBON AND ALAN MOORE: X MAGAZINE BENEFIT COLAB 1978, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In 2010, French filmmaker Céline Danhier created a [[documentary film]] titled ''Blank City''. The film presents an [[oral history]] of the no wave cinema and Cinema of Transgression movements&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1398949/ IMDB Blank City (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; through interviews with Jarmusch, Kern, Buscemi, Poe, Seidelman, Ahearn, Zedd, [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]’s [[Debbie Harry]], hip-hop legend [[Fab 5 Freddy]], [[Thurston Moore]] of [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Jack Sargeant (writer)|Jack Sargeant]]. The soundtrack includes music by [[Patti Smith]], [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Richard Hell]] &amp; [[The Voidoids]], James Chance and the Contortions, [[Bush Tetras]] and Sonic Youth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blankcityfilm.com/ "Blank City"] - official film website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://centerinparis.uchicago.edu/news/new-york-no-wave-chicago-post-rock-deux-villes-deux-scènes NEW YORK NO WAVE - CHICAGO POST ROCK : DEUX VILLES, DEUX SCÈNES]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] celebrated the movement with the retrospective "No Wave Cinema", which included works by Jarmusch, Kern, Mitchell, Poe, Zedd, Scot and Beth B., [[Lizzie Borden (director)|Lizzie Borden]], [[Edo Bertoglio]] and [[Kembra Pfahler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Wave Cinema|url=http://www.madmuseum.org/series/no-wave-cinema|website=Museum of Arts and Design|publisher=Museum of Arts and Design|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robbins|first1=Christopher|title=See Classic, Rare New Wave/No Wave/Punk At Museum Of Art And Design|url=http://gothamist.com/2014/04/18/see_classic_rare_new_waveno_wavepun.php|website=Gothamist|publisher=Gothamist, LLC|accessdate=5 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509090521/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/18/see_classic_rare_new_waveno_wavepun.php|archivedate=9 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the later [[Dogme 95]] creative movement, No Wave Cinema has been described as a defining period in [[low budget film]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper|title=Low-budget movements that defined cinema|last=Coulter|first=Tomas|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nonsense word''', unlike a [[sememe]], may have no definition.

A '''stunt word''' is a nonsense word used for a special effect, or to attract attention, as part of a performance.

'''North Zone Culture Centre''' or '''''NZCC''''' in [[Patiala]] in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] state was first amongst several regional cultural centres established by [[Government of India]] to preserve and promote arts, crafts, traditions and cultural heritage of [[India]].

Establishment of ''North Zone Culture Centre'' was announced by then Prime Minister of India [[Rajiv Gandhi]] during his visit to [[Hussainiwala]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] on 23 March 1985.

The North Cultural Zone is one of seven [[Cultural Zones of India]] defined and provided with administrative infrastructure by the Government of India.&lt;ref name="wzccsite"&gt;{{Citation | title=West Zone Culture Center | publisher=West Zone Culture Centre | accessdate=2010-12-15 | url=http://www.wzccindia.com/ | quote=''...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14910">The '''One Dimension Group''' (''Al Bu'd al Wahad'') was a modern art group founded in Iraq, by [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] in 1971 which attempted to combine medieval [[Sufism|Sufi]] traditions with contemporary, abstract art. Although  the One Dimension Group was founded in Iraq, its members originated from across Arab nations, and its influence was felt across the Arab art world. 

==Background==

One Dimension is one of a number of [[Iraqi art#Art groups|art groups]] that formed in 20th-century Iraq. During the first world war, a small group of European officers and artists settled in Iraq, exposing young artists to Western art traditions and techniques. &lt;ref&gt;Davis, E., ''Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq,'' University of California Press, 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; While local artists and middle classes developed an appreciation for European art, the arts community searched for ways of synthesising indigenous art with international trends. In effect, these groups were seeking to forge an Arabic art aesthetic and to use art to help their nations reassert a sense of national identity. &lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F. (ed.), ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London:, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 25; Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between the 1930s and the early 1970s, more than six different art groups were formed: ''The Pioneers'' formed in the 1930s;&lt;ref&gt;Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad,'' Iraq, 2010, pp 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Avantgarde Group'' formed in 1950; &lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F. (ed.), ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London:, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;;  ''[[Iraqi art#Jama’et Baghdad lil Fenal-Hadith (The Baghdad Modern Art Group)|The Baghdad Modern Art Group]]'' formed in 1951; &lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Impressionists'' formed in 1953;&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, 23–25 November&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Corners Group'' founded in 1961;&lt;ref&gt;Ghareeb, E.A. and Dougherty, B., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Innovationists'' founded in 1963;&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Vision'' founded in 1968 and ''One Dimension'' founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of these groups endured for decades, while others were short-lived and abandoned within a few years of their formation. &lt;ref&gt;Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad,'' Iraq, 2010, pp 7-9; Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M12&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each of these groups developed different ideas about how to combine heritage and modernity and developed a different vision for a national art aesthetic. Although there were tensions in the different visions of these groups,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 79 -80&lt;/ref&gt; collectively, they actively searched for new national vision which would enable the country to develop internally, as well as take its place on a world stage.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ali, N. and Al-Najjar, D., ''We Are Iraqis: Aesthetics and Politics in a Time of War,'' Syracuse University Press, 2013, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of these art groups, the Baghdad Modern Art Group and the One Dimension Group are the most frequently cited.

==Brief history and philosophy==
The One Dimension Group was established formally in 1971 by the prominent Baghdadi artist and intellectual, Shakir Hassan Al Said, when he published a manifesto for the group.&lt;ref&gt;The manifesto was published in the Iraqi newspaper, ''al-Jamhuriyyah,'' issue no. 880, p. 8; See: Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Al Said had previously been a founding member of the Baghdad Group for Modern Art (Jama'at Baghdad lil-Fann al-Hadith) together with [[Jawad Saleem]] (1919-1961) and [[Jabra Ibrahim Jabra]] (1919-1994), but he along with several high profile artists, had withdrawn from that group when it lost its sense of direction, following the death of its founder, Jawad Saleem in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 51-52&lt;/ref&gt; 

The One Dimension manifesto gives voice to the group's commitment to both heritage and modernity and sought to distance itself from the modern Arab artists which they perceived as following European artistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S., "Shakir Hassan Al Said," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Shakir-Hassan-Al-Said.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; One Dimension's objectives are complex and sophisticated; it is philosophy, technique, style and a relationship between time and space, between the visual and the non-visual.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 109M&lt;/ref&gt; The "one dimension" is an oblique reference to [[Sufism]], which has been described as "the inner dimension of [[Islam]]."&lt;ref&gt;Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam: Language and Meaning'' (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2009), p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the One Dimension Group were multi-dimensional and complex. At the most basic level, the group rejected two and three-two dimensional artwork in favour of a single "inner dimension". This approach was influenced by both the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]] and the traditions of [[Arabic calligraphy]] and associated [[Sufi]] movements. In practice, a single inner dimension was difficult to realise because most artworks are produced on two-dimensional surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52; Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; At a more profound level, one dimension refers to "eternity".&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articls/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]; also see Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;Al Said explained:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articls/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|"From a philosophical point of view, the One-Dimension is eternity, or an extension of the past to the time before the existence of pictorial surface; to the non-surface. Our consciousness of the world is a relative presence. It is our self-existence while our absence is our eternal presence." }}

Al Said actively searched for relationships between time and space; and for a visual language that would connect Iraq's deep art traditions with modern art methods and materials. The incorporation of callij (calligraphy) letters into modern artworks was an important aspect of this relationship. The letter became part of Al Said's transition from figurative art to abstract art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic calligraphy was charged with intellectual and esoteric Sufi meaning,&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95&lt;/ref&gt; in that it was an explicit reference to a Medieval theology where letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Said, and members of the One Dimension group, searched for a new artistic identity, drawn from within their own culture and heritage and successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy and Arabic motifs, into contemporary, abstract compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; At an individual level, these artists were carrying out their own dialogue with national identity and modern art, at a broader level they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Arab identity.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294; Mejcher-Atassi, S., "Shakir Hassan Al Said," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Shakir-Hassan-Al-Said.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Al Said and his group successfully bridged the gap between modernity and heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq: The Ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, they "charted a new Arabo-Islamic art aesthetic, and thus initiated a possible alternative for art valuating for local and regional art other than those allowed through an exclusionary Western canon of art history."&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

In focusing on the Arabic letter as the central element of his work, al-Said soon was collaborating with [[Madiha Omar]] (who by then was living in the US) and [[Jamil Hamoudi]], who both joined his group.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52&lt;/ref&gt; The One Dimension Group was very significant to the so-called School of Calligraphic Art (also known as the [[Hurufiyya movement]]) which comprised groups of artists that had emerged independently across North Africa and the Middle East in the second half of the 20th century, with the common thread being that each group searched for ways to integrate tradition and modernity in a way that would contributed to a distinct national style.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52; Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt;

Although each of these groups developed locally, and went by different labels at the local level, collectively, these groups and their practitioners would become known as the School of Calligraphy (or [[Hurufiyya movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, the movement emerged in the 1950s and was known as the ''Al-hurufiyyah movement'',&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006&lt;/ref&gt; while in Iraq, the movement was known as ''Al Bu'd al Wahad'' (or the One Dimension Group)",&lt;ref&gt;"Shaker Hassan Al Said," Darat al Funum, Online: www.daratalfunun.org/main/activit/curentl/anniv/exhib3.html; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran, the [[Iranian modern and contemporary art#Saqqakhaneh movement|Saqqa-Khaneh movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, artworks took on a slightly different form - since artists rejected Western art traditions and included both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, the movement was known as the ''Old Khartoum School.'' &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.R., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Original members of the One Dimension group include: [[Rafa al-Nasiri]], [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], [[Nuri al-Rawi]], [[Dia Azzawi]], [[Jamil Hamoudi]], Hashem Samarchi (b. 1939), Hashim al-Baghdadi (1917-1973) and Saad Shaker (1935-2005).&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture'', Kassel University Press, 2017, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of Perpetual Help'''  (also known as '''Our Lady of Perpetual Succour''')&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] of 1911 uses the latter name: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11699b.htm John Magnier, "Our Lady of Perpetual Succour" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1911); but the former is more prevalent today.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Roman Catholic]] title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] as represented in a celebrated 15th-century [[Byzantine art|Byzantine icon]] also associated with the same [[Marian apparition]].

The [[icon]] originated from the [[Keras Kardiotissas Monastery]] and has been in [[Rome]] since 1499. Today it is permanently enshrined in the [[Church of St. Alphonsus Liguori, Rome|Church of Saint Alphonsus]], where the official [[Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help]] text is prayed weekly. 

On 23 June 1867, [[Pope Pius IX]] granted the image its [[Canonical Coronation]] along with its present title. The Redemptorist priests are the only religious order currently entrusted by the [[Holy See]] to protect and propagate a Marian religious work of art. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] [[iconography]], the image is known as the ''”Virgin [[Theotokos]] of the Passion''” due to the instruments of the [[Passion of Jesus Christ]] present on the image.

The feast day of the image is celebrated on June 27, with novena devotions held every Wednesday. Under [[Pope Pius XII]]'s Pontificate, the image was designated as the national [[Patroness]] of the [[Republic of Haiti]] and [[Almoradi]], Spain. In addition, [[Pope John Paul II]] issued a [[canonical coronation]] for a similar image in [[Jaworzno]], [[Poland]] in 16 June 1999&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanktuariumjaworzno.wiara.org.pl/historia.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Due to the propagation of the [[Redemptorist]] Priests since 1865, the image has become very popular among Roman Catholics. Modern reproductions are oftentimes displayed in residential homes, commercial establishments, and public transportation.

==Description==
[[File:Arcangelmiguel.JPG|thumb|Detail of the icon, showing the [[Archangel Michael]].]]
The original wooden icon is suspended on the altar, measures 17" × 21" inches and is written on hard nut wood with a gold leaf background.&lt;ref&gt;''Fest-schrift zum Andenken an die Wieder-Eröffnung der St. Peter's Kirche'', St. Peter's Church Philadelphia, 1901, page 93&lt;/ref&gt; The image depicts the following symbols: 

* The Blessed Virgin Mary — wearing a dress of dark red, representing the Passion of Jesus, with a blue mantle, representing her [[Perpetual virginity of Mary|perpetual virginity]], and cloaked veil, which represents her pure modesty. 
* The subject shows Mary looking towards the faithful, while pointing at her son, [[Jesus Christ]] who is frightened by the instruments of [[crucifixion]] and is depicted with a fallen sandal.
* The left side is [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael Archangel]] —  carrying the [[Holy Lance|lance]] and [[Holy Sponge|sponge]] of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]]. 
* On the right side is [[Gabriel (archangel)|Saint Gabriel Archangel]] carrying a [[Patriarchal cross|3-bar cross]] used by Popes at the time and [[Nail (relic)|nails]]. 
* The [[Virgin Mary]] has a star on her forehead signifying her role as [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]] while the cross on the side has been claimed as referring to the Greek monastery which produced the icon. 

Byzantine depictions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in art have three stars, one star each on the shoulder and one on the forehead. This type of icon is called [[Hodegetria]], where Mary is pointing to her Son, known as a ''Theotokos of the Passion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=theotokos+of+the+passion&amp;qpvt=theotokos+of+the+passion&amp;FORM=IGRE |title=Types of Theotokos of the Passion |publisher=Bing.com |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary has long slender nose, thin lips, and smoothly arched eyebrows, evidence of being made by a Greek artist. The veil and her face itself are rounded, indicating holiness. The size of the mother is also out of proportion to her son, a deliberate intent by the artist Mary as larger than life.

The Greek inscriptions read '''MP-ΘΥ''' (Μήτηρ Θεοῦ, ''Mother of God''), '''ΟΑΜ''' (Ὁ Ἀρχάγγελος Μιχαήλ, ''Michael the Archangel''), '''ΟΑΓ''' (Ὁ Ἀρχάγγελος Γαβριήλ, ''Gabriel the Archangel'') and '''[[Christogram|IC-XC]]''' (Ἰησοῦς Χριστός, ''Jesus Christ''), respectively. 

The icon has a gold background on a walnut panel, believed to be from Crete. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Icons-Saints-Eastern-Orthodox-Church/dp/0892368454|title=''Icons and saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church''|author=Alfredo Tradigo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cretan School]] was the source of the many icons imported into Europe from the late Middle Ages through the Renaissance. The gold background represents the Kingdom of God.&lt;ref name=shrine&gt;[http://trinityacres.blogspot.com/2014/07/our-lady-of-perpetual-help.html Trinity Acres]&lt;/ref&gt; The round halo surrounding the Virgin Mary's head is styled called ''Estofado'', which is an artistic effect created by making dented holes into the icon to reflect light from the gold background. The icon was cleaned and restored once in 1866 and again in the year 1940.

==Pious legends==
Popular legends claim that the icon to be a true copy of a painting that according to legend was painted by [[Saint Luke]] using the meal table of the [[Holy Family]] in [[Nazareth]], and in [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition was often identified with the ''Hodegetria'' icon,&lt;ref name="OUR LADY OF FATIMA CRUSADER BULLETIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salvemariaregina.info/SalveMariaRegina/SMR-112.html |title=Our Mother of Perpetual Help |publisher=Salvemariaregina.info |date=1921-07-30 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consider it to be a miraculous imprint of the Virgin Mary both in the [[Latin Church|Latin]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] communities. This belief is common in many [[Hodegetria]] icons who have similar claims of Lucan legends.

==Origin and discovery==
[[File:Arcangelgabriel.JPG|thumb|Close-up of the [[Archangel Gabriel]].]]
The earliest written account of the image comes from a Latin and [[Italian language|Italian]] plaque placed in the church of [[San Matteo in Via Merulana]] where it was first venerated by the public in 1499. The writer of the icon is unknown, but according to a parchment attached to the painting that accompanied the icon, it was stolen by a merchant sailing to [[Rome]] from the island of [[Crete]]. (The [[Keras Kardiotissas Monastery]] is regarded as the monastery from which the icon was stolen.)&lt;ref&gt;http://orthodoxcrete.com/en/places/holy-monastery-of-kera-kardiotissa/&lt;/ref&gt;

The image remained in the private possession of a Roman merchant and his family until March 27, 1499, when the icon was transferred to the church of San Matteo&lt;ref&gt;[https://redemptorists.net/redemptorists/devotion-to-omph/ "Our Mother of Perpetual Help", The Redemptorists]&lt;/ref&gt;  where it remained for 300 years. The picture was then popularly called the Madonna di San Matteo.

==Transfer==
In 1798, [[France|French]] troops under [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] occupied Rome as part of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], establishing the
short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] and taking [[Pope Pius VI]] prisoner. Among the several churches demolished during the French occupation was San Matteo in Via Merulana, which housed the icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquinasandmore.com/catholic-articles/who-is-our-lady-of-perpetual-help/article/110 |title=Who is Our Lady of Perpetual Help? |publisher=Aquinasandmore.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Augustinians|Augustinian friars]] who rescued the icon first took it to the nearby Church of St. Eusebius, then later set it up on a side altar in the Church of Santa Maria in Posterula.

In January 1855, the Redemptorist priests purchased ''Villa Caserta'' in Rome along the Via Merulana and converted it into their headquarters. Without realizing it, the property they had purchased was once the church and monastery of Saint Matthew, the site which the Virgin reportedly chose as the icon's shrine.

Decades later, [[Pope Pius IX]] invited the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist Fathers]] to set up a Marian house of veneration in Rome, in response to which the Redemptorists built the [[Church of St. Alphonsus Liguori, Rome|Church of St. Alphonsus Liguori]] at that location. The Redemptorists were thus established on the Via Merulana, not knowing that it had once been the site of the Church of San Matteo and shrine of the once-famous icon.

==Present caretaker==
[[File:Manosdelaperpe.JPG|left|thumb|Detail of the hands of the virgin.]]
[[Pope Pius IX]] sent a letter dated 11 December 1865 to Father General Mauron, C.Ss.R., ordered that the image be once again publicly venerated in Via Merulana, the new church of Saint Alphonsus. The same Pontiff directed the Augustinian friars to surrender the icon to the Redemptorist priests, on condition that the Redemptorists must supply the Augustinians with another picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Help or a good copy of the icon in exchange as a gesture of goodwill.
Pope Pius IX instructions to the [[Redemptorists]] were:

{{quote|The Cardinal Prefect of Propaganda will call the Superior of the community of Sancta Maria in Posterula and will tell him that it is Our desire that the image of Most Holy Mary, referred to in this petition, be again placed between Saint John and St. Mary Major; the Redemptorists shall replace it with another adequate picture.''&lt;ref name="The History of the Icon"/&gt;}}

Upon its official transfer, Pope Pius IX finally gave his Apostolic Blessing and titled the icon ''Mater de Perpetuo Succursu'' (Mother of Perpetual Help). On 23 June 1867, the image was given a [[Canonical Coronation]] by the [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Vatican]] [[chapter (religion)|Chapter]] in a solemn and official recognition of the Marian icon under that title. 

On 21 April 1866, the Redemptorist Superior General gave one of the first copies of the icon to [[Pope Pius IX]]. This copy is preserved in the chapel of the Redemptorists' Generalate in Rome. The original icon remains under the care of the Redemptorist Fathers at the Church of St. Alphonsus with the latest restoration of the icon having taken place in 1990.&lt;ref name="The History of the Icon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssr.com/english/whoarewe/iconstory.shtml |title=The History of the Icon |publisher=Cssr.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
[[File:Antesrestaur.png|thumb|250px|Photograph of the icon prior to its restoration in 1866.]]

In 1866, the icon underwent restoration by the Polish painter Leopold Nowotny (1822-1870).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cssr.com/english/whoarewe/iconstory.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the icon was taken down from its altar for new photography and image restoration commissioned by the General Government of Redemptorists. The Redemptorist Order entered into contract with the Technical Department at the [[Vatican Museum]] to restore the icon and prevent further fungal damage to the icon. The restoration process involved [[X-ray]], [[infra-red]] scanning, technical analysis of the paint and [[ultra-violet]] testing along with a [[Carbon Dating|Carbon-14-test]] which placed the icon between the year 1325-1480. Artistic analysis of the icon revealed that the facial structure of the icon was altered due to previous overpainting, resulting in a combination of "oriental and occidental" features of the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssr.com/english/whoarewe/iconstory.shtml |title=Official Website of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer. Superior General, Michael Brehl, C.SsR. - Latest Restoration of the Icon |publisher=Cssr.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
Our Lady of Perpetual Help has been venerated across many cultures and thus bears several titles in different languages, such as "Mother of Perpetual Succour", ''Mutter von immerwährenden Hilfe'', ''Nuestra Señora del Perpetuo Socorro'', ''Notre-Dame du Perpétuel Secours'', ''Mater del Perpetuo Succursu'', and ''Ina ng Laging Saklolo''. 

===United States of America===
In 1878, the [[Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] obtained a certified copy of the icon being the first in the [[United States]]. Between 1927 and 1935, the first American novena service dedicated to the icon was recited in [[St. Alphonsus Catholic Church, St. Louis|Saint Alphonsus "The Rock" church]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and various other Redemptorist stations around the United States.

===The Philippines===
[[File:NationalShrineofOurMotherofPerpetualHelpjf9967 07.JPG|thumb|The National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help (also called [[Baclaran Church]]) is one of the Philippines' largest Marian shrines. It is authorised by the [[Holy See]] to remain open 24 hours a day throughout the year.]]

Our Lady of Perpetual Help is widely venerated by [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Filipino Catholics]] and [[Overseas Filipino]] communities. A German copy of the icon is venerated in the [[National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help]] in [[Baclaran, Parañaque City]], [[Metro Manila]] – the country's centre of devotion to the icon. Pope [[John Paul II]] once said Mass at the shrine as [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and later prayed before the icon during his first pastoral visit to the country in February 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1981/february/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19810217_manila-baclaran_en.html |title=Vatican website: Pope John Paul II in the Philippines |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1981-02-17 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all Catholic churches and chapels in the Philippines have a replica of the icon, often enshrined in a [[Bye-altar|side altar]]. Copies of the icon can also be found in countless houses, businesses, and even public utility vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Culture-Customs-Philippines-Cultures-World/dp/0313304157 Culture and Customs of the Philippines (Cultures and Customs of the World)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Relations-Between-Religions-Cultures-Southeast/dp/1565182502/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503193741&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Relations+between+religions+and+cultures+in+Southeast+Asia Relations Between Religions and Cultures in Southeast Asia: Indonesian Philosophical Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Wednesday, many congregations hold services where they publicly recite the [[rosary]] and [[Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help|the icon's associated novena]], along with a priest delivering [[Benediction]] and celebrating a [[votive Mass]] in its honour. Devotees today still use the same Novena booklet first published by [[Ireland|Irish]] Redemptorists, who introduced the icon and its devotion to the Philippines in the early 1900s. The Filipino Diaspora continue keeping the Wednesday Novena, holding novena services in their respective parishes overseas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Asian-American-Religions-Boundaries-Ethnicity/dp/081471630X Asian American Religions: The Making and Remaking of Borders and Boundaries (Religion, Race, and Ethnicity) ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Religion-Corner-Bliss-Nirvana-Communities/dp/0822345471/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503193875&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Religion+at+the+corner+of+bliss+and+nirvana+Lois+Ann+Lorentzen Religion at the Corner of Bliss and Nirvana: Politics, Identity, and Faith in New Migrant Communities]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Saint John the Baptist Parish, [[Garcia Hernandez, Bohol]], the feast of the image is held on April 27 instead of the usual liturgical date. The 48 sub-chapels in the parish participate in the annual feast, while every 27th month has each chapel's respective congregations holding a procession of the icon. This form of the devotion began in 1923 when two missionary priests, a Dutchman named Thomas and a German named Jorge, brought the icon to the town. The original icon can still be seen in a chapel of the parish; its reverse bears a Latin inscription attesting to its dedication.

===Patronage===
The town of [[Almoradi]], [[Spain]] invokes the patronage of Our Mother of Perpetual Help. In 1918, the son of Marquis of Rioflorido, Jose Carlos fell ill with [[pleurisy]]. His mother, the noble lady Desamparado Fontes fed him a silk fabric cloth touched to the icon of Perpetual Help in Rome which resulted in an instantaneous healing later claimed to be miraculous. As a token of thanksgiving, the lady Fontes officially donated funds to begin the Confraternity of Almoradi. On 29 May 1919, Our Lady of Perpetual Help was officially enthroned in Saint Andrew's Parish as the official patroness of the town. In 1945, [[Pope Pius XII]] confirmed this patronage by a pontifical decree. On its 50th anniversary in 1969, a public coronation of this image was held and the crowns were made by [[Santo (art)|Santero]] artist ''Jose David'' by the town mayor and its authorities. 

In addition to this, Our Lady of Perpetual Help is the designated the national [[patron saint]] of [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/patrons-of-haiti/ |title=patrons of Haiti |publisher=Saints.sqpn.com |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roman Catholic [[Bishop]] [[Guy Sansaricq]], former Haitian president [[Élie Lescot]] and his cabinet petitioned the [[Holy See]] to make Our Mother of Perpetual Help the national [[Patroness]] of Haiti in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netny.net/currents/video/stories/haitians-pray-for-perpetual-help-for-their-homeland-62911/ |title=Haitians pray for perpetual help for their homeland 6/29/11 : Currents |publisher=Netny.net |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2014-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721114632/http://netny.net/currents/video/stories/haitians-pray-for-perpetual-help-for-their-homeland-62911/ |archivedate=July 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Haitians credit the Virgin Mary under this title in performing miracles to prevent a [[cholera]] and [[smallpox]] outbreak which ravaged the country in 1882. The Holy See approved the request for patronage under the Pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]]. The Our Lady of Perpetual Help is also present in numerous Haitian public stamps used by the Haitian postal office. In January 2010, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] invoked Our Lady of Perpetual Help for Haiti's earthquake relief through Archbishop Louis Kébreau.

Our Lady of Perpetual Help is also the patroness of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salina|Diocese of Salina]], Kansas in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://salinadiocese.org/home/about-us/salina-arms|title=Salina Arms|website=salinadiocese.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Middlesbrough|Diocese of Middlesbrough]] in England, and of the Catholic Diocese of Issele-Uku in Nigeria.

[[File:Armlet from the Oxus Treasure BM 1897.12-31.116.jpg|thumb|300px|One of a pair of armlets from the Oxus Treasure, which has lost its inlays of precious stones or enamel]]
[[File:Oxus chariot model.jpg|thumb|300px|Gold model chariot]]

The '''Oxus treasure''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: گنجینه آمودریا) is a collection of about 180 surviving pieces of metalwork in gold and silver, the majority rather small, plus perhaps about 200 coins, from the [[Achaemenid]] Persian period which were found by the [[Oxus river]] about 1877-1880.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 5&lt;/ref&gt; The exact place and date of the find remain unclear, and it is likely that many other pieces from the hoard were melted down for bullion; early reports suggest there were originally some 1500 coins, and mention types of metalwork that are not among the surviving pieces. The metalwork is believed to date from the sixth to fourth centuries BC, but the coins show a greater range, with some of those believed to belong to the treasure coming from around 200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 48, 57-58&lt;/ref&gt; The most likely origin for the treasure is that it belonged to a temple, where [[votive offering]]s were deposited over a long period. How it came to be deposited is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 58-61&lt;/ref&gt;

As a group, the treasure is the most important survival of what was once an enormous production of Achaemenid work in precious metal.  It displays a very wide range of quality of execution, with the many gold votive plaques mostly crudely executed, some perhaps by the donors themselves, while other objects are of superb quality, presumably that expected by the court.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 23-46, 57; Yamauchi, 340-341&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Museum]] now has nearly all the surviving metalwork, with one of the pair of griffin-headed bracelets on loan from the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and displays them in Room 52. The group arrived at the museum by different routes, with many items bequeathed to the nation by [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]].  The coins are more widely dispersed, and more difficult to firmly connect with the treasure.  A group believed to come from it is in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Peterburg]], and other collections have examples.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objects==
[[File:Gold statuettes from the Oxus Treasure by Nickmard Khoey.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Gold statuettes carrying ''[[barsom]]s'', with a rider behind]]
[[File:Gold fish shaped vessel from the Oxus Treasure by Nickmard Khoey.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The gold fish vessel]]

Achaemenid style arose rapidly with the very quick growth of the huge empire, which swallowed up the artistic centres of the ancient [[Near East]] and much of the Greek world, and mixed influences and artists from these. Although continuing influences from these sources can often be detected the Achaemenids formed a distinct style of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 52-55; Frankfort, chapter 12, especially pp. 376-378, mostly dealing with the treasure&lt;/ref&gt;

The griffin-headed bracelets from the hoard are typical of the 5th to 4th century BC court style of Achaemenid Persia.  Bracelets of a similar form to ones from the treasure can be seen on reliefs from [[Persepolis]] being given as tribute, whilst [[Xenophon]] writes that armlets (among other things) were gifts of honour at the Persian court. Glass, enamel or semi-precious stone inlays within the bracelets' hollow spaces have now been lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/g/gold_griffin-headed_armlet.aspx Bracelet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194928/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/g/gold_griffin-headed_armlet.aspx |date=2007-09-27 }}, British Museum; Curtis, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[John Boardman (art historian)|John Boardman]] regards the gold scabbard, decorated with tiny figures showing a lion hunt, as pre-Achaemenid [[Medes|Median]] work of about 600 BC, drawing on [[Assyria]]n styles, though other scholars disagree, and the British Museum continues to date it to the 5th or 4th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, throughout; Curtis, 34-35; [http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/ceremonial_gold_scabbard_from.aspx Gold scabbard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809061947/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/ceremonial_gold_scabbard_from.aspx |date=2007-08-09 }}, British Museum; see also Yamauchi, 341 (calling it a "sheath")&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving objects, an uncertain proportion of the original finds, can be divided into a number of groups.

===Sculptures===
There are a number of small figurines, some of which may have been detached from larger objects. The single male figures appear to show worshippers rather than deities.  The largest is most unusual for Persian art in showing a nude youth (in silver) standing in a formal pose, with a large conical hat covered in gold foil. The statuette shows Greek influence, in the figure and the fact of being nude, but is not typical of [[ancient Greek art]].  Two hollow gold heads of young males, rather crudely executed, probably belonged to composite statues with the main body in wood or some other material.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 14-15, 31-33; 
[http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/g/gold_head_from_the_oxus_treasu.aspx Gold head] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809062009/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/g/gold_head_from_the_oxus_treasu.aspx |date=2007-08-09 }} and [http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/cast_silver_statuette_from_the.aspx Silver statuette of naked youth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707051215/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/cast_silver_statuette_from_the.aspx |date=2007-07-07 }}, British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; One figure in silver and gold has a headdress that suggests he may be a king.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 31-33; [https://archive.is/20121223162606/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/cast_silver_statuette_of_a_bea.aspx Silver statuette], British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sculptural objects include two model chariots in gold, one incomplete, plus figures of a horse and a rider that may belong to this or other model groups, as may two other horses cut out from sheet gold.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 28-31&lt;/ref&gt;  The wheels of the complete chariot would originally have turned freely, and it had received at least one repair in antiquity.  It is pulled by four horses (rather small, and with only nine legs surviving between them) and carries two figures, a driver and a seated passenger, both wearing [[torc]]s.  The chariot has handrails at the open rear to assist getting in and out, while the solid front carries the face of the protective Egyptian dwarf-god [[Bes]].&lt;ref&gt;Mongiatti et al., 28, 32; Curtis, 28-31&lt;/ref&gt;  A leaping [[ibex]] was probably the handle of an [[amphora]]-type vase, and compares with handles shown on tribute vessels in the Persepolis reliefs, as well as an example now in the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 44-45, 56-57; [[:File:Vase handle ibex Louvre AO2748.jpg|Vase handle with winged ibex in the Louvre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewellery and fittings===
The two griffin-headed bracelets or armlets are the most spectacular pieces by far, despite lacking their stone inlays. There are a number of other bracelets, some perhaps [[torc]]s for the neck, several with simpler animal head terminals variously depicting goats, ibex, sheep, bulls, ducks, lions, and fantastic creatures.  Many have inlays, or empty cells for them; it used to be thought that this technique was acquired from Ancient Egyptian jewellery (as in some of [[Tutankhamun]]'s grave goods), but Assyrian examples are now known.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis &amp; Tallis, 132-133, and nos 153-171&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 12 finger rings with flat [[bezel (jewellery)|bezels]] engraved for use as [[signet ring]]s, and two stone [[cylinder seal]]s, one finely carved with a battle scene.&lt;ref&gt;Collon&lt;/ref&gt;

The griffin-headed bracelets were also the most complex objects to manufacture, being cast in several elements, then worked in many different techniques, and soldered together. Some of the surfaces are very thin, and show signs of damage, and in one place repair with a soldered patch.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis &amp; Tallis, 135-136&lt;/ref&gt;

A "Gold plaque in the form of a lion-griffin, with the body of an ibex and a leaf-shaped tail", with missing inlay, has two prongs behind for attaching it, and may have been an ornament for a cap or the hair, or part of an object.  The animal's legs are folded beneath its body in a way characteristic of the [[Scythian]] animal style of the southern Russian steppes, an influence also seen in other pieces such a ring with a lion.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis &amp; Tallis, no. 194; Curtis, 46-48;

[[File:Chopped gold pieces from the Oxus Treasure by Nickmard Khoey.jpg|thumb|Votive plaques]]

A stylized birds-head ornament can be recognised, like the finely-decorated scabbard of "Median" shape, as very similar to that of a soldier from a Persepolis relief, where it forms the crest to his bow-case.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; These seem to be the only items relating to weapons, though other pieces may have decorated horse harness.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 46&lt;/ref&gt;  Another group of plaques were probably [[bracteate]]s intended to be sewn onto clothing through the small holes round their edges. These have a variety of motifs, including the face of the Egyptian dwarf-god [[Bes]], lion-griffins, a [[sphinx]], and a cut-out figure apparently showing a king (see illustration below; Bes is centre in the top row, the king at bottom right).&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 44-46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Votive plaques===
The British Museum has 51 thin gold plaques with incised designs, which are regarded as votive plaques left by devotees at a temple as an offering to the deity. They are mostly rectangular with the designs in a vertical format, and range from 2 to 20&amp;nbsp;cm tall. Most show a single human figure facing left, many carrying a bunch of twigs called a ''[[barsom]]'' used in offerings; these probably represent the offeror.  The dress of the figures shows the types known as "Median" and "Persian" to modern historians, and the quality of the execution is mostly relatively low, but varies greatly, with some appearing to have been incised by amateurs.  Three show animals, a horse, a donkey and a camel; possibly it was their health that was the subject of the offering.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 23-27; [http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/g/gold_plaque_from_the_oxus_trea.aspx Gold plaque] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809175936/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/g/gold_plaque_from_the_oxus_trea.aspx |date=2007-08-09 }}, British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;  One large figure is in shallow relief within its incised outline (illustrated).

===Vessels===
The London group includes bowls, a gold jug, and a handle from a vase or ewer in the form of a leaping ibex,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 41-44; [http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/g/gold_jug_from_the_oxus_treasur.aspx Gold jug] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809180049/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/g/gold_jug_from_the_oxus_treasur.aspx |date=2007-08-09 }}, British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; which is similar to a winged Achaemenid handle in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis &amp; Tallis, no. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  No [[rhyton]] drinking vessels were found, but the British Museum has two other Achaemenid examples, one ending in a griffin's head similar to that on the bracelets in the treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis &amp; Tallis, no. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;  A hollow gold fish, apparently representing a species of [[carp]] found only in the Oxus, has a hole at its mouth and a loop for suspension; it may have contained oil or perfume, or hung as one of a group of pendants.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis &amp; Tallis, no. 150; Curtis, 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coins===
The association of surviving coins with the treasure is less generally accepted than for the other items, and [[Ormonde Maddock Dalton|O. M. Dalton]] of the British Museum, author of the [[monograph]] on the treasure, was reluctant to identify any specific coins as part of it, while Sir Alexander Cunningham (see below) disagreed, identifying about 200. The Russian scholar E.V. Zeymal associated 521 surviving coins with the treasure, without extending the ''[[terminus post quem]]'' for deposition of the treasure beyond Cunningham's figure of about 180 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Zeymal, v-vi; Curtis, 48&lt;/ref&gt;  The coins associated with the treasure include examples from various Achaemenid mints and dates, but also later ones from after the conquest of the Empire by [[Alexander the Great]], with the latest being of the reigns of [[Antiochus the Great]] (r. 223-187 BC) and [[Euthydemus I of Bactria]] (r. c. 235-200 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 48; for further details see Yamauchi, 342-343&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Gold artifacts from the Oxus Treasure by Nickmard Khoey.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Gold plaques for attaching to clothing]]
The treasure was evidently discovered by local people somewhere on the north bank of the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]] in what is today [[Tajikistan]] but was in the 1870s in the [[Emirate of Bokhara]], which was in the process of being swallowed up by the [[Russian Empire]].  Then as now, the south bank of the Oxus was [[Afghanistan]]; at the period when the treasure originated the whole area was part of the Persian Empire. The approximate area of the discovery is fairly clear; it was near, perhaps some three miles south of, [[Takhti-Sangin]], where an important temple was excavated by Soviet archaeologists in the 20th century, producing a large number of finds of metalwork and other objects, which seem to have been deposited from about 300 BC to as late as the third century AD. While it is tempting to connect the temple and treasure, as some scholars have proposed, the range of objects found, and a founding date for the temple proposed by the excavators of about 300 BC, do not neatly match up.  The area was a major ancient crossing point for the Oxus, and the treasure may have come from further afield.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 9-15, 58-60&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention in print of the treasure was an article in a Russian newspaper in 1880, written by a Russian general who in 1879 was in the area enquiring into the [[Trans-Caspian railway]] that the Russians had just begun to construct. He recounted that local reports said that treasure had been found in the ruins of an ancient fort called "Takht-i Kuwad", which was sold to Indian merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  A later report by Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], the British general and archaeologist who was the first Director of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], described the finds, which he said began in 1877, as being in the river itself, "scattered about in the sands of the river", in a place exposed in the dry season, though another account he later gave, based on new information, rather confused the issue.  Cunningham acquired many pieces himself through dealers in northern India (modern [[Pakistan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 11-13; 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Another account by a British general owning some objects said that they had been discovered in 1876, exposed by "a land slip of the river bank".&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 13&lt;/ref&gt;  Hopeful diggers continued to excavate the site for years afterwards, and perhaps objects continued to be found; accounts from locals mention many gold "idols", a gold tiger, and other objects not tallying with the surviving pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 13-15&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One large group of objects, perhaps the bulk of the treasure, was bought from locals by three merchants from [[Bokhara]] in 1880, who unwisely left their convoy on the road south from [[Kabul]] to [[Peshawar]] and were captured by Afghan tribesmen, who carried them and their goods into the hills, but allowed a servant of the merchants to escape.  News of the episode reached Captain Francis Charles Burton, a British [[political officer (British Empire)|political officer]] in Afghanistan, who immediately set out with two orderlies.  About midnight he came upon the robbers, who had already begun to fight among themselves, presumably over the division of the loot, with four of them lying wounded on the ground. The treasure was spread out on the floor of the cave they were sheltered in.  In a parlay Burton recovered a good part of the treasure, and later a further portion, which he restored to the merchants.  In gratitude, they sold him the bracelet which he sold to the Victoria and Albert Museum (now on loan to the British Museum) for £1,000 in 1884.  The merchants then continued to [[Rawalpindi]] in modern [[Pakistan]] to sell the rest of the Treasure; Cunningham acquired many of these pieces, and though dealers, Franks others.  The robbers evidently considered the objects as bullion, and had cut up some larger ones, such as a gold scabbard now in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 15-23. The fullest account of Burton's involvement is in Dalton, 2-3, although it is unclear where he got his information from.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other pieces may have been cut up in antiquity (like [[hacksilver]]), or upon discovery at the site.  Franks later bought Cunningham's collection, and bequeathed all his objects to the British Museum at his death in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 23&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:The Oxus Treasure by Nickmard Khoey (BM)1.jpg|thumb|right|Assorted small objects from the Oxus treasure]]

The incomplete model chariot and a detached figure of a rider were presented to the [[Viceroy of India]] at the time, [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton]] (son of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|the bestselling novelist]]) by Sir [[Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari|Louis Cavagnari]], the British representative in [[Kabul]] after the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].  Cavagnari, his mission and their guards were all massacred in Kabul on 3 September 1879. Lytton's rider was acquired by the British Museum in 1931, and the chariot group in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious context==
The Achaemenid kings, at least after [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Cambyses]], describe themselves in inscriptions as worshippers of [[Ahuramazda]], but it is not clear if their religious practice included [[Zoroastrianism]].  It is also evident that it was not the Persian way to impose the royal religious beliefs on their subjects (as for example the Jews, whose religious practices were not interfered with after they were conquered).  Other Persian cults were the worship of [[Mithra]] and of [[Zurvan]], and other local cults seem to have continued under the empire. The religious context of the treasure is unclear, although it is thought to have come from a temple.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 55-57; Curtis &amp; Tallis, 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
[[File:Apadana Persepolis Iran.JPG|thumb|left|Comparable objects in the "Apadama" reliefs at [[Persepolis]]: armlets, bowls, and ''[[amphorae]]'' with griffin handles are given as [[tribute]]]]
The circumstances of the discovery and trading of the pieces, and their variety of styles and quality of workmanship, cast some doubt on their authenticity from the start, and "necessitate a cautious treatment of the Oxus Treasure, for it has passed through places of evil repute and cannot have come out quite unscathed", as Dalton put it in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 4 (quoted); both Dalton and Muscarella, 1027-1030 (and at great length in other works) expand on the "evil repute" of Asian art markets.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Dalton records that Indian dealers initially made copies of items and tried to pass them off to Franks, who though not deceived, bought some "at a small percentage over the gold value" and then received the genuine objects, which were easily distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 4 (quoted)&lt;/ref&gt;  Considerable comfort has been received from the objects' similarity to later Achaemenid finds, many excavated under proper archaeological conditions, which the Oxus Treasure certainly was not.  In particular, finds of jewellery including armlets and torcs in a tomb at [[Susa]] by a French expedition from 1902 onwards (now in the Louvre) are closely similar to the Oxus finds.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

As the quality and style of the objects was generally considered to have stood the test of time, concerns over the antiquity of the great majority of the objects reduced over the years.  The issue was revived in 2003 when the archaeologist [[Oscar Muscarella]], employed by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York for 40 years, was reported in ''[[The Times]]'', in a story by [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]], to have "labelled as mostly fake" the treasure.&lt;ref&gt;"All that glisters isn’t old", by Peter Watson, December 19, 2003, [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article1715928.ece ''The Times'' archive]&lt;/ref&gt;  However he was attacked by the Director of the Metropolitan, [[Philippe de Montebello]], who said Muscarella, a long-standing critic of museums' tolerance and even encouragement of the trade in [[illegal antiquities]], only remained there because of the "exigencies of academic tenure", and was himself criticised for suppressing debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artwatchinternational.org/articles/the-metropolitan-and-the-oxus-treasure "The Metropolitan and the Oxus Treasure"], ''ArtWatch'', January 5, 2004; "The Oxus Treasure", letter from the Director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 26, 2003, [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/letters/article2074842.ece ''The Times'' archive]: "I am frankly astonished by the unofficial comments about the Oxus Treasure at the British Museum from someone you call “a distinguished archaeologist” at the Metropolitan, but who is someone whom we have marginalized within our museum..."&lt;/ref&gt;  In an article on the Oxus Treasure published in 2003 Muscarella goes nothing like as far, but does fiercely attack the assumed unity of the treasure and the narratives of its [[provenience]], and is sceptical of the authenticity of some of the votive plaques (especially the largest in the illustration above).&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted as Chapter 31 in Muscarella, 1036-1038 on the plaques&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up article, John Curtis has argued there is overwhelming contemporary evidence that the Treasure was discovered on the north bank of the River Oxus between 1877 and 1880,  and he also maintains that most if not all of the objects in the Treasure are genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Ancient Civilizations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tajik government==
In 2007, [[Emomalii Rahmon]], [[President of Tajikistan]], was reported as calling for the repatriation of the treasure, despite the fact that it had been recovered and sold by local peoples and acquired by museums in the art market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/news/story/0,,2053344,00.html Tajik president calls for return of treasure from British Museum], [[The Guardian]], Tuesday April 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no formal claim has been made by the Tajik government, and in 2013, "high-quality golden replicas" of pieces from the Oxus Treasure were presented to the Tajik government by the British Museum, intended for the new [[Tajik National Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/ukintajikistan/2013/03/25/in-search-of-oxus-treasure-trip-to-takhti-sangin/ FCO "blog about the work of the British Embassy in Tajikistan"], "In Search of Oxus Treasure – Trip to Takhti Sangin", March 25, 2013, by Bahodur Sheraliev, Communications Manager&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petrine Archer-Straw''' (26 December 1956 – 5 December 2012) was a British artist and influential [[art historian]] and [[curator]] who specialised in the art of the [[Caribbean#Demographics|Caribbean people]].&lt;ref name=jamaicaobserver&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Dr-Petrine-Archer-Straw--a-gentle-soul-with-a-steely-grip-on-reality_13260628 "A tribute to Petrine Archer-Straw"], ''Jamaica Observer'', 23 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Eddie Chambers (writer and artist)|Eddie Chambers]]: "In her work as an artist, academic, art historian, writer and curator, Archer-Straw consistently challenged the prevailing orthodoxies that treat Caribbean artists and cultural practice in geographical, racial and artistic isolation. In essence, her position was that we cannot fully understand or appreciate the practice of Caribbean artists without due consideration of broader factors such as migration, history, identity and, above all diaspora – the scattering of many black people beyond their ancestral homeland of Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Chambers, [http://www.eddiechambers.com/texts/petrine-archer-straw-memoriam-1956-2012/ "Petrine Archer-Straw, In Memoriam, (1956–2012)"]. Extracted from obituary in ''Nka Journal of Contemporary African Art'', 32, Spring 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Petrine Archer-Straw was born in [[Birmingham]], England, to [[Jamaica]]n parents,&lt;ref name=jamaicaobserver/&gt; and raised during the 1960s in an atmosphere of "... [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racial pride]], and activism".&lt;ref name=BTB35&gt;''Back to Black'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father arrived England in 1955 as a linotype press operator and subsequently sent for his family to join him.&lt;ref name=BTB35 /&gt; Archer-Straw notes that her home was a hub for the community.&lt;ref name=BTB36&gt;''Back to Black'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; These were extremely formative experiences for the young Archer-Straw who also recalls how she "would do the rounds [on Sunday] with my father, .... joining in house to house campaigning and, in the summer, attending the numerous rallies and protest marches.&lt;ref name=BTB36 /&gt; However, this community work eventually drew the ire of the right-wing [[British National Front]] and the family subsequently moved to [[Jamaica]] in the early 1970s,&lt;ref name=jamaicaobserver/&gt; where Dr. Archer-Straw finished high school and started university.&lt;ref name=BTB36 /&gt;

== Education ==
Petrine Archer-Straw earned a Theology, History, Sociology B.A. at the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI) B.A. (1975–78) and later earned a Cultural History M.Phil (1983–87) at the same institution. She was also trained as an artist at the [[Jamaican School of Art]] (Diploma, Painting, 1979–82). She also received degrees from the [[Courtauld Institute]] at the [[University of London]], where she earned an M.A. in Art History and PhD (Art History Modern, [[Negrophilia]], 1994–95).&lt;ref&gt;[http://petrinearcher.com/about from Archer-Straw’s official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Petrine Archer-Straw published numerous books and catalogues, including ''Eugene Palmer'' (October 1993, in collaboration with Jane Norrie), ''New World Imagery'' (October 1995), ''Negrophilia: Avant-Garde Paris and Black Culture in the 1920s'' (November 2000),&lt;ref name=rogin&gt;Michael Rogin, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n04/michael-rogin/mon-pays "Mon Pays"], ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 23, No. 4, 22 February 2001, pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fifty Years, Fifty Artists'' (May 2001), and ''Back to Black: Art, Cinema and the Racial Imaginary'' (June 2005, in collaboration with [[David A.

== ''Negrophilia'' ==
Archer-Straw's book ''Negrophilia: Avant-Garde Paris and Black Culture in the 1920s'' focused on the fashion for African artefacts, themes and emblems in [[Paris]] of the 1920s, including figures such as [[Josephine Baker]].&lt;ref name=rogin/&gt; The book inspired a jazz album by [[Mike Ladd]], ''Negrophilia: The Album'' (2005), on [[Thirsty Ear Recordings|Thirsty Ear]].&lt;ref&gt;Dave Segal, [http://jazztimes.com/articles/15314-negrophilia-the-album-mike-ladd "Mike Ladd: Negrophilia: The Album" (review)], ''Jazz Times'', March 2005,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pitchfork&gt;Joe Tangari, [http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4624-negrophilia/ "Mike Ladd: Negrophilia" (review)], Pitchfork, 30 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The album's lyrics combine references to the milieu that Archer-Straw defines with references to the civil rights struggle in the US and more recent pop music; [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] said: "its best moments are stellar and exhilarating" and scored it 7.2/10.&lt;ref name=pitchfork/&gt;

'''Rococo''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|oʊ}} or {{IPAc-en|r|oʊ|k|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ}}), less commonly '''roccoco''', or "'''Late Baroque'''", was a highly ornamental and theatrical style of decoration which combined asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colors, sculpted molding, and [[trompe l'oeil]] frescoes to create the illusions of surprise, motion and drama. It first appeared in France and Italy in the 1730s and spread to Central Europe in the 1750s and 1760s.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/video-rococ-writing-table|title=What is Rococo?|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=136}}&lt;ref&gt;"Rococo" Larousse Encyclopedia online &lt;/ref&gt; It is often described as the final expression of the [[Baroque]] movement.{{Sfn|Owens|2014|page=92}}

The Rococo style began in France in the first part of the 18th century in the reign of [[Louis Quinze|Louis XV]]  as a reaction against the more formal and geometric [[Style Louis XIV]]. It was known as the ''style [[rocaille]]'', or ''rocaille style''.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=136}} It soon spread other parts of Europe, particularly northern Italy, Bavaria, Austria, other parts of Germany, and Russia. It also came to influence the other arts, particularly sculpture, furniture, silverware and glassware, painting,  music, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/506448/Rococo-style |title=Rococo style (design) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Zwiefalten 28 04 2011 23.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Integrated rococo carving, [[stucco]] and [[fresco]] at [[Zwiefalten Abbey]] (1739–45)]] 
The word ''rococo'' was first used in 1835 in France, as a humorous variation of the word ''rocaille'' or a combination of ''rocaille'' and ''[[baroque]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary On-Line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monique Wagner, ''From Gaul to De Gaulle: An Outline of French Civilization.'' Peter Lang, 2005, p. 139. {{ISBN|0-8204-2277-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rocaille was originally a method of decoration, using pebbles, seashells and cement, which was often used to decorate grottoes and fountains since the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Larousse dictionary on-line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Stokstad, ed. Art History. 4th ed. New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 17th and early 18th century it became the term for a kind of decorative motif or ornament that appeared in the late [[Style Louis XIV]], in the form of a seashell interlaced with [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves. In 1736 the designer and jeweler Jean Mondon published the ''Premier Livre de forme rocquaille et cartel'',  a collection of designs for ornaments of furniture and interior decoration. It was the first appearance in print of the term  "rocaille" to designate the style.&lt;ref&gt;De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts décoratifs'', p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;   The carved or molded seashell motif was combined with palm leaves or twisting vines to decorate doorways, furniture, wall panels and other architectural elements.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier''(2006) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the term was used to describe architecture or music which was excessively ornamental.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/ancien.html Ancien Regime Rococo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411162829/http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/ancien.html |date=11 April 2018 }}. Bc.edu. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007210702/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c17th-mid19th/rococo.htm Rococo – Rococo Art]. Huntfor.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the mid-19th century, the term has been accepted by [[art historians]]. While there is still some debate about the historical significance of the style, Rococo is now often considered as a distinct period in the development of [[European art]].

==Characteristics==
&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

Rococo featured exuberant decoration, with an abundance of curves, counter-curves, undulations and elements modeled on nature. The exteriors of Rococo buildings are often simple, while the interiors are entirely dominated by their ornament. The style was highly theatrical, designed to impress and awe at first sight. Floor plans of churches were often complex, featuring interlocking ovals; In palaces, grand stairways became centrepieces, and offered different points of view of the decoration.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|page=92}}

The style often integrated painting, molded stucco, and wood carving, and ''[[quadratura]]'', or illusionist ceiling paintings, which were designed to give the impression that the those entering the room were looking up at the sky, where cherubs and other figures were gazing down at them. Materials used included included stucco,  either painted or left white; combinations of different colored woods; lacquered wood in the Japanese style, and ornament of gilded bronze. The intent was to create an impression of surprise, awe and wonder on first view.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}

==France==
{{See also|Rocaille|Louis Quinze}}
The  ''[[Rocaille]]'' style, or French Rococo, appeared in Paris during the reign [[Louis XV]], and flourished between about 1723 and 1759.&lt;ref&gt;Lovreglio, Aurélia and Anne, ''Dictionnaire des Mobiliers et des Objets d'art'', Le Robert, Paris, 2006, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;  The style was used particularly in salons, a new style of room designed to impress and entertain guests.  The most prominent example was the salon of the Princess in [[Hôtel de Soubise]] in Paris, designed by [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] (1735–40). The characteristics of French Rococo included exceptional artistry, especially in the complex frames made for mirrors and paintings, which sculpted in plaster and often gilded; and the use of vegetal forms (vines, leaves, flowers) intertwined in complex designs.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|pp. 92-93}}   The furniture also featured sinuous curves and vegetal designs. The leading furniture designers and craftsmen in the style included [[Juste-Aurele Meissonier]], [[Charles Cressent]], and [[Nicolas Pineau]].{{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=382}}&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred|title=Gardner's art through the ages: the western perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PA587|accessdate=21 February 2011|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57355-5|pages=583–584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rocaille style lasted in France until the mid-18th century, and while it became more curving and vegetal, it never achieved the extravagant exuberance of the Rococo in Bavaria, Austria and Italy. The discoveries of Roman antiquities beginning in 1738 at [[Herculanum]] and especially at [[Pompeii]] in 1748 turned French architecture in the direction of the more symmetrical and less flamboyant neo-classicism.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Italy==
Artists in Italy, particularly [[Venice]], also produced an exuberant rococo style.  Venetian commodes imitated the curving lines and carved ornament of the French rocaille, but with a particular Venetian variation; the pieces were painted, often with landscapes or flowers or scenes from [[Guardi]] or other painters, or [[Chinoiserie]], against a blue or green background, matching the colours of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]] of painters whose work decorated the salons. Notable decorative painters included [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], who painted ceilings and murals of both churches and palazzos, and [[Giovanni Battista Crosato]] who painted the ballroom ceiling of the [[Ca Rezzonico]] in the [[illusionistic ceiling painting|quadraturo]] manner, giving the illusion of three dimensions. Tiepelo travelled to Germany with his son during 1752–1754, decorating the ceilings of the [[Würzburg Residence]], one of the major landmarks of the Bavarian rococo.  An earlier celebrated Venetian painter was [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]], who painted several notable church ceilings. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

The Venetian Rococo also featured exceptional glassware, particularly [[Murano glass]], often engraved and coloured, which was exported across Europe. Works included multicolour chandeliers and mirrors with extremely ornate frames. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

==Southern Germany and Russia==
The Rococo decorative style reached its summit in southern Germany and central Europe from the 1730s until the 1770s. It was first introduced from France through the publications and works of French architects and decorators, including the sculptor [[Claude III Audran]], the interior designer [[Gilles-Marie Oppenordt]], the architect [[Germain Boffrand]], the sculptor Jean Mondon, and the draftsman and engraver [[Pierre Lepautre (1652–1716)|Pierre Lepautre]]. Their work had an important influence on the German Rococo style.&lt;ref&gt;De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts décoratifs'' (1977), pp. 354–355&lt;/ref&gt; 

German architects adapted the Rococo style but made it far more asymmetric and loaded with more ornate decoration than the French original.  The German style was characterized by an explosion of forms that cascaded down the walls. It featured molding formed into curves and counter-curves, twisting and turning patterns, ceilings and walls with no right angles, and stucco foliage which seemed to be creeping up the walls and across the ceiling. The decoration was often gilded or silvered to give it contrast with the white or pale pastel walls.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=150-153}}

The Belgian-born architect and designer [[François de Cuvilliés]] was one of the first to create a Rococo building in Germany, with the pavilion of [[Amalienburg]] in Munich, (1734-1739), inspired by the pavilions of the  [[Trianon]] and [[Marly]] in France. It was built as a hunting lodge, with a platform on the roof for shooting pheasants.  The Hall of Mirrors in the interior, by the painter and stucco sculptor [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], was far more exuberant than any French Rococo.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another notable example of the early German Rococo is [[Würzburg Residence]] (1737–1744) constructed for the Prince-Bishop of Wurzburg by [[Balthasar Neumann]].   Neumann had traveled to Paris and consulted with the French rocaille decorative artists [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Robert de Cotte]].  While the exterior was in more sober Baroque style,  the interior, particularly the stairways and ceilings, was much lighter and decorative. The Prince-Bishop imported the Italian Rococo painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] in 1750–53 to create a mural over the top of the three-level ceremonial stairway. &lt;ref name="Demartini 2006 pp. 222"&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006) pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; B.M. Field ''The Worlds Greatest Architecture:  Past and Present, Regency House Publishing Ltd, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Neumann described the interior of the residence as  "a theater of light".  The stairway was also the central element in a residence Neumann  built at the [[Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Brühl|Augustusburg Palace in Brühl]] (1743–1748).  In that building the stairway led the visitors up through a stucco fantasy of paintings, sculpture, ironwork and decoration, with surprising views at every turn.&lt;ref&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006) pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1740s and 1750s, a number of notable pilgrimage churches were constructed in [[Bavaria]], with interiors decorated in a distinctive variant of the rococo style. One of the most notable examples is the [[Wieskirche]] (1745–1754) designed by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]].   Like most of the Bavarian pilgrimage churches, the exterior is very simple, with pastel walls, and little ornament.  Entering the church the visitor encounters an astonishing theater of movement and light.  It features an oval-shaped  sanctuary, and  a deambulatory in the same form, filling in the church with light from all sides.  The white walls contrasted with columns of blue and pink stucco in the choir, and the domed ceiling surrounded by plaster angels below a dome representing the heavens crowded with colorful Biblical figures.  Other notable pilgrimage churches include the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1743–1772).{{Sfn|Ducher|1988| page=152}}{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|pp. 89–94}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Johann Michael Fischer]] was the architect of [[Ottobeuren Abbey]] (1748–1766), another Bavarian Rococo landmark. The church features, like much of the rococo architecture in Germany,  a remarkable contrast between the regularity of the facade and the overabundance of decoration in the interior.&lt;ref name="Demartini 2006 pp. 222"/&gt;

The Russian Empress [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] was another admirer of the Rococo; The Golden Cabinet of the Chinese Palace in the palace complex of [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]] near Saint Petersburg, designed by the Italian [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]],  is an example of the Russian Rococo.

==Britain==
In Great Britain, rococo was called the "French taste"  and had less influence on design and the decorative arts than in continental Europe. although its influence was felt in such areas as silverwork, porcelain, and silks. [[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not mentioning rococo by name, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/education/art-appreciation/the-rococo-influence-in-british-art/|title=The Rococo Influence in British Art - dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rococo was slow in arriving in England. Before entering the Rococo, British furniture for a time followed the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Palladian]] model under designer [[William Kent]], who designed for Lord Burlington and other important patrons of the arts. Kent travelled to Italy with Lord Burlington between 1712 and 1720, and brought back many models and ideas from Palladio.  He designed the furniture for [[Hampton Court Palace]] (1732), Lord Burlington's [[Chiswick House]] (1729), London, Thomas Coke's [[Holkham Hall]], Norfolk, Robert Walpole's pile at [[Houghton Hall|Houghton]], for [[Devonshire House]] in London, and at Rousham.{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=382}}

[[Mahogany]] made its appearance in England in about 1720, and immediately became popular for furniture, along with [[walnut]] wood. The Rococo began to make an appearance in England between 1740 and 1750. The furniture of [[Thomas Chippendale]] was the closest to the Rococo style,  In 1754 he published "Gentleman's and Cabinet-makers' directory", a catalog of designs for rococo, ''chinoiserie'' and even Gothic furniture, which achieved wide popularity, going through three editions.  Unlike French designers, Chippendale did not employ marquetry or inlays in his furniture.  The predominant designer of inlaid furniture were Vile and Cob, the cabinet-makers for King George III.  Another important figure in British furniture was [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], who in 1761,  very late in the period, published a catalog of Roroco furniture designs.  These include furnishings based on rather fantastic Chinese and Indian motifs, including a canopy bed crowned by a Chinese pagoda (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum).{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

Other notable figures in the British Rococo included the silversmith Charles Friedrich Kandler.

==Decline and end==
The art of [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and other painters of the period, with its emphasis on decorative mythology and gallantry, soon inspired a reaction, and a demand for more "noble" themes.  While the Rococo continued in Germany and Austria, the French Academy in Rome began to teach the classic style. This was confirmed by the nomination of [[Le Troy]] as director of the Academy in 1738, and then in 1751 by [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].

[[Madame de Pompadour]], the mistress of Louis XV contributed to the decline of the Rococo style.  In 1750 she sent her nephew, [[Abel-François Poisson|Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]], on a two-year mission to study artistic and archeological developments in Italy.  He was accompanied by several artists, including the engraver [[Nicolas Cochin]] and the architect [[Soufflot]].  They returned to Paris with a passion for classical art. Vandiéres became the Marquis of Marigny, and was named director general of the King's Buildings. He turned official French architecture toward the neoclassical. Cochin became an important art critic;  he denounced the ''petit style'' of Boucher, and called for a grand style with a new emphasis on antiquity and nobility in the academies of painting and architecture.{{sfn|Cabanne|1988|p. 106}}

The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art. Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of Neoclassical artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]]. In Germany, late 18th-century Rococo was ridiculed as ''Zopf und Perücke'' ("pigtail and periwig"), and this phase is sometimes referred to as ''Zopfstil''. Rococo remained popular in the provinces and in Italy, until the second phase of neoclassicism, "[[Empire style]]", arrived with Napoleonic governments and swept Rococo away.

==Furniture and decoration==
The ornamental style called ''[[rocaille]]'' emerged in France between 1710 and 1750, mostly during the regency and reign of [[Louis XV]];  the style was also called ''[[Louis Quinze]]''.  Its principal characteristics were picturesque detail, curves and counter-curves, asymmetry, and a theatrical exuberance. On the walls of new Paris salons, the twisting and winding designs, usually made of gilded or painted stucco, wound around the doorways and mirrors like vines.  One of the earliest examples was the [[Hôtel Soubise]] in Paris (1704–05), with its famous oval salon decorated with paintings by Boucher, and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=102}}

The best known French furniture designer of the period was [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier]] (1695–1750), who was also a sculptor, painter. and goldsmith for the royal household. He held the title of official designer to the Chamber and Cabinet of Louis XV.  His work is well known today because of the enormous number of engravings made of his work which popularized the style throughout Europe. He designed works for the royal families of Poland and Portugal.

Italy was another place where the Rococo flourished, both in its early and later phases.  Craftsmen in Rome, Milan and Venice all produced lavishly decorated furniture and decorative items.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The sculpted decoration included fleurettes, palmettes, seashells, and foliage, carved in wood. The most extravagant rocaille forms were found in the consoles, tables designed to stand against walls. The Commodes, or chests, which had first appeared under Louis XIV, were richly decorated with rocaille ornament made of gilded bronze. They were made by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]] and also featured marquetry of different-coloured woods, sometimes placed in checkerboard cubic patterns, made with light and dark woods.  The period also saw the arrival of [[Chinoiserie]], often in the form of lacquered and gilded commodes, called ''falcon de Chine'' of ''Vernis Martin'', after the ebenist who introduced the technique to France. [[Ormolu]], or gilded bronze, was used by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]]. Latz made a particularly ornate clock mounted atop a cartonnier for [[Frederick the Great]] for his palace in [[Potsdam]]. Pieces of [[Chinese export porcelain|imported Chinese porcelain]] were often mounted in [[ormolu]] (gilded bronze) rococo settings for display on tables or consoles in salons. Other craftsmen imitated the [[Japanese lacquer|Japanese art of lacquered furniture]], and produced commodes with Japanese motifs.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Great Britain|British]] Rococo tended to be more restrained. Thomas Chippendale's furniture designs kept the curves and feel, but stopped short of the French heights of whimsy. The most successful exponent of British Rococo was probably [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], a gifted carver and furniture designer working in London in the mid-18th century.

==Painting==
Elements of the ''Rocaille'' style appeared in the work of some French painters, including a taste for the picturesque in details; curves and counter-curves; and dissymmetry which replaced the movement of the baroque with exuberance, though the French ''rocaille'' never reached the extravagance of the Germanic rococo.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}  The leading proponent was [[Antoine Watteau]], particularly in [[Embarkation for Cythera|''Pilgrimage on the Isle of Cythera'']] (1717), [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]], in a genre called ''[[Fête galante|Fête Galante]]''  depicting scenes of young nobles gathered together to celebrate in a pastoral setting.  Watteau died in 1721 at the age of thirty-seven, but his work continued to have influence through the rest of the century. The ''Pilgrimage to Cythera'' painting was purchased by [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia in 1752 or 1765 to decorate his palace of [[Charlottenberg]] in Berlin.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}

The successor of Watteau and the ''Féte Galante'' in decorative painting was [[François Boucher]] (1703–1770), the favorite painter of [[Madame de Pompadour]].  His work included the sensual ''Toilette de Venus'' (1746), which became one of the best known examples of the style.  Boucher participated in all of the genres of the time, designing tapestries, models for porcelain sculpture, set decorations for the Paris opera and ''opera-comique'', and decor for the Fair of Saint-Laurent.  {{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other important painters of the ''Fête Galante'' style included [[Nicolas Lancret]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Pater]].  The style particularly influenced [[François Lemoyne]], who painted the lavish decoration of the ceiling of the Salon of Hercules at the [[Palace of Versailles]], completed in 1735.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}  Paintings with fétes gallant and mythological themes by Boucher, [[Pierre-Charles Trémolières]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] decorated the famous salon of the [[Hôtel Soubise]] in Paris (1735–40).{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other Rococo painters include: [[Jean François de Troy]] (1679–1752), [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]] (1685–1745), his two sons [[Louis-Michel van Loo]] (1707–1771) and [[Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo]] (1719–1795), his younger brother [[Charles-André van Loo]] (1705–1765), and [[Nicolas Lancret]] (1690–1743).

In Austria and Southern Germany, Italian painting had the largest effect on the Rococo style.  The Venetian painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], assisted by his son, [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]],  was invited to paint frescoes for the [[Würzburg Residence]] (1720–1744).  The most prominent painter of Bavarian rococo churches was [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], who painted the ceiling of the [[Wieskirche]] (1745–1754)

==Sculpture and porcelain==

Religious sculpture followed the Italian baroque style, as exemplified in the theatrical altarpiece of the Karlskirche in Vienna.  However, much of Rococo sculpture was lighter and offered more movement than the classical style of Louis XIV.  It was encouraged in particular by [[Madame de Pompadour]], mistress of Louis XV, who commissioned many works for her chateaux and gardens. The sculptor [[Edmé Bouchardon]] represented [[Cupid]] engaged in carving his darts of love from the club of [[Hercules]] Rococo style—the demigod is transformed into the soft child, the bone-shattering club becomes the heart-scathing arrows, just as [[marble]] is so freely replaced by [[stucco]]. [[Étienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716–1791) was another leading French sculptor during the period.  The French sculptors, [[Jean-Louis Lemoyne]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]], [[Louis-Simon Boizot]], [[Michel Clodion]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle|Pigalle]]  were also active.  In Italy, [[Antonio Corradini]] was among the leading sculptors of the Rococo style.  A Venetian, he travelled around Europe, working for [[Peter the Great]] in St. Petersburg, for the imperial courts in Austria and Naples. He preferred sentimental themes and made several skilled works of women with faces covered by veils, one of which is now in the [[Louvre]].

A new form of small-scale sculpture appeared, the [[porcelain]] figure, or small group of figures, initially replacing sugar sculptures on grand dining room tables, but soon popular for placing on mantelpieces and furniture.  The number of European factories grew steadily through the century, and some made porcelain that the expanding middle classes could afford. The amount of colourful [[overglaze decoration]] used on them also increased.  They were usually modelled by artists who had trained in sculpture. Common subjects included figures from the [[commedia dell'arte]], city street vendors, lovers and figures in fashionable clothes, and pairs of birds.  

[[Johann Joachim Kändler]] was the most important modeller of [[Meissen porcelain]], the earliest European factory, which remained the most important until about 1760.  The Swiss-born German sculptor [[Franz Anton Bustelli]] produced a wide variety of colourful figures for the [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory]] in Bavaria, which were sold throughout Europe.  The French sculptor [[Étienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716–1791) followed this example.  While also making large-scale works, he became director of the [[Sevres Porcelain]] manufactory and produced small-scale works, usually about love and gaiety, for production in series.

==Music==
A Rococo period existed in [[music history]], although it is not as well known as the earlier Baroque and later Classical forms. The Rococo music style itself developed out of baroque music both in France, where the new style was referred to as [[Galante music|''style galante'']] ("gallant" or "elegant" style), and in Germany, where it was referred to as ''empfindsamer Stil'' ("sensitive style"). It can be characterized as light, intimate music with extremely elaborate and refined forms of [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]]. Exemplars include [[Jean Philippe Rameau]], [[Louis-Claude Daquin]] and [[François Couperin]] in France; in Germany, the style's main proponents were [[C. P. E. Bach]] and [[Johann Christian Bach]], two sons of the renowned [[J.S. Bach]].

In the second half of the 18th century, a reaction against the Rococo style occurred, primarily against its perceived overuse of ornamentation and decoration. Led by [[C.P.E. Bach]] (an accomplished Rococo composer in his own right), [[Domenico Scarlatti]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], this reaction ushered in the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. By the early 19th century, Catholic opinion had turned against the suitability of the style for ecclesiastical contexts because it was "in no way conducive to sentiments of devotion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13106a.htm Rococo Style – Catholic Encyclopedia]. Newadvent.org (1912-02-01). Retrieved on 2014-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian composer of the Romantic era [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] wrote The [[Variations on a Rococo Theme]], Op. 33, for cello and orchestra in 1877. Although the theme is not Rococo in origin, it is written in Rococo style.

== Fashion ==
[[File:Sackbackgown.jpg|thumb|Sack-back gown and petticoat, 1775-1780 V&amp;A Museum no. T.180&amp;A-1965]]
Rococo fashion was based on extravagance, elegance, refinement and decoration. Women’s fashion of the seventeenth-century was contrasted by the fashion of the eighteenth-century, which was ornate and sophisticated, the true style of Rococo.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fashion: A history from the 18th to the 20th century|last=Fukui, A., &amp; Suoh, T.|first=|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These fashions spread beyond the royal court into the salons and cafés of the ascendant bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historyofeuropeanfashion.wordpress.com/category/baroquerococo-1650-1800/|title=Posts about Baroque/Rococo 1650-1800 on History of Costume|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exuberant, playful, elegant style of decoration and design that we now know to be ‘Rococo’ was then known as ‘''le style rocaille’, ‘le style moderne’, ‘le gout’.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rococo: The continuing curve, 1730-2008|last=Coffin|first=S.|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A style that appeared in the early eighteenth-century was the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''robe volante''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a flowing gown, that became popular towards the end of King Louis XIV’s reign. This gown had the features of a bodice with large pleats flowing down the back to the ground over a rounded petticoat. The colour palate was rich, dark fabrics accompanied by elaborate, heavy design features. After the death of Louis XIV the clothing styles began to change. The fashion took a turn to a lighter, more frivolous style, transitioning from the baroque period to the well-known style of Rococo.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/09-10/daily-life-france-fashion-marie-antoinette/|title=Marie Antoinette's Style Revolution|last=|first=|date=|website=National Geographic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later period was known for their pastel colours, more revealing frocks, and the plethora of frills, ruffles, bows, and lace as trims. Shortly after the typical women’s Rococo gown was introduced, ''robe à la Françoise,'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a gown with a tight bodice that had a low cut neckline, usually with a large ribbon bows down the centre front, wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed in large amounts of lace, ribbon, and flowers.

The ''Watteau pleats'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; also became more popular, named after the painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, who painted the details of the gowns down to the stiches of lace and other trimmings with immense accuracy. Later, the ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'pannier'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' and ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'mantua''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' became fashionable around 1718, they were wide hoops under the dress to extend the hips out sideways and they soon became a staple in formal wear. This gave the Rococo period the iconic dress of wide hips combined with the large amount of decoration on the garments. Wide panniers were worn for special occasions, and could reach up to 16 feet (4.8 metres) in diameter,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/18sil/hd_18sil.htm|title=Eighteenth-Century Silhouette and Support|last=Glasscock|first=J.|date=|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and smaller hoops were worn for the everyday settings. These features originally came from seventeenth-century Spanish fashion, known as '''guardainfante','' initially designed to hide the pregnant stomach, then reimagined later as the pannier.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  1745 became the Golden Age of the Rococo with the introduction of a more exotic, oriental culture in France called ''‘a la turque’.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was made popular by Louis XV’s mistress, Madame Pompadour, who commissioned the artist, Charles Andre Van Loo, to paint her as a Turkish sultana.  
''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''
In the 1760s, a style of less formal dresses emerged and one of these was the '''polonaise''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', with inspiration taken from Poland. It was shorter than the French dress, allowing the underskirt and ankles to be seen, which made it easier to move around in. Another dress that came into fashion was the ''‘robe a l’anglais’'', which included elements inspired by the males’ fashion; a short jacket, broad lapels and long sleeves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It also had a snug bodice, a full skirt without panniers but still a little long in the back to form a small train, and often some type of lace kerchief worn around the neck. Another piece was the 'redingote', halfway between a cape and an overcoat.

Accessories were also important to all women during this time, as they added to the opulence and the decor of the body to match their gowns. At any official ceremony ladies were required to cover their hands and arms with gloves if their clothes were sleeveless.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Scenic design''' (also known as [[scenography]], '''stage design''', '''set design''', or [[production designer|production design]]) is the creation of [[Theatre|theatrical]], as well as [[film]] or [[television]] [[theatrical scenery|scenery]].  Scenic designers come from a variety of artistic backgrounds, but in recent years, are mostly trained professionals, holding a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]] or [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] degrees in theater arts. Scenic designers design [[Theatrical scenery|set]]s and scenery that aim to support the overall artistic goals of the production.

== Scenic designer ==
A designer looks at the details searching for evidence through research to produce conceptual ideas that’s best toward supporting the content and values with visual elements. The subject of, “How do we generate creative ideas?” is a very legitimate question. The most consuming part of expanding our horizons toward scenic concepts is much more than witnessing creativity, and creative people. It starts with us opening our mind to the possibilities.  To have an attitude toward learning, seeking, and engaging in creativity and to be willing to be adventurous, inquisitive and curious. Our imagination is highly visual. Whether outside or inside, colorful trees or concerts, star lit skies or the architecture of a great building, scenic design is a process of discovery. Discovering what will best clarify and support the setting, environment, atmosphere, ambience, &amp; world that is being created.

The scenic designer works with the director and other designers to establish an overall visual concept for the production and design the stage environment. They are responsible for developing a complete set of design drawings that include the following:
*''basic ground plan'' showing all stationary scenic elements;
*''composite ground plan'' showing all moving scenic elements, indicating both their onstage and storage positions;
*section of the stage space incorporating all elements;
*''front elevations'' of every ''scenic element'', and additional elevations or sections of units as required.
All of these required drawing elements can be easily created from one accurate 3-D [[CAD model]] of the set design.

==Responsibility==
[[File:Robert Edmond Jones.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Scenic designer [[Robert Edmond Jones]] (1887-1954) drawing at a waist high table (c. 1920).]]
The scenic designer is responsible for collaborating with the [[theatre director]] and other members of the production design team to create an environment for the production and then communicating the details of this environment to the [[technical director]], [[production manager]], [[charge artist|charge scenic artist]] and [[property master|prop master]].  Scenic designers are responsible for creating [[scale model]]s of the scenery, [[artistic rendering|renderings]], paint elevations and scale construction drawings as part of their communication with other production staff.

==Training==
In Europe and Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sceno.org/theatre-design-101/training-as-a-theatre-designer/ |publisher=Central School of Speech and Drama, University of London article |title=Training as a Theatre Designer |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; scenic designers take a more holistic approach to theatrical design and will often be responsible not only for scenic design but costume, lighting and sound and are referred to as theatre designers or scenographers or production designers.

Notable scenic designers, past and present, include: Alban Piot, [[Adolphe Appia]], [[Boris Aronson]], [[Alexandre Benois]], [[Alison Chitty]], [[Antony McDonald]], [[Barry Kay]], [[Caspar Neher]], [[Cyro Del Nero]],  [[Aleksandra Ekster]], [[Daniil Lider]], [[David Borovsky]], [[David Gallo]], [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[Es Devlin]], [[Ezio Frigerio]], [[Franco Colavecchia]], [[Christopher Gibbs]], [[Franco Zeffirelli]], [[George Tsypin]], [[Howard Bay (designer)|Howard Bay]], [[Inigo Jones]], [[Jean-Pierre Ponnelle]], [[Jo Mielziner]], [[John Lee Beatty]], [[Josef Svoboda]], [[Ken Adam]], [[Léon Bakst]], [[Luciano Damiani]], [[Maria Björnson]], [[Ming Cho Lee]], [[Motley Theatre Design Group|Motley]], [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Nathan Altman]], [[Nicholas Georgiadis]], [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]], [[Ralph Koltai]], [[Neil Patel (designer)|Neil Patel]], [[Robert Brill]], [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]], [[Russell Patterson]], [[Brian Sidney Bembridge]], [[Santo Loquasto]], [[Sean Kenny (theatre designer)|Sean Kenny]], [[Todd Rosenthal]], [[Robin Wagner (designer)|Robin Wagner]], [[Tony Walton]], [[Roger Kirk (designer)|Roger Kirk]].

'''''Still Life with Profile of Laval''''' is an 1886 [[oil painting]] by [[France|French]] artist [[Paul Gauguin]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It depicts Gauguin's friend [[Charles Laval]] in profile with an assortment of inanimate objects, including a ceramic pot Gauguin made himself.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
This combination [[portrait]]/[[still life]] shows Gauguin's ability to take the best of various artists he admired. For example, the abrupt way Laval's face is cut off is a tribute to [[Edgar Degas|Edgar Degas']] off-centered, oddly-cropped compositions, while setup of the still life and the parallel brush strokes in the fruit harken to [[Paul Cézanne|Paul Cézanne's]] work. In addition to those other much-admired artists, Gauguin inserted himself into the composition in the form of the ceramic "monstrosity" he created, a strange interruption which Laval examines quizzically. He deliberately quotes the two most renowned artists in the genres of modern life and still life, then refuses to resolve them harmoniously. Instead, Gauguin leaves them disrupted, even incoherent in this, his first in a series of paintings on the challenges of creativity. Laval, the viewer's surrogate, tries to guess his next move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Druick|first1=Douglas W.|last2=Zegers|first2=Peter Kort|title=Van Gogh and Gauguin: the Studio of the South|year=2001|publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]]|location=[[Chicago]]|isbn=0500510547}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Historical information==
Gauguin and Laval met in the summer of 1886, and the younger artist soon became Gauguin's pupil. This subservient role is indicated by Laval's fixed gaze upon the pot Gauguin made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Still-Life with Portrait of Laval|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/gauguin/02/1ponta01.html|publisher=[[Web Gallery of Art]]|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pot itself helps place the creation of this painting very late in 1886, after Gauguin had returned to [[Paris]], because it was not created until at least October. Gauguin valued his ceramic experiments highly, as both artistic objects and sources of income. He wrote to his wife Mette that this particular pot was worth 100 francs. It cannot currently be located, and may have been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brettell|first1=Richard R.|last2=Pickvance|first2=Ronald|title=Gauguin and the School of Pont-Aven|year=1994|publisher=Apollo|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Vincent van Gogh]] had suggested a portrait exchange among the small group of artists (also including [[Émile Bernard]]) gathered at [[Pont-Aven]] in order to create a greater sense of community, a tradition known as ''Freundschaftsbild.'' By rendering them all in new artistic styles, the collective announced their abandonment of [[naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] and adoption of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gauguin's Freundschaftsbild|url=http://painters-table.com/link/indianapolis-museum-art/gauguins-freundschaftsbild|publisher=Painters' Table|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
''Still Life with Profile of Laval'' was acquired in 1998 as part of a collection of Gauguin and his [[Pont-Aven School|Pont-Aven coterie]]. Samuel Josefowitz, a Swiss collector, amassed the 17 paintings and 84 prints, worth an estimated $30 million. The [[Lilly Endowment]] raised $20 million toward that goal with a challenge grant. The remainder was raised by the IMA, with an undisclosed amount being given by Josefowitz himself, a museum trustee. Josefowitz also donated all the prints for free. He acquired the Pont-Aven collection in the 1950s and '60s, before that period's importance in Gauguin's development was fully appreciated.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|last=Dobrzynski|first=Judith H.|title=Indianapolis Museum Buys 30 Gauguins From Swiss Collector|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/18/arts/indianapolis-museum-buys-30-gauguins-from-swiss-collector.html|accessdate=17 January 2013|newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|date=18 Nov 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular painting hangs in the Jane H.

In the [[South of France]], The Bridge presented ''[[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Liz Robertson]] In Concert'', ''[[Honi Coles]] and The Copasetics In Concert'', and ''[[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]] In Concert''.&lt;ref name="Int Herald Trib 1984 Jul 25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"La Depeche 1982 July 6"&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Lower Manhattan]], The Bridge has produced its ''Performance-Forums'' with astrophysicist, [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], theater director, [[Tom O'Horgan]] and others.&lt;ref name="Time Out 1996 Mar 27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Notes 1996 Sum" /&gt;  And in June 2001, it presented ''Hart &amp; Hammerstein Centennial Plus One'' at [[Castle Clinton]], near the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="Backstage 2001 Feb 21" /&gt;  The production was the first of a summer concert series, and marked the first time in 146 years that [[Castle Clinton]] had been used as a theater.  [[Castle Clinton]], a {{age|1811|01|01}}-year-old circular stone garrison built in 1811 to protect New York from the warring British, has served as an indoor garden, an opera house, an aquarium, an immigrant landing depot, and the setting in which the "[[Swedish Nightingale]]" [[Jenny Lind]] made her 1850 American debut, courtesy of [[P.T. Barnum]]; also, in recent years, as a ticket booth for ferries to the [[Statue of Liberty]].&lt;ref name="NYTs 1996 Jun 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier Lifestyles 1996 Jun 3" /&gt;

==Founder and artistic director==
Avra Petrides, a native New Yorker, is the daughter of pioneering woman orchestral conductor, [[Frédérique Petrides]], and journalist, Peter Petrides, who, for many years was managing editor of the New York City-based, Greek-American newspaper, The National Herald (not to be confused with the newspaper of the same name that was established in 1997).&lt;ref name="Groh 1991" /&gt;

Before becoming Artistic Director of The Bridge, her many appearances as an actress included Honey, the young wife, in the original Broadway production of [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' (in the matinee company, opposite [[Kate Reid]] and [[Shepperd Strudwick]]);&lt;ref name="NY Herald Trib 1962 Oct 11" /&gt; starring as Leah with [[Joseph Wiseman]] and [[Luther Adler]] in the CBC ([[Canadian Broadcasting Company]]) television adaptation of [[Ansky]]'s ''[[The Dybbuk]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/16976/festival/episode_guide/ Canadian Film Festival May 1, 1961]&lt;/ref&gt; playing [[Bette Davis]] in Adrienne Kennedy's ''A Movie Star Has To Star in Black and White'', directed by [[Joseph Chaikin]] at [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[Public Theater]];&lt;ref&gt;"Gavella Orchestrates a Sigh, With the Under-Title A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White" (review), by Arthur Sainer, ''[[Village Voice]]'', November 29, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; appearing as Darlene in the original production of [[Lanford Wilson]]'s ''Balm in Gilead'' directed by [[Marshall W.

== History ==
The Bridge Stage of the Arts, Inc., was incorporated in New York City in 1980 as a not-for-profit organization.&lt;ref name="Incorporation 1980"/&gt; It was then known as The Bridge American Theater Festival, Inc. In 1995, its title was changed to The Bridge Stage of the Arts, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Certificate of Amendment, filed with the Secretary of State on June 2nd 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The Bridge works on a project by project basis.

===Festival in south of France===
''Bridge Productions are always staged in spaces exceptional for their beauty and resonance of the past.'' Although based in Manhattan, in the 1980s, The Bridge produced summer music theater festivals in the south of France, with an emphasis on the American musical theater. Alan Jay Lerner (lyricist, librettist, [[My Fair Lady]], [[Camelot]]), [[Comden and Green]], lyricists-screenwriters [[Singin' In The Rain]], [[Will Rogers Follies]]) tap dancer [[Honi Coles]], ([[Tony Award]] winner, [[My One and Only (musical)|My One and Only]]), [[Virgil Thomson]], (critic and composer, Four Saints in Three Acts), members of the [[American Dance Machine]] and of [[Joseph Chaikin]]'s experimental [[The Open Theater]], and others performed at night and taught master classes during the day. Each summer, through the invitation of The Bridge and the International Theatre Institute,&lt;ref&gt;"Theatre Notes," ''International Theatre Institute USA,'' No. 107, May 1982&lt;/ref&gt; (a branch of [[UNESCO]]), 150 actors, singers, dancers, choreographers, playwrights, composers, directors and lyricists and librettists from, at times, 22 countries including [[France]], [[China]], [[Australia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Madagascar]], [[United States|America]] and [[Japan]] came to partake free of charge in The Bridge programs. The performances attended by an international audience were sold out.

Surrounded by sunlit vineyards and streams, the festivals' first site, in 1982, was a restored 17th century factory, in the small, medieval township of [[Saint-Chinian]], South of France, ([[Languedoc-Roussillon]] region),  where the uniforms of [[Louis XIV]]'s regiments were once embroidered. In 1984, The Bridge Festival moved to the nearby walled medieval city of [[Beziers]] also in the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] region of the [[South of France]].

To bring something as high spirited and new as the American musical into these timeless surroundings was thrilling, giving a sense of new in old, of continuity of tradition and the march of time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', July 21, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 2, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French publication ''L'information du Spectacle'', June 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', June 25, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Dépêche du Midi|La Depeche]]'', June 19, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Marseillaise (journal)|La Marseillaise]]'' [[:fr:La Marseillaise (journal)|(fr)]] de [[Hérault|l'Herault]], July 1, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper Liberation July 2, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Marseillaise (journal)|La Marseillaise]]'' [[:fr:La Marseillaise (journal)|(fr)]] de [[Hérault|l'Herault]], June 25, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', June 26, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Dépêche du Midi|La Depeche]]'', July 6, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]],'' June 24, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]],'' June 11, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 17, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 20, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 22, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 26, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 27, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 28, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

====Betty Comden review excerpted====
[[Betty Comden]] and her partner, [[Adolph Green]], were prolific lyricists and librettists of Broadway and film musicals including ''[[Singin' In The Rain]], [[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]]'', and ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]].''  Comden gave The Bridge kudos in 1985.

'The Long Arm of the American Musical Stretches to [[Beziers]]'

&amp;hellip; It is not unusual for American musicals to appear in [[London]] &amp;hellip; nor is it strange that ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' is a smash in [[Budapest]], but just why were 50 assorted voices of musical workshop members belting out the song "Just in Time" one morning in July in the vaulted 11th century cloister of Sainte-Aphrodise in the relatively small town of [[Beziers]] (population 100,00) somewhere in the southwest of France!

'Just in time, I found you just in time &amp;hellip;' was issuing from throats that had traveled from [[Norway]], [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]], [[France]], [[West Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Israel]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Madagascar]], [[Romania|Rumania]], [[New Jersey]] and several other of the United States, only because my partner [[Adolph Green]] and I were using that song we had written with [[Jule Styne]] for the show ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells are Ringing]]'' as an example of a certain kind of theatrical-musical moment.  It pleased us to learn that most of the international group of students seemed to know, or at least know of the song.  They spontaneously sang along, their voices echoing, perhaps as far as the foothills of the Pyrenees. Ah your music, your theater, she is indeed the international language, no?

&amp;hellip;The concept of The Bridge, a yearly workshop and festival devoted to the American musical, to be located in France &amp;hellip; was to be literally a bridge between countries and cultures to disseminate knowledge on the subject by assembling "stagères", working participants from all over the globe, and bringing over from America leading practitioners of [[musical theater]] to do the disseminating.  Her dream was that some day in the future, for example, if [[Hal Prince]] wanted to experiment with Japanese [[Noh]] players, working with a Swedish lyricist, a Yugoslavian composer, and a Bessarabian choreographer, such an international collaboration would be assembled under the auspices of The Bridge.  This is but a facetious example of the possibilities.  Avra Petrides has a strong and sincere feeling about the need for open communication through the arts among the many diverse cultures of our all too unpeaceful world, and hopes The Bridge will help.&lt;ref name="Dramatists Guild 1985 Spring" /&gt;}}

=== Performance-Forums ===
In 1996, in [[Lower Manhattan]], The Bridge initiated its ''Performance- Forums'' in the [[Art Deco]] "Cocoa" building at No.1 Wall Street.  In this series, American/international theater artists collaborate with astrophysicists, sculptors, theologians, philosophers, poets, novelists, painters, musicians, choreographers, filmmakers, and others working in a variety of creative, scientific and intellectual disciplines.  The aim: to better understand each other's endeavors and find new and exciting ways to combine them in stage production. The theme of the initial Performance-Forum was ''Time'' (as perceived by people in different disciplines and cultures.)

For several months prior to this event these people collaborated on a performance based on that theme:
* [[Tom O'Horgan]], Theater director of the Broadway productions ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', ''Lenny'', ''Inner City''; director for the [[Vienna State Opera]], [[New York City Opera]]; and co-author of ''Senator Joe'' at the [[Neil Simon Theater]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].
* [[Neil de Grasse Tyson]], Ph.D. Astrophysicist and Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]].
* Michael Sherman, A futurist, who was advising governments and corporations on their long-range plans. He has made a comparative study of images of time in modern culture.
* [[Min Tanaka]], International choreographer and [[Butoh]] dancer.
* [[Tony Rothman]], Ph.D. Physicist specializing in cosmology, who has been on the Editorial Board of [[Scientific American]], and a [[Pulitzer Prize]] nominee.
* Kirk Nurock, Composer/pianist, who has played with [[Phil Woods]], [[Chet Baker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Donald Byrd]]. His compositions and arrangements have been performed by [[Judy Collins]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Dick Hyman]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Jane Ira Bloom]], The [[Brecker Brothers]] and [[Jay Clayton (musician)|Jay Clayton]].
* Serge Gubelman, who has been playing the [[Didgeridu]] since the 70's.
* R.M. Fischer, Sculptor and installation artist, whose work is in the permanent collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], The Cincinnati Art Museum, and the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], among others. His public installations include ''Rector Gate'' at [[Battery Park City]] and the ''Kansas City Sky Stations''.
* [[Brenda Bufalino]], Tap dancer and Founder of the [[American Tap Dance Foundation]], who has performed as a soloist at [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Avery Fisher Hall]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Kennedy Center]] and on [[PBS]]' [[Great Performances]] series; and-
* [[Theo Bleckmann]], Vocalist and composer who has worked with [[Philip Glass]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[Elliott Sharp]], [[Meredith Monk]] and Kirk Nurock.

This debut ''Performance-Forum'', given on March 28, 1996, was attended by approximately two hundred artists, scientists and philosophers, who, at its conclusion, participated in the ''Forum'', which took the form of a panel-led discussion on the evening's theme ''Time''.&lt;ref name="Time Out 1996 Mar 27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Notes 1996 Sum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[WQXR-FM]] initiative, ''Action for the Arts'' featured The Bridge ''Performance - Forums'' in public service announcements made by The Bridge's Artistic Director, Avra Petrides (on [[WQXR-FM]]) and they were featured in their ''Action for the Arts'' "catalog" which detailed the work of 96 organizations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;archival video tape of the entire event, held by The Bridge Stage of the Arts&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Castle Clinton redux ===
In addition, in 1996, The Bridge re-introduced the beautiful 19th century reddish circular stone structure in Historic [[Battery Park]], [[Castle Clinton]], as a remarkable performance space, with the production, ''Hart and Hammerstein Centennial Plus One''. An evening of song, it was hosted by [[CBS]]' [[Charles Osgood]], and featured leading singers and Rob Fisher, then musical director of the [[Encores!]] series at the [[New York City Center]]. It was the first performance at [[Castle Clinton]] since the mid-1800s when, as an opera house, it was the [[Lincoln Center]] of its day, attracting impresarios like [[P.T. Barnum]] and performers like [[Jenny Lind]]. For the Hart &amp; Hammerstein production, The Bridge brought in Broadway theater technicians who, by working into the wee hours of the night before the performance, erected a 30&amp;nbsp;inch high, spacious stage, and to guard against the possibility of rain bringing the performance to a close, covered the roof opening with a translucent white tent.&lt;ref name="NYTs 1996 Jun 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier Lifestyles 1996 Jun 3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[Castle Clinton]] &amp;hellip; Rising in the East," ''[[New York Magazine]],'' June 3, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Robert Moses ''vs.'' Castle Clinton ====
In 1941, the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|Park Commissioner]], [[Robert Moses]], wanted to raze [[Castle Clinton]], claiming it was essential to building a crossing from [[Battery Park|the Battery]] to [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="Caro 1974"&gt;''[[The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York]]'', by [[Robert Caro|Robert A. Caro]], [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] (1974); {{OCLC|834874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests from historic preservationists and others brought this plan to a halt but not before the roof had been removed.

==Ongoing and in development==
''Promethea On The Rocks'', a project that combines theater, music, the visual arts, film, education and community involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Records, The Bridge Stage of the Arts' office at 101 West 78th Street, Suite 21, New York, New York 10024&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
The Bridge programs have been supported by organizations including the French Ministries of Culture (L'Association Française d'Artistique) and Foreign Affairs (Le Ministère des Relations Extérieures), the [[United States Department of State]], [[CBS]],  [[United Technologies Corporation]] and the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' Foundation.&lt;ref name="Int Herald Trib 1984 Jul 25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French Newspaper, ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 29, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Dépêche du Midi]]'', July 6, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Suzy," (column), ''[[New York Post]],'' January 29, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Posters created by [[United Technologies]], advertising the Festival in Summer of1982&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Garden of Death''''' ({{lang-fi|Kuoleman puutarha}}) (1896) is a painting by [[Finland|Finnish]] symbolist painter [[Hugo Simberg]]. Like many of Simberg's paintings, it depicts a gloomy, otherworldly scene. The central figures are reminiscent of the classic black-clad [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], but paradoxically are tending to gardens; traditionally symbols of birth or renewal. 

''The Garden of Death'' is one of the few paintings whose symbolism Simberg explained; typically he preferred to let viewers come to their own conclusions. In a note on one sketch he described the garden as "the place where the dead end up before going to [[Heaven]]". &lt;ref&gt;{{fi icon}} [http://yle.fi/vintti/yle.fi/sininenlaulu/yle.fi/teema/sininenlaulu/artikkeli.php-id=34.htm Hugo Simberg] at [[YLE]].fi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Annotation?action=view&amp;annid=12706 The Garden of Death] at [[New York University]]'s Art, Literature and Medicine Database&lt;/ref&gt; Simberg's juxtaposition of the traditionally frightening imagery of death with the tenderness and humor of his portrayal invite the viewer to consider mortality in a new light. &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160428075354/http://www15.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/REL/ev-cathe.html The History, Art and Architecture of Tampere Cathedral]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was a favourite subject of Simberg's and he made several versions using different techniques, including larger fresco version of the painting in the [[Tampere Cathedral]], which also contains other works by Simberg.

Throughout Africa, Europe, and Asia [[Flint tool|flint arrowheads and axes]] turned up by farmer's plows were considered to have fallen from the sky. They were often thought to be [[thunderbolt]]s and are called '''"thunderstones"'''. It was not until travelers returned from far-away places where these implements were in [[Primitive culture|actual use]] that the origins of these objects became known. Even then, these travelers' tales received little popular credence.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;Leach, Maria. ""Flint"." Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legend. 3rd ed.

==Thunderstone folklore==
[[File:HMB Steinaxtmanufaktur Vinelz Jungsteinzeit 2700 BC.jpg|thumb|Axe heads found at a 2700 BC Neolithic manufacture site in Switzerland, arranged in the various stages of production from left to right.]]
In [[Scandinavian mythology|Scandinavia]] thunderstones were frequently worshiped as [[Household deity|family gods]] who kept off spells and witchcraft. [[Beer]] was poured over them as an offering and they were sometimes anointed with butter. In [[Switzerland]] the owner of a thunderstone whirls it, on the end of a thong, three times round his head, and throws it at the door of his dwelling at the approach of a storm to prevent [[Lightning strike|lightning from striking the house]]. In Italy they are hung around children's necks to protect them from illness and to ward off the [[Evil eye]]. In Roman times they were sewn inside dog-collars along with a little piece of [[coral]] to keep the dogs from going mad. In Sweden they offer protection from [[Elf|elves]]. In the [[French Alps]] they protect sheep, while elsewhere in France they are thought to ease [[childbirth]]. In Burma they are used as a cure and preventative for [[appendicitis]]. In Japan they cure boils and ulcers. In Malay and Sumatra they are used to sharpen the [[kris]], are considered very lucky objects, and are credited with being [[Touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstones]] for gold. Among the Slavs they cure warts on man and beast, and during [[Passion Week]] they have the property to reveal hidden [[treasure]].&lt;ref name="Leach"/&gt;

===Further examples of thunderstone folklore===
[[Image:Bifaz de Atapuerca (TG10).jpg|thumb|left|Picture of two [[Lower Paleolithic]] [[biface]]s]]
In the [[British Isles]] some idea of their original use is retained, and they are often referred to variously as elf arrows, elf bolts, elf darts, or fairy arrows, and are said to have been shot by elves or [[fairies]] at a person or animal to bewitch them. On the other hand, they are thought, for the most part, to protect the possessor from these little people. The presence of flint instruments found in British [[cinerary urn]]s of the [[Roman Britain|Roman Era]] is explained by two theories: 1) they were used by the [[mourner]]s to lacerate themselves; 2) flints (like all fire-producing stones) are potent magic for preventing the [[Haunted house|return of the dead.]] In Ireland flint stones are soaked in water to make a medicine which is good for man or beast. Mounted in silver they are worn as protection against [[elf-shot]], i.e. elf- or fairy-inflicted disease.
In North Carolina and Alabama there is a belief that flint stones placed in the fire will keep hawks from molesting the chickens, a belief which probably stems from the European idea that elf arrows protect domestic animals. In Brazil, flint is used as a divining stone for gold, treasure and water.&lt;ref name="Leach"/&gt; 

During the [[Middle Ages]] many of these well-wrought stones were venerated as weapons, which during the "war in heaven" had been used in driving forth Satan and his hosts; hence, in the 11th century the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] sent to the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman emperor]] a "heaven axe"; and in the 12th century a [[Bishop of Rennes]] asserted the value of thunderstones as a divinely appointed means of securing success in battle, safety on the sea, security against thunder, and immunity from unpleasant dreams. 
Even as late as the 17th century, a French ambassador brought a stone hatchet, which still exists in the museum at [[Musée de l'École de Nancy|Nancy]], as a present to the Prince-Bishop of Verdun, and claimed that it had healing properties.&lt;ref name="McNamara"/&gt;

===Native American thunderstone folklore===
The flint was an object of veneration by most American Indian tribes. According to the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] [[Origin myth]], stone weapons and implements were given to man by the [[Pawnee mythology|Morning Star]]. Among the [[K'iche' people]] of Guatemala, there is a myth that a flint fell from the sky and broke into 1600 pieces, each of which became a god. [[Tohil]], the God who gave them fire, is still represented as flint. This myth provides a parallel to the almost universal belief in the thunderstone, and reminds us that [[Jupiter (mythology)]] was once worshipped in the form of a flint stone. The [[Cherokee]] [[shaman]] invokes a flint when he is about to [[scarify]] a patient prior to applying his medicine. Among the [[Pueblos]] we have the Flint Societies which, in most tribes, were primarily concerned with weather and witchcraft, but sometimes had to do with war and medicine.&lt;ref name="Leach"/&gt;

===Fossil echinoids as thunderstones===
In many parts of southern England until the middle of the nineteenth century, another name commonly used for fossil [[Echinoid]]s was 'thunderstone'. This was a name that in all likelihood formed part of another folk tradition that was almost certainly brought to Britain by [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[Anglo-Saxon]] invaders more than 1500 years ago. In 1677 [[Robert Plot|Dr. Robert Plot]], the first keeper of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford University|Oxford]], published his classic book ''The Natural History of Oxfordshire''. Plot recorded that in [[Oxfordshire]] what we now call fossil echinoids were called thunderstones, as they were thought to have descended from the heavens during a thunderstorm. 
The St. Peter's Church in [[Linkenholt]], England, was built in 1871 near the location of the old St. Peter's, which had stood for nearly 700 years. The 1871 version of the church included fossil echinoids built into the walls surrounding the windows, a style adopted from the original. This implies that Thunderstone folklore was retained for at least 700 years in England, and had its roots in [[pagan]] folklore.&lt;ref name="McNamara"&gt;McNanamara, Kenneth. (2007). Shepards' crowns, fairy loaves and thunderstones: the mythology of fossil echinoids in England. Myth and Geology, (273), 289-293.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of thunderstone mythology==
[[File:Boucher de Perthes.jpg|thumb|right|Boucher de Perthes]]
[[Andrew Dickson White]] described the discovery of the true origin of thunderstones as a "line of observation and thought ... fatal to the theological view". In the last years of the sixteenth century [[Michael Mercati]] tried to prove that the "thunder-stones" were weapons or implements of early races of men; but for some reason his book was not published until the following century, when other thinkers had begun to take up the same idea. In 1723 [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]] addressed the French Academy on "The Origin and Uses of Thunder-stones". He showed that recent travellers from various parts of the world had brought a number of weapons and other implements of stone to France, and that they were essentially similar to what in Europe had been known as "thunderstones". A year later this fact was firmly embedded in the minds of French scientists by the Jesuit [[Lafitau, Joseph-Francois|Joseph-Francois Lafitau]], who published a work showing the similarity between the customs of aborigines then existing in other lands and those of the early inhabitants of Europe. So began, in these works of Jussieu and Lafitau, the science of [[ethnology]]. It was more than 100 years later, after the [[French Revolution of 1830]], that the political climate in Europe was free enough of religious sentiment for archaeological discoveries to be dispassionately investigated and the conclusion reached that human existence spanned a much greater period of time than any Christian theologian had dreamt of.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Andrew D. [[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]. New York: George Braziller, 1955. 266-283&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boucher de Perthes===
In 1847, a man previously unknown to the world at large, [[Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes|Boucher de Perthes]], published in Paris the first volume of work on ''Celtic and Antediluvian Antiquities'', and in this he showed engravings of typical flint implements and weapons, of which he had discovered thousands upon thousands in the high drift beds near Abbeville, in northern France. So far as France was concerned, he was met at first by what he calls "a conspiracy of silence", and then by a contemptuous opposition among orthodox scientists, led by [[Jean-Baptiste Élie de Beaumont|Elie de Beaumont]]. 

In 1863 the thunderstone myth was further discredited by [[Charles Lyell]] in his book ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]''. Lyell had previously opposed the new ideas about [[human antiquity]], and his changing sides gave further force to the scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

The '''Tomb of the Prophets Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi''' (Arabic: قبر النبيا Qubur El Anbiyya, lit. "Grave (of) The Prophets") is an ancient burial site located on the upper western slope of the [[Mount of Olives]], [[Jerusalem]]. According to a medieval Jewish tradition also adopted by Christians, the catacomb is believed to be the burial place of [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] and [[Malachi]], the last three [[Hebrew Bible]] prophets who are believed to have lived during the 6th-5th centuries BC. Archaeologists have dated the three earliest burial chambers to the 1st century BC, thus contradicting the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700, 2008 (5th edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial chamber==
The chamber forms two concentric passages containing 38 burial niches.&lt;ref name="Cornfeld1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gaalyahu Cornfeld|title=I Love Jerusalem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJsxXIZvjcsC&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=22 November 2010|year=1973|publisher=Kinneret|page=138|id=GGKEY:75S35PKF07B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance to the large [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut burial cave]] is on the western side, where a staircase descends, flanked on both sides by a stone [[balustrade]].&lt;ref name="KlonerZissu2007"/&gt; It leads into a large circular central vault measuring 24&amp;nbsp;ft in diameter. From it, two parallel tunnels, 5&amp;nbsp;ft wide and 10&amp;nbsp;ft high, stretch some 20 yards through the rock. A third tunnel runs in another direction. They are all connected by cross galleries, the outer one of which measures 40  yards in length.&lt;ref name="Porter1866"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Josias Leslie Porter]]|title=The giant cities of Bashan and Syria's Holy places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mo75ino-q6MC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=27 November 2010|year=1866|publisher=T. Nelson and Sons|pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that the complex actually dates from the 1st-century BCE, when these style of tombs came into use for Jewish burial. Some Greek inscriptions discovered at the site suggest the cave was re-used to bury foreign Christians during the 4th and 5th centuries CE.&lt;ref name="Winter1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dave Winter|title=Israel handbook: with the Palestinian Authority areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFmaH4AbP6QC&amp;pg=PA169|accessdate=22 November 2010|year=1999|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-900949-48-4|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one of the side walls of the vault, a Greek inscription translates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Put thy faith in God, Dometila: No human creature is immortal!&lt;ref name="SaulcyWarren1854"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis Félicien Joseph Caignart de Saulcy|author2=Edouard de Warren|title=Narrative of a journey round the Dead Sea, and in the Bible lands, in 1850 and 1851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyoNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=27 November 2010|year=1854|publisher=Parry and M'Millan|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|''Wall of Love'' in 2010]]
The '''''Wall of Love''''' ({{lang-fr|Le mur des je t'aime}}, [[Literal and figurative language|lit.]] the '''''I Love You Wall''''') is a love-themed wall of {{convert|40|m2}} in the Jehan Rictus [[garden square]] in [[Montmartre]], [[Paris]], France. The wall was created in 2000 by calligraphist Fédéric Baron and mural artist Claire Kito&lt;ref name="wall"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.travelfranceonline.com/wall-of-love-mur-des-je-taime-montmartre/|title=Wall of Love – Mur des Je t’aime – Montmartre |publisher=Travel France Online |accessdate = 30 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is composed of 612 tiles of [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] [[Volcanic rock|lava]], on which the phrase 'I love you' is featured 311 times in 250 languages.&lt;ref name="wall"/&gt; Each tile is {{convert|21|×|29.7|cm}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71253/Le-mur-des-je-t%27aime |title=Le mur des je t'aime|publisher=Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau |accessdate = 30 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes the words 'I love you' in all major languages, but also in rarer ones like [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Inuit languages|Inuit]], [[Bambara language|Bambara]] and [[Esperanto]]. 

The wall is open to public free of charge.

== Origins ==
Fédéric Baron first asked his brother, and later his foreign neighbours, to write words of love in their languages, then collected 'I love you' in this way in over 300 languages and dialects of the world

Claire Kito, a calligrapher, then assembled them in a work to be realised on enamel plates. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.montmartre-guide.com/histoires_montmartre/mur-des-je-t-aime/|title=Le Mur des Je T'aime - Histoires de Montmartre Montmartre-Guide.com|work=Montmartre-Guide.com|access-date=2017-09-10|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
The symbolism of the wall was a personal choice of the artist. A wall is, of course, a symbol of division and separation, and here Fédéric Baron wished that a wall could also be a support for the most beautiful of human feelings. 

The red splashes on the wall symbolise parts of a broken heart, and can be gathered to form a full heart. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Wilhelm  Mautner''' (1889-1944) was born in [[Vienna]]. He was an Austrian-German economist and attorney-in-fact of the Rotterdamse Bank who spent a part of his life in the Netherlands. Mautner was born Jewish. He was also an art collector.

==Early years==
After a short professional career in banking and industry, he studied economics in Paris, Vienna and Tübingen, where he finished his studies and wrote a thesis about Bolshevism in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mautner|first1=Wilhelm|title=Der Bolschewismus - Voraussetzungen und Geschichte|publisher=W. Kohlhammer|location=Stuttgart|edition=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he moved to the Netherlands.

==World War II==

From 1929 until 1944 he lived in Amsterdam. Mautner never married and had no children. On 22 July 1941, he drew up a will in which he appointed his brother in Ohio in the United States as his sole heir. During the war Mautner attempted unsuccessfully to escape from the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/recommendations/recommendation_189_a.html All the information used for this article is from the Restitutions Committee] [RC. 1.89]-[9 February 2009], unless otherwise specified. &lt;/ref&gt; Mautner tried to get an exit visa for the United States with the help of his brother, who lived in New York. In December 1943 Mautner was removed from his home in Amsterdam during a raid and transported to [[Westerbork transit camp]] and from there to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]]&lt;ref&gt;Prisoners of Ghetto Theresienstadt (1940-1945) Database Personal records&lt;/ref&gt; concentration camp. Mautner died on or around 29 September 1944 in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

==Art collection==

Mautner collected paintings. His collection also included some Dutch old masters. He continued purchasing works of art during the war. At that time he was in frequent contact with [[Max Jakob Friedlander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artprovenance.nl/varia/|title=Ruth Kaloena Krul - Kunsthistorische Herkomst|website=www.artprovenance.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941, he was no longer able to do so in his own name because of his Jewish origins. He gave works of art to various people for safekeeping. In February 1942, Mautner was ordered to move to Tugelaweg in Amsterdam as a result of the forced relocation of Jews. He sent 15 paintings for safe-keeping with the collector Dr J. van Dongen on the city's Museumplein. The latter kept all of these items until after the war. Other works, including a Brueghel and a Timmermann, were sold under duress in 1943 by Mautner. Various of Mautner's works of art and other possessions were recovered for his heirs, by custodians of his estate after the war. The 15 paintings in J.A. van Dongen's custody were probably bought by van Dongen with the consent of Mautner's heirs.
Three of the paintings that Mautner sold under duress are:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The latter two were acquired by the [[Führermuseum|Sonderauftrag Linz]] and returned to the Netherlands after the war, where they became part of the NK-Collection of the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl, Search, Undirected Search, "Mautner", retrieved April 8, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also sold 12 paintings, primarily 19th century, to W. Kadzik from Vienna. Mautner could not act as a seller, due to his Jewish origin, so he asked his friend Hans Alfred Wetzlar to fulfill the formalities. It is unknown where the works are.

Women have engaged in [[philosophy]] throughout the field's history. While there were women [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, and a relatively small number were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, particularly during the 20th and 21st century, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane. Eight women philosophers: theory, politics, and feminism. University of Illinois Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.hipporeads.com/why-i-left-academia-philosophys-homogeneity-needs-rethinking/#|title=Why I Left Academia: Philosophy’s Homogeneity Needs Rethinking - Hippo Reads|author=|date=|website=read.hipporeads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient philosophy]] in the West, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], female philosophers such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC) were active during this period. Notable [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] include [[Hypatia]] (5th century), [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098-1179) and [[St. Catherine of Sienna]] (1347-1380). Notable [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] included [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) and [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850). Influential [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary philosophers]] include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), [[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919), [[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924), [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), [[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) and [[Susan Haack]] (born 1945).

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], giving rise to new generations of female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93). See also "Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities." National Center For Education Statistics, E.D. Tabs, July 1997. U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 97-973;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-93).&lt;/ref&gt; Women make up as little as 17% of philosophy faculty in some studies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;U.S. Department of Education statistics in above-cited reports seem to put the number closer to 17%, but these numbers are based on data from the mid-1990s. [[Margaret Urban Walker]]'s more recent article (2005) discusses the data problem and describes more recent estimates as an "(optimistically projected) 25–30 percent."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of [[misogyny]] and [[sexual harassment]]" of women students and professors.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/19/unofficial-internet-campaign-outs-professor-alleged-sexual-harassment-attempted|title=Unofficial Internet campaign outs professor for alleged sexual harassment, attempted assault|author=|date=|website=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], stated in 2015 that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jan/05/philosophy-is-for-posh-white-boys-with-trust-funds-why-are-there-so-few-women|title=Philosophy is for posh, white boys with trust funds' – why are there so few women?|first1=Rebecca|last1=Ratcliffe|first2=Claire|last2=Shaw|date=5 January 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that there is gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis - National Association of Scholars|author=|date=|website=www.nas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers, and they require editors and writers to ensure they represent the contributions of women philosophers.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline."&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|date=13 May 2015|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;

==Representation and working climate==
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Nussbaum/nussbaum-con1.html|title=Conversation with Martha C. Nussbaum, p. 1 of 6|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that "...there is compelling evidence" of "...philosophy’s gender imbalance" and "bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products." In 1992, the association recommended that "fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In a 2008 article “Changing the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),” MIT philosophy professor [[Sally Haslanger]] stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia “encourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled "Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis." The article states that a "...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to [[gender bias|bias against women]] or some kind of wrongful [[discrimination]]". Evidence cited includes "gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member"; "anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy"; "research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines"; "psychological research on implicit bias"; "psychological research on [[stereotype threat]]" and the "...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals".&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; Sesardic and De Clercq argue that "proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively."&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

American philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]] stated in 2008 that "...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn’t actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/philosphy-women-warnock-baggini-debate|title=Does philosophy have a problem with women?|first1=Mary|last1=Warnock|first2=Julian|last2=Baggini|date=25 July 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haslanger states that she experienced “occasions when a woman’s status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‘mature’ student), or was in a long-distance relationship". American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;

In July 2015, British philosopher [[Mary Warnock]] addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is "... against intervention, by [[Hiring quota|quota]]s or otherwise, to increase women’s chances of employment" in philosophy.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She also argues that "... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance" and she states that she does not "...believe it shows a conscious bias against women." &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] states that he believes that there is "...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a "...great deal of unconscious bias" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Allegations of sexual harassment===
In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; On March 28, 2011, the blog ''New APPS'' published a post examining the allegations of persistent [[sexual harassment]] faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to "serial harassers" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions. The post proposed that, since institutional procedures seemed to have been ineffective at removing or punishing harassers, philosophers should socially shun known offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/03/what-is-to-be-done-about-sexual-harassment-in-the-philosophy-profession.html What is to be done about sexual harassment in the philosophy profession? – New APPS: Art, Politics, Philosophy, Science].

Retrieved on 2011-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and several blogs, including [[Gawker]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.gawker.com/5787195/philosophy-departments-are-full-of-sexual-harassment Philosophy Departments Are Full of Sexual Harassment]. Ca.gawker.com (2011-03-30). Retrieved on 2011-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jezebel]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna North, [http://jezebel.com/5787263/philosophy-profs-propose-shunning-sexual-harassers Philosophy Profs Propose "Shunning" Sexual Harassers], Jezebel, Mar 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, a series of posts on the blog "What's it like to be a woman in philosophy?" instigated a spate of mainstream media articles on the continued dominance of men in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;"How can we end the male domination of philosophy?" https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/nov/26/modern-philosophy-sexism-needs-more-women&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What Is Philosophy's Problem With Women?: http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/09/09/philosophy_has_a_woman_problem_let_s_try_to_figure_out_why.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In the Humanities, Men Dominate the Fields of Philosophy and History": http://chronicle.com/article/Men-Dominate-Philosophy-and/135306/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Name Five Women In Philosophy. Bet You Can't.:https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/06/17/192523112/name-ten-women-in-philosophy-bet-you-can-t&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Schliesser, a professor of philosophy at [[Ghent University]], said he believes that the "...systematic pattern of exclusion of women in philosophy is, in part, due to the fact that my profession has allowed a culture of [[harassment]], sexual predating, and [[bullying]] to be reproduced from one generation to the next."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
According to Heidi Lockwood, an associate professor of philosophy at [[Southern Connecticut State University]], there is a "...power “asymmetry” between professors and students – even graduate students"; as well, she noted that "...even when colleges and universities have blanket prohibitions against professor-student sexual relationships, as does Yale,...institution-specific policies leave students vulnerable [to sexual advances from faculty] at conferences."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
 
According to an August 2013 article in ''Salon'', a tenured male University of Miami philosopher resigned after allegedly "...sending emails to a [female] student in which he suggested that they have sex three times."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], set up a blog for women philosophers in 2010. She received numerous allegations of [[sexual harassment]] by male philosophy faculty, including a "job candidate who said she was sexually assaulted at the annual APA meeting where job interviews take place", an "undergraduate whose professor joked publicly about dripping hot wax on her nipples" and a "... lesbian who found herself suddenly invited, after she came out, to join in the sexualizing of her female colleagues." Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations.&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; In 2013, the [[American Philosophical Association]] formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a "...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: “Show me a grad student I can fuck”." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Saul states that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 2014, ''Inside Higher Education'' reported allegations that a [[Yale University]] philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the "alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result".&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
In an interview with ''Inside Higher Ed'', the alleged victim stated that she "...suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the “browbeating” she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In 1993, the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?harassment|title=Statement on Sexual Harassment - The American Philosophical Association|author=|date=|website=www.apaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection."
*"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on."
*"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board."

===Black women===
[[File:Angela Davis en Bogotá, Septiembre de 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Angela Davis]] (born 1944) is an American [[Activism|political activist]], philosopher and author. Her research interests include [[African-American studies]] and the philosophy of punishment and prisons.]]
There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, [[African-American]]s and other individuals from the [[African diaspora]]. According to philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]], the "numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling"; in a 2003 study, there "...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report." &lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/women-in-philosophy-do-the-math/?_r=0|title=Women in Philosophy? Do the Math|first=Sally|last=Haslanger|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the "...representation of scholars of color is plausibly worse than in any other field in the academy, including not only physics, but also engineering."&lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt;  According to professor L.K. McPherson, there is a "gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"&gt;L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black-underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html&lt;/ref&gt;  McPherson states that there is a "...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"/&gt;

The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], who obtained her degree in 1965 from [[Yale University]]. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include [[Angela Davis]], a political activist who specializes in writing about [[feminism]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]], [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; [[Kathryn Gines]], the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in [[continental philosophy]], [[Africana philosophy]], [[Race theory|philosophy of race]] and Black [[feminist philosophy]]; [[Anita L. Allen]], the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by [[President Obama]] to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and [[Adrian Piper]], an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Stanford University]], and who specializes in [[Nietzsche]], nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and [[African-American philosophy]].

=== Asian women ===
Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/asian-american-woman-philosopher/|title=Asian, American, Woman, Philosopher|last=Yancy|first=George|last2=Lee|first2=Emily S.|date=2015-04-06|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Yancy]], Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at [[California State University, Fullerton]], states, "I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued." She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. [[University of Washington]] philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n1.pdf|title=Asian Americans, Positive Stereotyping, and Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: "Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy." On the other had, "Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in ''passive'' rather than aggressive terms." Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and "derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity" may also contribute to the wide disparity.

==Reports from the US ==
[[U.S. Department of Education]] reports indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"/&gt; Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‘in philosophy.’ This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one [[data set]] exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]]' 2000 report, "Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities," estimates in Table 23 that the total number of "History and Philosophy" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, "In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;NCES (2000), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1997 report, "[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97973.pdf Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities]," NCES notes, that about "one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4)." In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men),
12.7 are female (971 women).&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men);
female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy.

The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time."&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively)."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/sed-2004.pdf Hoffer, T.B., V.

However, all chapters focus broadly on issues minorities face in the profession, philosophical issues regarding minorities, and work done by minority philosophers, as well as issues that are specific to that school’s philosophy department. MAP’s short-term goals include providing a space for students to discuss and work on these issues, and long-term goals include contributing to the culture of academic philosophy and increasing participation and recognition of minorities in philosophy. In recent years, MAP has fostered collaborative work between chapters, establishing "connections between chapters that benefit both members and departments long-term,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapforthegap.com/uploads/2/2/3/2/22328318/eoy_report_.pdf|title=Minorities and Philosophy End of Year Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased work on inclusive pedagogy, and organized efforts to bring philosophy into communities outside of university campuses, such as prisons and elementary schools.

===APA committee on the status of women in philosophy===

The Committee on the Status of Women is a committee of the [[American Philosophical Association]] devoted to the assessment and reporting on the status of women in philosophy.&lt;ref name="apaonlinecsw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/mission|title=Mission - APA Committee on the Status of Women|author=|date=|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently chaired by [[Hilde Lindemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/members|title=Committee Members - APA Committee on the Status of Women|author=|date=|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, the Committee on the Status of Women co-sponsored a session on the central question "Why Are Women Only 21% of Philosophy".&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lemmingsblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/apa-report-status-of-women-in.html|title=APA Report: the Status of Women in Philosophy|author=|date=|website=lemmingsblog.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this session, Sharon Crasnow suggested that the low numbers of women in philosophy may be due to:
* Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the  classroom.
* Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. 
* Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy.&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"/&gt;

The blog [[Jennifer Saul#Distinguished Woman Philosopher Award|Feminist Philosophers]] hosts the Gendered Conference Campaign, which works toward increasing the representation of women at philosophy conferences and in edited volumes. The blog states that "all-male events and volumes help to perpetuate the stereotyping of philosophy as male. This in turn to contributes to implicit bias against women in philosophy...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/gendered-conference-campaign/ Gendered Conference Campaign " Feminist Philosophers].

==History==
While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"/&gt;  Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, "Feminist History of Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/feminism-femhist/&gt;.
  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline." &lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; According to [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the University of Sheffield, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the humanities, is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;
[[File:Emilie_Chatelet_portrait_by_Latour.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706-1749)]]
In the May 13, 2015 issue of ''The Atlantic'', Susan Price notes that even though Kant's first work in 1747 cites [[Emilie du Chatelet|Émilie Du Châtelet]], a philosopher who was a "...scholar of Newton, religion, science, and mathematics", "her work won’t be found in the 1,000-plus pages of the new edition of The Norton Introduction to Philosophy." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; The Norton Introduction does not name a female philosopher until the book begins to cover the mid-20th century. Scholars argue that women philosophers are also absent from the "...other leading anthologies used in university classrooms." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price states that university philosophy anthologies do not usually mention 17th century women philosophers such as [[Margaret Cavendish]], [[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]], and [[Lady Damaris Masham]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that some say still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Amy Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, states that “...women have been systematically left out of the canon, and that women coming in have not been able to see how much influence women have had in the field."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', which as published in 1967, had "...articles on over 900 philosophers, [but it] did not include an entry for [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] or [[Simone de Beauvoir|de Beauvoir]]. "[T]hese women philosophers were scarcely even marginal" to the canon set out at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/feminism-femhist/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Charlotte|last1=Witt|first2=Lisa|last2=Shapiro|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=11 July 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] (born 1947) argues that "...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ten-great-female-philosophers-the-thinking-womans-women-299061.html|title=Ten great female philosophers: The thinking woman's women|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia claims that "[t]oday's lack of major female philosophers is not due to lack of talent but to the collapse of philosophy", because, in her view, philosophy "... as traditionally practised may be a dead genre" that "belongs to a vanished age of much slower and rhetorically formal inquiry."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

[[File:Hipparchia of Maroneia Villa Farnesina.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]]. Detail from a Roman wall painting in the [[Villa Farnesina]] in [[Rome]].]]
Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of [[Plato]], [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]]. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' on her.&lt;ref name="Wider1986"&gt;K. Wider, "Women philosophers in the Ancient Greek World", 21–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sykoutris"&gt;I. Sykoutris, ''Symposium (Introduction and Comments)'', 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] attributes to the (possibly fictional) [[Diotima of Mantinea]] his lessons in the art of Eros (or philosophical searching). [[Plato]]'s final views on women are highly contested, but the ''Republic'' suggests that women are equally capable of education, intellectual vision, and rule of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garside|first1=Christine|title=Plato on Women|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1975|pages=131–138|jstor=3177773|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Jacobs, William "Platon on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=William|title=Plato on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family|journal=Apeiron|date=June 1978|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–31|doi=10.1515/apeiron.1978.12.1.29|jstor=40913404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable philosophers include:
*[[Theano of Croton]] (6th century BC)
*[[Aristoclea of Delphi]] (6th century BC)
*[[Sosipatra of Ephesus]] (4th century BC)
*[[Nicarete of Megara]] (flourished around 300 BC)

[[Medieval philosophy]] dates from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD to the Renaissance in the 16th century. [[Hypatia]] (AD 350 – 370 to 415) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]], astronomer, and philosopher in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], then a part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="socrates"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Ecclesiastical History|last= Scholasticus|first= Socrates |authorlink= Socrates Scholasticus |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |url = http://cosmopolis.com/alexandria/hypatia-bio-socrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the head of the [[Neoplatonic]] school at [[Alexandria]], where she taught [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries''; ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999: ''"Greek Neoplatonist philosopher who lived and taught in Alexandria."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook |last1=Mueller |first1=I. |authorlink= |author2=L.S.

*[[Moderata Fonte]] (1555–1592), critic of religion, feminist

===Modern philosophy===
The 17th century marks the beginning of the [[modern philosophy]] era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced [[René Descartes]] and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on [[John Locke]]’s philosophy. [[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. [[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by [[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) in her essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her essay ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). During the 19th century, [[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876)  criticized the state of women's education and [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858), [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) called for [[women's rights]]. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) argued that women were oppressed by an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. Near the start of the 20th century, [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was the first woman to become president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Women thinkers such as [[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940), an [[anarchism|anarchist]], and
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919), a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], are known for their political views.

====17th century====
*[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated.
*[[Anna Maria van Schurman]] (1607–1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of [[female education]]. 
*[[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] (1618–1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably [[René Descartes]], who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. 
*[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]] (1623–1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy.
*[[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]] (1631-1679) was an [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] whose work, in the tradition of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], was an influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Conway's thought is original as it is [[rationalist philosophy]], with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.&lt;ref name="Duran2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Damaris Cudworth Masham]] (1659–1708) was an English philosopher, [[proto-feminist]], and advocate for women's education. 
*[[Mary Astell]] (1666–1731) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] writer and [[rhetorician]] known for advocacy of equal [[educational opportunities for women]], which earned her the title of "first English feminist."&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;Batchelor, Jennie.

*[[Catharine Trotter Cockburn]] (1679–1749) published her first major philosophical work, ''A Defence of Mr. Lock[e]'s [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' in 1702, at the age of 23. Much of the scholarly interest in her writing centres on [[gender studies]]. 
*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She translated and commented on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. She criticized [[John Locke]]’s philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience. She also theorized about [[free will]] and on the way to do [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was an Italian philosopher and physicist who was the first woman in the world to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies. She received a doctoral degree from the [[University of Bologna]] in May 1732,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Laura Bassi| work = MacTutor Biography| publisher = University of St Andrews| url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bassi.html| accessdate = 30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third academic qualification ever bestowed on a woman by a university,&lt;ref name="Findlen, Paula"&gt;Findlen, Paula.

*[[Catharine Macaulay]] (1731–1791) was an English historian and writer. She attacked [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]'', calling it "a poison...".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1992|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1790 ''Letters on Education'', she argued along the lines that [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] would do in 1792, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis-education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walters, Margaret|year=2006|title=Feminism: A Very Short Introduction|location=USA|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280510-X|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male–female inequality. 
*[[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) was an early [[United States|American]] advocate for women's rights, an essayist, [[playwright]], [[poet]], and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes—that women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other [[Feminism|feminist]] writers of the century. The essay predated [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' which was published in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Mary|title=An Enlightened Woman: Judith Sargent Murray and the Call to Equality|journal=[[Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review|Undergraduate Review]]|date=2011|volume=7|issue=21|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&amp;context=undergrad_rev|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. She is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]]. In ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work,&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

====19th century====
*[[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876) was an English [[social theorist]] and political writer, often cited as the first female [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Hill, Michael R.

Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94528-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote books and essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and feminine perspective.  In ''Society in America'', she criticised the state of women's education, stating that the "intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction" of access to education; she urged women to become well-educated and free.
*[[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858) was a philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. In [[John Stuart Mill]]'s autobiography, he claimed she was the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He stated that "when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen." Together, they wrote "Early Essays on Marriage and Divorce", published in 1832.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=harriet+taylor+mill|title=Search (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) was an American journalist, critic, philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration.
*[[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the [[United States]]. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as [[abolition of slavery]] and she sought to expand [[women's rights]]. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women.
*[[Victoria, Lady Welby]] (1837–1912) was a self-educated English [[philosopher of language]]. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and ''[[The Monist]]''. She published her first philosophical book, ''What Is Meaning?  Studies in the Development of Significance'' in 1903, following it with ''Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources'' in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word ''significs'' for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and [[semiology]]. 
*[[Bertha von Suttner]] (1843–1914) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'').&lt;ref name="weop"&gt;''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]]. ''The World Encyclopedia of Peace''. Edited by [[Ervin László]], [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Jong Youl Yoo]]. Oxford : Pergamon, 1986. {{ISBN|0-08-032685-4}}, (vol. 3, pp. 201–4).&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Helene von Druskowitz]] (1856–1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant [[sexism]] of the era.
*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) was an American [[feminist]], [[sociologist]], novelist, writer and [[social reform]]er. Her short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. She argued that the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann J. Lane, ''To Herland and Beyond'', 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. She argued that women were the underdeveloped half of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Knight, ''Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Her Contemporaries'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women.

====Early 20th century====
*[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]]. She was also the first woman to become president of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Calkins studied psychology under [[William James]] and studied at [[Harvard University]], which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1980 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 55–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1981.tb01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1979 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 346–356 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197910)15:4&lt;346::aid-jhbs2300150408&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as "the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard." &lt;ref name="Hilgard, E.

*[[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a [[free-thinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution.&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=122–134|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. 
*[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919) was a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Economics|economist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] of [[Polish-Jewish]] descent. While Luxemburg defended Marx's materialism dialectics and his conception of history, she called for spontaneous [[grass roots]]-based [[class struggle]].

===Contemporary philosophy===
[[File:Hannah_arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) considered herself a political theorist, but she is often described as a philosopher.]]
[[Contemporary philosophy]] is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the end of the 19th century with the [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. Some influential women philosophers from this period include:
*[[Ayn Rand]] (1905-1982) developed a philosophical system she named [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], which affirms [[objective reality]] and advocates holding [[reason]] as absolute.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/objectivity.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/reason.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ethics]], Rand championed [[rational egoism]] and [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/self-interest.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[politics]], she advocated for [[individual rights]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[esthetics]],  she upheld [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/romanticism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regards [[Aristotle]] as her sole major philosophical influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/aristotle.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985) was an American [[philosopher]] of [[philosopher of mind|mind]] and of [[philosopher of art|art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in [[philosophy]] and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name="gardner1"&gt;{{Citation|author=[[Howard Gardner]]|title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity|chapter=Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer |publisher=Basic Books|pages=48–54|location=New York|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/gardnerlanger.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Human Condition''. 2nd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998.&lt;!-- isbn needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her works deal with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]], and the subjects of politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and [[totalitarianism]]. The [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] is named in her honor.
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]].]]
*[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]].
*[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.  [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know".&lt;ref name="Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G. E. M. Anscombe (1919–2001)|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=1019–1021|jstor=20131480}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919) is an English [[ethics|moral philosopher]]. A senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], she is known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. Midgley strongly opposes [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argues, wholly inadequate. She has written extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. ''The Guardian'' has described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'"&lt;ref name=brown2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] of [[ethics|morality]], [[philosophy of education|education]] and [[philosophy of mind|mind]], and writer on [[existentialism]]. From 1984 to 1991, she was [[Master (college)|Mistress]] of [[Girton College, Cambridge]]. Warnock studied at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1984. She delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]], entitled "Imagination and Understanding," at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1992. She has written extensively on [[ethics]], [[existentialism]] and [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref name=Honderich&gt;{{cite book|last=Honderich|first=Ted|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-866132-0|page=907|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Philippa Foot]] (1920-2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], most notable for her works in [[ethics]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]]. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him.
*[[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) is a Canadian-American [[philosopher]] noted for her contributions to [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the [[University of Oxford]], she taught philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1969 to 1984.
*[[Susan Haack]] (born 1945) is distinguished professor in the humanities, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami. She earned her PhD at [[Cambridge University]]. She has written on [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]]. Her [[pragmatism]] follows that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Haack's major contribution to philosophy is her [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory called [[foundherentism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aune | first1 = B. | title = Haack's ''Evidence and Inquiry''| journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–632 | doi = 10.2307/2108389 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flage | first1 = D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2137">[[File:Charles Emile van Marcke de Lummen.jpg|thumb|Charles Émile van Marcke de Lummen]]

'''Émile van Marcke''', born Charles Émile van Marcke de Lummen (1827 in [[Sèvres]] &amp;ndash; 1890/91), was a [[French people|French]] cattle painter, born at [[Sèvres]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]].&lt;ref&gt;Annales archéologiques - Page 277 1833 "lithographies, par Émile Van Marcke, d'après les photographies de L. Robert."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courrier de l'art: Volume 6 Eugène Véron, Paul Leroi - 1886 "A. L'Enclos, épreuve avant la lettre de la lithographie de M. Théophile Chauvel, d'après le tableau de M. Émile Van Marcke "&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied under [[Constant Troyon|Troyon]] at [[Barbizon school|Barbizon]]. He received the cross of the [[Legion of Honor]] in 1872 and a gold medal at the Paris exhibition. He is represented at the [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]] and other museums of [[France]], and at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida, and in other public and private collections in the [[United States]]. Typical of his work is the public domain image ''Summer Pastoral, Bresle Valley'' on this page reproduced courtesy of the Morton Collection. This gem-like work offers the favorite themes of van Marcke in a microcosm; it incorporates cattle, water, reflections, dramatic [[cloudscape (art)|cloudscape]]s and a feeling of life and motion and verdant nature. Nature is idyllic and animals emblematic of that harmony.
