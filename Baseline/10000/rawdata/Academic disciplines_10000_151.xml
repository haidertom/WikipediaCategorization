'''Aldo Rossi''' (3 May 1931 – 4 September 1997) was an Italian [[architect]] and [[designer]] who achieved international recognition in four distinct areas: architectural theory, drawing and design and also product design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Germano |last=Celant |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Diane |last2=Ghirardo |title=Aldo Rossi: Drawings |publisher=Skira |location=Milan |year=2008 |isbn=978-88-6130-143-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first Italian to receive the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;Pritzker Prize for Architecture - [http://www.pritzkerprize.com/about/purpose chriteria]&lt;/ref&gt; for architecture.

==Early life==

He was born in [[Milan]], [[Italy]].  After early education by the [[Somaschi Fathers|Somascan Religious Order]] and then at [[:it:Collegio arcivescovile Alessandro Volta|Alessandro Volta College]] in [[Lecco]], in 1949 he went to the school of architecture at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]].  His thesis advisor was [[:it:Piero Portaluppi|Piero Portaluppi]] and he  graduated in 1959.

In 1955 he had started writing for, and from 1959 was one of the editors of, the architectural magazine [[Casabella|Casabella-Continuità]], with editor in chief [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]]. Rossi left in 1964, when the chief editorship went to Gian Antonio Bernasconi. Rossi went on to work for [[:it:Società (rivista)|Società magazine]] and Il_contemporaneo, making him one of the most active participants in the fervent cultural debate of the time.

His early articles cover architects such as [[Alessandro Antonelli]],  [[:it:Mario Ridolfi|Mario Ridolfi]], [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Emil Kaufmann]] and much of this material became part of his second book, ''Scritti scelti sull'architettura e la città 1956-1972'' (''Selected writings on architecture and the city from 1956 to 1972''). He married the Swiss actress Sonia Gessner, who introduced him to the world of film and theater. Culture and his family became central to his life. His son Fausto was active in movie-making both in front of and behind the camera and his daughter Vera was involved with theatre.

==Career==

He began his professional career at the studio of [[Ignazio Gardella]] in 1956, moving on to the studio of [[Marco Zanuso]]. In 1963 also he began teaching, firstly as an assistant to [[:it:Ludovico Quaroni|Ludovico Quaroni]] (1963) at the school of urban planning in [[Arezzo]], then to [[Carlo Aymonino]] at the [[Università Iuav di Venezia|Institute of Architecture in Venice]]. In 1965 he was appointed lecturer at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]] and the following year he published ''The architecture of the city'' which soon became a classic of architectural literature.

His professional career, initially dedicated to architectural theory and small building work took a huge leap forward when [[Carlo Aymonino|Aymonino]] allowed Rossi to design part of the [[Monte Amiata Housing|Monte Amiata complex]] in the [[Gallaratese|Gallaratese quarter]] of Milan. In 1971 he won the design competition for the extension of the San Cataldo Cemetery in [[Modena]], which made him internationally famous.

After suspension from teaching in Italy in those politically troubled times, he moved to [[ETH Zurich]], occupying the chair in architectural design from 1971 to 1975.

In 1973 he was director of the International Architecture Section at the [[:it:XV Triennale di Milano|XV Milan Triennial Exhibition of Decorative Arts and Modern Architecture]], where he presented, among others, his student [[Arduino Cantafora]].  Rossi's design ideas for the exhibition are explained in the International Architecture Catalogue and in a 16mm documentary ''Ornament and crime'' directed by Luigi Durissi and produced along with Gianni Braghieri and Franco Raggi.  In 1975, Rossi returned to the teaching profession in Italy, teaching architectural composition in Venice.

In 1979 he was made a member of the prestigious [[Accademia di San Luca|Academy of Saint Luke]]. Meanwhile, there was international interest in his skills.  He taught at several universities in the United States, including [[Cooper Union]] in New York City and [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca (New York State).  At Cornell he participated in the ''Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies'' joint venture with New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], travelling to China and Hong Kong and attending conferences in South America.

In 1981 he published his autobiography, ''A scientific autobiography''. In this work the author, "in discrete disorder", brings back memories, objects, places, forms, literature notes, quotes, and insights and tries to "... go over things or impressions, describe, or look for ways to describe."  In the same year he won first prize at the international competition for the design of an apartment block on the corner of Kochstraße and Wilhelmstraße in central [[Berlin]].

In 1984 together with [[Ignazio Gardella]] and [[Fabio Reinhart]], he won the competition for the renovation of the [[Teatro Carlo Felice]] in [[Genoa]], which was not fully completed until 1991. In 1985 and 1986 Rossi was director of the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture|3rd (respectively 4th) International Architecture Exhibition]] at the [[Venice Biennale]] including further away display spaces such as Villa Farsetti in [[Santa Maria di Sala]].

In 1987 he won two international competitions: one for a site at the [[Parc de la Villette]] in Paris, the other for the [[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] in Berlin, which was never brought to fruition. In 1989 he continued product design work for Unifor (now part of [[:it:Molteni&amp;C|Molteni Furniture]]) and [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]]. His espresso maker ''La Cupola'', designed for Alessi came out in 1988.

In 1990 he was awarded the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name=Goldberger1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberger|first1=Paul|title=Aldo Rossi: Sentiment For The Unsentimental|work=New York Times|date=22 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Fukuoka]] in Japan honoured him for his work on the hotel complex ''The Palace'' and he won the 1991 Thomas Jefferson Medal in Public Architecture from the [[American Institute of Architects]]. These prestigious awards were followed by exhibitions at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, the [[Beurs van Berlage]] in Amsterdam, the [[Berlinische Galerie]] in Berlin and the [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Ghent, Belgium.

In 1996 he became an honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and the following year he received their special cultural award in architecture and design.  He died in Milan on 4 September 1997, following a car accident. Posthumously he received the ''[[Torre Guinigi]]'' prize for his contribution to urban studies and the ''Seaside Prize'' of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150509102932/http://seasideinstitute.org/what-we-do/ Seaside Institute], Florida, where he had built a detached family home in 1995.

On appeal his proposals won the 1999 competition for the restoration of the [[Teatro La Fenice]], Venice and it reopened in 2004.  In 1999 the Faculty of Architecture of the [[University of Bologna]], based in [[Cesena]], was named after him.

==Work==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stainless steel kettle "Il Conico" (designed by Aldo Rossi).png|thumb|200px|left|Stainless steel kettle ''Il Conico'', 1986]] --&gt;
[[File:Aldo Rossi La Cupola Alessi Coffee Maker Austin Calhoon Photograph.jpg|thumb|200px|Aldo Rossi La Cupola Espresso Maker 1988, produced by Alessi]]
His earliest works of the 1960s were mostly theoretical and displayed a simultaneous influence of 1920s [[Italian modernism]] (''see [[Giuseppe Terragni]]''), classicist influences of Viennese architect [[Adolf Loos]], and the reflections of the painter [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. A trip to the [[Soviet Union]] to study [[Stalinist architecture]] also left a marked impression.

In his writings Rossi criticized the lack of understanding of the city in current architectural practice. He argued that a city must be studied and valued as something constructed over time; of particular interest are urban artifacts that withstand the passage of time. Rossi held that the city remembers its past (our "collective memory"), and that we use that memory through monuments; that is, monuments give structure to the city. Inspired by the persistence of Europe's ancient cities, Rossi strove to create similar structures immune to obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Aldo Rossi, Modena Cemetery, Model, c.1983.jpg.png|thumb|right|200px|Model of San Cataldo Cemetery, [[Modena]], Italy, 1971-]]  --&gt;
He became extremely influential in the late 1970s and 1980s as his body of built work expanded and for his theories promoted in his books ''[[The Architecture of the City]]'' (''L'architettura della città'', 1966) and ''A Scientific Autobiography'' (''Autobiografia scientifica'', 1981).The largest of Rossi's projects in terms of scale was the San Cataldo Cemetery, in [[Modena]], Italy, which began in 1971 but is yet to be completed. Rossi referred to it as a "city of the dead".

The distinctive independence of his buildings is reflected in the micro-architectures of the products designed by Rossi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buerdek |first=Bernhard E. |year=2005 |title=Design: History, theory and practice of product design |url= |location=Basel, Switzerland |publisher=Birkhauser-Publishers for Architecture |isbn=978-3-764-37029-9 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s Rossi designed stainless steel [[French press|cafetières]] and other products for [[Alessi (company)|Alessi]], [[Pirelli]], and others.

[[File:Bonnefanten2013-04.jpg|thumb|200px|Central staircase [[Bonnefanten Museum]], [[Maastricht]]]]

==Exhibits==

For the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1979 Rossi designed a floating ''Teatro del Mondo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archidose.blogspot.com/1999/02/teatro-del-mondo.html |title=Teatro del Mondo |date=8 February 1999 |access-date=29 October 2018 |work=A Daily Dose of Architecture |first=John |last=Hill |publisher=[[Blogspot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seated 250 people. For the Venice Biennale in 1984, he designed a triumphal arch at the entrance to the exhibition site. In 2006 two [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] based on an original 1989 design by Aldo Rossi were erected in front of the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht by the Delft architectural firm Ufo Architecten.

'''Alternatives to evolution by natural selection''', also described as '''non-Darwinian mechanisms of evolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Darwinian mechanisms of evolution and their authors|url=http://darwiniana.com/2012/02/24/non-darwinian-mechanisms-of-evolution-and-their-authors/|publisher=Darwiniana|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been proposed by scholars investigating biology since classical times to explain signs of [[evolution]] and the [[Homology (biology)|relatedness]] of different groups of living things. The alternatives in question do not encompass religious points of view such as young or old earth [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]], but are limited to explanations proposed by biologists, though one was confusingly named 'theistic evolution' by [[Asa Gray]].

Where the fact of evolutionary change was accepted but the mechanism proposed by [[Charles Darwin]], [[natural selection]], was denied, explanations of evolution such as [[Lamarckism]], [[catastrophism]], [[orthogenesis]], [[vitalism]], [[structuralism (biology)|structuralism]] and [[mutationism]] (called saltationism before 1900) were entertained. Different factors motivated people to propose non-[[Darwinism|Darwinian]] mechanisms of evolution. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it immoral, leaving little room for [[Teleology in biology|teleology]] or the concept of progress in the development of life. Some who came to accept evolution, but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections. Others felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others felt that nature, including the development of life, followed orderly patterns that natural selection could not explain.

By the start of the 20th century, evolution was generally accepted by biologists but [[eclipse of Darwinism|natural selection was in eclipse]].{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=246–281}} Many alternative theories were proposed, but biologists were quick to discount theories such as orthogenesis, vitalism and Lamarckism which offered no mechanism for evolution. Mutationism did propose a mechanism, but it was not generally accepted. The [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] a generation later claimed to sweep away all the alternatives to Darwinian evolution, though some have been revived as molecular mechanisms for them have been discovered.

==Unchanging forms==
{{main|Hylomorphism|Great chain of being}}

[[Aristotle]] did not embrace either divine creation or evolution, instead arguing [[Aristotle's biology|in his biology]] that each species (''eidos'') was immutable, breeding true to its [[Hylomorphism|ideal eternal form]] (not the same as Plato's [[theory of Forms]]).{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Leroi|2015|p=89}} Aristotle's suggestion in ''[[De Generatione Animalium]]'' of a fixed hierarchy in nature - a ''scala naturae'' ("ladder of nature") provided an early explanation of the continuity of living things.{{sfn|Lloyd|1968|pp=166–169}}{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pp=276–278}}{{sfn|Mayr|1985|pp=201–202}} Aristotle saw that animals were [[teleology|teleological]] (functionally end-directed), and had parts that were [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with those of other animals, but he did not connect these ideas into a concept of evolutionary progress.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=43}}

In the Middle Ages, [[Scholasticism]] developed Aristotle's view into the idea of a [[great chain of being]].{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}} The image of a ladder inherently suggests the possibility of climbing, but both the ancient Greeks and mediaeval scholastics such as [[Ramon Lull]]{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}} maintained that each species remained fixed from the moment of its creation.{{sfn|Lovejoy|2011|p=228 and passim}}{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=43}}

By 1818, however, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued in his ''Philosophie anatomique'' that the chain was "a progressive series", where animals like molluscs low on the chain could "rise, by addition of parts, from the simplicity of the first formations to the complication of the creatures at the head of the scale", given sufficient time. Accordingly, Geoffroy and later biologists looked for explanations of such evolutionary change.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=95}}

[[Georges Cuvier]]'s 1812 ''Recherches sur les Ossements Fossiles'' set out his doctrine of the correlation of parts, namely that since an organism was a whole system, all its parts mutually corresponded, contributing to the function of the whole. So, from a single bone the zoologist could often tell what class or even genus the animal belonged to. And if an animal had teeth adapted for cutting meat, the zoologist could be sure without even looking that its sense organs would be those of a predator and its intestines those of a carnivore. A species had an irreducible functional complexity, and "none of its parts can change without the others changing too".{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=18–21}} Evolutionists expected one part to change at a time, one change to follow another. In Cuvier's view, evolution was impossible, as any one change would unbalance the whole delicate system.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=18–21}}

[[Louis Agassiz]]'s 1856 "Essay on Classification" exemplified German philosophical idealism. This held that each species was complex within itself, had complex relationships to other organisms, and fitted precisely into its environment, as a pine tree in a forest, and could not survive outside those circles. The argument from such ideal forms opposed evolution without offering an actual alternative mechanism. [[Richard Owen]] held a similar view in Britain.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=42–43, 111}}

The Lamarckian social philosopher and evolutionist [[Herbert Spencer]], ironically the author of the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" adopted by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]],{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=239, 342}} used an argument like Cuvier's to oppose natural selection. In 1893, he stated that a change in any one structure of the body would require all the other parts to adapt to fit in with the new arrangement. From this, he argued that it was unlikely that all the changes could appear at the right moment if each one depended on random variation; whereas in a Lamarckian world, all the parts would naturally adapt at once, through a changed pattern of use and disuse.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=149, 253, 259}}

==Alternative explanations of change==
{{further|Eclipse of Darwinism}}

Where the fact of evolutionary change was accepted by biologists but [[natural selection]] was denied, including but not limited to the late 19th century [[eclipse of Darwinism]], alternative scientific explanations such as [[Lamarckism]], [[orthogenesis]], [[structuralism]], [[catastrophism]], [[vitalism]] and theistic evolution&lt;!--don't link, that's a different topic--&gt;{{efn|Not to be confused with the more recent use of the term [[theistic evolution]], which refers to a theological belief in the compatibility of science and religion.}} were entertained, not necessarily separately. (Purely religious points of view such as young or old earth [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]] are not considered here.) Different factors motivated people to propose non-Darwinian evolutionary mechanisms. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it immoral, leaving little room for [[Teleology in biology|teleology]] or the concept of progress in the development of life.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=197}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=119–120}} Some of these scientists and philosophers, like [[St. George Jackson Mivart]] and [[Charles Lyell]], who came to accept evolution but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections.{{sfn|Quammen|2006|pp=209–210}} Others, such as the biologist and philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], the botanist [[George Henslow]] (son of Darwin's mentor [[John Stevens Henslow]], also a botanist), and the author [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others, including the American paleontologists [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], had an idealist perspective and felt that nature, including the development of life, followed orderly patterns that natural selection could not explain.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}

Some felt that natural selection would be too slow, given the estimates of the [[age of the earth]] and sun (10–100 million years) being made at the time by physicists such as [[Lord Kelvin]], and some felt that natural selection could not work because at the time the models for inheritance involved blending of inherited characteristics, an objection raised by the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] in a review of ''Origin'' written shortly after its publication.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}} Another factor at the end of the 19th century was the rise of a new faction of biologists, typified by geneticists like [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], who wanted to recast biology as an experimental laboratory science. They distrusted the work of naturalists like Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], dependent on field observations of variation, adaptation, and [[biogeography]], as being overly anecdotal. Instead they focused on topics like [[physiology]] and [[genetics]] that could be investigated with controlled experiments in the laboratory, and discounted less accessible phenomena like natural selection and [[adaptation]] to the environment.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=143–147,182}}

===Vitalism===
[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Pasteur]] believed that only living things could carry out [[fermentation]]. Painting by [[Albert Edelfelt]], 1885]]
{{main|Vitalism}}

Vitalism holds that living organisms differ from other things in containing something non-physical, such as a fluid or vital spirit, that makes them live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |author=Bechtel, William; Robert C. Richardson |date=1998 |title=Vitalism |editor=Craig, E. |work=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory dates to ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jidenu, Paulin |date=1996 |title=African Philosophy |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-21096-8 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|BirchCobb|1985|pp=76–78}}
Since [[Early Modern]] times, vitalism stood in contrast to the mechanistic explanation of biological systems started by [[Descartes]]. Nineteenth century chemists  set out to disprove the claim that forming organic compounds required vitalist influence.&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt; In 1828, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] showed that [[urea]] could be made entirely from inorganic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kinne-Saffran |first1=E. |last2=Kinne |first2=R. K. H. |title=Vitalism and Synthesis of Urea |journal=American Journal of Nephrology|date=1999 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=290–292 |doi=10.1159/000013463}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Pasteur]] believed that [[fermentation]] required whole organisms, which he supposed carried out chemical reactions found only in living things. The embryologist [[Hans Driesch]], experimenting on [[sea urchin]] eggs, showed that separating the first two cells led to two complete but small [[blastula]]s, seemingly showing that cell division did not divide the egg into sub-mechanisms, but created more cells each with the vital capability to form a new organism. Vitalism faded out with the demonstration of more satisfactory mechanistic explanations of each of the functions of a living cell or organism.&lt;ref name=Bechtel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Bechtel |first1=William |last2=Richardson |first2=Robert C. |title=Vitalism |editor=Craig, E. |work=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=https://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |publisher=Routledge |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Driesch, Hans |authorlink=Hans Driesch |year=1914 |title=The History and Theory of Vitalism |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1931, biologists had "almost unanimously abandoned vitalism as an acknowledged belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bedau, Mark A.; Cleland, Carol E. |title=The Nature of Life: Classical and Contemporary Perspectives from Philosophy and Science |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=95 |isbn=978-0-521-51775-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theistic evolution===

The American botanist [[Asa Gray]] used the name "theistic evolution"{{efn|Gray, and later historians of science, did not refer to a 20th century usage of [[theistic evolution]] (described in that article), that one can accept Darwinian evolution without being an atheist.}} for his point of view, presented in his 1876 book ''Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gray, Asa |authorlink=Asa Gray |year=1876 |title=Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism |publisher=Appleton |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.19483|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.19483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the deity supplies beneficial mutations to guide evolution. [[St George Jackson Mivart]] argued instead in his 1871 ''On the Genesis of Species'' that the deity, equipped with foreknowledge, sets the direction of evolution by specifying the (orthogenetic) laws that govern it, and leaves species to evolve according to the conditions they experience as time goes by. [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|The Duke of Argyll]] set out similar views in his 1867 book ''The Reign of Law''.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=George|title=The Reign of Law|date=1867|publisher=Strahan|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/argyll/5rl.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian Edward Larson, the theory failed as an explanation in the minds of late 19th century biologists as it broke the rules of [[methodological naturalism]] which they had grown to expect.{{sfn|Larson|2004|p=126}} Accordingly, by around 1900, biologists no longer saw theistic evolution as a valid theory. In Larson's view, by then it "did not even merit a nod among scientists." Biologists might argue about mechanisms, but they were in no doubt that a mechanistic explanation was needed.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–128}} In the 20th century, theistic evolution could take other forms, such as the orthogenesis of Teilhard de Chardin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Morris, John D.; Morris, Henry M. |title=The Modern Creation Trilogy |year=1998 |publisher=New Leaf |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthogenesis===
[[File:Titanothere Osborn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] claimed in 1918 that [[Titanothere]] horns showed a non-[[adaptation|adaptive]] [[Orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] trend.]]
{{main|Orthogenesis}}

Orthogenesis is the hypothesis that life has an innate tendency to change, developing in a unilinear fashion in a particular direction, or simply making some kind of definite progress. Many different versions have been proposed, some such as that of [[Teilhard de Chardin]] openly spiritual, others such as [[Theodor Eimer]]'s apparently simply biological. These theories often combined orthogenesis with other supposed mechanisms. For example, Eimer believed in Lamarckian evolution, but felt that internal laws of growth determined which characteristics would be acquired and would guide the long-term direction of evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=249}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=221}}

Orthogenesis was popular among paleontologists such as [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]. They believed that the fossil record showed unidirectional change, but did not necessarily accept that the mechanism driving orthogenesis was [[teleological]] (goal-directed). Osborn argued in his 1918 book ''Origin and Evolution of Life'' that trends in [[Titanothere]] horns were both orthogenetic and non-[[adaptation|adaptive]], and could be detrimental to the organism. For instance, they supposed that the large antlers of the [[Irish elk]] had caused its extinction.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=249}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=221}}

Support for orthogenesis fell during the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1940s when it became apparent that it could not explain the complex branching patterns of evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the [[fossil record]].{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}} Work in the 21st century has supported the mechanism and existence of mutation-biased adaptation (a form of mutationism), meaning that constrained orthogenesis is now seen as possible.&lt;ref name=Yampolsky&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yampolsky, L.

===Lamarckism===
{{main|Lamarckism}}
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], drawn by [[Jules Pizzetta]], 1893]]

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s 1809 evolutionary theory, [[transmutation of species]], was based on a progressive (orthogenetic) drive toward greater complexity. Lamarck also shared the belief, common at the time, that [[inheritance of acquired characteristics|characteristics acquired during an organism's life could be inherited]] by the next generation, producing adaptation to the environment. Such characteristics were caused by the use or disuse of the affected part of the body. This minor component of Lamarck's theory became known, much later, as [[Lamarckism]].{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=86–95}} Darwin included ''Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection'' in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', giving examples such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the [[ostrich]], they could not fly at all.{{sfn|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=136 108]}} In the late 19th century, [[neo-Lamarckism]] was supported by the German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]], the American [[paleontologist]]s [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], and the American [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Alpheus Spring Packard|Alpheus Packard]]. Butler and Cope believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=236}} Packard argued that the loss of vision in the blind cave insects he studied was best explained through a Lamarckian process of atrophy through disuse combined with inheritance of acquired characteristics.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=236}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–129}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=217}} Meanwhile, the English botanist [[George Henslow]] studied how environmental stress affected the development of plants, and he wrote that the variations induced by such environmental factors could largely explain evolution; he did not see the need to demonstrate that such variations could actually be inherited.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=239–240}} Critics pointed out that there was no solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Instead, the experimental work of the German biologist [[August Weismann]] resulted in the germ plasm theory of inheritance, which Weismann said made the inheritance of acquired characteristics impossible, since the [[Weismann barrier]] would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–129}}{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=253–255}}

In modern [[epigenetics]], biologists observe that [[phenotype]]s depend on heritable changes to [[gene expression]] that do not involve changes to the [[DNA sequence]]. [[Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance|These changes can cross generations]] in plants, animals, and [[prokaryote]]s. This is not identical to traditional Lamarckism, as the changes do not last indefinitely and do not affect the germ line and hence the evolution of genes.&lt;ref name=Heard&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heard, E.; Martienssen, R.

===Catastrophism===
{{main|Catastrophism}}

Catastrophism is the [[hypothesis]], argued by the French [[anatomist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Georges Cuvier]] in his 1812 ''Recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupèdes'', that the various [[extinction]]s and the patterns of [[faunal succession]] seen in the [[fossil]] record were caused by large-scale natural catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions and, for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia, the inundation of low-lying areas by the [[sea]]. This was explained purely by natural events: he did not mention [[Noah's flood]],{{sfn|McGowan|2001|pp=3–6}} nor did he ever refer to divine creation as the mechanism for repopulation after an extinction event, though he did not support evolutionary theories such as those of his contemporaries Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire either.{{sfn|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–134}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |year=1996 |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/cuvier.html |title=Georges Cuvier (1769–1832) |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier believed that the [[stratigraphic]] record indicated that there had been several such catastrophes, recurring natural events, separated by long periods of stability during the history of life on earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old.{{sfn|Rudwick|1972|p=131}}

Catastrophism has found a place in modern biology with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period, as proposed in a paper by 
[[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] in 1980. It argued that a {{convert|10|km|mi}} [[asteroid]] [[Alvarez hypothesis|struck Earth 66 million years ago]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period.

===Structuralism===

[[File:Darcythompson.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4&lt;!--width for low image--&gt;|In his 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]'', [[D'Arcy Thompson]] illustrated the [[Transformation (geometry)|geometric transformation]] of [[Argyropelecus|one fish's]] body form into [[Sternoptyx|another]] with a 20° [[shear mapping]]. He did not discuss the [[evolution]]ary causes of such a change, raising suspicions of [[vitalism]].{{sfn|Ruse|2013|pp=419}}]]

Biological structuralism objects to an exclusively Darwinian explanation of natural selection, arguing that other mechanisms also guide evolution, and sometimes implying that these supersede selection altogether.{{sfn|Ruse|2013|pp=419}} Structuralists have proposed different mechanisms that might have guided the formation of [[body plan]]s.

It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was popular with early geneticists such as [[Hugo de Vries]], who along with [[Carl Correns]] helped rediscover [[Gregor Mendel]]'s laws of inheritance in 1900, [[William Bateson]], a British zoologist who switched to genetics, and early in his career, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]. These ideas developed into [[mutationism]], the mutation theory of evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=265–270}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=127–129, 157–167}} This held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation, based on de Vries's experiments with the evening primrose, ''[[Oenothera]]'', from 1886. The primroses seemed to be constantly producing new varieties with striking variations in form and color, some of which appeared to be new species because plants of the new generation could only be crossed with one another, not with their parents.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=148–162}} However, [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] showed in 1918 that the new varieties de Vries had observed were the result of [[polyploid]] hybrids rather than rapid genetic mutation.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=202–205}}

Initially, de Vries and Morgan believed that mutations were so large as to create new forms such as subspecies or even species instantly. Morgan's 1910 fruit fly experiments, in which he isolated mutations for characteristics such as white eyes, changed his mind. He saw that mutations represented small [[Mendelian]] characteristics that would only spread through a population when they were beneficial, helped by natural selection. This represented the germ of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], and the beginning of the end for mutationism as an evolutionary force.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=310–311}}

===Genetic drift===
[[File:Different Types of Mutations.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Many [[mutation]]s are [[neutral mutation|neutral]] or silent, having no effect on the [[amino acid]] sequence that is produced when the [[gene]] involved is [[translation (biology)|translated]] to [[protein]], and accumulate over time, forming a [[molecular clock]]. However this does not cause [[phenotype|phenotypic]] evolution.]]
{{main|Neutral theory of molecular evolution}}

The [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]], proposed by [[Motoo Kimura]] in 1968, holds that at the [[DNA sequence|molecular level]] most [[evolution]]ary changes and most of the variation within and between species is not caused by [[natural selection]] but by [[genetic drift]] of [[mutation|mutant]] [[allele]]s that are neutral. A [[neutral mutation]] is one that does not affect an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. The neutral theory allows for the possibility that most mutations are deleterious, but holds that because these are rapidly purged by natural selection, they do not make significant contributions to variation within and between species at the molecular level. Mutations that are not deleterious are assumed to be mostly neutral rather than beneficial.&lt;ref name=Kimura83/&gt;

The theory was controversial as it sounded like a challenge to Darwinian evolution; controversy was intensified by a 1969 paper by [[Jack Lester King]] and [[Thomas H. Jukes]], provocatively but misleadingly titled "[[Non-Darwinian Evolution (paper)|Non-Darwinian Evolution]]". It provided a wide variety of evidence including [[protein sequence]] comparisons, studies of the Treffers mutator gene in ''[[E. coli]]'',  analysis of the genetic code, and comparative [[immunology]], to argue that most protein evolution is due to neutral mutations and genetic drift.&lt;ref name=KingJukes1969&gt;{{cite journal |volume=164 |issue=3881 |pages=788–798 |last=King |first=Jack Lester |author2=Thomas H.

==Combined theories==
[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Multiple explanations have been offered since the 19th century for how evolution took place, given that many scientists initially had objections to natural selection (dashed orange arrows). Many of these theories led (blue arrows) to some form of directed evolution ([[orthogenesis]]), with or without invoking [[theistic evolution|divine control]] (dotted blue arrows) directly or indirectly. For example, evolutionists like [[Edward Drinker Cope]] believed in a combination of theistic evolution, Lamarckism, vitalism, and orthogenesis,{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261–262}} represented by the sequence of arrows on the extreme left of the diagram.]]

The various alternatives to Darwinian evolution by natural selection were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope]] is a case in point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that [[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]], which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in [[embryology]] and [[palaeontology]]. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop at the expense of the rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261–262}} Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|p=264}}

==Rebirth of natural selection, with continuing alternatives==
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

By the start of the 20th century, during the [[eclipse of Darwinism]], biologists were doubtful of natural selection, but equally were quick to discount theories such as orthogenesis, vitalism and Lamarckism which offered no mechanism for evolution. Mutationism did propose a mechanism, but it was not generally accepted.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=128–129}} The [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] a generation later, roughly between 1918 and 1932, broadly swept away all the alternatives to Darwinism, though some including forms of orthogenesis,&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus/&gt;  [[transgenerational epigenetic inheritance|epigenetic mechanisms]] that resemble Lamarckian [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]],&lt;ref name=Heard/&gt; catastrophism,&lt;ref name=Alvarez/&gt; structuralism,&lt;ref name=Goodwin/&gt; and mutationism&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus_on_Nei2014/&gt; have been revived, such as through the discovery of molecular mechanisms.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=222–243, 284–286}}

Biology has become Darwinian, but belief in some form of progress (orthogenesis) remains both in the public mind and among biologists. Ruse argues that evolutionary biologists will probably continue to believe in progress for three reasons. Firstly, the [[anthropic principle]] demands people able to ask about the process that led to their own existence, as if they were the pinnacle of such progress. Secondly, scientists in general and evolutionists in particular believe that their work is leading them progressively closer to [[philosophical realism|a true grasp of reality]], as knowledge increases, and hence (runs the argument) there is progress in nature also. Ruse notes in this regard that [[Richard Dawkins]] explicitly compares cultural progress with [[meme]]s to biological progress with genes. Thirdly, evolutionists are self-selected; they are people, such as the entomologist and sociobiologist [[E. O. Wilson]], who are interested in progress to supply a meaning for life.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=536–539}}

The '''Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology''' ('''IGB''') is an interdisciplinary facility for [[genomics]] research at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. The construction of the IGB, which was completed in 2006, represented a strategy to centralize biotechnology research at the University of Illinois.  A goal of the IGB is to provide a collaborative environment in which researchers with diverse backgrounds are drawn together by their pursuit of scientific questions related to genomics.  The interdisciplinary nature of the institute promotes the creation of innovative solutions to societal challenges related to health, the environment, and food production. Current research at the IGB explores the genomic bases of a wide range of phenomena, including the progression of cancer, the ecological impact of global change, tissue and organ growth, and the diversity of animal behavior.&lt;ref name=igbweb&gt;{{cite web|title=The Institute for Genomic Biology: Where science meets society.|url=http://www.igb.illinois.edu|accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Construction===
Plans for what would become the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB) were formed in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;  Initially, the facility was to be named the Post-Genomic Institute; the name was changed to Institute for Genomic Biology in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tallon|first=Mary|title=U. Illinois trustees approve health benefits for same-sex partners.|newspaper=Daily Illini|date=2003-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Funds of $67.5 million were initially appropriated by the state of Illinois for construction in 2000.&lt;ref name=aps1stfunding&gt;{{cite news|title=Governor expected to unveil $1 billion technology initiative.|newspaper=Associated Press Services|date=2000-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In response to economic hardships, the state halted plans for construction in 2001 as part of a large set of budget cuts,&lt;ref name=stlouis&gt;{{cite news|last=McDermott|first=Kevin|title=Ryan pares $219 million from Illinois budget.|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=2001-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but in 2002, funds were re-appropriated.&lt;ref name=midconst&gt;{{cite news|title=State gives U. of I. $123 million for tech buildings.|newspaper=Midwest Construction|date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Construction began in April 2004 and was completed in November 2006.  The building was dedicated in March 2007.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;  The Institute, initially named the Institute for Genomic Biology, officially changed its name to the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology in 2015 to honor the scientific contributions of [[Carl Woese]].

===Leadership===
The IGB was initially led by [[Harris Lewin]], then a professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois.  Lewin served as the founding director until 2011, when he accepted the position of Research Vice Chancellor at [[University of California, Davis]].  [[Gene E. Robinson]], a professor in the Entomology department, took over as Interim Director, and was named the new Director of IGB in January 2012.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;

==Research==

===Personnel===
The IGB houses over 130 faculty and 600+ graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and research personnel.  IGB faculty are drawn from a broad range of departments, including Crop Sciences, Psychology, Entomology, Physics and Computer Science.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;

===Aims===
The research goals of the IGB fall under one of three Program Areas ([[Systems Biology]], [[Biological engineering|Cellular]] and [[Metabolic engineering|Metabolic Engineering]], and Genome Technology).  Work at the IGB addresses societal challenges related to health, the environment, and food production, both through basic science research and through exploration of ethical and legal issues.  Research is further organized into Themes, each of which occupies a customized lab and office space.  Each Theme contains multiple research groups.  These groups often pursue some research questions independently, but are unified by a common interest in the broader area of the Theme.  The multi-group space encourages communication and collaboration between researchers with diverse backgrounds and technical skills.  One senior faculty member acts as Theme leader, and is responsible for shaping and guiding the overall research initiative.  Themes are reviewed every five years; new Themes may be added or existing Themes modified to reflect the current state of genomics research.  Current Themes are listed below:&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;

==Notable awards and partnerships==

In 2007, the University of Illinois, along with the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]], became partners with the energy company [[BP]] as part of a major research project to develop bioenergy sources.  The University of Illinois facility is based in the IGB.&lt;ref name=bpnews&gt;{{cite news|last=Mercer|first=David|title=Two U.S. universities chosen by BP for partnership in alternative-fuels research.|newspaper=Associated Press Worldstream|date=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Abbott Nutrition and the University of Illinois formed collaboration to establish a research center for the study of the relationship between [[nutrition and cognition]], the [http://cnlm.illinois.edu/ Center for Nutrition, Learning, and Memory] (CNLM).  Several campus units are currently partners of CNLM, including the IGB.&lt;ref name=cnlm&gt;{{cite news|last=des Garennes|first=Christine|title=University of Illinois, Abbott developing nutrition, cognition research center.|newspaper=The News-Gazette|date=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==

The IGB is located on the south side of the University of Illinois main campus at Urbana-Champaign.  The building was constructed by the architecture firm CUH2A (now a part of the architecture-engineering company HDR).  The exterior of the building was designed to include elements of [[Georgian architecture]], consistent with many other campus buildings, but with a modern feel.&lt;ref name=cu2ha&gt;{{cite news|title=Award winning Institute for Genomic Biology designed by CUH2A opens at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.|newspaper=Business Wire|date=2007-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Inside, each Research Theme has a large, [[open plan]] laboratory space and additional work rooms and office and meeting area.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;  The building stands adjacent to the Morrow Plots.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4317">The '''Combs method''' is a method of writing [[fuzzy logic]] rules described by [[William E. Combs]] in 1997. It is designed to prevent [[combinatorial explosion]] in fuzzy logic rules.

The Combs method takes advantage of the [[propositional logic|logical]] equality &lt;math&gt;((p \land q) \Rightarrow r) \iff ((p \Rightarrow r) \lor (q \Rightarrow r))&lt;/math&gt;.

== Combinatorial explosion ==
Suppose we have a fuzzy system that considers N variables at a time, each of which can fit into at least one of S sets. The number of rules necessary to cover all the cases in a traditional fuzzy system is &lt;math&gt;S^N&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the Combs method would need only &lt;math&gt;S \times N&lt;/math&gt; rules. For example, if we have five sets and five variables to consider to produce one output, covering all the cases would require 3125 rules in a traditional system, while the Combs method would require only 25 rules, taming the [[combinatorial explosion]] that occurs when more inputs or more sets are added to the system.

This article will focus on the Combs method itself. To learn more about the way rules are traditionally formed, see [[fuzzy logic]] and [[fuzzy associative matrix]].

== Example ==
Suppose we were designing an [[artificial personality]] system that determined how friendly the personality is supposed to be towards a person in a strategic video game. The personality would consider its own fear, trust, and love in the other person. A set of rules in the Combs system might look like this:
{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="3"
! Fear
| Unafraid THEN Enemies || Moderate Fear THEN Neutral || Afraid THEN Good Friends
|-
! Trust
| Distrusting THEN Enemies || Moderate Trust THEN Neutral || Trusting THEN Good Friends
|-
! Love
| Unloving THEN Enemies || Moderate Love THEN Neutral || Loving THEN Good Friends
|}

The table translates to:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;IF Fear IS Unafraid THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
  IF Fear IS ModerateFear THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
  IF Fear IS Afraid THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 OR
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;IF Trust IS Distrusting THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
  IF Trust IS ModerateTrust THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
  IF Trust IS Trusting THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 OR
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;IF Love IS Unloving THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
  IF Love IS ModerateLove THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
  IF Love IS Loving THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In this case, because the table follows a straightforward pattern in the output, it could be rewritten as:
{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="3"
! Fear
| Unafraid || Moderate Fear || Afraid
|-
! Trust
| Distrusting || Moderate Trust || Trusting
|-
! Love
| Unloving || Moderate Love || Loving
|-
! Friendship
| ''Enemies'' || ''Neutral'' || ''Good Friends''
|}

Each column of the table maps to the output provided in the last row. To obtain the output of the system, we just average the outputs of each rule for that output. For example, to calculate how much the computer is Enemies with the player, we take the average of how much the computer is Unafraid, Distrusting, and Unloving of the player. When all three averages are obtained, the result can then be [[defuzzification|defuzzified]] by any of the traditional means.

'''''Estuaries and Coasts''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] published by [[Springer Science+Business Media]] and the official journal of the [[Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation]]. It was established in 1960 as ''Chesapeake Science'' by Romeo J. Mansueti, covering research results and management studies on natural resources of the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake Bay region]]. In 1977, the journal was acquired by the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation and in 1978 it was renamed ''Estuaries''. It obtained its current name in 2006 (Vol. 29, Issue 1). ''Chesapeake Science'' was published and partially subsidized by the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory during its 18-year history. The [[Editor-in-chief|co-editors-in-chief]] are Charles "Si" Simenstad ([[University of Washington]]) and Paul Montagna [[Texas A&amp;M University–Corpus Christi|(Texas A&amp;M University–Corpus Christi]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/environment/journal/12237?detailsPage=editorialBoard Editorial Board of ''Estuaries and Coasts'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

According to [[Judy Wajcman]], the concept of technology has historically been bound to indigenous women.  The roles of harvesters, or caretakers of the domestic economy taken up by these women lead Wajcman to conclude they would have created tools such as the [[sickle]] and the [[pestle]], making them the first technologists.&lt;ref name= wajcman&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004). {{ISBN|0745630448}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} During the Eighteenth century, industrial engineering began to constitute the modern definition of technology. This transformed the meaning from including useful arts technology – such as [[needlework]], [[metalwork]], [[weaving]], and [[mining]] – to strictly applied science.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|16}}  As a result, "male machines" replaced the "female fabrics" as identifiers of modern technology when engineering was considered as masculine profession.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|16}} Due to political movements of the 1960s and early 70s, science and technology were considered for a profit industrial, governmental, or militaristic based practice, and associated with masculinity resulting in a lack of feminist discourse.&lt;ref name = weber398&gt;{{Cite book | last=Weber|first=Jutta| title = From Science and Technology to Feminist Technoscience | year = 2006 | url = https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ZIF/FG/2006Application/PDF/Weber_essay.pdf |isbn = 9780761943907|pages=398 |journal=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies| publisher=Davis K, Evans M, Lorber J| ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholarship identified the absence of women's presence in technological and scientific spheres, due the use of sex stereotyping in education and sexual discrimination in the workforce, as well as the development of technology as a masculine construct.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|16}}  Examples of masculine-coded technologies under these categories included [[ARPANET]], a precursor to the internet developed by the United States Department of Defence, and the [[Manhattan Project]].

The women's health movements of the 1970s US and UK provided momentum to the emergence of feminist politics around scientific knowledge. During the early states of [[second-wave feminism]], campaigns for improved birth control and abortion rights were at the forefront in challenging the consolidation of male dominated sciences and technologies at the expense of women's health.  The act of regaining knowledge and control over women's bodies was seen as a crucial component to women's liberation.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Science was originally seen as an alien entity opposed to women's interests. Sciences and technologies developed under the misconception that women's needs were universal and inferior to the needs of men, forcing women into rigid, determined sex roles.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|18}} A shift happened in the 1980s – [[Sandra Harding]] proposed "the female question in science" to raise "the question of the science in feminism", claiming that science is involved in projects that are not only neutral and objective, but that are strongly linked to male interests.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|18}} The conceptualization of science and technology was expanded to reflect the all-pervasive ways in which technology is encountered in daily life,&lt;ref name = weber398&gt;{{Cite book | last=Weber|first=Jutta| title = From Science and Technology to Feminist Technoscience | year = 2006 | url = https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ZIF/FG/2006Application/PDF/Weber_essay.pdf |isbn = 9780761943907|pages=398 |journal=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies| publisher=Davis K, Evans M, Lorber J| ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; gaining attention of feminists out of concern for female positions in science and technological professions.  Rather than asking how women can be better treated within and by science, feminist critics instead chose to focus on how a science deeply involved in masculinity and masculine projects could be used for the emancipation of women.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|18}}

Today's feminist critique often uses the former demonology of technology as a point of departure to tell a story of progress from liberal to [[postmodern feminism]]. According to Judy Wajcman, both liberal and Marxist feminists failed in the analysis of science and technology, because they considered the technology as neutral and did not pay attention to the symbolic dimension of technoscience.&lt;ref name="Wajcmanp25"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wajcman|first=Judy|title=Technofeminism|pages=25–26 |year=2004|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|isbn=0-7456-3043-X|edition=Réimpr. 2005.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist technologies and technoscience studies ==

Feminist technoscience studies have become intrinsically linked with practices of [[Technoethics#Technofeminism|Technofeminism]] and the development of feminist technologies in cultural and critical vernacular.  Feminist technoscience studies explore the coded social and historical implications of science and technology on the development of society, including how identity constructs and is constructed by these technologies.  Technofeminism emerged in the early 1980s, leaning on the different feminist movements. Feminist scholars reanalyzed the [[Scientific Revolution]], and stated that the resulting science was based on the masculine ideology of exploiting the Earth and control.  During this time, nature and scientific inquiry were modelled after misogynous relationships to women.  Femininity was associated with nature and considered as something passive to be objectified. This was in contrast to culture, which was represented by objectifying masculinity.  This analysis depended on the use of gender imagery to conceptualize the nature of technoscientific masculine ideology.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|85}}

Judy Wajcman draws parallels between [[Judith Butler]]'s theory of gender performativity and the construction of technology.  Butler conceives gender as a performative act as opposed to a naturalized condition one is born into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory |first=Judith |last=Butler |doi=10.2307/3207893|journal= Theatre Journal 40, no. 4 |pages= 519–31 |date=1988 |volume=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a fluctuating process achieved in daily social interaction, gender identity is acted and constructed through relational behaviours – it is a fluid concept. Drawing from the work of Butler and [[Donna Haraway]], Amade M'charek analyzes how objects, when linked to another object or signifier, construct identity through the use of human imagination:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Differences and similarities may be stable or not, depending on the maintenance work that goes into the relations that help to produce them. They are neither fundaments nor qualities that are always embodied… Differences are relational. They do not always materialize in bodies (in the flesh, genes, hormones, brains, or the skin). Rather they materialize in the very relations that help to enact them.&lt;ref name = Amade&gt;{{cite journal |title= Fragile Differences, Relational Effects: Stories about the Materiality of Race and Sex |first=Amade |last=M'charek |doi=10.1177/1350506810377698|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |page= 313 |volume=17 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this theory, identity is not the byproduct of genes, but the constant upholding of hierarchical difference relations.&lt;ref name = Amade&gt;{{cite journal |title= Fragile Differences, Relational Effects: Stories about the Materiality of Race and Sex |first=Amade |last=M'charek |doi=10.1177/1350506810377698|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |page= 313 |volume=17 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in identity are the effect of interferences, performing and enacting and being enacted upon.  Technology too, as proposed by Wajcman, is a product of mutual alliances, not objectively given but collectively created in a process of reiteration.  To this end, technology exists as both a source and a concurrence of identity relations.

Western technology and science is deeply implicated in the masculine projection and patriarchal domination of women and nature.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|85}}   After the shift of feminist theory to focus more on technoscience, there was a call for new technology to be based on the needs and values of women, rather than masculine dominated technological development.  The differences between female and male needs were asserted by feminist movements, drawing attention to the exclusion of women being served by current technologies.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|22}}  Reproductive technologies in particular were influenced by this movement. During this time, household technologies, new media, and new technosciences were, for the most part, disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Kathy|editor-last=Davis|title=Handbook of gender and women's studies|year=2006|publisher=Sage|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780761943907|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist technologies===

[[Feminist]] technologies are ones that are formed from feminist social relations, but varied definitions and layers of feminism complicate the definition.  Deborah Johnson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Deborah G.|title=Sorting out the question of feminist technology|journal=Feminist technology|year=2010|page=6|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/Sorting%20out%20the%20Question%20of%20Feminist%20Technology.pdf|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes four candidates for feminist technologies: 
* Technologies that are good for women
* Technologies that constitute gender-equitable social relations
* Technologies that favor women
* Technologies that constitute social relations that are more equitable than those that were constituted by a prior technology or than those that prevail in the wider society

The successes of certain technologies, such as the [[pap smear]] for cervical cancer testing, relied on the feminization of technician jobs.  The intervention of women outside the technological sphere, like from members of the women's health movement, and public health activists also aided in the tool's development.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other feminist technologies, such as birth control serve as an example of a feminist technology also shaped in part by dominant masculinity.

[[Combined oral contraceptive pills]] were first approved for use in the United States in 1960, during the time of the women's liberation movement. The birth control pill helped make it possible for more women to enter the workforce by giving them the ability to control her own fertility.  Decades prior to this, activists such as [[Margaret Sanger]] and [[Katharine McCormick]] fought for female contraceptives, seeing it as a necessity for the emancipation of women.&lt;ref&gt;"People &amp; Events: The Pill and the Women's Liberation Movement." PBS. Accessed December 04, 2016. https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/peopleevents/e_lib.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the 1970s feminists raised critique on male control of the medical and [[pharmaceutical industry]].  The male domination of these fields led technologies such as oral contraceptives to be developed around what men considered to be universal, defining characteristics of women (these being their sex and reproductive capabilities).&lt;ref name=Wajcman50&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Birth control pills themselves also succeeded in perpetrating and creating this universality – shaped by moral considerations of the natural body, the length of the menstrual cycle was able to be engineered.&lt;ref name=Wajcman50&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioethics and capitalism ===

The development of reproductive technologies blur the lines between nature and technology, allowing for the reconfiguration of life itself. Through the advances of genetic technologies, the controlling of pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood has become increasingly possible through intrusive means.  These advances in [[biotechnology]] are serving to develop life as a commodity and deepen monetary inequality - a link made by feminist theorists such as Donna Haraway.&lt;ref name = weber399&gt;{{Cite book | last=Weber|first=Jutta| title = From Science and Technology to Feminist Technoscience |  year = 2006 | url = https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ZIF/FG/2006Application/PDF/Weber_essay.pdf |isbn = 9780761943907|pages=399|journal=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies| publisher=Davis K, Evans M, Lorber J| ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetic engineering also brings about questions in eugenics, leading to early radical feminist analysis to declare and attempt to reclaim motherhood as a foundation of female identity.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|79}} The idea of a green, natural motherhood was popularized by [[Ecofeminism#ecofeminism|eco feminists]] who celebrated the identification of women with nature, and natural life.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|79}}

Haraway instead chooses to embrace technology as feminist instead of reverting to this idea of naturalized femininity. By embracing the image of the [[cyborg]],  an amalgamation that is neither human/animal nor machine, Haraway explores the ideas of technoscience and gender, conceptualizing a space where gender is an arbitrary, unnecessary construct.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|80}}

The corporatization of biology through the alteration of nature through technology is also a theme explored by Haraway. The [[oncomouse#oncomouse|OncoMouse]] is a laboratory mouse genetically modified to carry a specific gene which increases the creature's chance of developing cancer.  Until 2005, American conglomerate DuPoint owned the patent to the OncoMouse, reconfiguring and relegating life to a commodity.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|89}} This development in genetic engineering brings up questions about lab animal treatment, as well as ethical questions around class and race. Increasing [[breast cancer]] rates in Black women are discussed in [[eco-feminist]] analysis of the modification of lab animals from breast cancer research to being the discussion into an ethically ambiguous space.  Haraway in particular raises the question of whether modifying and expending a live commodity like OncoMouse is ethical if it leads to the development of a cure for breast cancer.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|91}}

The reconfiguring of life in biotechnologies and genetic engineering allow for a precedence to be set, leading to capitalist cultural consequences.  Through these technologies technoscience becomes naturalized, and also becomes increasingly subject to the process of commodification and capital accumulation in transnational capitalist corporations.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|89}} Like presented in [[Marxist]] and [[Neo-Marxist]] analysis of sciences, biotechnologies allow for the concept of commodity to become fetishized as genes are reified to have a monetary value outside nature.  This also develops life and nature as a thing to be exploited by capitalism.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|90}}

'''Fire ecology''' is a scientific discipline concerned with natural processes involving [[fire]] in an [[ecosystem]] and the [[ecology|ecological]] effects, the interactions between fire and the abiotic and biotic components of an ecosystem, and the role as an ecosystem process. Many ecosystems, particularly [[prairie]], [[savanna]], [[chaparral]] and [[coniferous forest]]s, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to [[habitat]] vitality and renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128027493|title=The Ecological Importance of Mixed-Severity Fires -  ScienceDirect|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many plant species in  fire-affected environments require fire to germinate, establish, or to reproduce.  [[Wildfire suppression]] not only eliminates these species, but also the animals that depend upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutto|first=Richard L.|date=2008-12-01|title=The Ecological Importance of Severe Wildfires: Some Like It Hot|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/08-0895.1/abstract|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1827–1834|doi=10.1890/08-0895.1|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of wildfire suppression in the United States|Campaigns in the United States]] have historically molded public opinion to believe that [[wildfire]]s are always harmful to nature. This view is based on the outdated belief that ecosystems progress toward an equilibrium and that any disturbance, such as fire, disrupts the harmony of nature. More recent ecological research has shown, however, that fire is an integral component in the function and [[biodiversity]] of many natural habitats, and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand, and even to exploit, natural wildfire.  More generally, fire is now regarded as a 'natural disturbance', similar to [[flood]]ing, [[Storm|wind-storms]], and [[landslide]]s, that has driven the evolution of species and controls the characteristics of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11134082|title=The ecology of natural disturbance and patch dynamics|date=1985|publisher=Academic Press|others=Pickett, Steward T., 1950-, White, P. S.|isbn=0125545207|location=Orlando, Fla.|oclc=11134082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fire suppression, in combination with other human-caused environmental changes, may have resulted in unforeseen consequences for natural ecosystems. Some large wildfires in the United States have been blamed on years of fire suppression and the continuing expansion of people into fire-adapted ecosystems, but [[climate change]] is more likely responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westerling|first=A.

==Fire components==

A [[fire regime]] describes the characteristics of fire and how it interacts with a particular ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Whitlock2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitlock|first=Cathy|author2=Higuera, P.E.|author3=McWethy, D.B.|author4=Briles, C.E.|title=Paleoecological Perspectives on Fire Ecology: Revisiting the Fire-Regime Concept|journal=Open Journal of Ecology|year=2010|volume=3|pages=6–23|url=http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toecolj/articles/V003/S10001TOECOLJ/6TOECOLJ.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2013|doi=10.2174/1874213001003020006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130222755/http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toecolj/articles/V003/S10001TOECOLJ/6TOECOLJ.pdf|archivedate=30 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its "severity" is a term that ecologists use to refer to the impact that a fire has on an ecosystem. Ecologists can define this in many ways, but one way is through an estimate of plant mortality. Fire can burn at three levels. Ground fires will burn through soil that is rich in organic matter. Surface fires will burn through dead plant material that is lying on the ground. Crown fires will burn in the tops of shrubs and trees. Ecosystems generally experience a mix of all three.&lt;ref name="BondKeeley2005" /&gt;

Fires will often break out during a dry season, but in some areas wildfires may also commonly occur during a time of year when lightning is prevalent. The frequency over a span of years at which fire will occur at a particular location is a measure of how common wildfires are in a given ecosystem. It is either defined as the average interval between fires at a given site, or the average interval between fires in an equivalent specified area.&lt;ref name="BondKeeley2005"&gt;Bond and Keeley 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined as the energy released per unit length of fireline (kW m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), wildfire intensity can be estimated either as

* the product of 
**the linear spread rate (m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), 
** the low heat of combustion (kJ kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;),
**  and the combusted fuel mass per unit area, 
*or it can be estimated from the flame length.&lt;ref name="Byram1959"&gt;Byram, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abiotic responses==
Fires can affect soils through heating and combustion processes. Depending on the temperatures of the soils caused by the combustion processes, different effects will happen- from evaporation of water at the lower temperature ranges, to the combustion of soil organic matter and formation of pyrogenic organic matter, otherwise known as charcoal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santín|first=Cristina|last2=Doerr|first2=Stefan H.|date=2016-06-05|title=Fire effects on soils: the human dimension|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1696/20150171|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B|language=en|volume=371|issue=1696|pages=20150171|doi=10.1098/rstb.2015.0171|issn=0962-8436|pmid=27216528|pmc=4874409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fires can cause changes in soil nutrients through a variety of mechanisms, which include oxidation, volatilization, erosion, and leaching by water, but the event must usually be of high temperatures in order of significant loss of nutrients to occur. However, quantity of nutrients available in soils are usually increased due to the ash that is generated, and this is made quickly available, as opposed to the slow release of nutrients by decomposition.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pivello|first=Vânia Regina|last2=Oliveras|first2=Imma|last3=Miranda|first3=Heloísa Sinátora|last4=Haridasan|first4=Mundayatan|last5=Sato|first5=Margarete Naomi|last6=Meirelles|first6=Sérgio Tadeu|date=2010-12-01|title=Effect of fires on soil nutrient availability in an open savanna in Central Brazil|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-010-0508-x|journal=Plant and Soil|language=en|volume=337|issue=1–2|pages=111–123|doi=10.1007/s11104-010-0508-x|issn=0032-079X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock spalling (or [[Spall#Exfoliation|thermal exfoliation]]) accelerates weathering of rock and potentilly the release of some nutrients.

Increase in the pH of the soil following a fire is commonly observed, most likely due to the formation of calcium carbonate, and the subsequent decomposition of this calcium carbonate to calcium oxide when temperatures get even higher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It could also be due to the increased cation content in the soil due to the ash, which temporarily increases soil pH. Microbial activity in the soil might also increase due to the heating of soil and increased nutrient content in the soil, though studies have also found complete loss of microbes on the top layer of soil after a fire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mataix-Solera|first=J.|last2=Cerdà|first2=A.|last3=Arcenegui|first3=V.|last4=Jordán|first4=A.|last5=Zavala|first5=L.M.|title=Fire effects on soil aggregation: A review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012825211001322|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|language=en|volume=109|issue=1–2|pages=44–60|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.08.002|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, soils become more [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] (higher pH) following fires because of [[acid]] combustion. By driving novel chemical reactions at high temperatures, fire can even alter the [[Soil#Texture|texture]] and [[Soil#Structure|structure of soils]] by affecting the clay content and the [[Soil#Porosity|soil's porosity]].

Removal of vegetation following a fire can cause several effects on the soil, such as increasing the temperatures of the soil during the day due to increased solar radiation on the soil surface, and greater cooling due to loss of radiative heat at night. Fewer leaves to intercept rain will also cause more rain to reach the soil surface, and with fewer plants to absorb the water, the amount of water content in the soils might increase. However, it might be seen that ash can be water repellent when dry, and therefore water content and availability might not actually increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robichaud|first=Peter R.|last2=Wagenbrenner|first2=Joseph W.|last3=Pierson|first3=Fredrick B.|last4=Spaeth|first4=Kenneth E.|last5=Ashmun|first5=Louise E.|last6=Moffet|first6=Corey A.|title=Infiltration and interrill erosion rates after a wildfire in western Montana, USA|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0341816216300431|journal=CATENA|language=en|volume=142|pages=77–88|doi=10.1016/j.catena.2016.01.027|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biotic responses and adaptations==
{{See also|Fire adaptations}}

===Plants===
[[Image:LodgepolePine 6915.jpg|right|thumb|Lodgepole pine cones]]
Plants have evolved many [[adaptation]]s to cope with fire.  Of these adaptations, one of the best-known is likely ''[[serotiny|pyriscence]]'', where maturation and release of seeds is triggered, in whole or in part, by fire or smoke; this behaviour is often erroneously called ''serotiny'', although this term truly denotes the much broader category of seed release activated by any stimulus.  All pyriscent plants are serotinous, but not all serotinous plants are pyriscent (some are necriscent, hygriscent, xeriscent, soliscent, or some combination thereof).  On the other hand, [[germination]] of seed activated by trigger is not to be confused with pyriscence; it is known as ''physiological dormancy''.

In [[chaparral]] communities in Southern [[California]], for example, some plants have leaves coated in flammable oils that encourage an intense fire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/fire/wildland-fire/learning-center/fire-in-depth/different-ecosystems/chaparral-sw.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; This heat causes their fire-activated seeds to germinate (an example of dormancy) and the young plants can then capitalize on the lack of [[competition (biology)|competition]] in a burnt landscape. Other plants have smoke-activated seeds, or fire-activated buds. The cones of the [[Lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta'') are, conversely, pyriscent: they are sealed with a resin that a fire melts away, releasing the seeds.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;USDA Forest Service&lt;/ref&gt; Many plant species, including the shade-intolerant [[giant sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron giganteum''), require fire to make gaps in the vegetation canopy that will let in light, allowing their seedlings to compete with the more shade-tolerant seedlings of other species, and so establish themselves.&lt;ref name="USNPS"&gt;US National Park Service&lt;/ref&gt; Because their stationary nature precludes any fire avoidance, plant species may only be fire-intolerant, fire-tolerant or fire-resistant.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"&gt;Kramp ''et al.'' 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fire intolerance====
Fire-intolerant plant species tend to be highly flammable and are destroyed completely by fire. Some of these plants and their seeds may simply fade from the community after a fire and not return; others have adapted to ensure that their offspring survives into the next generation. "Obligate seeders" are plants with large, fire-activated seed banks that germinate, grow, and mature rapidly following a fire, in order to reproduce and renew the seed bank before the next fire.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KnoxClarke2005"&gt;Knox and Clarke 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
Seeds may contain the receptor protein KAI2, that is activated by the growth hormones [[karrikin]] released by the fire.&lt;ref name="Salk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salk.edu/news/pressrelease_details.php?press_id=613 | title=Smoke signals: How burning plants tell seeds to rise from the ashes | publisher=Salk Institute for Biological Studies | work=Salik researchers | date=April 29, 2013 | accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Eucalypt trees, Australia, 15 months after a bushfire.jpg|right|thumb|Fire tolerance. Typical regrowth after an Australian bushfire]]

====Fire tolerance====
Fire-tolerant species are able to withstand a degree of burning and continue growing despite damage from fire. These plants are sometimes referred to as "[[resprouter]]s." Ecologists have shown that some species of resprouters store extra energy in their roots to aid recovery and re-growth following a fire.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KnoxClarke2005"/&gt; For example, after an [[Bushfires in Australia|Australian bushfire]], the [[Mountain Grey Gum]] tree (''Eucalyptus cypellocarpa'') starts producing a mass of shoots of leaves from the base of the tree all the way up the trunk towards the top, making it look like a black stick completely covered with young, green leaves.

====Fire resistance====
Fire-resistant plants suffer little damage during a characteristic fire regime. These include large trees whose flammable parts are high above surface fires. Mature [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') is an example of a tree species that suffers virtually no crown damage under a naturally mild fire regime, because it sheds its lower, vulnerable branches as it matures.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pyne2002"&gt;Pyne 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals, birds and microbes===
[[Image:Fire hawks.jpg|right|thumb|A mixed flock of hawks hunting in and around a bushfire]]
Like plants, animals display a range of abilities to cope with fire, but they differ from most plants in that they must avoid the actual fire to survive. Although [[bird]]s are vulnerable when nesting, they are generally able to escape a fire; indeed they often profit from being able to take prey fleeing from a fire and to recolonize burned areas quickly afterwards. Some anthropological and ethno-ornithological evidence suggests that certain species of fire-foraging raptors may engage in intentional fire propagation to flush out prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosford|first1=Robert|title=Ornithogenic Fire: Raptors as Propagators of Fire in the Australian Savanna|journal=2015 Raptor Research Foundation Annual Conference, Nov 4 – 8 , Sacramento, California|date=Nov 2015|url=http://www.raptorresearchfoundation.org/files/2015/11/2015_conference_program.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonta|first1=Mark|title=Intentional fire-spreading by "firehawk" raptors in Northern Australia|journal=Journal of Ethnobotany|date=2017|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2993/0278-0771-37.4.700|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mammal]]s are often capable of fleeing a fire, or seeking cover if they can burrow. [[Amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s may avoid flames by burrowing into the ground or using the burrows of other animals. Amphibians in particular are able to take refuge in water or very wet mud.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt; Some [[arthropod]]s also take shelter during a fire, although the heat and smoke may actually attract some of them, to their peril.&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"&gt;DeBano ''et al.'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microbial]] organisms in the soil vary in their heat tolerance but are more likely to be able to survive a fire the deeper they are in the soil. A low fire intensity, a quick passing of the flames and a dry soil will also help. An increase in available nutrients after the fire has passed may result in larger microbial communities than before the fire.&lt;ref name="Hart2005"&gt;Hart ''et al.'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The generally greater heat tolerance of bacteria relative to fungi makes it possible for soil microbial population diversity to change following a fire, depending on the severity of the fire, the depth of the microbes in the soil, and the presence of plant cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersson|first1=Michael|title=Tropical savannah woodland: effects of experimental fire on soil microorganisms and soil emissions of carbon dioxide|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|date=5 May 2014|volume=36|issue=5|pages=849–858|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2004.01.015|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071704000513|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain species of fungi, such as ''Cylindrocarpon destructans'' appear to be unaffected by combustion contaminants, which can inhibit re-population of burnt soil by other microorganisms, and therefore have a higher chance of surviving fire disturbance and then recolonizing and out-competing other fungal species afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Widden|first1=P|title=The effects of a forest fire on soil microfungi|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|date=March 1975|volume=7|issue=2|pages=125–138|doi=10.1016/0038-0717(75)90010-3.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire and ecological succession==
Fire behavior is different in every ecosystem and the organisms in those ecosystems have adapted accordingly. One sweeping generality is that in all ecosystems, fire creates a mosaic of different [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] patches, with areas ranging from those having just been burned to those that have been untouched by fire for many years. This is a form of [[ecological succession]] in which a freshly burned site will progress through continuous and directional phases of colonization following the destruction caused by the fire.&lt;ref name="Begon1996p692"&gt;Begon ''et al.'' 1996, pg. 692&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecologists usually characterize succession through the changes in vegetation that successively arise. After a fire, the first species to re-colonize will be those with seeds are already present in the soil, or those with seeds are able to travel into the burned area quickly. These are generally fast-growing [[herbaceous]] plants that require light and are intolerant of shading. As time passes, more slowly growing, shade-tolerant woody species will suppress some of the herbaceous plants.&lt;ref name="Begon1996p700"&gt;Begon ''et al.'' 1996, pg 700&lt;/ref&gt; Conifers are often early successional species, while broad leaf trees frequently replace them in the absence of fire. Hence, many conifer forests are themselves dependent upon recurring fire.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007"&gt;Keddy 2007, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting different stages in this process of succession, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape. Soil characteristics will be a factor in determining the specific nature of a fire-adapted ecosystem, as will climate and topography.

==Some examples of fire in different ecosystems==

===Forests===
Mild to moderate fires burn in the [[forest]] [[understory]], removing small trees and herbaceous [[groundcover]]. High-severity fires will burn into the crowns of the trees and kill most of the dominant vegetation. Crown fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain the fire in the forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in the canopy independently of any ground fuel support (an active crown fire). High-severity fire creates [[complex early seral forest]] habitat, or [[snag forest]] with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground soil temperatures rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil.&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"/&gt; Although other characteristics of a forest will influence the impact of fire upon it, factors such as [[climate]] and [[topography]] play an important role in determining fire severity and fire extent.&lt;ref name="BeatyTaylor2001"&gt;Beaty and Taylor (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by the type of vegetation that is growing.

====Forests in British Columbia====
In [[Canada]], forests cover about 10% of the land area and yet harbor 70% of the country’s bird and terrestrial mammal species. Natural fire regimes are important in maintaining a diverse assemblage of [[vertebrate]] species in up to twelve different forest types in [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Bunnell1995"&gt;Bunnell (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Different species have adapted to exploit the different stages of succession, regrowth and habitat change that occurs following an episode of burning, such as downed trees and debris. The characteristics of the initial fire, such as its size and intensity, cause the habitat to evolve differentially afterwards and influence how vertebrate species are able to use the burned areas.&lt;ref name="Bunnell1995" /&gt;

===Shrublands===
[[File:2011-08-04 20 00 00 Susie Fire in the Adobe Range west of Elko Nevada.jpg|thumb|Lightning-sparked wildfires are frequent occurrences on shrublands and grasslands in [[Nevada]].]]
[[Shrub]] fires typically concentrate in the canopy and spread continuously if the shrubs are close enough together. [[Shrubland]]s are typically dry and are prone to accumulations of highly volatile fuels, especially on hillsides. Fires will follow the path of least moisture and the greatest amount of dead fuel material. Surface and below-ground soil temperatures during a burn are generally higher than those of forest fires because the centers of combustion lie closer to the ground, although this can vary greatly.&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"/&gt; Common plants in shrubland or chaparral include [[manzanita]], [[Adenostoma fasciculatum|chamise]] and [[Coyote Brush]].

====California shrublands====
California shrubland, commonly known as [[chaparral]], is a widespread plant community of low growing species, typically on arid sloping areas of the [[California Coast Ranges]] or western foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. There are a number of common shrubs and tree shrub forms in this association, including [[salal]], [[toyon]], [[Rhamnus californica|coffeeberry]] and [[Western poison oak]].&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan (2008) [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 "Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721044257/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 |date=July 21, 2009 }}, GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Strömberg&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration following a fire is usually a major factor in the association of these species.

====South African Fynbos shrublands====
[[Fynbos]] shrublands occur in a small belt across [[South Africa]]. The plant species in this ecosystem are highly diverse, yet the majority of these species are obligate seeders, that is, a fire will cause germination of the seeds and the plants will begin a new life-cycle because of it. These plants may have [[Coevolution|coevolved]] into obligate seeders as a response to fire and nutrient-poor soils.&lt;ref name="Wisheu2000"&gt;Wisheu ''et al.'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Because fire is common in this ecosystem and the soil has limited nutrients, it is most efficient for plants to produce many seeds and then die in the next fire. Investing a lot of energy in roots to survive the next fire when those roots will be able to extract little extra benefit from the nutrient-poor soil would be less efficient. It is possible that the rapid generation time that these obligate seeders display has led to more rapid [[evolution]] and [[speciation]] in this ecosystem, resulting in its highly diverse plant community.&lt;ref name="Wisheu2000" /&gt;

===Grasslands===
[[Grasslands]] burn more readily than forest and shrub ecosystems, with the fire moving through the stems and leaves of herbaceous plants and only lightly heating the underlying soil, even in cases of high intensity. In most grassland ecosystems, fire is the primary mode of [[decomposition]], making it crucial in the [[nutrient cycle|recycling of nutrients]].&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"/&gt; It has been hypthesized that fire only recently became the primary mode of decomposition in many grassland ecosystems after the removal or extinction of large migratory herds of browsing or grazing megafauna driven by predator pressure. In this view, in the absence of functional communities of large migratory herds of herbivorous megafauna and attendant predators, overuse of fire to maintain grassland ecosystems may lead to excessive oxidation, loss of carbon, and desertification in susceptible climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961894493|title=Holistic management : a commonsense revolution to restore our environment|last1=Savory|first1=Allan|last2=Butterfield|first2=Jody|isbn=9781610917438|edition=Third|location=Washington|oclc=961894493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South African savanna====
In the [[savanna]] of [[South Africa]], recently burned areas have new growth that provides palatable and nutritious forage compared to older, tougher grasses. This new forage attracts large [[herbivores]] from areas of unburned and grazed grassland that has been kept short by constant grazing. On these unburned "lawns", only those plant species adapted to heavy grazing are able to persist; but the distraction provided by the newly burned areas allows grazing-intolerant grasses to grow back into the lawns that have been temporarily abandoned, so allowing these species to persist within that ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Archibald2005"&gt;Archibald et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longleaf pine savannas===
[[image:Sarracenia Flava JPG01.jpg|thumb|100px|Yellow pitcher plant is dependent upon recurring fire in coastal plain savannas and flatwoods.]]
Much of the southeastern United States was once open [[longleaf pine]] forest with a rich understory of grasses, sedges, carnivorous plants and orchids. The above maps shows that these ecosystems (coded as pale blue) had the highest fire frequency of any habitat, once per decade or less. Without fire, deciduous forest trees invade, and their shade eliminates both the pines and the understory.  Some of the typical plants associated with fire include [[Sarracenia flava|Yellow Pitcher Plant]] and [[Pogonia ophioglossoides|Rose pogonia]]. The abundance and diversity of such plants is closely related to fire frequency. Rare animals such as [[gopher tortoise]]s and [[indigo snake]]s also depend upon these open grasslands and [[flatwoods]].&lt;ref&gt;Means, D. Bruce. 2006. Vertebrate faunal diversity in longleaf pine savannas.  Pages 155-213 in S. Jose, E. Jokela and D. Miller (eds.) Longleaf Pine Ecosystems: Ecology, Management and Restoration.  Springer, New York. xii + 438 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the restoration of fire is a priority to maintain species composition and biological diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Peet, R. K. and Allard, D. J. (1993).

Hermann, pp. 45–81. Tallahassee, FL: Tall Timbers Research Station.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire in wetlands===
Although it may seem strange, many kinds of wetlands are also influenced by fire. This usually occurs during periods of drought.  In landscapes with peat soils, such as bogs, the peat substrate itself may burn, leaving holes that refill with water as new ponds. Fires that are less intense will remove accumulated litter and allow other wetland plants to regenerate from buried seeds, or from rhizomes.  Wetlands that are influenced by fire include [[coastal marsh]]es, wet prairies, [[peat bog]]s, [[floodplain]]s, prairie marshes and [[flatwoods]].&lt;ref name="Keddy 2010"&gt;Keddy 2010, p. 114-120.&lt;/ref&gt; Since wetlands can store large amounts of carbon in peat, the fire frequency of vast northern peatlands is linked to processes controlling the carbon dioxide levels of the atmosphere, and to the phenomenon of global warming.&lt;ref name="Vitt  2010"&gt;Vitt et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire suppression==
{{Main|Wildfire suppression}}
Fire serves many important functions within fire-adapted ecosystems. Fire plays an important role in nutrient cycling, diversity maintenance and habitat structure. The suppression of fire can lead to unforeseen changes in ecosystems that often adversely affect the plants, animals and humans that depend upon that habitat. Wildfires that deviate from a historical fire regime because of fire suppression are called "uncharacteristic fires".

===Chaparral communities===
In 2003, southern [[California]] witnessed powerful [[chaparral]] wildfires. Hundreds of homes and hundreds of thousands of acres of land went up in flames. Extreme fire weather (low humidity, low fuel moisture and high winds) and the accumulation of dead plant material from 8 years of drought, contributed to a catastrophic outcome. Although some have maintained that fire suppression contributed to an unnatural buildup of fuel loads,&lt;ref name="Minnich1983"&gt;Minnich 1983&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed analysis of historical fire data has showed that this may not have been the case.&lt;ref name="Keeley1999"&gt;Keeley ''et al.'' 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Fire suppression activities had failed to exclude fire from the southern California chaparral. Research showing differences in fire size and frequency between southern California and Baja has been used to imply that the larger fires north of the border are the result of fire suppression, but this opinion has been challenged by numerous investigators and is no longer supported by the majority of fire ecologists.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

One consequence of the fires in 2003 has been the increased density of [[invasive species|invasive]] and [[introduced species|non-native]] plant species that have quickly colonized burned areas, especially those that had already been burned in the previous 15 years. Because shrubs in these communities are adapted to a particular historical fire regime, altered fire regimes may change the [[selective pressure]]s on plants and favor invasive and non-native species that are better able to exploit the novel post-fire conditions.&lt;ref name="Keeley2005"&gt;Keeley ''et al.'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish impacts===
The [[Boise National Forest]] is a US national forest located north and east of the city of [[Boise, Idaho]]. Following several uncharacteristically large wildfires, an immediately negative impact on fish populations was observed, posing particular danger to small and isolated fish populations.&lt;ref name="Burton2005"&gt;Burton (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In the long term, however, fire appears to rejuvenate fish habitats by causing [[hydraulic]] changes that increase flooding and lead to [[silt]] removal and the deposition of a favorable habitat substrate. This leads to larger post-fire populations of the fish that are able to recolonize these improved areas.&lt;ref name="Burton2005" /&gt; But although fire generally appears favorable for fish populations in these ecosystems, the more intense effects of uncharacteristic wildfires, in combination with the fragmentation of populations by human barriers to dispersal such as weirs and dams, ''will'' pose a threat to fish populations.

==Fire as a management tool==
[[Restoration ecology]] is the name given to an attempt to reverse or mitigate some of the changes that humans have caused to an ecosystem. [[Controlled burn]]ing is one tool that is currently receiving considerable attention as a means of restoration and management. Applying fire to an ecosystem may create habitats for species that have been negatively impacted by fire suppression, or fire may be used as a way of controlling invasive species without resorting to herbicides or pesticides. However, there is debate as to what state managers should aim to restore their ecosystems to, especially as to whether "natural" means pre-human or pre-European. [[Native American use of fire]], not natural fires, historically maintained the diversity of the [[Pre-Columbian savannas of North America|savannas of North America]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/heritage/docum/Fire/Bibliography%20-%20Indian%20Use%20of%20Fire.pdf|title=REFERENCES ON THE AMERICAN INDIAN USE OF FIRE IN ECOSYSTEMS|last=Williams|first=Gerald W.|date=2003-06-12|accessdate=2008-07-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706160607/http://www.blm.gov/heritage/docum/Fire/Bibliography%20-%20Indian%20Use%20of%20Fire.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When, how, and where managers should use fire as a management tool is a subject of debate.

===The Great Plains shortgrass prairie===
{{details|Shortgrass prairie}}
A combination of heavy livestock grazing and fire-suppression has drastically altered the structure, composition, and diversity of the shortgrass prairie ecosystem on the [[Great Plains]], allowing woody species to dominate many areas and promoting fire-intolerant invasive species. In semi-arid ecosystems where the decomposition of woody material is slow, fire is crucial for returning nutrients to the soil and allowing the grasslands to maintain their high productivity.

Although fire can occur during the growing or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most effective at increasing the grass and [[forb]] cover, [[biodiversity]] and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies.&lt;ref name="Brockwayet"&gt;Brockway et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire if they want to restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive [[spotted knapweed]] (''Centaurea maculosa'') on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, because this is the time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.&lt;ref&gt;Emery and Gross (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed conifer forests in the US Sierra Nevada===
Mixed [[conifer]] forests in the United States [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] used to have fire return intervals that ranged from 5 years up to 300 years, depending on the local climate. Lower elevations had more frequent fire return intervals, whilst higher and wetter elevations saw much longer intervals between fires. Native Americans tended to set fires during fall and winter, and land at a higher elevation was generally occupied by Native Americans only during the summer.&lt;ref name="Anderson1996"&gt;{{Cite book|last=ANDERSON|first=M.

=== Finnish boreal forests ===
The decline of habitat area and quality has caused many species populations to be red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to a study on forest management of Finnish boreal forests, improving the habitat quality of areas outside reserves can help in conservation efforts of endangered deadwood-dependent beetles. These beetles and various types of fungi both need dead trees in order to survive. Old growth forests can provide this particular habitat. However, most Fennoscandian boreal forested areas are used for timber and therefore are unprotected. The use of controlled burning and tree retention of a forested area with deadwood was studied and its effect on the endangered beetles. The study found that after the first year of management the number of species increased in abundance and richness compared to pre-fire treatment. The abundance of beetles continued to increase the following year in sites where tree retention was high and deadwood was abundant. The correlation between forest fire management and increased beetle populations shows a key to conserving these red-listed species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyvarinen|first1=Esko|last2=Kouki|first2=Jari|last3=Martikainen|first3=Petri|title=Fire and Green-Tree Retention in Conservation of Red-Listed and Rare Deadwood-Dependent Beetles in Finnish Boreal Forests|journal=Conservation Biology|date=1 February 2006|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1711–1719|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00511.x|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=aee65b99-0f41-4054-a741-ff200aca6310%40sessionmgr105&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=110|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian eucalypt forests===
Much of the old growth eucalypt forest in Australia is designated for conservation. Management of these forests is important because species like ''Eucalyptus grandis'' rely on fire to survive. There are a few eucalypt species that do not have a [[lignotuber]], a root swelling structure that contains buds where new shoots can then sprout. During a fire a lignotuber is helpful in the reestablishment of the plant. Because some eucalypts do not have this particular mechanism, forest fire management can be helpful by creating rich soil, killing competitors, and allowing seeds to be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tng|first1=David Y. P.|last2=Goosem|first2=Steve|last3=Jordan|first3=Greg J.|last4=Bowman|first4=David M.J.S.|title=Letting giants be - rethinking active fire management of old-growth eucalypt forest in the Australian tropics|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|date=2014|volume=51|pages=555–559|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12233|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2f35e2f6-ed9f-4aa9-9846-8e72e1870104%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=110|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management policies==

===United States===
Fire [[policy]] in the United States involves the federal government, individual state governments, tribal governments, interest groups, and the general public. The new federal outlook on fire policy parallels advances in ecology and is moving towards the view that many ecosystems depend on disturbance for their diversity and for the proper maintenance of their natural processes. Although human safety is still the number one priority in fire management, new US government objectives include a long-term view of ecosystems. The newest policy allows managers to gauge the relative values of private property and resources in particular situations and to set their priorities accordingly.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"/&gt;

One of the primary goals in fire management is to improve public education in order to suppress the "[[Smokey Bear]]" fire-suppression mentality and introduce the public to the benefits of regular natural fires.

]]
As a form of biological asymmetry, '''fluctuating asymmetry''' ('''FA'''), along with anti-symmetry and direction asymmetry, refers to small, random deviations away from perfect [[Symmetry in biology|bilateral symmetry]].&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valen1962"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valen|first=Leigh Van|title=A Study of Fluctuating Asymmetry|journal=Evolution|date=June 1962|volume=16|issue=2|pages=125–142|jstor=2406192|doi=10.2307/2406192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fluctuating Asymmetry|last=Tomkins|first=J. L.|last2=Kotiaho|first2=J. S.|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Ltd.|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deviation from perfection is thought to reflect the genetic and environmental pressures experienced throughout development, with greater pressures resulting in higher levels of asymmetry.&lt;ref name="Valen1962" /&gt; Examples of FA in the human body include unequal sizes (asymmetry) of bilateral features in the face and body, such as left and right eyes, ears, wrists, [[breast]]s, [[testicle]]s, and thighs.

Research has exposed multiple factors that are associated with FA. As measuring FA can indicate developmental stability, it can also suggest the genetic fitness of an individual. This can further have an effect on mate attraction and sexual selection, as less asymmetry reflects greater developmental stability and subsequent fitness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Human [[Health|physical health]] is also associated with FA. For example, young men with greater FA report more medical conditions than those with lower levels of FA.&lt;ref name="Fluctuating asymmetry and physical health among young adults" /&gt; Multiple other factors can be linked to FA, such as intelligence&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and personality traits.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Measurement ==
Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) can be measured by the equation: Mean FA = mean absolute value of left sides - mean absolute value of right sides.

The closer the mean value is to zero, the lower the levels of FA, indicating more symmetrical features. By taking many measurements of multiple traits per individual, this increases the accuracy in determining that individual's developmental stability. However, these traits must be chosen carefully, as different traits are affected by different selection pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patrice|first=D.|last2=Hingle|first2=A.|last3=Fowler|first3=K.|last4=Pomiankowski|first4=A.|date=1999|title=Measurement bias and fluctuating asymmetry estimates.|url=|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=57|issue=1|pages=251–253|doi=10.1006/anbe.1998.0977|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This equation can further be used to study the distribution of asymmetries at population levels, to distinguish between traits that show FA, directional asymmetry, and anti-symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swaddle|first=J. P.|date=2003|title=Fluctuating asymmetry, animal behaviour, and evolution.|url=|journal=Advances in the study of behaviour.|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=R.|last2=Strobeck|first2=C.|date=1992|title=Fluctuating asymmetry as a measure of developmental stability: Implications of non-normal distributions and power of statistical tests.|url=|journal=Acta Zoologica Fennica|pages=57–72|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of FA around a mean point of zero suggests that FA is not an adaptive trait, where symmetry is ideal. Directional asymmetry of traits can be distinguished by showing significantly biased measurements towards traits being larger on either the left or right sides, for example, human [[testicle]]s (where the right is more commonly larger), or handedness (85% are right handed, 15% are left handed). Anti-symmetry can be distinguished by the bimodal distributions, due to some adaptive functions.

== Causes ==
Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is often considered to be the product of [[Developmental biology|developmental]] stress and instability, caused by both genetic and environmental stressors. The notion that FA is a result of genetic and environmental factors is supported by [[C. H. Waddington|Waddington's]] notion of [[Canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]], which implies that FA is a measure of the [[genome|genome's]] ability to successfully buffer development to achieve a normal [[phenotype]] under imperfect environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WADDINGTON|first=C. H.|title=Canalization of Development and the Inheritance of Acquired Characters|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/150563a0|journal=Nature|volume=150|issue=3811|pages=563–565|doi=10.1038/150563a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various factors causing developmental instability and FA include [[infection]]s, [[mutation]]s, and [[toxin]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolutionary biology of human female sexuality|last=Thornhill, Gangestad|first=Randy, Steven W.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0195340981|location=Oxford, England|pages=162–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic factors ===
Research on [[twin]]s suggests that there are genetic influences on FA,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Wendy|last2=Segal|first2=Nancy L.|last3=Bouchard Jr.|first3=Thomas J.|date=2008-05-01|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and general intelligence: No genetic or phenotypic association|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289607000967|journal=Intelligence|volume=36|issue=3|pages=279–288|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased levels of mutations and perturbations is also linked to greater asymmetry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

FA may also result from a lack of genetic immunity to diseases, as those with higher FA show less effective immune responses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is further supported by evidence showing an association between FA and the number of respiratory infections experienced by an individual, such that those with higher levels of FA experience more infections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Increased prevalence of parasites and diseases in an organism is also seen more in individuals with greater levels of FA.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fink|first=Bernhard|last2=Neave|first2=Nick|last3=Manning|first3=John T.|last4=Grammer|first4=Karl|date=2006-08-01|title=Facial symmetry and judgements of attractiveness, health and personality|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886906000973|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=41|issue=3|pages=491–499|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.01.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the research in this field is predominantly correlational, so caution must be taken when inferring causation. For example, rather than a lack of immunity causing FA, FA may weaken the immune responses of an organism, or there may be another factor involved.

There is some speculation that [[inbreeding]] contributes towards FA. One study on young Turkish males demonstrated that, although inbred individuals show more asymmetry in observed bilateral traits, the differences were not significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Özener|first=Bariş|date=2010-07-01|title=Effect of inbreeding depression on growth and fluctuating asymmetry in Turkish young males|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.21046/abstract|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=557–562|doi=10.1002/ajhb.21046|issn=1520-6300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, ant colonies created by an inbreeding queen do not show significantly higher FA than those produced by a non-inbreeding queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keller|first=Laurent|last2=Passera|first2=Luc|date=1993-09-01|title=Incest avoidance, fluctuating asymmetry, and the consequences of inbreeding in Iridomyrmex humilis, an ant with multiple queen colonies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00216600|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=191–199|doi=10.1007/BF00216600|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental factors ===
Multiple sources provide information on environmental factors that are correlated with FA. A meta-analysis of related studies suggests that FA is an appropriate marker of environmental stress during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beasley|first=De Anna E.|last2=Bonisoli-Alquati|first2=Andrea|last3=Mousseau|first3=Timothy A.|date=2013-07-01|title=The use of fluctuating asymmetry as a measure of environmentally induced developmental instability: A meta-analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X13000988|journal=Ecological Indicators|volume=30|pages=218–226|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence suggests that [[poverty]] and [[Malnutrition|lack of food]] during development may contribute to greater levels of FA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ozener|first=Bariş|date=2011-12-01|title=Does urban poverty increase body fluctuating asymmetry?|journal=Collegium Antropologicum|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1001–1005|issn=0350-6134|pmid=22397230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallard|first=Samantha T.|last2=Barnard|first2=C. J.|date=2004-02-01|title=Food stress, fluctuating asymmetry and reproductive performance in the gryllid crickets Gryllus bimaculatus and Gryllodes sigillatus|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156853904322890825|journal=Behaviour|volume=141|issue=2|pages=219–232|doi=10.1163/156853904322890825|issn=1568-539X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infection|Infectious diseases]] can also lead to FA, as studies have repeatedly shown that those with higher FA report more infections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møller|first=Anders Pape|date=2006-03-01|title=A review of developmental instability, parasitism and disease: Infection, genetics and evolution|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156713480500064X|journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution|volume=6|issue=2|pages=133–140|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2005.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, this association between levels of FA and infections may be due to a lack of immunity to diseases, as mentioned earlier (see 'Genetic factors'). Fluctuating asymmetry in human males is also seen to positively correlate with levels of [[oxidative stress]]. This process occurs when an organism creates excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to ROS-neutralising antioxidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gangestad|first=Steven W.|last2=Merriman|first2=Leslie A.|last3=Emery Thompson|first3=Melissa|date=2010-12-01|title=Men’s oxidative stress, fluctuating asymmetry and physical attractiveness|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347210003416|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=80|issue=6|pages=1005–1013|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidative stress may mediate the association seen between high FA and infection amounts during development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Toxins and poisons are considered to increase FA. [[Morning sickness|Pregnancy sickness]] is argued to be an [[adaptation]] for avoiding toxins during [[Prenatal development|foetal development]]. Research has reported that when a mother has no sickness or a sickness that extends beyond week 12 of gestation, the offspring shows higher FA (as demonstrated by measuring thigh circumferences). This suggests that when a mother fails to expel environmental toxins, this creates stress and developmental instability for the foetus, later leading to increased asymmetry in that individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Devendra|last2=Rosen|first2=Valerie C.|title=Effects of maternal body morphology, morning sickness, gestational diabetes and hypertension on fluctuating asymmetry in young women|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513801000824|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=22|issue=6|pages=373–384|doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(01)00082-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater exposure to [[pollution]] may also be a fundamental cause of FA. Research on skull characteristics of [[Grey seal|Baltic grey seals]] (''Halichoerus grypus'') demonstrated that those born after 1960 (marking an increase in environmental pollution) had increased levels of asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zakharov|first=Vladmir M.|last2=Yablokov|first2=Alexay V.|date=1990-01-01|title=Skull Asymmetry in the Baltic Grey Seal: Effects of Environmental Pollution|journal=Ambio|volume=19|issue=5|pages=266–269|jstor=4313708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Greater white-toothed shrew|shrews]] (''Crocidura russula)'' from more polluted areas show higher levels of asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sánchez-Chardi|first=Alejandro|last2=García-Pando|first2=Marián|last3=López-Fuster|first3=María José|date=2013-10-01|title=Chronic exposure to environmental stressors induces fluctuating asymmetry in shrews inhabiting protected Mediterranean sites|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513008023|journal=Chemosphere|volume=93|issue=6|pages=916–923|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.05.056|pmid=23800592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radioactive contamination may also increase FA levels, as [[Yellow-necked mouse|mice]] (''Apodemus flavicollis'') living closer to the failed [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl reactor]] show greater asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oleksyk|first=Taras K|last2=Novak|first2=James M|last3=Purdue|first3=James R|last4=Gashchak|first4=Sergiy P|last5=Smith|first5=Michael H|date=2004-01-01|title=High levels of fluctuating asymmetry in populations of Apodemus flavicollis from the most contaminated areas in Chornobyl|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X03002224|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity|volume=73|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2003.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developmental stability ==
Developmental stability is achieved when an organism is able to withstand genetic and environmental stress, to display the bilaterally symmetrical traits determined by its developmentally programmed phenotype.&lt;ref name="Valen1962" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markow|first=Therese Ann|date=1995-01-01|title=Evolutionary Ecology and Developmental Instability|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.en.40.010195.000541|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=40|issue=1|pages=105–120|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.40.010195.000541|pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; To measure an individual's developmental stability, the FA measurements of 10 traits are added together, including ear width, elbows, ankles, wrists, feet, length of ears and fingers. This is achieved by: (L - R)trait 1 + (L - R)trait 2 + ......(L - R)trait 10. This provides a good overall measure of body FA, as every individual has some features that are not perfectly symmetrical.

Common environmental pressures leading to lower developmental stability include exposure to toxins, poison and infectious diseases, low food quality and malnutrition. Genetic pressures include spontaneous new mutations, and "bad genes" (genes that once had adaptive functions, but are being removed through evolutionary selection). A large fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and a low developmental stability suggests that an organism is unable to develop according to the ideal state of bilateral symmetry. The energy required for bilateral symmetry development is extremely high, making perfect bilateral symmetry rare. Energy is invested into survival in spite of the genetic and environmental pressures, before making bilaterally symmetrical traits. Research has also revealed links between FA and depression, genetic or environmental stress and measures of mate quality for sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = J.

==Health==

===Susceptibility to diseases===

Research has linked higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) to poorer outcomes in some domains of physical health in humans. For example, one study found that individuals with higher levels of FA report a higher number of medical conditions than those with lower levels of FA. However, they did not experience worse outcomes in areas such as systolic blood pressure or cholesterol levels.&lt;ref name="Fluctuating asymmetry and physical health among young adults"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milne|first1=Barry J|last2=Belsky|first2=Jay|last3=Poulton|first3=Richie|last4=Thomson|first4=W.

===Health in non-human populations===

The relationship between FA, health and susceptibility to disease has also been studied in non-human animals. For example, studies have found that higher levels of facial asymmetry are associated with poorer overall health in female rhesus macaques (''Macaca mulatta''),&lt;ref name="FA and health in female macaques"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Anthony C.|last2=Paukner|first2=Annika|last3=Woodward|first3=Ruth A.|last4=Suomi|first4=Stephen J.|title=Facial asymmetry is negatively related to condition in female macaque monkeys|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=21 July 2012|volume=66|issue=9|pages=1311–1318|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1386-4|url=http://media.proquest.com/media/pq/classic/doc/2748861961/fmt/pi/rep/NONE?hl=&amp;cit%3Aauth=Little%2C+Anthony+C%3BPaukner%2C+Annika%3BWoodward%2C+Ruth+A%3BSuomi%2C+Stephen+J&amp;cit%3Atitle=Facial+asymmetry+is+negatively+related+to+condition+in+female+macaque+monkeys&amp;cit%3Apub=Behavioral+Ecology+and+Sociobiology&amp;cit%3Avol=66&amp;cit%3Aiss=9&amp;cit%3Apg=1311&amp;cit%3Adate=Sep+2012&amp;ic=true&amp;cit%3Aprod=PsycINFO&amp;_a=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%3D%3D&amp;_s=MAMCvAoYUz1EfxAJfVCgE6akFXY%3D|accessdate=30 March 2016|pmc=3649767}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that higher FA is also linked to more health issues in chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'').&lt;ref name="FA and health in chimpanzees"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sefcek|first1=Jon A.|last2=King|first2=James E.|title=Chimpanzee facial symmetry: A biometric measure of chimpanzee health.|journal=American Journal of Primatology|date=2007|volume=69|issue=11|pages=1257–1263|doi=10.1002/ajp.20426|pmid=17387675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between FA and health has also been investigated in non-primates. In three gazelle species (''Gazella cuvieri; Gazella dama; Gazella dorcas''), for instance, FA has been linked to a range of blood parameters associated with health in mammals, although the specific relevance of these blood parameters for these gazelle species was not examined.&lt;ref name="FA and blood parameters in gazelles"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuervo|first1=José Javier|last2=Dhaoui|first2=Mohamed|last3=Espeso|first3=Gerardo|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and blood parameters in three endangered gazelle species|journal=Mammalian Biology|date=July 2011|volume=76|issue=4|pages=498–505|doi=10.1016/j.mambio.2011.01.007|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1616504711000085/1-s2.0-S1616504711000085-main.pdf?_tid=fd3356e4-f67e-11e5-a5a0-00000aab0f26&amp;acdnat=1459346278_36c5ab2b6d055a31818b2842befb9983|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that, among Iberian red deer (''Cervus elaphus hispanicus''), higher FA was slightly negatively related to both antler size and overall body mass (traits thought to indicate overall condition). Antlers more involved in fighting were found to be more symmetrical than those not involved, and antler asymmetry at reproductive age was lower than in development or at post-reproductive age.&lt;ref name="FA and antler size/body mass"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mateos|first1=Concha|last2=Alarcos|first2=Susana|last3=Carranza|first3=Juan|last4=Sánchez-Prieto|first4=Cristina B.|last5=Valencia|first5=Juliana|title=Fluctuating asymmetry of red deer antlers negatively relates to individual condition and proximity to prime age|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=May 2008|volume=75|issue=5|pages=1629–1640|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.10.016}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

FA and health outcomes have been examined within insect populations. For instance, it has been found that Mediterranean field crickets (''Gryllus bimaculatus'') with higher levels of FA in three hind-limb traits have lower encapsulation rates, but do not differ from low-FA crickets in lytic activity (both are measures of immunocompetence).&lt;ref name="FA and immune function in field crickets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rantala|first1=Markus J.|last2=Ahtiainen|first2=Jari J.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and immune function in a field cricket.|journal=Oikos|date=December 2004|volume=107|issue=3|pages=479–484|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12776.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While research on the relationship between FA and longevity is sparse in humans, some studies using non-human populations have suggested an association between the symmetry of an organism and its lifespan.

===Sexual selection in non-human animals===
Many non-human animals have been shown to be able to distinguish between potential partners, based upon levels of FA. As with humans, lower levels of FA are seen in the most reproductively successful members of species. For instance, FA of male forewing length seem to have an important role in successful mating for many insect species, such as dark-wing damselflies and Japanese [[Mecoptera|scorpionflies]].  In the dark-winged [[damselfly]] (''Calopteryx maculate''), successfully mating male flies showed significantly lower levels of FA in their forewings than unsuccessful males,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=Michelle L.|last2=Pruett-Jones|first2=Stephen|title=Fluctuating asymmetry, sexual selection, and survivorship in male dark-winged damselflies.|journal=Ethology|date=2002|volume=108|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1046/j.1439-0310.2002.00814.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; while for Japanese scorpionflies, FA levels are a good predictor for the outcome of fights between males in that more symmetrical males won significantly more fights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thornhill|first1=R.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and the mating system of the japanese scorpionfly, panorpa japonica.|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1992|volume=44|issue=5|pages=867–879|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80583-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other animals also show similar patterns, for example, many species of butterfly, males with lower levels of FA tended to live longer and flew more actively, allowing them to have more reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsubaki|first1=Y.|last2=Matsumoto|first2=K.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and male mating success in a sphragis-bearing butterfly luehdorfia japonica (lepidoptera: Papilionidae).|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|date=1998|volume=11|issue=4|pages=571–582|doi=10.1023/a:1022371531263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, female swallows have been shown to prefer longer, and more symmetrical tails as a cue for mate choice. Therefore, the males with longer and more symmetrical tails show higher levels of reproductive success with more attractive females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Møller|first1=A. P.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry in male sexual ornaments may reliable reveal male quality.|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1990|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1185–1187|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80187-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In red deer, sexual selection has effected antler development, in that larger and more symmetrical antlers are favoured in males at prime mating age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mateos|first1=C.|last2=Alarcos|first2=S.|last3=Carranza|first3=J.|last4=Sánchez-Prieto|first4=C.

However, some evidence for the effects of sexual selection of FA levels have been inconsistent, suggesting that the relationship between FA and sexual selection may be more complex than originally thought. For instance, in the lekking black grouse and red junglefowl, no correlations were found between FA and mating success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rintamäki|first1=P. T.|last2=Alatalo|first2=R.

==Other associated factors ==

=== Intelligence ===
Through research, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been found to have a negative [[correlation]] to [[psychometrics|measurements of human traits]] such as [[working memory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yeo|first=RA|author2=Hill, D |author3=Campbell, R |author4=Vigil, J |author5=Brooks, WM |title=Developmental instability and working memory ability in children: a magnetic resonance spectroscopy investigation.|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|year=2000|volume=17|issue=2|pages=143–59|doi=10.1207/S15326942DN1702_01|pmid=10955200|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a784400620}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intelligence]], such that individuals showing greater asymmetry have lower IQ scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furlow|first=FB|author2=Armijo-Prewitt, T |author3=Gangestad, SW |author4=Thornhill, R |title=Fluctuating asymmetry and psychometric intelligence.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|date=1997-06-22|volume=264|issue=1383|pages=823–9|doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0115|pmid=9265189|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/264/1383/823.short |pmc=1688437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=T|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and intelligence|journal=Intelligence|date=1 January 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=41–46|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.03.013|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289606000353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prokosch|first=M|author2=Yeo, R |author3=Miller, G |title=Intelligence tests with higher -loadings show higher correlations with body symmetry: Evidence for a general fitness factor mediated by developmental stability|journal=Intelligence|date=1 April 2005|volume=33|issue=2|pages=203–213|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2004.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As FA links with both intelligence and facial attractiveness, it is possible that our perceptions of attractiveness have evolved based upon developmental quality, which includes traits such as intelligence and health.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; However, some literature shows no such correlations between FA and intelligence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A meta-analysis of the research covering this topic demonstrated that whilst published studies largely report negative correlations, unpublished studies often find no association between FA and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banks|first=George C.|last2=Batchelor|first2=John H.|last3=McDaniel|first3=Michael A.|date=2010-07-01|title=Smarter people are (a bit) more symmetrical: A meta-analysis of the relationship between intelligence and fluctuating asymmetry|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289610000310|journal=Intelligence|volume=38|issue=4|pages=393–401|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2010.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality ===
Research into FA suggests that there may be some correlation to specific personality factors, in particular, the [[Big Five personality traits]]. From a general view, one would expect someone who is more symmetrical (usually meaning greater attractiveness), to be high on agreeableness, [[conscientiousness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]] and openness, and low on [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Tartaglia|first = Stefano|last2 = Rollero|first2 = Chiara|date = 2015-11-27|title = The Effects of Attractiveness and Status on Personality Evaluation|url = http://ejop.psychopen.eu/article/view/896|journal = Europe’s Journal of Psychology|volume = 11|issue = 4|pages = 677–690|doi = 10.5964/ejop.v11i4.896|issn = 1841-0413}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most consistent findings reported is that low FA is positively associated with measures of extraversion, suggesting that more symmetrical people tend to be more extraverted than less symmetrical individuals, particularly when specifying to symmetry within the face.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Fink|first = Bernhard|last2 = Neave|first2 = Nick|last3 = Manning|first3 = John T.|last4 = Grammer|first4 = Karl|date = 2005-08-01|title = Facial symmetry and the ‘big-five’ personality factors|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886905000541|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 39|issue = 3|pages = 523–529|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Pound|first = Nicholas|last2 = Penton-Voak|first2 = Ian S.|last3 = Brown|first3 = William M.|date = 2007-10-01|title = Facial symmetry is positively associated with self-reported extraversion|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690700164X|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 43|issue = 6|pages = 1572–1582|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2007.04.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Fink|first = Bernhard|last2 = Neave|first2 = Nick|last3 = Manning|first3 = John T.|last4 = Grammer|first4 = Karl|date = 2006-08-01|title = Facial symmetry and judgements of attractiveness, health and personality|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886906000973|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 41|issue = 3|pages = 491–499|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.01.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation has also been reported between FA and human [[Dominance hierarchy|social dominance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furlow|first=B |author2=Gangestad, SW |author3=Armijo-Prewitt, T|title=Developmental stability and human violence.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |date=1998-01-07|volume=265|issue=1390|pages=1–6|doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0255|pmid=9470212|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/265/1390/1.short|pmc=1688754}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research is proving less consistent with other personality factors, with some finding some weak correlations between low FA and conscientiousness and openness to experience, and others finding no significant differences between those with high or low FA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hope|first = David|last2 = Bates|first2 = Timothy|last3 = Penke|first3 = Lars|last4 = Gow|first4 = Alan J.|last5 = Starr|first5 = John M.|last6 = Deary|first6 = Ian J.|date = 2011-01-01|title = Fluctuating Asymmetry and personality|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886910004228|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 50|issue = 1|pages = 49–52|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.08.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antisocial behaviours ===
Some studies suggest a link between FA and [[aggression]], but the evidence is mixed. In humans, criminal offenders show greater FA than nonoffenders.&lt;ref name="FA and psychopathy" /&gt; However, other studies report that human males with higher FA show less physical aggression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manning|first=J.

For example, one study found that females with higher FA demonstrated higher levels of reactive aggression in response to high levels of provocation, whereas high FA males showed more reactive aggression under low levels of provocation.&lt;ref name="FA and reactive aggression"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benderlioglu|first1=Zeynep|last2=Sciulli|first2=Paul W.|last3=Nelson|first3=Randy J.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry predicts human reactive aggression|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|date=2004|volume=16|issue=4|pages=458–469|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20047}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Research is also mixed in other animals. In Japanese [[Panorpa|scorpionflies]] (''Panorpa nipponensis'' and ''Panorpa ochraceopennis''), FA differences between members of the same sex competing for food determines the outcome of [[Interspecific competition|interspecific contests]] and aggression better than body size or ownership of food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thornhill|first=Randy|date=1992-05-01|title=Fluctuating asymmetry, interspecific aggression and male mating tactics in two species of Japanese scorpionflies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00170603|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=357–363|doi=10.1007/BF00170603|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, cannibalistic laying [[Chicken|hens]] (''Gallus gallus domesticus'') demonstrate more asymmetry than normal hens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yngvesson|first=Jenny|last2=Keeling|first2=Linda J.|date=2001-03-01|title=Body size and fluctuating asymmetry in relation to cannibalistic behaviour in laying hens|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347200916166|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=61|issue=3|pages=609–615|doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1616}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this link between FA and aggression in hens is questionable, as victimised hens also showed greater asymmetry. Furthermore, when [[Prenatal development|prenatally]] injecting hen eggs with excess [[serotonin]] (5-HT), the hens later exhibited more FA at 18 weeks of age, but displayed less aggressive behaviours. It is suggested that the stress introduced during early embryonic stages via certain factors (such as excess serotonin) may create developmental instability, causing phenotypic and behavioural variations (such as increased or decreased aggression).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennis|first=Rachel L.|last2=Fahey|first2=Alan G.|last3=Cheng|first3=Heng W.|date=2013-03-01|title=Alterations to Embryonic Serotonin Change Aggression and Fearfulness|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.21459/abstract|journal=Aggressive Behavior|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=91–98|doi=10.1002/ab.21459|issn=1098-2337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ageing===

In old age, facial symmetry has been associated with better [[Aging brain|cognitive aging]], as lower levels of FA have been associated with higher intelligence and more efficient information processing in older men.&lt;ref name="FA and cognitive aging"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penke|first1=Lars|last2=Bates|first2=Timothy C|last3=Gow|first3=Alan J|last4=Pattie|first4=Alison|last5=Starr|first5=John M|last6=Jones|first6=Benedict C|last7=Perrett|first7=David I|last8=Deary|first8=Ian J|title=Symmetric faces are a sign of successful cognitive aging|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=November 2009|volume=30|issue=6|pages=429–437|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.06.001|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1090513809000543/1-s2.0-S1090513809000543-main.pdf?_tid=e47f5726-d723-11e5-b37a-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1455898666_db9300ce5bbce8595f8dd1bde41f0277|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, it has been found that risk of mortality cannot be predicted accurately from levels of FA in photographs of older adults.&lt;ref name="Predicting mortality from human faces"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dykiert|first1=Dominika|last2=Bates|first2=Timothy C|last3=Gow|first3=Alan J|last4=Penke|first4=Lars|last5=Starr|first5=John M|last6=Deary|first6=Ian J|title=Predicting mortality from human faces|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|date=2012|volume=74|issue=6|pages=560–566|doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e318259c33f}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other factors ===
Additionally, FA has been shown to predict atypical asymmetry of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=J. T|last2=Gangestad|first2=S. W|last3=Lewine|first3=J. D|last4=Thoma|first4=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3599">'''Genreflecting''' is the process of examining and analyzing the patterns and characteristics of [[literary genre]]s—both [[fiction]] and recreational [[Non-fiction|nonfiction]]—and using that analysis to identify titles with similar appeals to readers (i.e., read-alikes), in order to make reading suggestions to individuals who are looking for something to read.

The term "genreflecting" was first coined by Betty Rosenberg, a prominent [[library science]] educator, in 1982.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genreflecting: A Guide to Reading Interests in Genre Fiction|last=Rosenberg|first=Betty|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1982|isbn=978-0872873339|location=Littleton, CO|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, the term has been adopted by [[readers' advisory]] in [[Library|libraries]] and extended to [[Non-fiction|nonfiction]] genres as well as fiction. A similar practice in retail bookstores is called "hand-selling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Retail-Approach-or-Library-Approach-Shaping-Readers-Advisory-John-Schoppert/pid=5938363|title=Retail Approach or Library Approach? Shaping Readers' Advisory, by John  Schoppert {{!}} Booklist Online|website=www.booklistonline.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the time the first edition of Rosenberg's ''Genreflecting'' was written, adding popular reading materials to library collections and recommending those titles to readers were controversial practices. Dr. Rosenberg's First Law of Reading—"Never apologize for your reading taste"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;—has since been adopted by growing numbers of [[librarian]]s, and the field of [[readers' advisory]] has become increasingly central to the practice of [[Library science|librarianship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2014/02/library-services/the-state-of-readers-advisory/#_|title=The State of Readers’ Advisory|newspaper=Library Journal|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Pearl]], the well known model of the librarian [[action figure]] and author of ''[[Book Lust]]'' and ''More Book Lust,'' has promoted and further popularized the practice of readers' advisory within the library community and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://litreactor.com/columns/readers-advisory-expert-advice-on-what-to-read-next|title=Library Love: Reader’s Advisory - Expert Advice On What To Read Next|newspaper=LitReactor|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a number of [[online database]]s have been developed to assist readers' advisors find "read-alikes," including ''What Do I Read Next?'' (Gale Thomson), ''NoveList'' ([[EBSCO Information Services|EBSCO]]), ''The Reader's Advisor Online'' ([[Greenwood Publishing Group]]), ''Fiction Connection'' (Bowker), and ''Booklist Online'' ([[American Library Association]]).

[[Glass-to-metal seal]]s have been around for many years, with one of the most common uses being lamp bulb seals. A more recent invention is '''glass-ceramic-to-metal seals'''.

==Properties==
''Glass-ceramics'' are polycrystalline [[ceramic]] materials prepared by the controlled crystallization of suitable glasses, normally [[silicate]]s. Depending on the starting glass composition and the heat-treatment schedule adopted, glass-ceramics can be prepared with tailored [[thermal expansion]] characteristics. This makes them ideal for sealing to a variety of different metals, ranging from low expansion [[Tungsten|tungsten (W)]] or [[Molybdenum|molybdenum (Mo)]] to high expansion [[stainless steel]]s and [[nickel]]-based [[superalloys]].

Glass-ceramic-to-metal seals offer superior properties over their glass equivalents including more [[refractory]] behaviour, in addition to their ability to seal successfully to many different metals and alloys. They have been used in electrical feed-through seals for such applications as [[vacuum]] interrupter envelopes and pyrotechnic [[actuator]]s, in addition to many applications where a higher temperature capability than is possible with [[glass-to-metal seal]]s is required, including solid [[oxide]] [[fuel cell]]s.

==Process==
In the formation of a glass-ceramic-to-metal seal, the parts to be joined are first heated, normally under [[Inert gas|inert]] atmosphere, in order to melt the glass and allow it to wet and flow into the metal parts, in much the same way as when preparing a more conventional [[glass-to-metal seal]]. The temperature is then normally reduced into a temperature regime where many microscopic nuclei are formed in the glass. The temperature is then raised again into a regime where the major [[crystallinity|crystalline]] [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s can form and grow to create the polycrystalline ceramic material with thermal expansion characteristics matched to that of the particular metal parts.

== Examples ==
The white opaque "glue" between the panel and the funnel of a colour TV [[cathode ray tube]] is a
devitrified [[solder glass]] based on the system {{chem|PbO}}-{{chem|ZnO}}-{{chem|B|2|O|3}}. While
this is a glass-ceramic-to-glass seal, the basic patent of S.A. Claypoole considers
glass-ceramic-to-metal seals as well.

}}
The '''Government Accountability Office''' ('''GAO''') is a [[legislative branch]]  government agency that provides [[audit]]ing, [[evaluation]], and investigative services for the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/about/workforce/ocg.html|title=Office of the Comptroller General|publisher=United States Government Accountability Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[supreme audit institution]] of the [[federal government of the United States]].

Mission of GAO is to:
* investigate how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars
* support the Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities
* help improve the performance
* ensure the accountability of the federal government for people
* provide Congress with timely information

==Core values==
{{advert section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Gao core values chart.gif|thumb|GAO’s Core Values encompass mission values (Accountability, Integrity, Reliability) and people values (Valued, Respected, Treated Fairly)]]
* Accountability:  GAO helps the Congress oversee federal programs and operations to ensure accountability to the American people. GAO's analysts, auditors, lawyers, economists, information technology specialists, investigators, and other multidisciplinary professionals seek to enhance the economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and credibility of the federal government both in fact and in the eyes of the American people. GAO accomplishes its mission through a variety of activities, including financial audits, program reviews, investigations, legal support, and policy analyses.
* Integrity:  GAO takes a professional, objective, fact-based, nonpartisan, nonideological, fair, and balanced approach to all of its activities and sets high standards for itself and its work. Integrity is the foundation of reputation, and GAO's approach to its work assures both.
* Reliability:  GAO produces high quality reports, testimony, briefings, legal opinions, and other products and services that are timely, accurate, useful, clear, and candid.
* Valued:  GAO seeks out and appreciates each person’s perspectives by seeing everyone as an individual and tapping into everyone’s skills, talents, and life experiences.
* Respected:  GAO strives to treat everyone with dignity by listening, hearing, and acknowledging everyone’s viewpoints, keeping an open mind, and embracing differences.
* Treated Fairly:  GAO fosters a work environment that provides opportunities for all staff to excel by acting with honesty and integrity, treating all equitably, checking for bias, supporting equal access to opportunities, and trusting others to do their part.

==Powers of GAO==
Work of GAO is done at the request of congressional committees or subcommittees or is mandated by public laws or committee reports. It also undertakes research under the authority of the Comptroller General. It supports congressional oversight by:
* auditing agency operations to determine whether federal funds are being spent efficiently and effectively;
* investigating allegations of illegal and improper activities;
* reporting on how well government programs and policies are meeting their objectives;
* performing policy analyses and outlining options for congressional consideration;
* issuing legal decisions and opinions;
* advising Congress and the heads of executive agencies about ways to make government more efficient and effective.

==Products of GAO==
[[File:LocalGao.png|thumb|GAO local offices]]

Products of GAO includes the following:
* reports and written correspondence;
* testimonies and statements for the record, where the former are delivered orally by one or more of GAO senior executives at a congressional hearing and the latter are provided for inclusion in the congressional record;
* briefings, which are usually given directly to congressional staff members;
* legal decisions and opinions resolving bid protests and addressing issues of appropriations law as well as opinions on the scope and excrcise of authority of federal officers.
GAO also produce special publications on specific issues of general interest to many Americans, such as its report on the fiscal future of the United States, GAO’s role in the federal bid protest process, and critical issues for congressional consideration related to improving the nation's image abroad.

==History==
The GAO was established as the '''General Accounting Office''' by the [[Budget and Accounting Act]] of 1921. The act required the head of the GAO to "investigate, at the seat of government or elsewhere, all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and application of public funds, and shall make to the President ... and to Congress ... reports [and] recommendations looking to greater economy or efficiency in public expenditures".&lt;ref&gt;[[Budget and Accounting Act of 1921]], Sec. 312(a), {{USStat|42|25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the GAO's current mission statement, the agency exists to support the Congress in meeting its [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] responsibilities and to help improve the [[performance]] and ensure the [[accountability]] of the federal government for the benefit of the American people.

The name was changed in 2004 to Government Accountability Office by the [[GAO Human Capital Reform Act]] to better reflect the mission of the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GAO Answers the Question: What’s in a Name?|last=Walker|first=David M.|authorlink=David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|date=July 19, 2004|work=[[Roll Call]]|url=http://www.gao.gov/about/rollcall07192004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Section 8, GAO Human Capital Reform Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-271, 118 Stat. 811, 814 (July 7, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; While most other countries have government entities similar to the GAO, their focus (with the exceptions of the [[Taiwan]]ese [[Control Yuan]] and the [[Israel]]i [[State Comptroller of Israel|State Comptroller]]) is primarily on conducting financial audits.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The GAO's auditors conduct not only financial audits, but also engage in a wide assortment of performance audits.

Over the years, the GAO has been referred to as "The Congressional Watchdog" and "The Taxpayers' Best Friend" for its frequent audits and investigative reports that have uncovered waste and inefficiency in government. News media often draw attention to the GAO's work by publishing stories on the findings, conclusions and recommendations of its reports. Members of Congress also frequently cite the GAO's work in statements to the press, congressional hearings, and floor debates on proposed legislation.  In 2007 the Partnership for Public Service ranked the GAO second on its list of the best places to work in the federal government and [[Washingtonian (magazine)|''Washingtonian'']] magazine included the GAO on its 2007 list of great places to work in Washington, a list that encompasses the public, private, and non-profit sectors.

The GAO is headed by the [[Comptroller General of the United States|comptroller general of the U.S.]], a professional and non-partisan position in the U.S. government.  The comptroller general is appointed by the [[President of the United States|president]], by and with the [[advice and consent#United States|advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], for a 15-year, non-renewable term.  The president selects a nominee from a list of at least three individuals recommended by an eight-member bipartisan, bicameral commission of congressional leaders. During such term, the comptroller general has standing to pursue litigation to compel access to federal agency information. The comptroller general may not be removed by the president, but only by Congress through impeachment or joint resolution for specific reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''See [[Bowsher v. Synar]]'', 478 U.S. 714 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1921, there have been only seven comptrollers general, and no formal attempt has ever been made to remove a comptroller general.

Labor-management relations became fractious during the 9-year tenure of the 7th comptroller general, [[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David M. Walker]].  On September 19, 2007, GAO analysts voted by a margin of two to one (897–445), in a 75% turnout, to establish the first union in the GAO's 86-year history.  The analysts voted to affiliate with the [[International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers]] (IFPTE), a member union of the [[AFL-CIO]]. There are more than 1,800 analysts in the GAO analysts bargaining unit; the local voted to name itself IFPTE Local 1921, in honor of the date of the GAO's establishment. On February 14, 2008, the GAO analysts' union approved its first-ever negotiated pay contract with management; of just over 1,200 votes, 98 percent were in favor of the contract.

The GAO also establishes standards for audits of government organizations, programs, activities, and functions, and of government assistance received by contractors, nonprofit organizations, and other nongovernmental organizations. These standards, often referred to as [[Government Auditing Standards (Yellow Book)|Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards]] (GAGAS), are to be followed by auditors and audit organizations when required by law, regulation, agreement, contract, or policy. These standards pertain to auditors' professional qualifications, the quality of audit effort, and the characteristics of professional and meaningful audit reports.

In 1992 the GAO hosted XIV [[International Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions|INCOSAI]], the fourteenth triennial convention of the [[International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions]] (INTOSAI).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

GAO is a United States government electronic data provider, as all of its reports are available on its [http://www.gao.gov/browse/date/week website], except for certain reports whose distribution is limited to official use in order to protect national and homeland security.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The variety of topics reported on range from Federal Budget and Fiscal Issues to Financial Management, Education, Retirement Issues, Defense, Homeland Security, Administration of Justice, Health Care, Information Management and Technology, Natural Resources, Environment, International Affairs, Trade, Financial Markets, Housing, Government Management and Human Capital. GAO often produces highlights of its reports that serve as a [[Congressional Record#Overview|statement for the record]] for various subcommittees of the United States Congress.

Most GAO studies and reports are initiated by requests from members of Congress, including requests mandated in statute, and so reflect concerns of current political import, for example to study the impact of a government-wide hiring freeze.&lt;ref name="GAO_1982"&gt;{{cite report |author=[[Comptroller General of the United States]] |accessdate=January 24, 2017 |url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/140/137055.pdf |format=PDF |title=Recent Government-Wide Hiring Freeze Prove Ineffective In Managing Federal Employment  |number=FPCD-82-21 |date=March 10, 1982 |publisher=Government Accountability Office (GOA)}} requested sent to  [[Charles A.

The GAO prepares some 900 reports annually. GAO publishes reports and information relating to, [[Inter alia#inter alia|''inter alia'']]:

===Financial Statements of the U.S. government===
Each year the GAO issues an audit report on the financial statements of the United States Government. The '''2010 Financial Report of the United States Government''' was released on December 21, 2010.&lt;ref name="GaO 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/press/financial_report_2010dec21.html |title=Press Release |publisher=US Government Accountability Office |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying press release states that the GAO 'cannot render an [[audit opinion|opinion]] on the [[2010 United States federal budget|2010 consolidated financial statements of the federal government]], because of widespread [[materiality (auditing)|material]] internal control weaknesses, significant uncertainties, and other limitations'.&lt;ref name="GaO 2010"/&gt;

===U.S. Public Debt===
As part of its initiative to advocate [[sustainability]], the GAO publishes a Federal Fiscal Outlook Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/fed/recent.html |title=Most Recent Federal Fiscal Outlook Report |publisher=Government Accountability Office |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as data relating to the [[US public debt|deficit]].&lt;ref name="deficit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/deficit/ |title=Measuring the Deficit: Cash vs. Accrual |publisher=Government Accountability Office |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US deficit is presented on a [[Comparison of Cash Method and Accrual Method of accounting|cash]] rather than [[accruals]] basis, although the GAO notes that the accrual deficit 'provides more information on the longer-term implications of the government's annual operations'.&lt;ref name="deficit"/&gt;
In [[Fiscal year|FY]] 2010, the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] had a net operating cost of $2,080 billion, although since this includes accounting [[Provision (accounting)|provisions]] (estimates of future liabilities), the cash deficit is $1,294 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/financial/fy2010/10frusg.pdf |title=2010 Financial Report of the United States Government (''vid.'' pp.v, 43) |publisher=Government Accountability Office |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quinquennial Strategic Plan===
The most recent GAO plan, for 2010-2015, sets out four goals, namely to address: (1) Current and Emerging Challenges to the Well-being and Financial Security of the American People; (2) Changing Security Threats and the Challenges of Global Interdependence; (3) Transformation of the Federal Government to Address National Challenges; (4) Maximization of the Value of the GAO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10559sp.pdf |title=Strategic Plan: Serving the Congress and the Nation, 2010 –2015 |publisher=Government Accountability Office |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic Audits and Investigative Service (FAIS)

The Forensic Audits and Investigative Service (FAIS) team provides Congress with high-quality forensic audits and investigations of fraud, waste, and abuse; other special investigations; and security and vulnerability assessments. Its work cuts across a diverse array of government programs administered by IRS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Homeland Security, among others.

==GAO and Technology Assessment==

After the closing of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1995, Congress directed GAO to conduct a [[technology assessment]] (TA) pilot program. Between 2002 and 2006, four reports were completed– use of biometrics for border security, cyber security for [[critical infrastructure protection]], technologies for protecting structures in wildland fires, and cargo container security technologies. In the first report, GAO found that while biometrics technologies could be used to secure the border, they had limitations in fingerprinting and facial recognition systems. An immediate impact of the report was a congressional testimony on the use of biometrics which, in turn, helped to inform U.S. national security reform efforts. GAO reports, which are made available to the public, have become essential vehicles for understanding science and technology (S&amp;T) implications of policies considered by the Congress.

Since 2007, Congress has established a permanent TA function within GAO. This new operational role augments GAO’s performance audits related to S&amp;T issues, including effectiveness and efficiency of U.S. federal programs. In 2010, GAO joined [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) as an associate member. In the last three years, GAO has completed TA reports on three topics, the most recent one being released in 2011 – rail security, climate engineering, and alternate neutron detectors. In the climate engineering report, Congress requested GAO to examine three areas: the current S&amp;T state of climate engineering, views of experts on the future of climate engineering research, and potential public responses to climate engineering. When the GAO receives a request to conduct TA, it follows five phases: Acceptance, Planning, Data Gathering and Analysis, Product development and Distribution and Results. Phases one and two include selecting the topic and initiating the TA plan while the other ones are respectively: conducting TA, followed by developing the report and ensuring its accuracy and integrity, and finally receiving feedback from Congress and developing lessons learned to enhance the TA process.

The GAO describes the TA as providing "thorough and balanced analysis of critical technological innovations that affect our society, the environment, and the economy" explaining "the consequences that each featured technology will have on federal agencies and departments, and their wider impacts on American society".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/technology_assessment U.S. GAO - Technology Assessment]. Gao.gov. Retrieved on July 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This broad working definition enables GAO analysts to utilize TA as a tool for policy analysis. Technology assessments at GAO are conducted in accordance with GAO’s quality assurance framework.  GAO initiates technology assessments through congressional mandates, requests from congressional leaders, and through the authority of U.S. Comptroller General.

The Technology Assessment section of GAO's website &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/technology_assessment GAO-TA]&lt;/ref&gt; offers the latest TA reports and videos.

==Protocols==
* USDA Should Take Further Action to Reduce Pathogens in Meat and Poultry Products. Why GAO Did This StudyThe U.S. food supply is generally considered safe, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that Salmonella and Campylobacter in food cause about 2 million human illnesses per year in the United States. GAO was asked to review USDA’s approach to reducing pathogens in meat and poultry products. This report examines (1) the extent to which USDA has developed standards for meat and poultry products and (2) any additional steps USDA has taken to address challenges GAO identified in 2014. GAO reviewed relevant regulations, documents, and data and interviewed officials from USDA and CDC, as well as 17 stakeholders representing industry, consumer groups, and researchers selected based on their knowledge of USDA’s meat and poultry slaughter inspections and food safety.What GAO RecommendsGAO is making three recommendations, including that USDA document its process for deciding which products to consider for new standards and that it include information on the effectiveness of on-farm practices in its guidelines for Salmonella control in hogs. USDA agreed with GAO's recommendations and described actions it will take to implement them.
* CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION Additional Actions Are Essential for Assessing Cybersecurity Framework Adoption. Why GAO Did This Study Our nation’s critical infrastructure includes the public and private systems and assets vital to national security, economic stability, and public health and safety. Federal policy identifies 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including the financial services, energy, transportation, and communications sectors. To better address cyber- related risks to critical infrastructure, in 2014, NIST developed, as called for by federal law and policy, the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, a voluntary framework of cybersecurity standards and procedures for industry to adopt.The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 included provisions for GAO to review aspects of the cybersecurity standards and procedures in the framework developed by NIST. GAO’s objective was to assess what is known about the extent to which critical infrastructure sectors have adopted the framework. To do so, GAO analyzed documentation, such as sector-specific guidance and tools to facilitate implementation, and interviewed relevant federal and nonfederal officials from the 16 critical infrastructure sectors.What GAO RecommendsGAO is making nine recommendations that methods be developed for determining framework adoption by the sector-specific agencies across their respective sectors, in consultation with their respective sector partner(s), such as the sector coordinating councils, the Department of Homeland Security, and NIST, as appropriate. Five agencies agreed with the recommendations, while four others neither agreed nor disagreed.
* Homeland defenceurgent Need for DOD and FAA to Address Risks and Improve Planning for Technology That Tracks Military Aircraft. Why GAO Did This StudyDOD has until January 1, 2020, to equip its aircraft with ADS-B Out technology that would provide DOD, FAA, and private citizens the ability to track their flights in real-time and track flight patterns over time. This technology is a component of NextGen, a broader FAA initiative that seeks to modernize the current radar- driven, ground-based air transportation system into a satellite-driven space- based system.What GAO RecommendsGAO is recommending that DOD and FAA approve one or more solutions to address ADS-B -related security risks; and that DOD implement key tasks to facilitate consistent, long-term planning and implementation of NextGen. DOD and the Department of Transportation generally concurred and described planned actions to implement the recommendations.

== AIDS ==

The [[HIV]] genome is made from [[RNA]] rather than [[DNA]]. The [[enzyme]] that converts RNA to DNA and then inserts it into a cell makes between one and 10 mistakes every time it copies itself. This high error rate means that the [[virus]] population that inhabits each HIV patients is genetically diverse.&lt;ref name=rd/&gt;

When the HIV virus infects someone, it copies its DNA and inserts into the DNA of [[white blood cells]], making the virus part of its host. Even if these genes could be silenced with drugs, (later) stopping the drugs sets the viral DNA free to attack the patient.&lt;ref name=rd/&gt;

HT-TALENs binds to that sequence and cuts the HIV DNA, but not human DNA. When that cut gets fixed by the cell's [[DNA repair]] system, it makes a scar that leaves the virus unable to return and make HIV DNA cells. 60% of the cells making the protein damage the viral DNA.&lt;ref name=rd/&gt;

[[File:common time signatures.gif|right|frame|Basic [[time signature]]s: {{music|time|4|4}}, also known as common time ({{music|common-time}}); {{music|time|2|2}}, also known as cut time or cut-common time ({{music|alla-breve}}); etc.]]

In [[popular music]], '''half-time''' is a type of [[meter (music)|meter]] and [[tempo]] that alters the [[rhythm]]ic feel by essentially ''doubling the tempo resolution'' or metric [[divisive rhythm|division]]/level in comparison to [[common-time]]. Thus {{music|time|4|4}} approximates {{music|time|8|8}}. It is not to be confused with ''[[alla breve]]'' or [[Time signature#Complex time signatures|odd time]]. Though notes usually get the same value relative to the tempo, the way the [[beat (music)|beats]] are divided is altered. While much music typically has a [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]] on [[quarter note]] (crotchet) beats two and four, half time would increase the interval between backbeats to double, thus making it hit on beats three and seven, or the third beat of each measure ([[counting (music)|count]] out of an 8 beat measure [bar], common practice in half time):
 1   '''2'''   3   '''4'''   1   '''2'''   3   '''4'''
 1   '''2'''   3   '''4'''   5   '''6'''   7   '''8'''
 1       '''2'''       3       '''4'''
Essentially, a half time '[[Groove (drumming)|groove]]' is one that expands one [[bar (music)|measure]] over the course of two. The ''length'' of each note is doubled while its ''frequency'' is halved).

==Common-time==
{{main|Common-time}}
[[File:Characteristic rock drum pattern.png|250px|thumb|Rhythm pattern characteristic of much popular music including rock ({{audio|Characteristic rock drum pattern.mid|Play}}), quarter note (crotchet) or "regular" time: "bass drum on beats 1 and 3 and snare drum on beats 2 and 4 of the measure [bar]...add eighth notes [quavers] on the hi-hat".&lt;ref&gt;Peckman, Jonathan (2007). ''Picture Yourself Drumming'', p.50. {{ISBN|1-59863-330-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Time signatures are defined by how they divide the measure (in {{music|time|9|8}}, complex triple time, each measure is divided in three, each of which is divided into three eighth notes: 3×3=9). In "common" time, often considered {{music|time|4|4}}, each level is divided in two (simple duple time: 2×2=4). In a  common-time rock drum pattern each measure (a whole note) is divided in two by the bass drum (half note), each half is divided in two by the snare drum (quarter note, collectively the bass and snare divide the measure into four), and each quarter note is divided in two by a [[ride pattern]] (eighth note). "Half"-time refers to halving this division (divide each measure into quarter notes with the ride pattern), while "double"-time refers to doubling this division (divide each measure into sixteenth notes with the ride pattern).

==Half-time==
[[File:Half time rock pattern.png|300px|center|thumb|Half time: notice the snare moves to beats 3 of measures (bars) one and two (beats 3 &amp; 7) while the hi-hat plays only on the quarter notes (quavers).{{audio|Half time rock pattern.mid|Play}} Note also, for example, that the quarter notes 'sound like' eighth notes in one giant measure.]]

A classic example is the '''half-time shuffle''', a variation of a [[swung note|shuffle]] rhythm, which is used extensively in hip-hop and some blues music. Some of the variations of the basic groove are notoriously difficult to play on [[drum set]]. It is also a favorite in some pop and rock tunes. Some classic examples are the [[Purdie Shuffle]] by [[Bernard Purdie]] which appears in "[[Home at Last (Steely Dan song)|Home At Last]]" and "[[Babylon Sisters]]", both of which are [[Steely Dan (band)|Steely Dan]] songs.&lt;ref name=Porcaro&gt;{{YouTube|id=pwyO1qr0edI|title=The Rosanna Half Time Shuffle by Jeff Porcaro}}. Accessed 31 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Fool in the Rain]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]] uses a derivation of the Purdie Shuffle, and [[Jeff Porcaro]] of [[Toto (band)|Toto]] created a hybridization of the Zeppelin and Purdie shuffles called the [[Rosanna shuffle]] for the track "[[Rosanna (song)|Rosanna]]".&lt;ref name=Porcaro /&gt;

[[File:Shuffle feel.png|thumb|right|250px|Quarter note shuffle&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, Rick (2006). ''All About Drums'', p.44. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|1-4234-0818-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Audio|Shuffle feel.mid|play}}]]
[[File:Half time shuffle.png|thumb|center|300px|"Basic half time shuffle"&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Dee (2001). ''The Drummer's Guide to Shuffles'', p.19. {{ISBN|0-634-01098-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Audio|Half time shuffle.mid|play}}.]]

It is important to realize that while in half time, the ''feel'' of notes are chopped in half, but the actual time ''value'' remains the same. For example, at the same tempo, 8th notes (quavers) would sound like 16ths (semiquavers). In the case of the half time shuffle, triplets sound like 16th note (semiquaver) triplets, etc. By preserving the tempo, the beat is stretched by a factor of 2.

{{Other uses|Double Time (disambiguation){{!}}Double Time}}

In [[music]] and [[dance]], '''double-time''' is a type of [[meter (music)|meter]] and [[tempo]] or rhythmic feel by essentially ''halving the tempo resolution'' or metric [[divisive rhythm|division]]/level. It is also associated with specific [[time signature]]s such as {{music|time|2|2}}. Contrast with [[half time (music)|half time]].

In [[jazz]] the term means using note values twice as fast as previously but without changing the pace of the [[Chord (music)|chord]] progressions. It is often used during improvised solos.&lt;ref&gt;Randel, Don Michael (2003). ''Harvard dictionary of music'', fourth edition, p. 253. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-01163-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may help to picture the way musicians count each metric level in 4/4:
 quarter:    1           2           3           4
 eighth:     1     &amp;     2     &amp;     3     &amp;     4     &amp;
 sixteenth:  1  e  &amp;  a  2  e  &amp;  a  3  e  &amp;  a  4  e  &amp;  a

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9321">In photography and cinematography, '''headroom''' or '''head room''' is a concept of [[Composition (visual arts)|aesthetic composition]] that addresses the relative vertical position of the subject within the [[Framing (visual arts)|frame]] of the image. Headroom refers specifically to the distance between the top of the subject's head and the top of the frame, but the term is sometimes used instead of [[lead room]], nose room or 'looking room'&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;Thompson, Roy. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kxeJpEDGBGQC&amp;pg=PA64 ''Grammar of the shot''], Focal Press, 1998, p. 64. {{ISBN|0-240-51398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include the sense of space on both sides of the image. The amount of headroom that is considered aesthetically pleasing is a dynamic quantity; it changes relative to how much of the frame is filled by the subject. For both photography and cinematography, composition is incredibly important. Rather than pointing and shooting, one must compose the image to be pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediacollege.com/video/camera/tutorial/01-framing.html|title=Camera Tutorial 1-5 : Framing|website=www.mediacollege.com|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Too much room between a subject's head and the top of frame results in dead space. Its uninteresting and leaves the viewer feeling awkward. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.steves-digicams.com/knowledge-center/how-tos/film-and-video-production/production-understanding-head-room.html|title=Production: Understanding Head Room  - Steve's Digicams|website=www.steves-digicams.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of headroom ==
[[File:Harriet_Backer_Lesende_dame_i_renessansedrakt_1878.jpg|317x317px|Harriet Backer Lesende dame i renessansedrakt 1878]]

The concept of headroom was born with [[portrait painting]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Hurter, Bill. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OR4pYn9yYDAC&amp;pg=PA38 ''The Best of Portrait Photography: Techniques and Images from the Pros''], Amherst Media, Inc, 2003, p. 38. {{ISBN|1-58428-101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classical painters used a technique linked to headroom called the "[[rule of thirds]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://penguindaze.com/beginning/FEIST-DVA_Composition.pdf ''Camera Terms''], Retrieved on June 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MediaCollege.com. [http://www.mediacollege.com/video/camera/tutorial/01-framing.html ''Framing''], Retrieved on June 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "rule of thirds" was first coined by the painter John Thomas Smith in his book "Remarks on Rural Scenery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/who-wrote-rule-thirds%3F|title=Who Wrote the Rule of Thirds?|last=Harris|first=John|date=|website=B&amp;H Photo Video|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of thirds suggests that the subject's eyes, as a center of interest, are ideally positioned one-third of the way down from the top of the frame.&lt;ref name="Barbash2"&gt;Barbash, Ilisa; Taylor, Lucien. [https://books.google.com/books?id=omwNpTZ6LoUC&amp;pg=PA97 ''Cross-cultural Filmmaking: A Handbook for Making Documentary and Ethnographic Films and Videos''], University of California Press, 1997, p. 97. {{ISBN|0-520-08760-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a subject placed one-third of the way down from the top of frame, the subject aligns with the proper head room to make an image pleasing to the eye. This technique has carried on with other visual forms of art such as photography and cinematography.

== Psychology of headroom ==
Perceptual psychological studies have been carried out{{by whom|date=January 2015}} with experimenters using a white dot placed in various positions within a frame to demonstrate that observers attribute potential motion to a static object within a frame, relative to its position. The unmoving object is described as 'pulling' toward the center or toward an edge or corner.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Peter. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oofqv043A3EC&amp;pg=PA84 ''Picture composition for film and television''], Elsevier, 2003, p. 84. {{ISBN|0-240-51681-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper headroom is achieved when the object is no longer seen to be slipping out of the frame—when its potential for motion is seen to be neutral in all directions.

Head room can also aid the creator in imposing a certain feeling upon the viewer. Headroom is a way of balancing out a frame. According to Dr. John Suhler in his e-book ''Photographic Psychology: Image and Psyche'', “the eye appreciates the appearance of balance in [an image]. It makes us feel centered, steady, and stable. It suggests poise and gracefulness.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://truecenterpublishing.com/photopsy/article_index.htm|title=Photographic Psychology: Image and Psyche|website=truecenterpublishing.com|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headroom helps create this balance. If there is too much headroom, this can make a viewer feel unsettled. On the other hand, a head that is partially cut off can make a viewer feel claustrophobic. A perfectly framed headroom can make the viewer feel at ease and focus on the eyes of a subject. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.provideocoalition.com/the-history-of-headroom/|title=A Short History of Headroom, and How to Use It by Art Adams - ProVideo Coalition|last=Coalition|first=ProVideo|date=2016-05-01|work=ProVideo Coalition|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows a filmmaker to advance the story visually by altering a viewer's subconscious. It may also aid a photographer in creating the tone they want in a photograph. For a head shot, they would want the viewer to be completely at ease and be drawn to the person in the shot. They would frame it perfectly. For a piece of art about mental illness, they may give the viewer either too much headroom or entirely too little. It depends on the overall effect a photographer wants. 

== Headroom in cinematography ==
Cinematography has the added factors of the movement of the subject, the movement of the camera, and the possibility of [[Zooming (filmmaking)|zooming in or out]]. 

Headroom changes as the camera zooms in or out, and the camera must simultaneously tilt up or down to keep the center of interest approximately one-third of the way down from the top of the frame.&lt;ref name="Barbash3"&gt;Barbash, Ilisa; Taylor, Lucien. [https://books.google.com/books?id=omwNpTZ6LoUC&amp;pg=PA97 ''Cross-cultural Filmmaking: A Handbook for Making Documentary and Ethnographic Films and Videos''], University of California Press, 1997, p. 97. {{ISBN|0-520-08760-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closer the subject, the less headroom needed.&lt;ref&gt;Millerson, 1994, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme [[Close-up|close-ups]], the top of the head is out of the frame,&lt;ref name="Thompson2"&gt;Thompson, Roy. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kxeJpEDGBGQC&amp;pg=PA64 ''Grammar of the shot''], Focal Press, 1998, p. 64. {{ISBN|0-240-51398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept of headroom still applies via the rule of thirds. This also changes when one is shooting a extreme wide-shot. The subject can still be placed correctly for rule of thirds, but have a significant amount of space between his/her head and the top from frame. It can be more visually pleasing to give equal weight to the sky and ground rather than ensuring proper headroom is being achieved. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Headroom in television ==
In [[Television program|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] camera work, the amount of headroom seen by the production crew is slightly greater than the amount seen by home viewers, whose frames are reduced in area by about 5%.&lt;ref name="Thompson3"&gt;Thompson, Roy. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kxeJpEDGBGQC&amp;pg=PA64 ''Grammar of the shot''], Focal Press, 1998, p. 64. {{ISBN|0-240-51398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; To adjust for this, broadcast camera headroom is slightly expanded so that home viewers will see the correct amount of headroom.&lt;ref name="Thompson3" /&gt; Professional [[video camera]] [[Viewfinder|viewfinders]] and professional [[Video monitor|video monitors]] often include an [[overscan]] setting to compare between full screen resolution and "domestic cut-off"&lt;ref name="Thompson3" /&gt; as an aid to achieving good headroom and lead room.

==Examples==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11744">[[File:Helium flash.svg|thumbnail|right|Fusion of helium in the core of low mass stars.]]
A '''helium flash''' is a very brief [[thermal runaway]] [[nuclear fusion]] of large quantities of [[helium]] into [[carbon]] through the [[triple-alpha process]] in the core of low mass [[star]]s (between 0.8 [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=yes}}) and 2.0 {{Solar mass}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/siu_web/ssescript/new/chapter9.pdf Chapter 9: Post-main sequence evolution through helium burning]&lt;/ref&gt;) during their [[red giant]] phase (the [[Sun]] is predicted to experience a flash 1.2 billion years after it leaves the [[main sequence]]). A much rarer runaway helium fusion process can also occur on the surface of [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] [[white dwarf]] stars.

Low mass stars do not produce enough [[gravity|gravitational]] pressure to initiate normal helium fusion. As the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, some of the helium left behind is instead compacted into [[degenerate matter]], supported against [[gravitational collapse]] by [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] pressure rather than [[ideal gas law|thermal pressure]]. This increases the density and temperature of the core until it reaches approximately 100 million [[kelvin]], which is hot enough to cause helium fusion (or "helium burning") in the core.

However, a fundamental quality of degenerate matter is that changes in temperature do not produce a change of volume of the matter until the thermal pressure becomes so very high that it exceeds degeneracy pressure. In main sequence stars, [[hydrostatic equilibrium|thermal expansion]] regulates the core temperature, but in degenerate cores this does not occur. Helium fusion increases the temperature, which increases the fusion rate, which further increases the temperature in a runaway reaction. This produces a flash of very intense helium fusion that lasts only a few minutes, but briefly emits energy at a rate comparable to the entire [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

In the case of normal low mass stars, the vast energy release causes much of the core to come out of degeneracy, allowing it to thermally expand, however, consuming as much energy as the total energy released by the helium flash, and any left-over energy is absorbed into the star's upper layers. Thus the helium flash is mostly undetectable to observation, and is described solely by astrophysical models. After the core's expansion and cooling, the star's surface rapidly cools and contracts in as little as 10,000 years until it is roughly 2% of its former radius and luminosity. It is estimated that the electron-degenerate helium core weighs about 40% of the star mass and that 6% of the core is converted into carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/end.html |title= The End Of The Sun |first= David |last= Taylor |website= North Western }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red giants==
[[File:White Dwarf Resurrection.jpg|thumb|[[Sakurai's Object]] is a [[white dwarf]] undergoing a helium flash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Dwarf Resurrection|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1531a/|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the [[red giant]] phase of [[stellar evolution]] in stars with less than 2.0 {{Solar mass}} the [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen ceases in the core as it is depleted, leaving a helium-rich core. While fusion of hydrogen continues in the star’s shell causing a continuation of the accumulation of helium ash in the core, making the core denser, the temperature still is unable to reach the level required for helium fusion, as happens in more massive stars. Thus the thermal pressure from fusion is no longer sufficient to counter the gravitational collapse and create the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] found in most stars. This causes the star to start contracting and increasing in temperature until it eventually becomes compressed enough for the helium core to become [[degenerate matter]]. This degeneracy pressure is finally sufficient to stop further collapse of the most central material but the rest of the core continues to contract and the temperature continues to rise until it reaches a point ({{val|p=≈|1|e=8|ul=K}}) at which the helium can ignite and start to fuse.&lt;ref name=Hansen2004&gt;{{cite book|title=Stellar Interiors - Physical Principles, Structure, and Evolution|last=Hansen|first=Carl J.|last2=Kawaler|first2=Steven D.|last3=Trimble|first3=Virginia|isbn=978-0387200897 |date=2004|edition=2|publisher=Springer|pages=62–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seeds2012&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Astronomy|last=Seeds|first=Michael A.|last2=Backman|first2=Dana E.|pages=249–51|date=2012|edition=12|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-1133103769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karttunen2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamental Astronomy|isbn=978-3540341437|edition=5|page=249|editor-first=Hannu|editor-last=Karttunen|editor2-first=Pekka|editor2-last=Kröger|editor3-first=Heikki|editor3-last=Oja|editor4-first=Markku|editor4-last=Poutanen|editor5-first=Karl Johan|editor5-last=Donner|publisher=Springer|date=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosive nature of the helium flash arises from its taking place in degenerate matter. Once the temperature reaches 100 million–200 million [[kelvin]] and helium fusion begins using the [[triple-alpha process]], the temperature rapidly increases, further raising the helium fusion rate and, because degenerate matter is a good [[Thermal conduction|conductor of heat]], widening the reaction region.

However, since degeneracy pressure (which is purely a function of density) is dominating thermal pressure (proportional to the product of density and temperature), the total pressure is only weakly dependent on temperature.  Thus, the dramatic increase in temperature only causes a slight increase in pressure, so there is no stabilizing cooling expansion of the core.

This runaway reaction quickly climbs to about 100 billion times the star's normal energy production (for a few seconds) until the temperature increases to the point that thermal pressure again becomes dominant, eliminating the degeneracy. The core can then expand and cool down and a stable burning of helium will continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 317| pages = 724–732| last = Deupree| first = R. G.|author2=R. K. Wallace| title = The core helium flash and surface abundance anomalies| journal = Astrophysical Journal| date = 1987|bibcode = 1987ApJ...317..724D| doi = 10.1086/165319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A star with mass greater than about 2.25 {{Solar mass}} starts to burn helium without its core becoming degenerate, and so does not exhibit this type of helium flash. In a very low-mass star (less than about 0.5 {{Solar mass}}), the core is never hot enough to ignite helium. The degenerate helium core will keep on contracting, and finally becomes a [[White dwarf#Stars with very low mass|helium white dwarf]].

The helium flash is not directly observable on the surface by electromagnetic radiation. The flash occurs in the core deep inside the star, and the net effect will be that all released energy is absorbed by the entire core, leaving the degenerate state to become nondegenerate. Earlier computations indicated that a nondisruptive mass loss would be possible in some cases,&lt;ref name="Deupree1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Deupree|first1= R.

In a one solar mass star, the helium flash is estimated to release about {{val|5|e=41|ul=J}},&lt;ref name="Edwards19690"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Edwards, A. C.|title= The Hydrodynamics of the Helium Flash | journal= Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | date=1969 | volume=146 |issue= 4 | pages=445–472 | bibcode= 1969MNRAS.146..445E|doi = 10.1093/mnras/146.4.445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 0.3% of the energy release of a {{val|1.5|e=44|ul=J}} [[Type Ia supernova]],&lt;ref name="Khokhlov1993"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Khokhlov, A. |author2=Müller, E. |author3=Höflich, P. | title= Light curves of Type IA supernova models with different explosion mechanisms | journal= Astronomy and Astrophysics | date=1993 | volume=270 | issue=1–2 | pages=223–248 | bibcode= 1993A&amp;A...270..223K}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is triggered by an analogous [[Carbon detonation|ignition of carbon fusion]] in a carbon–oxygen [[white dwarf]].

==Binary white dwarfs==

When hydrogen gas is accreted onto a ''white dwarf'' from a binary companion star, the hydrogen can fuse to form helium for a narrow range of accretion rates, but most systems develop a layer of hydrogen over the degenerate white dwarf interior. This hydrogen can build up to form a shell near the surface of the star. When the mass of hydrogen becomes sufficiently large, runaway fusion causes a [[nova]]. In a few binary systems where the hydrogen fuses on the surface, the mass of helium built up can burn in an unstable helium flash. In certain binary systems the companion star may have lost most of its hydrogen and donate helium-rich material to the compact star. Note that similar flashes occur on [[X-ray burster|neutron stars]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=={{Anchor|shell helium flash}}Shell helium flash==

'''Shell helium flashes''' are a somewhat analogous but much less violent, nonrunaway helium ignition event, taking place in the absence of degenerate matter. They occur periodically in [[asymptotic giant branch]] stars in a shell outside the core. This is late in the life of a star in its giant phase. The star has burnt most of the helium available in the core, which is now composed of carbon and oxygen. Helium fusion continues in a thin shell around this core, but then turns off as helium becomes depleted. This allows hydrogen fusion to start in a layer above the helium layer. After enough additional helium accumulates, helium fusion is reignited, leading to a thermal pulse which eventually causes the star to expand and brighten temporarily (the pulse in luminosity is delayed because it takes a number of years for the energy from restarted helium fusion to reach the surface&lt;ref name = "Wood"/&gt;). Such pulses may last a few hundred years, and are thought to occur periodically every 10,000 to 100,000 years.&lt;ref name = "Wood"&gt;{{Cite journal

After the flash, helium fusion continues at an exponentially decaying rate for about 40% of the cycle as the helium shell is consumed.&lt;ref name = "Wood"/&gt; Thermal pulses may cause a star to shed circumstellar shells of gas and dust.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

{{annotated image/Extinction|float=right|caption=The percentage of marine animal extinction at the [[genus]] level through the five [[mass extinction]]s}}

The '''Holocene extinction''', otherwise referred to as the '''Sixth extinction''' or '''Anthropocene extinction''', is the ongoing [[extinction event]] of [[species]] during the present [[Holocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], mainly as a result of human activity.&lt;ref name="WorldScientists"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2018-06&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos |first1=Gerardo |last2=Ehrlich |first2=Paul R. |title=The misunderstood sixth mass extinction |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1080.2 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=8 June 2018 |volume=360 |issue=6393 |pages=1080-1081 |doi=10.1126/science.aau0191 |pmid=29880679 |oclc=7673137938}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large number of extinctions spans numerous families of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, including [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[arthropod]]s. With widespread degradation of [[Biodiversity hotspot|highly biodiverse]] habitats such as [[coral reef]]s and [[rainforest]]s, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be ''undocumented'', as no one is even aware of the existence of the species before they go extinct, or no one has yet discovered their extinction. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lawton95/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{Cite journal|last=De Vos|first=Jurriaan M.|last2=Joppa|first2=Lucas N.|last3=Gittleman|first3=John L.|last4=Stephens|first4=Patrick R.|last5=Pimm|first5=Stuart L.|date=2014-08-26|title=Estimating the normal background rate of species extinction|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12380|journal=Conservation Biology |volume=29|issue=2|pages=452–462|doi=10.1111/cobi.12380|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2018-06/&gt;

The Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as [[megafauna]], starting at the end of the [[last glacial period|last Ice Age]]. Megafauna outside of the [[African continent]], which did not evolve alongside humans, proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation, and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the Earth (additionally, many [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|African species have also gone extinct in the Holocene]]). These extinctions, occurring near the [[Pleistocene]]–[[Holocene]] boundary, are sometimes referred to as the [[Quaternary extinction event]].

The arrival of humans on different continents coincides with megafaunal extinction. The most popular theory is that human overhunting of species added to existing stress conditions. Although there is debate regarding how much human predation affected their decline, certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity, such as the extinction events of [[List of extinct animals of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[List of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]]. Aside from humans, [[climate change]] may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions, especially at the end of the Pleistocene.

Ecologically, humanity has been noted as an unprecedented "global superpredator" that consistently preys on the adults of other [[apex predator]]s, and has [[human impact on the environment|worldwide effect]]s on [[food web]]s. There have been extinctions of species on every [[land mass]] and in every [[ocean]]: there are many famous examples [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|within Africa]], [[List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene|Asia]], [[List of extinct animals of Europe|Europe]], [[List of extinct animals of Australia|Australia]], [[List of North American animals extinct in the Holocene|North]] and [[List of South American animals extinct in the Holocene|South America]], and on smaller islands.

Humans of this era actively hunted the [[mammoth]] and the [[mastodon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pitulko | first1 = V. V. | last2 = Nikolsky | first2 = P. A. | last3 = Girya | first3 = E.

The ecosystems encountered by the first Americans had not been exposed to human interaction, and may have been far less resilient to human made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans. Therefore, the actions of the Clovis people, despite seeming insignificant by today's standards could indeed have had a profound effect on the ecosystems and wild life which was entirely unused to human influence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Afroeurasia====
{{See also|List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene|List of extinct animals of Europe}}
Africa experienced the smallest decline in megafauna compared to the other continents. This is presumably due to the idea that Afroeurasian megafauna evolved alongside humans, and thus developed a healthy fear of them, unlike the comparatively tame animals of other continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/files/17443890/late_pleistocene_megafaunal_extinctions.pdf|pages=700–711|first=S.

====Megafaunal extinction====
Megafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance. They do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination (or, to a much lesser extent, through decomposition after death).&lt;ref name="Wolf2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1=A.|last2=Doughty|first2=C.

Large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of [[methane]], which is an important [[greenhouse gas]]. Modern [[ruminant]] [[herbivores]] produce methane as a byproduct of [[foregut fermentation]] in digestion, and release it through belching or flatulence. Today, around 20% of annual [[methane emissions]] come from livestock methane release. In the [[Mesozoic]], it has been estimated that [[sauropod]]s could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually,&lt;ref name = "Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=D.

After early humans migrated to the Americas about 13,000 [[Before Present|BP]], their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there. Calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year. This suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the [[Younger Dryas]].&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; The decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time, as recorded in [[ice core]]s, was 2–4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years, suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt;

=== Disease ===

The hyperdisease hypothesis, proposed by Ross MacPhee in 1997, states that the megafaunal die-off was due to an indirect transmission of diseases by newly arriving [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal humans]].&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1997"&gt;{{cite book |author1=MacFee, R.D.E.  |author2=Marx, P.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1997 |chapter= Humans, hyperdisease and first-contact extinctions |title=Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar |editor= Goodman, S. |editor2=Patterson, B.D. | location = Washington D.C. | publisher = Smithsonian Press | pages = 169–217 | isbn = 978-1-56098-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1998"&gt;{{cite web |author1=MacFee, R.D.E.  |author2=Marx, P.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1998 | title = Lightning Strikes Twice: Blitzkrieg, Hyperdisease, and Global Explanations of the Late Quaternary Catastrophic Extinctions | publisher = American Museum of Natural History | url = http://www.amnh.biz/science/biodiversity/extinction/Day1/bytes/MacPheePres.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| first = Ross D.E.| last = MacPhee|author2=Marx, Preston | title = The 40,000-year Plague: Humans, Hyperdisease, and First-Contact Extinctions| booktitle = Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar| pages = 169–217| publisher = Smithsonian Institution Press| year = 1997| location = Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MacPhee, aboriginals or animals travelling with them, such as [[domestic dog]]s or livestock, introduced one or more highly [[virulent]] diseases into new environments whose native population had no immunity to them, eventually leading to their extinction. [[K-selection]] animals, such as the now-extinct megafauna, are especially vulnerable to diseases, as opposed to [[r-selection]] animals who have a shorter [[gestation period]] and a higher population size. Humans are thought to be the sole cause as other earlier migrations of animals into North America from Eurasia did not cause extinctions.&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1997"/&gt;

There are many problems with this theory, as this disease would have to meet several criteria: it has to be able to sustain itself in an environment with no [[host (biology)|hosts]]; it has to have a high [[infection rate]]; and be extremely lethal, with a [[mortality rate]] of 50–75%. Disease has to be very virulent to kill off all the individuals in a [[genus]] or [[species]], and even such a virulent disease as [[West Nile Virus]] is unlikely to have caused extinction.&lt;ref name="Lyons et al2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lyons|first=K.|last2=Smith|first2=F.

Rising levels of carbon dioxide are resulting in influx of this gas into the ocean, increasing its acidity. Marine organisms which possess [[seashell|calcium carbonate shells]] or [[exoskeleton]]s experience physiological pressure as the carbonate reacts with acid. For example, this is already resulting in [[coral bleaching]] on various [[coral reef]]s worldwide, which provide valuable habitat and maintain a high biodiversity.

The decline of amphibian populations has also been identified as an indicator of environmental degradation. As well as habitat loss, introduced predators and pollution, [[Chytridiomycosis]], a fungal infection thought to have been accidentally spread by human travel,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; has caused severe population drops of several species of frogs, including (among many others) the extinction of the [[golden toad]] in Costa Rica and the [[Gastric-brooding frog]] in Australia. Many other amphibian species now face extinction, including the reduction of [[Rabb's Fringe-limbed Treefrog|Rabb's fringe-limbed treefrog]] to an [[endling]], and the extinction of the [[Panamanian golden frog]] in the wild. Chytrid fungus has spread across Australia, New Zealand, Central America and Africa, including countries with high amphibian diversity such as [[cloud forest]]s in [[Honduras]] and [[Madagascar]]. ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans]]'' is a similar infection currently threatening [[salamander]]s.

Millions of bats in the US have been dying off since 2012 due to a fungal infection spread from European bats, which appear to be immune. Population drops have been as great as 90% within five years, and extinction of at least one bat species is predicted.

Some leading scientists have advocated for the global community to designate as protected areas 30 percent of the planet by 2030, and 50 percent by 2050, in order to mitigate the contemporary extinction crisis as the human population is projected to grow to 10 billion by the middle of the century.

In November 2018, the UN's biodiversity chief Cristiana Pașca Palmer urged people around the world to put pressure on governments to implement significant protections for wildlife by 2020, as rampant biodiversity loss is a "silent killer" as dangerous as [[global warming]], but has received little attention by comparison.

The '''Institute of Asian Research (IAR) Graduate Conference''' at the [[University of British Columbia]] is an annual graduate conference organized by the IAR Conference Committee, and co-hosted by the University's [[Institute of Asian Research]]. The symposium is a forum for interdisciplinary discussion on Asia Pacific policy-relevant issues, where students in all fields are encouraged to demonstrate the policy significance of their work. The IAR Conference Committee, under its collaboration with the College for Interdisciplinary Studies ([http://www.cfis.ubc.ca/ CFIS]) at UBC, publishes the proceedings of the conference in the ''Journal of the College for Interdisciplinary Studies'', as well as the possibility of publication in the Asia Pacific Memo.

== Mandate ==
The mandate of the symposium, as stated by its organizer (IAR Conference Committee), is "to promote academic awareness towards the salience of policy-relevant issues in the Asia Pacific and its surrounding regions. The IAR Conference Committee, backed by its belief of academic research as a necessary precursor to sound policy-making and the interdisciplinary nature of such, strives to create a community of understanding between students of Asia Pacific policy and makers of Asia Pacific policy by providing a dynamic forum for the exchange of ideas".[http://www.iar.ubc.ca/mapps/mappssaconference.aspx]

The '''''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''''' refers to two different revisions of a Bible encyclopedia. The first version was published under the general editorship of the [[fundamentalist]] [[James Orr (theologian)|James Orr (1844–1913)]], among other objectives to counteract the impact of [[higher criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;'' The religious bodies of America'' Frederick Emanuel Mayer, Arthur Carl Piepkorn – 1961 "5 ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' was published under the general editorship of James Orr (Chicago: Howard-Severance Co., 1915) to counteract the impact of higher criticism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The original encyclopedia was published by the Howard-Severance Co., Chicago, in 1915. It is in the public domain and can be found freely available at various sites. A revised version, edited by [[Geoffrey W. Bromiley]], was published by [[Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]] in 1989. It contains articles by nearly 200 [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] scholars about [[archaeological]] discoveries, the language and literature of Bible lands, customs, family life, occupations, and the historical and religious environments of Bible people.

== Reception ==
Writing in a 1984 book review for ''[[Churchman (journal)|The Churchman]]'', Stephen Motyer said the conservatism of the ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' "is that of broad, main-line [[evangelicalism]], although it seems to be slightly more conservative than the work it replaces". He also says it makes "dogmatic use of the Bible", and adds: "sometimes it seems to go over the top somewhat". However, he concludes "The criticisms I have made do not, to my mind, qualify the great solid worth of this production....I...seriously commend this encyclopedia..."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Motyer, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/churchman/098-01_062.pdf Book Reviews – ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributors ==
This list of contributors is taken from the Revised Edition. An asterisk (*) indicates that the person contributed an article to the 1915 edition that is still in the Revised Edition. New articles far outnumber older revised articles in the revised version. For some reason many contributors are listed more than once in the revised version. It is likely that the multiple listings is because of the scholar being at different institutions during the long process of revision. A scholar may have been employed at one school when they submitted one article in the beginning of the revision process and by the end they were employed at another school when they submitted their last article. The subject of the revision process and the rationale for retaining and updating some articles from the 1915 version is discussed in the preface and introduction of the revised version.

The book derived from his doctoral thesis, ''Numen, Old Men: Contemporary Masculine Spiritualities and the Problem of Patriarchy'' (Equinox Publishers, 2009) proposed that masculine spirituality tends to perpetuate a patriarchal spirituality, and that gay spirituality and queer theory can be a useful way to think about masculinities for all men, gay or straight. He has published extensively on how masculinity functions in contemporary society and, more specifically,  in contemporary religion. He proposes that by questioning the social construction of masculinity in the everyday it is possible to create a more equitable and sustainable society.

And that, ironically, may result in 2012 being a catalyst for a shift in human consciousness, exactly as the prophets predicted."&lt;ref name="token" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cometh" /&gt;

This is a list of women who engaged in war, found throughout [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], studied in fields such as [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[film studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[women's studies]]. A ''mythological'' figure does not always mean a ''fictional'' one, but rather, someone of whom stories have been told that have entered the cultural heritage of a people. Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of [[history]] (e.g. the [[Ancient Briton]] queen [[Boudica]], who led the [[Iceni]] into battle against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]). However, to be considered a warrior, the woman in question must have belonged to some sort of [[military]], be it recognized, like an organized [[army]], or unrecognized, like [[revolutionaries]].

==Pirates and seafarers==
*[[Anne Bonny]] and [[Mary Read]] sailed alongside [[Calico Jack]], Mary dressing as a man. Anne eventually became Jack's lover, and they had a child. In October 1720, their ship was attacked by a royal fleet. All but one of the male crew members, drunk and afraid, hid below deck as the two women fought on with the help of the unknown man. While imprisoned, Bonny is reported to have said of her doomed lover: "Sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have been hanged like a dog."&lt;ref&gt;^ Druett, Joan (2000). She Captains : Heroines and Hellions of the Sea. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Ching Shih]], legendary "Pirate Queen" of China, famous for commanding over 300 ships and an army of 20,000 to 40,000 pirates. She lived during the 18th and 19th centuries.
*[[Gráinne O'Malley]], legendary "Pirate Queen" of Ireland. She lived during the 16th century.
*[[Muirisc]], daughter of [[Úgaine Mór]] (Hugony the Great), the sixty-sixth high king of Ireland, c. 600 BC  to AD 500.

==Africa==

===Angola===
*[[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba]]  valiantly fought and held off [[Portugal|Portuguese]] control of present-day [[Angola]] for over thirty years during the early 17th century.

===Benin history===

* The [[Dahomey Amazons]] (or ''N'Nonmiton'', meaning ''our mothers'' in the [[Fon language]]), were a [[Fon people|Fon]] all-female military regiment in [[Dahomey]], an African kingdom (c. 1600–1894) located in the area of the present-day [[Republic of Benin]]. They were so named by Western observers and historians due to their similarity to the semi-mythical [[Amazons]] of ancient [[Anatolia]] and the [[Black Sea]].

===Berber history===
*[[Kahina]] or '''al-Kāhina''' ([[Classical Arabic]] for "female seer"; modern [[Maghreb Arabic]] '''l-Kahna''', commonly romanised as '''Kah(i)na''', also known as '''Dihya''' or '''Kahya''') was a 7th-century female [[Berber people|Berber]] religious and military leader, who led indigenous resistance to Arab expansion in [[Northwest Africa]], the region then known as [[Numidia]], known as the [[Maghreb]] today. She was born in the early 7th century and died around the end of the 7th century probably in modern-day [[Algeria]].

===Burkina Faso===
*[[Yennenga]] was a legendary warrior woman skilled in spear and bow, considered by the [[Mossi people]] as the mother of their empire.

===Ancient Egypt===

This Amazon is famous in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; some of the inhabitants dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in the centre of the floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go off the side of the wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appins.org/martin.htm "A Voyage to St. Kilda" in ''A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland''(1703)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313003106/http://www.appins.org/martin.htm |date=2007-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rashidun Caliphate===
[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar]] was the daughter of one of the chiefs of [[Bani Assad]] tribe, and her family embraced Islam in its first days. The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.

[[Nusaybah bint Ka’ab]], also known as [[Umm Ammarah]] (Ammarah's mother), a Hebrew woman by origin from the Banu Najjar tribe, was an early convert to Islam.

But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.

She is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war. Ashtoreth is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a foreign, non-Judahite goddess, the principal goddess of the homeland of the Phoenicians which is in modern-day [[Lebanon]], representing the productive power of nature.

He also wrote about the world's largest temple of Aphrodite, in one of the Phoenician cities.
*Tanit is a Phoenician lunar goddess, worshiped as the patron goddess at Carthage. Her shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia (Carthage) revealed an inscription that identified her for the first time in her homeland (Phoenicia of the Levant) and related her securely to the Phoenician goddess Astarte/Ashtart. In Egyptian, her name means Land of Neith, Neith being a war goddess. Long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit is still venerated in North Africa under the Latin name of Juno Caelestis, for her identification with the Roman goddess Juno. Hvidberg-Hansen (Danish professor of Semitic philology), notes that Tanit is sometimes depicted with a lion's head, showing her warrior quality. In modern times the name, with the spelling "Tanith", has been used as a female given name, both for real people and, more frequently, in occult fiction. From the 5th century BC  onwards, Tanit is associated with that of Ba`al Hammon. She is given the epithet pene baal ("face of Baal") and the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief).

===Hinduism===
*[[Durga]] ({{lang-sa|"the inaccessible"&lt;ref&gt;"Durga." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 25 February  2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9363243/Durga"&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}} or "the invincible",&lt;ref&gt;"Durga" Sanatan Society &lt;http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/durga.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-bn|দুর্গা}}) is a form of [[Devi]], the supreme [[goddess]] of [[Hinduism]]. According to the narrative from the [[Devi Mahatmya]] of the [[Markandeya Purana]], the form of Durga was created as a warrior goddess to fight a demon. The nine-day holiday dedicated to Durga, ''The [[Durga Puja]],'' is the biggest annual festival in [[Bengal]] and other parts of Eastern India and is celebrated by Hindus all over the world.
*[[Kālī]] ({{lang-sa|काली}}, {{IPA-sa|kɑːliː|IPA}}; {{lang-bn|কালী}}; {{lang-pa|ਕਾਲੀ}};  {{lang-si|කාලි}}; {{lang-te|కాళికాదేవి}}; {{lang-kn|ಕಾಳಿ ಮಾತಾ}}; {{lang-ta|காளி}}), also known as '''{{IAST|Kālikā}}''' ({{lang-sa|कालिका}}, {{lang-bn|কালিকা}}), is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[goddess]] associated with empowerment, [[shakti]]. The name Kali comes from ''kāla'', which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for [[Shiva]]. Kali means "the black one".  Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In Kāli's most famous myth, [[Durga]] and her assistants, the [[Matrikas]], wound the demon [[Raktabija]], in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him.  They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kinsley p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Durga, in need of help, summons Kāli to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess Kāli at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as ''Daksinakali''.
* Other warrior goddesses include [[Chamunda]] ("the killer of demon Chanda and Munda") and the goddess group [[Matrikas]] ("Mothers").
*[[Vishpala]] (in ''The [[Rigveda]]'') is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made. Afterwards, she returned to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpoc.org/library/1976_05_015.asp|title=A Brief Review of the History of Amputations and Prostheses Earl E.

== Career ==
Ludwig Blattner, also known as '''Louis Blattner''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2ba5e95a13 "Louis Blattner"], BFI, retrieved 8 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; was a pioneer of early magnetic sound recording, licensing a steel wire-based design from German inventor Dr. Kurt Stille, and enhancing it to use steel tape instead of wire, thereby creating an early form of [[tape recorder]]. This device was marketed as the Blattnerphone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/blattner.htm "Blattnerphone"], Orbem.co.uk, retrieved 25 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst on a promotional tour of his sound recording technology in 1928 he would choose ladies from the audience to dance with to music being played from a Blattnerphone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/24235/morton_david_l_199512_phd_438003.pdf.txt The History of Magnetic Recording in the United States, 1888–1978] David L.

Prior to the First World War, Blattner was involved in the entertainment industry in Merseyside: he managed the "La Scala" cinema in [[Wallasey]] from 1912 to 1914, conducted the cinema's orchestra, and composed a waltz "The Ladies of Wallasey".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofwallasey.co.uk/wallasey/Wallasey_Cinemas_Part_2/index.html History of Wallasey Cinemas Part 2] retrieved 7 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1920 he moved to Manchester where he managed a chain of cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hJc8afOZV0QC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=%22Ludwig+Blattner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0XLNUqbpDIy_sQTkqIHwDQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ludwig%20Blattner%22&amp;f=false The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History] Palgrave Macmillan, 15 March 2011, {{ISBN|9781403939104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1920s he bought the British film rights to [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]'s novel [[Jud Süß (Feuchtwanger novel)|Jew Süss]] although the film was not made until 1934 after Blattner sold on the rights&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQm8fuT5rnsC&amp;pg=PT218&amp;lpg=PT218&amp;dq=blattner+suss&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MF4BKwmzIR&amp;sig=ydvlAB8jey2AuyY-7rfgOzz9HVg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EB7UUoy5DNSQhQf3hoHwBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=blattner%20suss&amp;f=false Jew Suss: His Life and Afterlife in Legend, Literature and Film], – Google Books – by Susan Tegel, Continuum Publishing, London, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-6297-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Gaumont British]]. In early 1928 press reports appeared saying that Blattner was planning a 400-acre "Hollywood, England" complex with a hospital, 150 room hotel, aeroplane club and the largest collection of studios in the world, for which he was planning to spend between 2 million and 5 million pounds.&lt;ref&gt;[£5,000,000 ?

The best known films produced by his film company were [[A Knight in London]] in 1929 and [[My Lucky Star (1933 film)|My Lucky Star]] in 1933, which was co-directed by Blattner. Films produced by other companies at the Blattner Studios included [[Dorothy Gish]] and [[Charles Laughton]]'s first drama talkie [[Wolves (1930 film)|Wolves]] in 1930,&lt;ref name="imdb_0021558"&gt;{{IMDb title| id =0021558 | title = Wolves (1930) }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[The Tell-Tale Heart (1934 film)|1934 adaptation]] of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story [[The Tell-Tale Heart]],&lt;ref name="imdb_0149973"&gt;{{IMDb title| id = 0149973 | title = The Tell-Tale Heart (1934) }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rookery Nook (film)|Rookery Nook]] (1930) and [[A Lucky Sweep]] (1932).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-british-films-1927-1939.pdf British Films 1927 - 1939] Linda Wood, BFI National Library, London, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig Blattner was also involved in an early colour motion picture process: in about 1929 he bought the rights for the use outside the USA of a lenticular colour process called [[Keller-Dorian cinematography]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L_FhfTvzjygC&amp;pg=PA154 "Encyclopedia of Modern Jewish Culture"], edited by Glenda Abramson, -Google Books-, pub.

Ludwig Blattner originally intended the Blattnerphone to be used as a system of recording and playback for talking pictures,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1224952 The Blattnerphone: An Early Attempt to Introduce Magnetic Recording into the Film Industry], William Lafferty, Cinema Journal Vol. 22, No. 4 (Summer, 1983), pp. 18–37, pub. University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[BBC]] saw its potential to record and "timeshift" BBC radio programmes for use with the [[BBC World Service|BBC Empire Service]], and rented several Blattnerphones from 1930 onwards, one of which was used to record King George V's speech at the opening of the India Round Table Conference on 12 November 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EdIjgeedgRwC&amp;pg=PA54 Video Recording Technology: Its Impact on Media and Home Entertainment, Aaron Foisi Nmungwun – Google Books] pub.

For years the B.B.C 's programme officials have longed for a machine which would be useful on the one hand for recording outside events such as commentaries, speeches, etc., of which normally no record existed, and on the other for rehearsals, and in particular for enabling certain broadcasters to hear themselves as others hear them.}} In 1939 the BBC used a Blattnerphone (not the later Marconi-Stille recorder) to record Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s announcement to Britain of the outbreak of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/bbc-donation-national-media-museum.html "BBC donates historical collection to National Media Museum to mark 90th anniversary"], BBC Media Centre, retrieved 5 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mexican art''' consists of various [[visual arts]] that developed over the geographical area now known as Mexico. The development of these arts roughly follows the [[history of Mexico]], divided into the prehispanic [[Mesoamerica]]n era, the colonial period, with the period after [[Mexican War of Independence]] further subdivided. Mexican art is usually filled most of the time with intricate patterns.&lt;ref name="jflam"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexican Art Over Three Millennia |first=Jack |last=ver Flam |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=New York |date=October 9, 1990 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoamerican art is that produced in an area that encompasses much of what is now central and southern Mexico, before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] for a period of about 3,000 years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE. During this time, all influences on art production were indigenous, with art heavily tied to religion and the ruling class. There was little to no real distinction among art, architecture, and writing. The Spanish conquest led to 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, and art production remained tied to religion—most art was associated with the construction and decoration of churches, but secular art expanded in the eighteenth century, particularly [[casta]] paintings, portraiture, and history painting. Almost all art produced was in the European tradition, with late colonial-era artists trained at the [[Academy of San Carlos]], but indigenous elements remained, beginning a continuous balancing act between European and indigenous traditions.&lt;ref name="paz"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.301.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Independence, art remained heavily European in style, but indigenous themes appeared in major works as liberal Mexico sought to distinguish itself from its Spanish colonial past. This preference for indigenous elements continued into the first half of the 20th century, with the [[Mexican muralism|Social Realism or Mexican muralist movement]] led by artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]], who were commissioned by the post-[[Mexican Revolution]] government to create a visual narrative of Mexican history and culture.

The strength of this artistic movement was such that it affected newly invented technologies, such as still photography and cinema, and strongly promoted popular arts and crafts as part of Mexico's identity. Since the 1950s, Mexican art has broken away from the muralist style and has been more globalized, integrating elements from Asia, with Mexican artists and filmmakers having an effect on the global stage.

==Pre-Columbian art==

It is believed that the American continent's oldest rock art, 7500 years old, is found in a cave on the peninsula of Baja California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html Descubierta en una cueva de México la pintura rupestre más antigua de América / EL MUNDO&lt;!-- Título generado por un bot --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213061450/http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Hispanic art of Mexico belongs to a cultural region known as [[Mesoamerica]], which roughly corresponds to central Mexico on into [[Central America]],&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing three thousand years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE generally divided into three eras: Pre Classic, Classic and Post Classic.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dominant Mesoamerican culture was that of the [[Olmec]]s, which peaked around 1200 BCE. The Olmecs originated much of what is associated with Mesoamerica, such as [[Mesoamerican writing systems|hieroglyphic writing]], [[Mesoamerican calendars|calendar]], first advances in astronomy, monumental sculpture ([[Olmec colossal heads|Olmec heads]]) and [[jade]] work.&lt;ref name="pazp38"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were a forerunner of later cultures such as [[Teotihuacan]], north of Mexico City, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] in Oaxaca and the [[Mayan peoples|Mayas]] in southern Mexico, [[Belize]] and [[Guatemala]]. While empires rose and fell, the basic cultural underpinnings of the Mesoamerica stayed the same until the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]].&lt;ref name="pazp38"/&gt; These included cities centered on plazas, temples usually built on pyramid bases, [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s and a mostly common cosmology.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p4" /&gt;

While art forms such as cave paintings and rock etchings date from earlier, the known history of Mexican art begins with Mesoamerican art created by sedentary cultures that built cities, and often, dominions.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pazp38"/&gt; While the art of Mesoamerica is more varied and extends over more time than anywhere else in the Americas, artistic styles show a number of similarities.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p9"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike modern Western art, almost all Mesoamerican art was created to serve religious or political needs, rather than art for art's sake. It is strongly based on nature, the surrounding political reality and the gods.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p12" /&gt; [[Octavio Paz]] states that "Mesoamerican art is a logic of forms, lines, and volumes that is as the same time a cosmology." He goes on to state that this focus on space and time is highly distinct from European naturalism based on the representation of the human body. Even simple designs such as [[fretwork|stepped frets]] on buildings fall into this representation of space and time, life and the gods.&lt;ref name="pazp41"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tlatilco culture figurines.jpg|thumb|Female figurines from the [[Tlatilco culture]], 1250 to 800 BCE.]]
Art was expressed on a variety of mediums such as ceramics, [[amate]] paper and architecture.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p9" /&gt; Most of what is known of Mesoamerican art comes from works that cover stone buildings and pottery, mostly paintings and reliefs.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt; Ceramics date from the early the Mesoamerican period. They probably began as cooking and storage vessels but then were adapted to ritual and decorative uses. Ceramics were decorated by shaping, scratching, painting and different firing methods.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p12"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known purely artistic production were small ceramic figures that appeared in [[Tehuacán, Puebla|Tehuacán]] area around 1,500 BCE and spread to [[Veracruz]], the [[Valley of Mexico]], [[Guerrero]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Chiapas]] and the Pacific coast of Guatemala.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt; The earliest of these are mostly female figures, probably associated with fertility rites because of their often oversized hips and thighs, as well as a number with babies in arms or nursing. When male figures appear they are most often soldiers.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p56"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these ceramic figures, which would later include animals and other forms, remained an important art form for 2000 years. In the early Olmec period most were small but large-scale ceramic sculptures were produced as large as 55&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p2"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p6"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the middle pre-Classic, ceramic sculpture declined in the center of Mexico except in the [[Chupícuaro (archaeological site)|Chupícuaro]] region. In the Mayan areas, the art disappears in the late pre-Classic, to reappear in the Classic, mostly in the form of whistles and other musical instruments. In a few areas, such as parts of Veracruz, the creation of ceramic figures continued uninterrupted until the Spanish conquest, but as a handcraft, not a formal art.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p67"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Messico, maya, piatto da calakmul, 600-800 ca..JPG|thumb|Painted ceramic plate from [[Calakmul]], 600 to 800 AD.]]
Mesoamerican painting is found in various expressions—from murals, to the creation of [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]] and the painting of ceramic objects. Evidence of painting goes back at least to 1800&amp;nbsp;BCE and continues uninterrupted in one form or another until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p2"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may have occurred earlier, the earliest known cases of artistic painting of monumental buildings occur in the early Classic period with the Mayas at [[Uaxactun]] and [[Tikal]], and in [[Teotihuacan]] with walls painted in various colors.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;

Paints were made from animal, vegetable and mineral pigments and bases.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Most paintings focus one or more human figures, which may be realistic or stylized, masculine, feminine or asexual. They may be naked or richly attired, but the social status of each figure is indicated in some way. Scenes often depict war, sacrifice, the roles of the gods or the acts of nobles. However, some common scenes with common people have been found as well.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p5"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Other subjects included gods, symbols and animals.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4" /&gt; Mesoamerican painting was bi-dimensional with no efforts to create the illusion of depth. However, movement is often represented.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-ceramic sculpture in Mesoamerica began with the modification of animal bones, with the oldest known piece being an animal skull from [[Tequixquiac]] that dates between 10,000 and 8,000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p56" /&gt; Most Mesoamerican sculpture is of stone; while relief work on buildings is the most dominant, freestanding sculpture was done as well. Freestanding three-dimensional stone sculpture began with the Olmecs, with the most famous example being the [[Olmec#Colossal heads|giant Olmec stone heads]]. This disappeared for the rest of the Mesoamerican period in favor of relief work until the late post-Classic with the [[Aztec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CoyolxauhquiDisk cropped.JPG|thumb|A disk depicting the goddess [[Coyolxauhqui]], 14th to 16th century, at the [[Templo Mayor]] museum.]]
The majority of stonework during the Mesoamerican period is associated with monumental architecture that, along with mural painting, was considered an integral part of architecture rather than separate.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p15"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Monumental architecture began with the Olmecs in southern [[Veracruz]] and the coastal area of [[Tabasco]] in places such as San Lorenzo; large temples on pyramid bases can still be seen in sites such as Montenegro, [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]] and [[La Venta]]. This practice spread to the [[Oaxaca]] area and the [[Valley of Mexico]], appearing in cities such as [[Monte Albán]], [[Cuicuilco]] and [[Teotihuacan]].&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p18"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

These cities had a nucleus of one or more plazas, with temples, palaces and [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s. Alignment of these structures was based on the cardinal directions and astronomy for ceremonial purposes, such as focusing the sun's rays during the spring equinox on a sculpted or painted image. This was generally tied to calendar systems.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p2023"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.20-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Relief sculpture and/or painting were created as the structures were built. By the latter pre-Classic, almost all monumental structures in Mesoamerica had extensive relief work. Some of the best examples of this are Monte Albán, Teotihuacan and [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p5"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Hispanic reliefs are general lineal in design and low, medium and high reliefs can be found. While this technique is often favored for narrative scenes elsewhere in the world, Mesoamerican reliefs tend to focus on a single figure. The only time reliefs are used in the narrative sense is when several relief steles are placed together. The best relief work is from the Mayas, especially from [[Yaxchilan]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing and art were not distinct as they have been for European cultures. Writing was considered art and art was often covering in writing.&lt;ref name="pazp41" /&gt; The reason for this is that both sought to record history and the culture's interpretation of reality.(salvatvolp14) Manuscripts were written on paper or other book-like materials then bundled into [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]].&lt;ref name="eboone"&gt;Boone 2000, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of reading and writing was strictly designated to the highest priest classes, as this ability was a source of their power over society.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7" /&gt;

The [[Mesoamerican writing systems|pictograms or glyphs of this writing system]] were more formal and rigid than images found on murals and other art forms as they were considered mostly symbolic, representing formulas related to astronomical events, genealogy and historic events.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7" /&gt; Most surviving pre-Hispanic codices come from the late Mesoamerican period and early colonial period, as more of these escaped destruction over history. For this reason, more is known about the Aztec Empire than the Mayan cultures.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eboone" /&gt; Important [[Aztec codices]] include the [[Borgia Group]] of mainly religious works, some of which probably pre-date the conquest, the [[Codex Borbonicus]], [[Codex Mendoza]], and the late [[Florentine Codex]], which is in a European style but executed by Mexican artists, probably drawing on earlier material that is now lost.

==Colonial era, 1521–1821==

===The early colonial era and indigenous artists and influences===
{{See also|Aztec codices}}
[[File:AtriumCrossAcolman1.JPG|thumb|right|An atrium cross in [[Acolman]]. During the early period of evangelization, an enclosed open chapels for large congregations of neophytes saw the creation and placement of decorated, anthropomorphized stone crosses with Jesus at their center.]]
Since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Mexican art has been an ongoing and complex interaction between the traditions of Europe and native perspectives.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;

'''Church construction'''  After the conquest, Spaniards' first efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches, which needed indigenous labor for basic construction, but they Nahuas elaborated stonework exteriors and decorated church interiors. Indigenous craftsmen were taught European motifs, designs and techniques, but very early work, called ''tequitqui'' ([[Nahuatl]] for “vassal”), includes elements such as flattened faces and high-stiff relief.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p34"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mexorg"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicanarchitecture.org/glossary/index.php?detail=121 |author=Charlote Ekland |title= Mexican Colonial Architecture |publisher=Mexican Architecture |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish friars directing construction were not trained architects or engineers. They relied on indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches and other Christian structures, often in the same places as temples and shrines of the traditional religion. "Although some Indians complained about the burden such labor represented, most communities considered a large and impressive church to be a reflection of their town's importance and took justifiable pride in creating a sacred place for divine worship."&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Prentice Hall 2003, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that so many colonial-era churches have survived centuries it testament to their general good construction.

The first monasteries built in and around Mexico City, such as the [[Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl|monasteries on the slopes of Popocatepetl]], had [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Plateresque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] elements, or some combination. They were relatively undecorated, with building efforts going more towards high walls and fortress features to ward off attacks.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p17"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of more elaborate churches with large quantities of religious artwork would define much of the artistic output of the colonial period. Most of the production was related to the teaching and reinforcement of Church doctrine, just as in Europe. Religious art set the rationale for Spanish domination over the indigenous. Today, colonial-era structures and other works exist all over the country, with a concentration in the central highlands around [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p3"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huanitzin.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''[[Mass of St. Gregory]]'', feathers on wood panel, the oldest dated feather work with a Christian subject. Made by or for [[Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin|Diego Huanutzin]], nephew and son-in-law of [[Moctezuma II]] to present to [[Pope Paul III]], dated 1539]]
[[File:The Florentine Codex- Aztec Feather Painters VI.tiff|thumb|left|Feather work artists as depicted in the [[Florentine Codex]] (ca. 1576).]]
[[Mexican feather work|'''Feather work''']] was a highly valued skill of prehispanic central Mexico that continued into the early colonial era.  Spaniards were fascinated by this form of art, and indigenous feather workers (''amanteca'') produced religious images in this medium, mainly small "paintings", as well as religious vestments.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schrefler, "Visual Arts: Sixteenth Century" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1557.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Castello Yturbide, ''The Art of Featherwork in Mexico'', Mexico: Fomento Cultural Banamex 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indigenous writings'''  Indians continued production of written manuscripts in the early colonial era, especially [[Aztec codices|codices in the Nahua area]] of central Mexico.  An important early manuscript that was commissioned for the Spanish crown was [[Codex Mendoza]], named after the first viceroy of Mexico, Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], which shows the tribute delivered to the Aztec ruler from individual towns as well as descriptions of proper comportment for the common people. A far more elaborate project utilizing indigenous scribes illustration is the project resulting in the [[Florentine Codex]] directed by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]].  Other indigenous manuscripts in the colonial era include the [[Huexotzinco Codex]] and Codex Osuna.

An important type of manuscript from the early period were pictorial and textual histories of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs from the indigenous viewpoint.  The early [[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] illustrated the contributions the Spaniards' Tlaxcalan allies made to the defeat of the Aztec empire, as well the [[Hernán Cortés]] and his cultural translator Doña Marina ([[Malinche]]).

'''Painting''' Most Nahua artists producing this visual art are anonymous.  An exception is the work of Juan Gerson, who ca. 1560 decorated the vault of the Franciscan church in the Nahua town of Tecamachalco,(Puebla state), with individual scenes from the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Schrefler, "Visual Arts", p.1556.&lt;/ref&gt;

While colonial art remained almost completely European in style, with muted colors and no indication of movement—the addition of native elements, which began with the ''tequitqui,'' continued. They were never the center of the works, but decorative motifs and filler, such as native foliage, pineapples, corn, and [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]].&lt;ref name="jcummings"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1311-diego-frida-and-the-mexican-school |title= Diego, Frida And The Mexican School |first=Joe |last=Cummings |date= January 1, 1999 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this can be seen on portals as well as large frescoes that often decorated the interior of churches and the walls of monastery areas closed to the public.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253322 |title=Colonial Art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest of Mexico's colonial artists were Spanish-born who came to Mexico in the middle of their careers. This included mendicant friars, such as Fray Alonso López de Herrera. Later, most artists were born in Mexico, but trained in European techniques, often from imported engravings. This dependence on imported copies meant that Mexican works preserved styles after they had gone out of fashion in Europe.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt; In the colonial period, artists worked in guilds, not independently. Each guild had its own rules, precepts, and mandates in technique—which did not encourage innovation.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p10"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican Baroque===

[[File:Eternal father painting guadalupe.jpg|right|thumb|18th-century painting of [[God the Father]] fashioning the image of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]]]
Baroque painting became firmly established in Mexico by the middle of the 17th century with the work of Spaniard Sebastián López de Arteaga. His painting is exemplified by the canvas called ''Doubting Thomas'' from 1643. In this work, the [[Apostle Thomas]] is shown inserting his finger in the wound in Christ's side to emphasize Christ's suffering. The caption below reads "the Word made flesh" and is an example of Baroque's didactic purpose.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

One difference between painters in Mexico and their European counterparts is that they preferred realistic directness and clarity over fantastic colors, elongated proportions and extreme spatial relationships. The goal was to create a realistic scene in which the viewer could imagine himself a part of. This was a style created by [[Caravaggio]] in Italy, which became popular with artists in [[Seville]], from which many migrants came to New Spain came.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Similarly, Baroque free standing sculptures feature life-size scales, realistic skin tones and the simulation of gold-threaded garments through a technique called ''estofado'', the application of paint over gold leaf.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

The most important later influence to Mexican and other painters in Latin America was the work of Flemish artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]], known through copies made from engravings and [[mezzotint]] techniques. His paintings were copied and reworked and became the standard for both religious and secular art.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Later Baroque paintings moved from the confines of altarpieces to colossal freestanding canvases on church interiors. One of the best known Mexican painters of this kind of work was [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]]. His work can be seen in the [[sacristy]] of the Mexico City Cathedral, which was done between 1684 and 1686. These canvases were glued directly onto the walls with arched frames to stabilize them, and placed just under the vaults of the ceiling. Even the fresco work of the 16th century was not usually this large.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Another one of Villalpando's works is the cupola of the [[Puebla Cathedral]] in 1688. He used Rubens’ brush techniques and the shape of the structure to create a composition of clouds with angels and saints, from which a dove descends to represent the Holy Spirit. The light from the cupola's windows is meant to symbolize God's grace.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; [[Juan Rodríguez Juárez]] (1675–1728) and mulatto artist [[Juan Correa]] (1646–1716) were also prominent painters of the baroque era. Correa's most famous student, [[José de Ibarra]] (1685–1756) was also mixed-race. One of Mexico's finest painters, [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] (1695–1768), was possibly mixed race.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, "Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700–85" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550–1820'', Luisa Elena Alcalá and Jonathan Brown, eds. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church produced the most important works of the seventeenth century. Among the important painters were [[Baltasar de Echave Ibia]] and his son Baltasar Echave Rioja, also [[Luis Juárez (painter)|Luis Juárez]] and his son [[José Juárez]], [[Juan Correa]], [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], Rodrigo de la Piedra, Antonio de Santander, Polo Bernardino, Juan de Villalobos, Juan Salguero and Juan de Herrera. Juan Correa, worked from 1671 to 1716 and reached great prestige and reputation for the quality of its design and scale of some of his works. Among the best known: 'Apocalypse in the Cathedral of Mexico', 'Conversion of St. Mary Magdalene', now in the 'Pinacoteca Virreinal' and 'Santa Catarina and Adam and Eve casting out of paradise', the latter located in the [[Museo Nacional del Virreinato|National Museum of Viceroyalty]] of [[Tepotzotlán]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1541-Arte-y-cultura-en-la-colonia Arte y cultura en la colonia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013144844/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1541-Arte-y-cultura-en-la-colonia |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial religious art was sponsored by Church authorities and private patrons. Sponsoring the rich ornamentation of churches was a way for the wealthy to gain prestige.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p3" /&gt; In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Mexico City was one of the wealthiest in the world, mostly due to mining and agriculture, and was able to support a large art scene.&lt;ref name="dwarren"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=David B. |date=April 2002 |title=The Magazine Antiques |journal=Art Journal |volume=161 |issue=4 |pages=120–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical and Secular Art===

While most commissioned art was for churches, secular works were commissioned as well. Portrait painting was known relatively early in the colonial period, mostly of viceroys and archbishops. Beginning in the late Baroque period, portrait painting of local nobility became a significant genre. Two notable painters of this type are brothers Nicolás and Juan Rodríguez Juárez. These works followed European models, with symbols of rank and titles either displayed unattached in the outer portions or worked into another element of the paintings such as curtains.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

Another type of secular colonial painting is called [[casta]] paintings referring to the depiction of racial hierarchy racially in eighteenth-century [[New Spain]]. Some were likely commissioned by Spanish functionaries as souvenirs of Mexico. A number of artists of the era created casta paintings, including [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], [[José de Ibarra]], [[Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz]], [[Francisco Clapera]], and [[Luis de Mena]], but most casta paintings are unsigned. Ibarra, Morlete, and possibly Cabrera were of mixed race and born outside Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, "Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700-85" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550–1820'', Luisa Elena Alcalá and Jonathan Brown. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mena's only known casta painting links the Virgin of Guadalupe and the casta system, as well as depictions of fruits and vegetables and scenes of everyday life in mideighteenth-century Mexico. It is one of the most-reproduced examples of casta paintings, one of the small number that show the casta system on a single canvas rather than up to 16 separate paintings. It is unique in uniting the thoroughly secular genre of casta painting with a depiction of the Virgin of Guadalupe.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Cline, "Guadalupe and the Castas: The Power of a Singular Colonial Mexican Painting", ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 31, Issue 2, Summer 2015, pages 218–246.&lt;/ref&gt; Production of these paintings stopped after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], when legal racial categories were repudiated in independent Mexico. Until the run-up to the 500th anniversary of the Columbus's 1492 voyage, casta paintings were of little or no interest, even to art historians, but scholars began systematically studying them as a genre.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Guadalupe and the Castas", p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;María Concepción García Sáiz, ''Las castas mexicanas: un g´enero pictórico americano''. Milan: Olivetti, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew. ''Casta Paintings: Images of Race in Eighteenth-Century Mexico''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico was a crossroads of trade in the colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those natively produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain.&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; It was popular among the upper classes to have a main public room, called a ''salon de estrado'', to be covered in rugs and cushions for women to recline in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and settees were added for men. Folding screens were introduced from Japan, with Mexican-style ones produced called ''biombos'' The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes. One example of this is a screen with the conquest of Mexico one side and an aerial view of Mexico City on the other at the [[Franz Mayer Museum]].&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt;

The Crown promoted the establishment in Mexico of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style of art and architecture, which had become popular in Spain. This style was a reinterpretation of Greco-Roman references and its use was a way to reinforce European dominance in the Spain's colonies. One Neoclassical artist from the Academy at the end of the colonial period was [[Manuel Tolsá]]. He first taught sculpture at the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and then became its second director. Tolsá designed a number of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical buildings]] in Mexico but his best known work is an equestrian status of King Charles IV in bronze cast in 1803 and originally placed in the [[Zócalo]]. As of 2011 it can be seen at the [[Museo Nacional de Arte]].&lt;ref name="statesponsored" /&gt;

Along with the construction of temples and houses artistic religious themes proliferated. In New Spain, as in the rest of the [[New World]], since the seventeenth century, particularly during the eighteenth century, the portrait became an important part of the artistic repertoire. In a society characterized by a deep religious feeling which was imbued, it was expected that many portraits reflected the moral virtues and piety of the model.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145806/http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here he shows a Spanish (español) father, Mestiza (mixed Spanish-Indian) mother, and their Castiza daughter.]]

Some prominent painters of this period are: [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], [[Juan Correa (1646–1716)|Juan Correa]], [[José de Ibarra]], Joseph Mora, Nicolas Rodriguez Juarez, Francisco Martinez, [[Miguel Cabrera]], Andrés López and Nicolás Enríquez. Sebastian Zalcedo painted ca. 1780 a beautiful allegory of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe (Mexico)|Virgin of Guadalupe]] in oil on copper foil. In this century Josep Antonio de Ayala was a prominent artist, who is known for painting ''[[La familia del Valle a los pies de la Virgen de Loreto (Josep Antonio de Ayala)|The family of the Valley at the foot of Our Lady of Loreto]]'' c. 1769. This devotional painting was commissioned to be done for the children of the del Valle family in memory of his parents and is characteristic of the painting of this century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seis Siglos de Arte, Cien Grandes Maestros de Romero|editor-last=de Romero|editor-first=Soumaya Slim|editor-first2=Minerva Mogollan|editor-last2=Garcia|editor-first3=Eva Maria|editor-last3=Ayala Canseco|publisher=Fundacion Carso / Museo Soumaya|year=2006|isbn=9789687794303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of colonial art says: ''"In the "Sponsorship of [[Saint Joseph]] on the Caroline College", [[Saint Joseph]] is seen as a major figure of the work, who carries on his left side the child [[Jesus]]. Two archangels flank him and maintain its long purple robe. At the top two little angels are observed with intent to crown the holy". "For centuries, the work was attributed to [[Manuel Caro]], but the meticulous restoration work allowed to find the signature of the original author. Miguel Cabrera"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comunicacion.buap.mx/bol_mar08/boletin-d-13mar.html |title=Puebla, Pue. México, Jueves 13 de Marzo de 2008 |website=Comunicacion.buap.mx |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, artists increasingly included the Latin phrase ''[[pinxit]] Mexici'' (painted in Mexico) on works bound for the European market as a sign of pride in their artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Painted in Mexico, 1700–1790: Pinxit Mexici |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/pinxit-mexici |website=www.metmuseum.org |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |quote=This expression eloquently encapsulates the painters' pride in their own tradition and their connection to larger, transatlantic trends.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Academy of San Carlos===
[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Manuel Tolsá - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Manuel Tolsá]], director of the [[Academy of San Carlos]] by [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]], director of painting at the Academy]]
The last colonial era art institution established was the [[Academy of San Carlos]] in 1783.&lt;ref name="statesponsored"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253329 |title=State sponsored art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the depiction of saints consumed most artistic efforts, they were not without political effects. The most important of these was the rise of the cult of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] as an American rather than European saint, representative of a distinct identity.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p13"&gt;Rosas, 1982, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 18th century, Spain's colonies were becoming culturally independent from Spain, including its arts. The Academy was established by the [[Spanish Crown]] to regain control of artistic expression and the messages it disseminated. This school was staffed by Spanish artists in each of the major disciplines, with the first director being Antonio Gil.&lt;ref name="statesponsored" /&gt; The school became home to a number of plaster casts of classic statues from the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|San Fernando Fine Arts Academy]] in Spain, brought there for teaching purposes. These casts are on display in the Academy's central patio.&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last=Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=70–72 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy of San Carlos survived into post-independence Mexico.

==Independence to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, 1821–1911==

===Early Post-independence era the Mid Nineteenth Century===

[[File:Valle de México José Maria Velazco 3.jpg|thumb|[[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]], El Valle de México.]]

Artists of the independence era in Mexico (1810–21) produced works showing the insurgency's heroes. A portrait of secular cleric [[José María Morelos]] in his military uniform was painted by an unknown artist. The portrait is typical of those from the late eighteenth century, with framing elements, a formal caption, and new elements being iconography of the emerging Mexican nationalism, including the eagle atop the nopal cactus, which became the central image for the Mexican flag.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''Mexican Art and Architecture''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson 2013, pp. 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt; Morelos was the subject of a commissioned statue, with [[Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque]], who trained at the Academy of San Carlos and remained an important sculptor through the era of era independence.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''Art and Architecture in Mexico''. London: Thames and Hudson 2013, pp. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of San Carlos remained the center of academic painting and the most prestigious art institution in Mexico until the [[Mexican War of Independence]], during which it was closed.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/ |title= Academia de San Carlos |language= Spanish |accessdate= November 30, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090409140215/http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/ |archivedate= April 9, 2009 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its association with the Spanish Crown and European painting tradition, the Academy was reopened by the new government after Mexico gained full independence in 1821. Its former Spanish faculty and students either died during the war or returned to Spain, but when it reopened it attracted the best art students of the country, and continued to emphasize classical European traditions until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neoclassbrit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253332 |title=Neoclassicism |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academy was renamed to the National Academy of San Carlos. The new government continued to favor Neoclassical as it considered the Baroque a symbol of colonialism. The Neoclassical style continued in favor through the reign of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] although President [[Benito Juárez]] supported it only reluctantly, considering its European focus a vestige of colonialism.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;

Despite Neoclassicism's association with European domination, it remained favored by the Mexican government after Independence and was used in major government commissions at the end of the century. However, indigenous themes appeared in paintings and sculptures. One indigenous figure depicted in Neoclassical style is Tlahuicol, done by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] artist Manuel Vilar in 1851. In 1887, [[Porfirio Díaz]] commissioned the statue of the last Aztec emperor, [[Cuauhtémoc]], which can be seen on [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. Cuauhtémoc is depicted with a toga-like cloak with a feathered headdress similar to an Etruscan or Trojan warrior rather than an Aztec emperor. The base has elements reminiscent of Mitla and Roman architecture. This base contains bronze plates depicting scenes from the Spanish conquest, but focusing on the indigenous figures.&lt;ref name="neoclassbrit" /&gt;

There were two reasons for this shift in preferred subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture—the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican.&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; The other factor was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.&lt;ref name="pazp2"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 19th century, the Romantic style of painting was introduced into Mexico and the rest of Latin America by foreign travelers interested in the newly independent country. One of these was [[Bavaria]]n artist [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]], who lived in the country from 1831 to 1834. He painted scenes with dynamic composition and bright colors in accordance with Romantic style, looking for striking, sublime, and beautiful images in Mexico as well as other areas of Latin America. However much of Rugendas's works are sketches for major canvases, many of which were never executed. Others include Englishman [[Daniel Egerton]], who painted landscapes in the British Romantic tradition, and German [[Carl Nebel]], who primarily created [[lithograph]]s of the various social and ethnic populations of the country.&lt;ref name="foreigntravel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253334 |title=Foreign Travelers |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:VelorioJaraDF.JPG|thumb|right|''El Velorio'' by [[José María Jara]] 1889]]
A number of native-born artists at the time followed the European Romantic painters in their desire to document the various cultures of Mexico. These painters were called ''[[Costumbrismo|costumbristas]]'', a word deriving from ''costumbre'' (custom). The styles of these painters were not always strictly Romantic, involving other styles as well. Most of these painters were from the upper classes and educated in Europe. While the European painters viewed subjects as exotic, the costumbristas had a more nationalistic sense of their home countries. One of these painters was [[Agustín Arrieta]] from Puebla, who applied realistic techniques to scenes from his home city, capturing its brightly painted tiles and ceramics. His scenes often involved everyday life such as women working in kitchen and depicted black and Afro-Mexican vendors.&lt;ref name="costumbristas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253335 |title=Costumbristas |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Nineteenth Century to the Revolution===
[[File:NezahualcoyotlGardenTADF.JPG|thumb|180px|A bronze casting (1888–1889) of [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], by [[Jesús F. Contreras]] at the Garden of the Triple Alliance, Filomeno Mata street, historical center of Mexico City.]]
[[File:SceneTortureCuautemocMonumentDF.jpg|thumb|[[Cuauhtemoc]]'s torture on a monument to him on the Paseo de la Reforma, by [[Gabriel Guerra]] (1847–1893).]]
In the mid-to late 19th century Latin American academies began to shift away from severe Neoclassicism to “academic realism”. Idealized and simplified depictions became more realistic, with emphasis on details. Scenes in this style were most often portraits of the upper classes, Biblical scenes, and battles—especially those from the Independence period. When the Academy of San Carlos was reopened after a short closure in 1843, its new Spanish and Italian faculty pushed this realist style. Despite government support and nationalist themes, native artists were generally shorted in favor of Europeans.&lt;ref name="realismbrit" /&gt;

One of the most important painters in Mexico in the mid 19th century was Catalan [[Pelegrí Clavé]], who painted landscapes but was best known for his depictions of the intellectual elite of Mexico City. Realist painters also attempted to portray Aztec culture and people by depicting settings inhabited by indigenous people, using live indigenous models and costumes based on those in Conquest era codices. One of these was [[Félix Parra]], whose depictions of the conquest empathized with the suffering of the indigenous. In 1869, José Obregón painted ''The Discovery of Pulque''; he based his depictions of architecture on [[Mixtec]] codices, but misrepresented temples as a setting for a throne.&lt;ref name="realismbrit"&gt;dead link {{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253336 |title=Realism |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of the 19th century after Independence is considered to have declined, especially during the late 19th century and early 20th, during the regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1876–1911).  Although during this time, painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts were often limited to imitation of European styles,&lt;ref name="tburton"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title= Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art |first=Tony |last=Burton |date= March 14, 2008 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the emergence of young artists, such as [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Saturnino Herrán]], increased the focus on Mexican-themed works. This meant that following the military phase of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the 1920s, Mexican artists made huge strides is forging a robust artistic nationalism.

In this century there are examples of murals such as folkloric style created between 1855 and 1867 in La Barca, Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/semanario/index.php?id_nota=02042008173408 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030053129/http://www.arts-history.mx/semanario/index.php?id_nota=02042008173408 |archivedate=2014-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlights at this time: Pelegrín Clavé, [[Juan Cordero]], Felipe Santiago Gutiérrez and José Agustín Arrieta.
In Mexico, in 1846 he was hired to direct Pelegrín Clavé's reopening of the Academy of San Carlos, a body from which he promoted the historical and landscaping themes with a pro-European vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/cercadetuarte/pintura.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015220757/http://www.geocities.com/cercadetuarte/pintura.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-15 |title=Pintura |website=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of San Carlos continued to advocate classic, European-style training until 1913. In this year, the academy was partially integrated with [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM). Between 1929 and the 1950s, the academy’s architecture program was split off as a department of the university; the programs in painting, sculpture, and engraving were renamed the National School of Expressive Arts, now the [[Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas "Rafael Rodríguez Padilla"|Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas]] (ENAP). Both moved to the south of the city in the mid-20th century, to [[Ciudad Universitaria]] and [[Xochimilco]] respectively, leaving only some graduate programs in fine arts in the original academy building in the [[historic center of Mexico City|historic center]]. ENAP remains one of the main centers for the training of Mexico’s artists.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;

===Mexican muralism and Revolutionary art===
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 6 063.jpg|thumb|Detail of mural "Gente y paisaje de Michoacán" at the Palacio de Gobierno in [[Michoacán]] (1962)]]
{{Further|Mexican muralism}}

While a shift to more indigenous and Mexican themes appeared in the 19th century, the [[Mexican Revolution]] from 1910 to 1920 had a dramatic effect on Mexican art.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arquitectuba" /&gt; The conflict resulted in the rise of the Partido Revolucionario Nacional (renamed the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]]), which took the country in a socialist direction. The government became an ally to many of the intellectuals and artists in Mexico City&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; and commissioned murals for public buildings to reinforce its political messages including those that emphasized Mexican rather than European themes. These were not created for popular or commercial tastes; however, they gained recognition not only in Mexico, but in the United States.&lt;ref name="pazp24"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This production of art in conjunction with government propaganda is known as the Mexican Modernist School or the Mexican Muralist Movement, and it redefined art in Mexico.&lt;ref name="pazp298299"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.298-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavio Paz gives [[José Vasconcelos]] credit for initiating the Muralist movement in Mexico by commissioning the best-known painters in 1921 to decorate the walls of public buildings. The commissions were politically motivated—they aimed to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and redefine the Mexican people vis-à-vis their indigenous and Spanish past.&lt;ref name="pazp11"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these commissioned paintings were at [[San Ildefonso College|San Ildefonso]] done by Fernando Leal, [[Fermín Revueltas]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[Diego Rivera]]. The first true fresco in the building was the work of [[Jean Charlot]]. However, technical errors were made in the construction of these murals: a number of them began to blister and were covered in wax for preservation.&lt;ref name="pazp12"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberto Montenegro]] painted the [[San Pedro y San Pablo College (Museum of Light)|former church and monastery of San Pedro y San Pablo]], but the mural in the church was painted in [[tempera]] and began to flake. In the monastery area, Montenegro painted the ''Feast of the Holy Cross,'' which depicts Vasconcelos as the protector of Muralists. Vasconcelos was later blanked out and a figure of a woman was painted over him.&lt;ref name="pazp1213"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first protagonist in the production of modern murals in Mexico was [[Dr. Atl]]. Dr Atl was born “Gerard Murillo” in [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]] in 1875. He changed his name in order to identify himself as Mexican. Atl worked to promote [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexico's folk art and handcrafts]]. While he had some success as a painter in Guadalajara, his radical ideas against academia and the government prompted him to move to more liberal Mexico City. In 1910, months before the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]], Atl painted the first modern mural in Mexico. He taught major artists to follow him, including those who came to dominate Mexican mural painting.&lt;ref name="tburton" /&gt;

The muralist movement reached its height in the 1930s with four main protagonists: [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and Fernando Leal. It is the most studied part of Mexico's art history.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alee"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Anthony |date=Spring 1999 |title= Mexican murals and their meaning |journal=Art Journal |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; All were artists trained in classical European techniques and many of their early works are imitations of then-fashionable European paintings styles, some of which were adapted to Mexican themes.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pazp298299" /&gt; The political situation in Mexico from the 1920s to 1950s and the influence of Dr. Atl prompted these artists to break with European traditions, using bold indigenous images, lots of color, and depictions of human activity, especially of the masses, in contrast to the solemn and detached art of Europe.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;

Preferred mediums generally excluded traditional canvases and church porticos and instead were the large, then-undecorated walls of Mexico's government buildings. The main goal in many of these paintings was the glorification of Mexico's pre-Hispanic past as a definition of Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; They had success in both Mexico and the United States, which brought them fame and wealth as well as Mexican and American students.&lt;ref name="pazp24" /&gt;

These muralists revived the fresco technique for their mural work, although Siqueiros moved to industrial techniques and materials such as the application of [[pyroxilin]], a commercial enamel used for airplanes and automobiles.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; One of Rivera's earliest mural efforts emblazoned the courtyard of the Ministry of Education with a series of dancing tehuanas (natives of [[Tehuantepec]] in southern Mexico). This four-year project went on to incorporate other contemporary indigenous themes, and it eventually encompassed 124 frescoes that extended three stories high and two city blocks long.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; The [[Abelardo L. Rodriguez Market, Mexico City|Abelardo Rodriguez Market]] was painted in 1933 by students of Diego Rivera, one of whom was [[Isamu Noguchi]].&lt;ref name="pazp16"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure of this time period was [[Frida Kahlo]], the wife of Diego Rivera. While she painted canvases instead of murals, she is still considered part of the Mexican Modernist School as her work emphasized Mexican folk culture and colors.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dgoddard"&gt;{{cite news |title= enfoque ; Artistic update ; Mexican art featured at Blue Star and the Instituto de Mexico |first= Dan R. |last= Goddard |newspaper=Conexion |location=San Antonio, Texas |date=May 20, 2004 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's self-portraits during the 1930s and 40s were in stark contrast to the lavish murals artists like her husband were creating at the time. Having suffered a crippling bus accident earlier in her teenage life, she began to challenge Mexico's obsession with the female body. Her portraits, purposefully small, addressed a wide range of topics not being addressed by the mainstream art world at the time. These included motherhood, domestic violence, and male egoism. 

Her paintings never had subjects wearing lavish jewelry or fancy clothes like those found in muralist paintings. Instead, she would sparsely dress herself up, and when there were accessories, it added that much more importance to them. She would also depict herself in very surreal, unsettling scenarios like in ''[[The Two Fridas]]'' where she depicts two versions of herself, one with a broken heart and one with a healthy infusing the broken heart with “hopeful” blood., or Henry Ford Hospital where she depicts herself in having an abortion and the struggle she had in real life coming to terms with it.

Although she was the wife of Diego Rivera, her self-portraits stayed rather obscured from the public eye until well after her passing in 1954.  Her art has grown in popularity and she is seen by many to be one of the earliest and most influential feminist artists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meade |first=Teresa |title=The History of Modern Latin America |year=2016 |pages=192-193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selling Mexican art abroad===
Despite maintaining an active national art scene, Mexican artists after the muralist period had a difficult time breaking into the international art market. One reason for this is that in the Americas, Mexico City was replaced by New York as the center of the art community, especially for patronage.&lt;ref name="pazp25"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Mexico, government sponsorship of art in the 20th century (dominated until 2000 by the PRI party) meant religious themes and criticism of the government were effectively censored. This was mostly passive, with the government giving grants to artists who conformed to their requirements.&lt;ref name="rgallop11" /&gt;

===Other Artistic Expressions 1920–1950===
[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|300px|''Mexico de Hoy'' by Rufino Tamayo on the first floor of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]]]
The first to break with the nationalistic and political tone of the muralist movement was [[Rufino Tamayo]]. For this reason he was first appreciated outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="pazp2425"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamayo was a contemporary to Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco, and trained at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes. Like them he explored Mexican identity in his work after the Mexican Revolution. However, he rejected the political Social Realism popularized by the three other artists and was rejected by the new establishment.&lt;ref name="miami" /&gt;

He left for New York in 1926 where success allowed him to exhibit in his native Mexico. His lack of support for the post-Revolutionary government was controversial. Because of this he mostly remained in New York, continuing with his success there and later in Europe. His rivalry with the main three Mexican muralists continued both in Mexico and internationally through the 1950s. Even a belated honorific of “The Fourth Great One” was controversial.&lt;ref name="miami"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexican Master |author= Carlos Suarez De Jesus |url= http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2007-07-05/culture/mexican-master/full |newspaper=Miami New Times |location=Miami |date=July 5, 2007 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, [[Wolfgang Paalen]] published the extremely influential ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'' magazine in Mexico City, which focussed on a transitional movement between surrealism to abstract expressionism.

In 1953, [[Museo Experimental El Eco]] (in Mexico City) opened; it was created by [[Mathias Goeritz]].

===The Rupture Movement===
{{Further|Generación de la Ruptura}}

[[File:Murayl y tempusfugit.jpg|thumb|160px|A mural and clock sculpture by [[Manuel Felguerez]] at [[Universidad La Salle]], Campus central.]]
The first major movement after the muralists was the [[Generación de la Ruptura|Rupture Movement]], which began in the 1950s and 1960s with painters such as [[José Luis Cuevas]], Gilberto Navarro, [[Rafael Coronel]], Alfredo Casaneda, and sculptor [[Juan Soriano]]. They rejected social realism and nationalism and incorporated surrealism, visual paradoxes, and elements of Old World painting styles.&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rfajardo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fajardo |first=Renee |date=September 10, 2003 |title= Miradas Del Arte Mexicano; A modern perspective on contemporary Mexican art |journal=La Voz Bilinguë |page=25 |location=Denver, Colorado }}&lt;/ref&gt; This break meant that later Mexican artists were generally not influenced by muralism or by Mexican folk art.&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt;

José Luis Cuevas created self-portraits in which he reconstructed scenes from famous paintings by Spanish artists such as [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Francisco de Goya]], and [[Picasso]]. Like Kahlo before him, he drew himself but instead of being centered, his image is often to the side, as an observer. The goal was to emphasize the transformation of received visual culture.&lt;ref name="trends1950"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253344 |title=Trends 1950–1970 |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure during this time period was Swiss-Mexican [[Gunther Gerzso]], but his work was a “hard-edged variant”{{cite quote|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--Is this is a quotation from a critic, or "scare-quotes"?--&gt; of Abstract Expressionism, based on clearly defined geometric forms as well as colors, with an effect that makes them look like low relief. His work was a mix of European abstraction and Latin American influences, including Mesoamerican ones.&lt;ref name="trends1950" /&gt;&lt;ref name="violencia"&gt;{{cite news |title= Opinion invitada/ Gunther Gerzso/Gunther Gerzso: una violencia metaforica |first=Cuauhtemoc |last=Medina |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=April 3, 2000 |page=9 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Invited opinion/Gunther Gerzo:metaphoric violence }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[watercolor]] field we can distinguish [[Edgardo Coghlan]] and [[Ignacio Barrios]] who were not aligned to a specific artistic movement but were not less important.

===The Olympics in Mexico City (1968); later===
"Designed by [[Mathias Goeritz]], a series of sculptures ... [lined] the "Route of Friendship" ([[Ruta de la Amistad]]) in celebration of the Olympics ... In contestation to the government-sanctioned artistic exhibition for the Olympics, a group of diverse, independent visual artists organize a counterpresentation entitled ''[[Salón Independiente]]'', or ''Independent Salon''; the exhibition signifies a key event in the resistance by artists of state-controlled cultural policies. This show of antigovernment efforts by artists would also be expressed in a mural in support of student movement's protests; the work became known as the ''Mural Efímero'' (or ''Ephemeral Mural'')" at [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]]".&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXV"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M. Saragoza, Editors|title=Mexico Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: Volume One|date=2012|isbn=978-0-313-34948-5|page=XXV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Independent Salon was staged in 1970. In 1976 "[[Fernando Gambao]] spearheads the organization of an exposition of abstract art entitled ''El Geometrismo Mexicano Una Tendencia Actual''".&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXVI"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M.

"In an attempt to reassess ... post-1968 Mexican art, the Museum of Science and Art at UNAM" organized in 2007, the exhibition ''La Era de la Discrepancia. Arte y cultura visual en México 1968-1997''
&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXXIII"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M. Saragoza, Editors|title=Mexico Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: Volume One|date=2012|isbn=978-0-313-34948-5|page=XXXIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 the exhibition ''Mexico: Esplendor de Treinta Siglos'', started its world tour at [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

===Neo-expressionism===
From the 1960s to the 1980s [[Neo-expressionist]] art was represented in Mexico by [[Manuel Felguerez]], Teresa Cito, Alejandro Pinatado, and [[Jan Hendrix]].&lt;ref name="rfajardo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huella"&gt;{{cite news |title= Manuel Felguerez: La huella de su arte |first=Leticia |last=Sanchez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=July 11, 1997 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Felguerez:The mark of his art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss-German artist, [[Mathias Goeritz]], in the 1950s created public sculptures including the ''Torres Satélite'' in [[Ciudad Satélite]]. In the 1960s, he became central to the development of abstract and other modern art along with [[José Luis Cuevas]] and [[Pedro Friedeberg]].&lt;ref name="rogallery"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rogallery.com/Goeritz_Mathias/goeritz-biography.html |title= Mathias Goeritz, German-Mexican (1915–1990) |publisher= RO Gallery |location=Mexico City |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neomexicanismo===
In the mid-1980s, the next major movement in Mexico was Neomexicanismo, a slightly surreal, somewhat kitsch and postmodern version of Social Realism that focused on popular culture rather than history.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; The name ''neomexicanismo'' was originally used by critics to belittle the movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Works were not necessarily murals: they used other mediums such as collage and often parodied and allegorized cultural icons, mass media, religion, and other aspects of Mexican culture. This generation of artists were interested in traditional Mexican values and exploring their roots—often questioning or subverting them. Another common theme was Mexican culture vis-à-vis globalization.&lt;ref name="artmod"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mam.org.mx/exposiciones/actuales/376-ineomexicanismos-ficciones-identitarias-en-el-mexico-de-los-ochenta |title=¿Neomexicanismos?

===Postmodern===
Art from the 1990s to the present is roughly categorized as Postmodern, although this term has been used to describe works created before the 1990s. Major artists associated with this label include [[Betsabeé Romero]],&lt;ref name="nunes"&gt;{{cite news |title= ART IN REVIEW; Betsabee Romero |first=Ken |last=Johnson |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/28/arts/art-in-review-betsabee-romero.html |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York |date=July 28, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monica Castillo]], [[Francisco Larios]],&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt; Martha Chapa and Diego Toledo.&lt;ref name="rfajardo" /&gt;

The success of Mexican artists is demonstrated by their inclusion in galleries in New York, London, and [[Zurich]].&lt;ref name="rgallop10"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art collections and galleries===
In 1974 Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil (MACG), a gallery and museum, opened.

[[Museo Tamayo de Arte Contemporáneo]] opened in Mexico City in 1981. The [[Museo Nacional de Arte|National Museum of Art]] (MUNAL) opened in 1982.

[[Centro Cultural Arte Contemporáneo]] opened in Mexico City in 1986, now defunct. "In 1998 ... with the sudden death of its chief executive, [[Televisa]] closed ... [the gallery] for a time, as the turnover in the company coincided with a drastic drop in the company's profitability".

In 1996 the [[Jacques Gelman|Gelman collection]] was donated to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (in New York); part of the Gelmans' collection is on display in the [[Cuernavaca#Museo Muros|Muros Museum]] in [[Cuernavaca]].

[[Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo]] (MUAC) opened in 2008.

Private art exhibition is concentrated  to major urban centers, in particular [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo Léon]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Oaxaca City]] and [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="Zaragoza51"/&gt;

===Art criticism===
[[Octavio Mercado]] said in 2012 that the activity of art criticism still can be found in specialized magazines and nationally disseminated newspapers; furthermore, a new generation of art critics include [[Daniela Wolf]], [[Ana Elena Mallet]], [[Gabriella Gómez-Mont]], and [[Pablo Helguera]].

==21st century==

==Popular arts and handcrafts==
{{Main|Mexican handcrafts and folk art}}
[[File:Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos votive 1920 1922.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ex-voto]] painting from the early 1920s honoring Our Lady of [[San Juan de los Lagos]].]]
[[Mexican handcrafts and folk art]], called ''artesanía'' in Mexico, is a complex category of items made by hand or in small workshops for utilitarian, decorative, or other purposes. These include ceramics, wall hangings, certain types of paintings, and textiles.&lt;ref name="mexpopart"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mexipopulart.org/mexicanpopularart.aspx |title= Mexican Popular Arts |accessdate= 2009-11-28 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005022/http://mexipopulart.org/mexicanpopularart.aspx |archivedate= 2010-03-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the more formal arts, artesanía has both indigenous and European roots and is considered a valued part of Mexico's ethnic heritage.&lt;ref name="pomar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/interior/index.php?idNota=4038&amp;p=nota |title=Centenaria presencia de las artesanías |first=Maria Teresa |last=Pomar |date=Nov–Dec 1999 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=100 years of arts and crafts |accessdate=2009-11-28 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This linking among the arts and cultural identity was most strongly forged by the country's political, intellectual, and artistic elite in the first half of the 20th century, after the Mexican Revolution.&lt;ref name="pomar" /&gt; Artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[Rufino Tamayo]], and [[Frida Kahlo]] used artesanía as inspiration for a number of their murals and other works.&lt;ref name="pomar" /&gt; Unlike the fine arts, artesanía is created by common people and those of indigenous heritage, who learn their craft through formal or informal apprenticeship.&lt;ref name="mexpopart" /&gt; The linking of artesanía and Mexican identity continues through television, movies, and tourism promotion.&lt;ref name="iturbe"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Iturbe |first1=Mercedes |editor1-first=Mercedes |editor1-last=Iturbe |title= Folk Art Aesthetics and Poetry in Belleza y Poesía en el arte popular mexicano |year=1996 |publisher= CVS Publicaciones |location= Querétaro,QRO |language=Spanish, English |isbn=968-7377-14-3 |pages=223–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the artesanía produced in Mexico consists of ordinary things made for daily use. They are considered artistic because they contain decorative details or are painted in bright colors, or both.&lt;ref name="mexpopart" /&gt; The bold use of colors in crafts and other constructions extends back to pre-Hispanic times. These were joined by other colors introduced by European and Asian contact, always in bold tones.&lt;ref name="aprahamian1112"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |pages=11–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design motifs vary from purely indigenous to mostly European with other elements thrown in. Geometric designs connected to Mexico's pre-Hispanic past are prevalent, and items made by the country's remaining purely indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="aprahamian31"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Motifs from nature are popular, possibly more so than geometric patterns in both pre-Hispanic and European designs. They are especially prevalent in wall-hangings and ceramics.&lt;ref name="aprahamian36"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |page=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best of Mexico's handcrafts is [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera pottery]] produced in [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; It has a mix of Chinese, Arab, Spanish, and indigenous design influences.&lt;ref name="delpaso"&gt;{{cite book |last1= del Paso |first1=Fernando |editor1-first=Mercedes |editor1-last=Iturbe |title= Form and Color in the Manual Arts of Mexico in Belleza y Poesía en el arte popular mexicano |year=1996 |publisher= CVS Publicaciones |location= Querétaro,QRO |language=Spanish, English |isbn=968-7377-14-3 |pages=245–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known folk paintings are the ''ex-voto'' or ''[[retablo]]'' [[Votive paintings of Mexico|votive paintings]]. These are small commemorative paintings or other artwork created by a believer, honoring the intervention of a saint or other figure. The untrained style of ex-voto painting was appropriated during the mid-20th century by Kahlo, who believed they were the most authentic expression of Latin American art.&lt;ref name="trends1970"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253345 |title=Trends 1970-present |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema==
{{Main|Cinema of Mexico}}
[[File:Francisco Villa.gif|right|thumb|Iconic image of [[Pancho Villa]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]], a publicity still taken by Mutual Film Corporation photographer John Davidson Wheelan, January 1914.&lt;ref name="John Mraz 2012, pp. 246-47"&gt;[[John Mraz]], ''Photographing the Mexican Revolution'', Austin: University of Texas Press 2012, pp. 246-47. Inv. #287647. Fondo Casasola. SINAFO-Fototeca Nacional de INAH.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Cinema in Mexico|Cinematography]] came to Mexico during the [[Mexican Revolution]] from the U.S. and France. It was initially used to document the battles of the war. Revolutionary general [[Pancho Villa]] himself starred in some silent films.  In 2003, [[HBO]] broadcast ''[[And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself]]'', with Antonio Banderas as Villa; the film focuses on the making of the film ''[[The Life of General Villa]]''.  Villa consciously used cinema to shape his public image.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Mistron. "The Role of Pancho Villa in the Mexican and American Cinema." ''Studies in Latin American Popular Culture'' 2:1-13 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sound film in Mexico was made in 1931, called ''Desde Santa''. The first Mexican film genre appeared between 1920 and 1940, called ''ranchero''.&lt;ref name="truax"&gt;{{cite news |title=El Cine Mexicano Vuelve a Brillar |first=Eileen |last=Truax |newspaper=La Opinion |location=Los Angeles |date=January 29, 2007 |pages=1A, 16A |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican Cinema Shines Again }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Mexico's Golden Age of Cinema]] is regarded as the 1940s and 1950s, two films from the mid to late 1930s, ''Allá en el Rancho Grande'' (1936) and ''Vamanos con Pancho Villa'' (1935), set the standard of this age thematically, aesthetically, and ideologically. These films featured archetypal star figures and symbols based on broad national mythologies. Some of the mythology according to [[Carlos Monsiváis]], includes the participants in family melodramas, the masculine ''[[charro]]s'' of ranchero films, [[femme fatale]]s (often played by [[María Félix]] and [[Dolores del Río]]), the indigenous peoples of [[Emilio Fernández]]’s films, and [[Cantinflas]]’s ''peladito'' (urban miscreant).&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt;

Settings were often ranches, the battlefields of the Revolution, and [[cabaret]]s. Movies about the Mexican Revolution focused on the initial overthrow of the [[Porfirio Díaz]] government rather than the fighting among the various factions afterwards. They also tended to focus on rural themes as “Mexican”, even though the population was increasingly urban.&lt;ref name="strayer"&gt;Strayer, 2009 p.7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico had two advantages in filmmaking during this period. The first was a generation of talented actors and filmmakers. These included actors such as [[María Félix]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Pedro Armendáriz]], [[Pedro Infante]], [[Cantinflas]], and directors such as [[Emilio Fernández|Emilio “El Indio” Fernandez]] and cinematographer [[Gabriel Figueroa]]. Many of these starts had success in the United States and at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] .&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacDonald |first1=Christine |year=1994 |title= Cinema renaissance: Mexican films captivate world audiences |journal=Business Mexico |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=60–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the corner of La Brea and [[Hollywood Boulevard]], there is a sculpture of four women who represent the four pillars of the cinema industry, one of whom is Mexican actress [[Dolores del Rio]] .&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt; Gabriel Figueroa is known for black-and-white camerawork that is generally stark and expressionist, with simple but sophisticated camera movement.&lt;ref name="roads"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=Alex |date=November 1995 |title=Roads to the south: In praise of Mexican cinema |journal=Film Comment |volume=31 |issue=6 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second advantage was that Mexico was not heavily involved in the [[Second World War]], and therefore had a greater supply of celluloid for films, then also used for bombs.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

[[File:Bird of Paradise (1932) 1.jpg|thumb|300px|A scene from ''Bird of Paradise'' (1932) with [[Dolores del Río]].]]
In the 1930s, the government became interested in the industry in order to promote cultural and political values. Much of the production during the Golden Age was financed with a mix of public and private money, with the government eventually taking a larger role. In 1942 the Banco Cinematográfico financed almost all of the industry, coming under government control by 1947. This gave the government extensive censorship rights through deciding which projects to finance.&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt; While the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) censored films in many ways in the 1940s and 1950s, it was not as repressive as other Spanish speaking countries, but it played a strong role in how Mexico's government and culture was portrayed.&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

The Golden Age ended in the late 1950s, with the 1960s dominated by poorly made imitations of Hollywood westerns and comedies. These films were increasingly shot outdoors and popular films featured stars from [[lucha libre]]. Art and experimental film production in Mexico has its roots in the same period, which began to bear fruit in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; Director [[Paul Leduc (film director)|Paul Leduc]] surfaced in the 1970s, specializing in films without dialogue. His first major success was with ''Reed: Insurgent Mexico'' (1971) followed by a biography of [[Frida Kahlo]] called ''Frida'' (1984). He is the most consistently political of modern Mexican directors. In the 1990s, he filmed ''Latino Bar'' (1991) and ''Dollar Mambo'' (1993). His silent films generally have not had commercial success.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

In the late 20th century the main proponent of Mexican art cinema was Arturo Ripstein Jr.. His career began with a spaghetti Western-like film called ''Tiempo de morir'' in 1965 and who some consider the successor to [[Luis Buñuel]] who worked in Mexico in the 1940s. Some of his classic films include ''El Castillo de la pureza'' (1973), ''Lugar sin limites'' (1977) and ''La reina de la noche'' (1994) exploring topics such as family ties and even homosexuality, dealing in cruelty, irony, and tragedy.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;
State censorship was relatively lax in the 1960s and early 1970s, but came back during the latter 1970s and 1980s, monopolizing production and distribution.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

Another factor was that many Mexican film making facilities were taken over by Hollywood production companies in the 1980s, crowding out local production.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; The quality of films was so diminished that for some of these years,{{which|date=January 2012}} [[Ariel Award|Mexico's Ariel film award]] was suspended for lack of qualifying candidates.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt; Popular filmmaking decreased but the art sector grew, sometimes producing works outside the view of censors such as [[Jorge Fons]]’ 1989 film ''Rojo Amanecer'' on the [[Tlatelolco massacre|1968 Tlatelolco massacre]]. The movie was banned by the government but received support in Mexico and abroad. The film was shown although not widely.{{elucidate|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--Shown where? In Mexico? I thought it was banned. From whom did it receive support?--&gt; It was the beginning of more editorial freedom for filmmakers in Mexico.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Starting in the 1990s, Mexican cinema began to make a comeback, mostly through co-production with foreign interests. One reason for international interest in Mexican cinema was the wild success of the 1992 film [[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|''Como Agua Para Chocolate'']] (''Like Water for Chocolate'').&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; In 1993, this film was the largest grossing foreign language film in U.S. history and ran in a total of 34 countries.&lt;ref name="macdonald" /&gt; Since then, Mexican film divided into two genres. Those for a more domestic audience tend to be more personal and more ambiguously political such as ''Pueblo de Madera'', ''La Vida Conjugal'', and ''Angel de fuego''. Those geared for international audiences have more stereotypical Mexican images and include ''Solo con tu Pareja'', ''La Invencion de Cronos'' along with ''Como Agua para Chocolate''.&lt;ref name="macdonald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Mexico's newest generation of successful directors includes [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], and [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. Films include ''[[Children of Men|Cuarón/Children of Men]]'' filmed in England and ''[[Pan's Labyrinth|El Laberinto del Fauno]]'', which was a Mexican/Spanish production. Film professionals in the early 21st century tend to be at least bilingual (Spanish and English) and are better able to participate in the global market for films than their predecessors.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

==Photography in Mexico==
[[File:MetlacBridgeKahlo.JPG|thumb|300px|An image of the Metlac Bridge, taken by [[Guillermo Kahlo]].]]
Photography came to Mexico in the form of [[daguerreotype]] about six months after its discovery, and it spread quickly. It was initially used for portraits of the wealthy (because of its high cost), and for shooting landscapes and pre-Hispanic ruins.&lt;ref name="monroy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/hitoria-de-la-fotografia-en-mexico.html |title= Historia de la Fotografía en México |first=Rebeca |last=Monroy Nasr |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=History of Mexican photography |accessdate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another relatively common type of early photographic portraits were those of recently deceased children, called ''little angels,'' which persisted into the first half of the 20th century. This custom derived from a Catholic tradition of celebrating a dead child's immediate acceptance into heaven, bypassing purgatory. This photography replaced the practice of making drawings and other depictions of them as this was considered a “happy occasion.”&lt;ref name="sleeping"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marino |first1=Daniela |date=Summer 1997 |title= Prayer for a sleeping child: Iconography of the funeral ritual of little angels in Mexico |journal= The Journal of American Culture |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=37–49 |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734x.1997.2002_37.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal portraits were the most common form of commercial photography through the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

Modern photography in Mexico did not begin as an art form, but rather as documentation, associated with periodicals and government projects. It dates to the [[Porfirio Díaz]] period of rule, or the ''Porfiriato'', from the late 19th century to 1910.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1086-the-legacy-of-agustin-victor-casasola-photographer-1874-1938 |title= The legacy of Agustin Victor Casasola (Photographer 1874–1938) |author=Rita Pomade |date=June 1, 2004 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn= 1028-9089 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp7"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Porfirian-era photography was heavily inclined toward the presentation of the nation's modernization to the rest of the world, with Mexico City as its cultural showpiece. This image was European-based with some indigenous elements for distinction.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp24"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylized images of the indigenous during the Porfirato were principally done by Ybañez y Sora in the [[costumbrista]] painting style, which was popular outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; The most important Porfirian era photographer was [[Guillermo Kahlo]], who worked with associate Hugo Brehme.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; Kahlo established his own studio in the first decade of the 1900s and was hired by businesses and the government to document architecture, interiors, landscapes, and factories.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp35"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahlo's style reflected the narratives of the period, solely focusing on major constructions and events, and avoiding the common populace.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp37"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; It avoided subjects that hinted at the political instability of the country at the time, such as [[strike action]]s.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp26"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; One major Kahlo project was the Photographic Inventory of Spanish Colonial Church Architecture in Mexico (1910), which consisted of twenty five albums sponsored by the federal government to document the remaining colonial architecture.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp25"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's photography was used to link Mexico's past to its progress with political and social power provided in symbols and ideals, as well to link the government's aspirations with its colonial and pre-Hispanic past.{{clarify|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp34"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decena trágica.JPG|thumb|300px|A scene from the [[Decena Trágica]], February 1913, from the [[Agustín Casasola]] archives.]]
Another pioneer of Mexican photography was [[Agustín Casasola|Agustín Victor Casasola]]. Like Kahlo, he began his career in the Porfirato, but his career was focused on photography for periodicals. Again like Kahlo, Casasola's work prior to the Mexican Revolution focused on non-controversial photographs, focusing on the lives of the elite. The outbreak of civil war caused Casasola's choice of subject to change. He began to focus not only on portraits of the main protagonists (such as [[Francisco Villa]]) and general battle scenes, but on executions and the dead. He focused on people whose faces showed such expressions as pain, kindness, and resignation.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

His work during this time produced a large collection of photographs, many of which are familiar to Mexicans as they have been widely reprinted and reused, often without credit to Casasola. After the war, Casasola continued to photograph common people, especially migrants to Mexico City during the 1920s and 1930s. His total known archives comprise about half a million images with many of his works archived in the former monastery of San Francisco in [[Pachuca]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

Kahlo and Casasola are considered the two most important photographers to develop the medium in Mexico, with Kahlo defining architectural photography and Casasolas establishing photojournalism. Neither man thought of himself as an artist—especially not Casasolas—who thought of himself as a historian in the [[Positivism|Positivist]] tradition, but the photography of both show attention to detail, lighting, and placement of subjects for emotional or dramatic effect.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp1825"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.18-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of the 20th century, most photography was connected to documentation. However, artistic trends from both inside and outside the country had an effect. In the 1920s, the dominant photographic style was [[Pictorialism]], in which images had a romantic or dream-like quality due to the use of filters and other techniques. American [[Edward Weston]] broke with this tradition, taking these effects away for more realistic and detailed images.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |title= Edward Weston: Pictorialist Pioneer |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 27, 2003 |pages=62–65 s }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a split in the photography world between Pictorialists and Realists both inside and outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

Weston and his Italian assistant [[Tina Modotti]] were in Mexico from 1923 to 1926, allying themselves with Mexican Realist photographers [[Manuel Álvarez Bravo]] as well as muralists such as [[Gabriel Fernández Ledesma]]. These photographers' political and social aspirations matched those of the muralist movement and the new post-Revolution government.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp1718"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariana Yampolsky]], originally from the U.S., became an important photographer in Mexico.  Photography and other arts shifted to depictions of the country's indigenous heritage and the glorification of the Mexican common people.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9" /&gt; This was mainly to reject the elitist and heavily European values of the Porfiriato, along with the increasing cultural influence of the United States in favor of an “authentic” and distinct Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp910"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another was the government's decision to use this imagery, rather than the still-fresh memories of the battles and atrocities of the Revolution to promote itself.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp27"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Centro-fotografico-in-oaxaca-founded-by-toledo.jpg|thumb|[[Centro Fotográfico Álvarez Bravo]] at the [[Institute of Graphic Arts of Oaxaca]].]]

Manuel Alvarez Bravo experimented with abstraction in his photography and formed his own personal style concerned with Mexican rites and customs. He was active from the 1920s until his death in the 1990s. Like other artists of the 20th century, he was concerned with balancing international artistic trends with the expression of Mexican culture and people. His photographic techniques were concerned with transforming the ordinary into the fantastic. From the end of the 1930s to the 1970s his photography developed along with new technologies such as color, using the same themes. In the 1970s, he experimented with female nudes.&lt;ref name="aalonso"&gt;{{cite news |title= Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico en imagenes |first=Alejandro |last=Alonso |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=June 13, 1997 |page=14 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico in images }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These post-Revolution photographers influenced the generations after them, but the emphasis remained on documentary journalism, especially for newspapers. For this reason, the focus remained on social issues. This included work by [[Nacho López]] and [[Héctor García Cobos|Hector Garcia]], best known for their photography of the [[Tlatelolco massacre|student uprising of 1968]].&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

During the 1970s, a fusion of various styles retained a social focus.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; During the same period, institutions were established that dedicated themselves to the promotion of photography and conservation of photographs, such as the Centro de la Imagen, the Fototeca Nacional del [[INAH]], and the publication ''Luna Córnea''.&lt;ref name="grandes"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los 13 grandes de la fotografía mexicana |first=Yanet |last=Aguilar Sosa |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/sociedad/3014.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The 13 greats of Mexican photography }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photography in Mexico from the latter 20th century on remains mostly focused on photojournalism and other kinds of documentary. Francisco Mata de Rosas is considered the most notable photographer in contemporary Mexico mostly working with documentaries.{{according to whom|date=January 2012}} He has published a number of books including ''México Tenochtitlan'' and ''Tepito, Bravo el Barrio''. Eniac Martínez specializes in panoramas. Patricia Aridjis works with social themes, mostly to illustrate books. Gerardo Montiel Klint's work has been described as a “shadowing and dark world”, focusing on the angst and violence of adolescents.&lt;ref name="grandes" /&gt; The most recent generation of photographers work with new and digital technologies. One of these is [[Javier Orozco]] who specializes in interiors.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

However, purely artistic photography has had an impact. In 2002, a photographic exhibit by Daniela Rossell featured images of Mexican multimillionaires posing in their ostentatious homes, filled with expensive paintings, hunting trophies, crystal chandeliers, gold lamé wallpaper, and household help. The photographs set off a wave of social criticism as well as tabloid gossip.&lt;ref name="rgallop47"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Misunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field''''' was edited by [[Benjamin Zablocki]] and [[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Thomas Robbins]].  The book was published by [[University of Toronto Press]], on December 1, 2001 and includes contributions from ten religious, sociological and psychological scholars.

The book is unique in that it includes contributions from scholars who have been labeled as "[[Anti-Cult Movement|anti-cult]]", as well as those who have been labeled as "[[cult apologist]]s."  The book features a section which discusses the need for scholarly objectivity when researching cults, as well as emphasizing the danger of partisanship while researching these controversial groups.  Other topics discussed include [[brainwashing]], [[destructive cult|cult violence]], the conflict that exists between [[new religious movement]]s and their critics, as well as the ramifications of raising children in controversial religious movements.

==Contributors==
The book includes contributions from researchers with varied viewpoints on the subject of cults.

== Reception ==

[[William Sims Bainbridge]] frames the book as part of the debate whether [[sociology of religion]] is truly scientific. He notes that a lot of the debate in the book is centered on the validity of [[brainwashing]] as a concept. He writes that "In many respects this is an excellent book, containing insightful essays written from a variety of perspectives," noting however that "Not a single paper in the collection makes use of quantitative data or conducts any other kind of formal theory testing," and decrying the scarcity of connections to research on [[Social influence|group influence]] from [[social psychology]] or sociology in general. Bainbridge also writes that "Some contributors use very harsh language in describing writers who disagree with them, each faction accusing the other of selling out and forsaking intellectual integrity for material gain either from the families who turn in desperation to the anti-cult movement for help with lost relatives, or from the cults themselves. It is a telling fact that several of the more polite writers refer to their colleagues as scholars rather than scientists, the implication being that they all operate outside any framework of precise measurement and hypothesis testing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjsonline.ca/reviews/miscults.html Review], ''Canadian Journal of Sociology Online'', July – August 2002, William Sims Bainbridge&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9442">'''Orchid hunting''' is the search for [[Orchidaceae|orchid plants]] in the wild. The orchid plants are usually being acquired for the commercial market, where there was, and still is, significant demand for these unusual flowering plants.

==The Victorian era==
[[File:Swainson William 1789-1855.jpg|'''William John Swainson''', British [[ornithologist]] precursor of orchid hunting.|200px|thumb]] 
[[File:Ophrys speculum - Bot. Reg. 5 pl.370 (1819).jpg|Illustration of [[Ophrys|Ophrys speculum]] probably painted by William Swainson|200px|thumb]]

In 1818, [[William John Swainson]] was collecting plants in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. He sent a box of tropical plants he had acquired to London. As a packing material he used [[Orchidaceae|orchids]], which he believed were [[parasitic plants]]. Surprisingly, one of the orchids bloomed on arrival, and Londoners were astonished by the unusual shape and colors of the flower. That single flower triggered "orchid fever", which resulted in many deaths in pursuit of the plants.&lt;ref name="Orchid Discovery"/&gt; However, there is some evidence that this conventional story about using specimens of ''[[Cattleya labiata]]'' as packing material is just a myth - Swainson actually saw exceptionally showy flowers of this orchid and understood its real value. And upon arrival to Barnet orchids were provided with proper care&lt;ref&gt;[http://chadwickorchids.com/largeflowering A. A. Chadwick.  Large-Flowered Cattleya Species]&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of the orchid plants sent to Europe did not survive the trip. The demand grew, the plants became more and more expensive, and the profession of orchid hunter was created. Orchid hunters faced tropical diseases, wild animals and poisonous snakes, floods, native indigenous nations , and often fierce competition from each other.&lt;ref name="Orchid Discovery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The orchid thief"/&gt;   

In 1901, eight orchid hunters went to look for rare orchids in the [[Philippines]]. One of the hunters was eaten by a tiger, another had oil spilled on him and was burned alive, and five others vanished completely. The man who survived the ordeal collected 7,000 orchid specimens.&lt;ref name="Twelve Portraits of the Dracula Orchid"/&gt;

Another group of orchid hunters in [[Papua New Guinea]] were captured and held hostage. Two members of the party were beheaded before Indonesian troops came to their rescue.&lt;ref name="NOVA"/&gt;
[[Colombia]] is said to be one of the best places to hunt for orchids, but it also used to be one of the hardest places to survive the hunt. William Arnold drowned in the fast and wild [[Orinoco River]] while on a collecting expedition; [[David Bowman (botanist)|David Bowman]] died from [[dysentery]]; and [[yellow fever]] killed Gustavo Wallis in the [[Andean mountains]].&lt;ref name="The orchid thief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Twelve Portraits of the Dracula Orchid"/&gt;

Albert Millican was both a painter and orchid hunter. He knew that hunting for the orchids was a dangerous business. He wrote about his expedition's supplies:   
{{cquote|I provided myself with a stock of knives, cutlasses, revolvers, rifle&lt;ref name="TRAVELS AND ADVENTURES OF AN ORCHID HUNTER IN COLOMBIA"/&gt;}}

The competition between the hunters was intense. William Arnold got into a confrontation with another orchid hunter which almost ended up in a [[duel]]. When Arnold wrote about this to his employer, he was ordered to follow the other man, collect the same specimens he did, and try to urinate on the other man's collection in order to kill his orchids. No matter how homesick and lonely the orchid hunters were, they never made friends with their rivals.&lt;ref name="Twelve Portraits of the Dracula Orchid"/&gt;  

[[Wilhelm Micholitz]] was one of the best orchid  hunters. Once the boat he was on caught fire; the orchids he had collected perished, but Micholitz survived. He cabled the news to his employer Sander, and was ordered to return and to recollect, despite the fact that the rainy season made the collection of orchids all but impossible. One entry in Micholitz's diary was made in [[Bogota]]:
{{cquote|I do not know what I would not give to be back in the well-ordered British or Dutch Colonies in the East, to be able to do work in peace and comparative comfort.&lt;ref name="Wilhelm Micholitz "/&gt;}}

It was not surprising that Micholitz dreamed about peace after witnessing a horrific fight between locals in [[Papua New Guinea]]. The fight left many wounded and dead, three of whom were also beheaded, and one was missing his hands, feet and penis. Those locals were supposed to be helping Micholitz with his orchid search, but after the fight they refused to continue.&lt;ref name="The orchid thief"/&gt;   
    
Orchid hunters who survived their ordeals came home with incredible stories. They claimed that [[cannibals]] on the [[Solomon Islands]] tortured their human sacrifices with the most beautiful blooming orchids placed around them so that the victims were able to see the color of the flowers growing richer from their own blood. Fosterman, who was hunting for orchids in [[Brazil]], described his adventure in the "village of the demon flowers". He claimed that the orchids his party found there were the most beautiful he had ever seen, but he said that the flowers had a very bad smell, an odor that literally was strong enough to kill people. His men circled this village and saw abundant orchids everywhere, but because the smell was so deadly, the flowers were simply impossible to reach, like a lovely [[mirage]].&lt;ref name="The Orchid review"/&gt;

From 15 February to 16 March 2003, [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] ran their ninth orchid festival with a theme: "In Search of Paradise". The exhibit included letters, diaries and paintings on the theme of "daring tales of Victorian exploration" and orchid hunting.&lt;ref name="In Search of Paradise "/&gt;

==Modern orchid hunting==
Modern orchid hunting is not without its dangers. [[Tom Hart Dyke]], a plant hunter who follows the tradition of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] orchid hunters, was held in 2000 by kidnappers thought to be [[FARC]] guerillas in the [[Darien Gap]] between [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]], while hunting for rare [[orchid]]s, a plant for which he has a particular passion. He and his travel companion, Paul Winder, were held captive for nine months, and threatened with death. Hart Dyke kept his morale up by creating a design for a garden containing plants collected on his trips, laid out in the shape of a world map, the plants being positioned according to the respective continents of their origin.&lt;ref name="Tom Hart Dyke"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2904">'''Orchidelirium''' is the name given to the [[Victorian era]] of flower madness when collecting and discovering [[orchid]]s reached extraordinarily high levels. Wealthy orchid fanatics of the 19th century sent explorers and collectors to almost every part of the world in search of new varieties of orchids.&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie Godeanu, Nature assessed Sep 30, 2008 [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/orchids/deceivers.html Nature:Obsession with Orchids]&lt;/ref&gt; Orchidelirium is seen as similar to Dutch [[tulip mania]]. Today there still exists some levels of orchid madness, that has some times resulted in [[theft]] of exceptional orchids among collectors such as the [[Dendrophylax lindenii|Ghost Orchid]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Orlean, "The Orchid Thief" 1998 Random House publishing [http://www.susanorlean.com/books/the-orchid-thief.html The Orchid Thief]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== &lt;!-- This entire section is plagiarized from http://www.orchidsusa.com/1Introduction.htm#1.5-Abitoforchidhistory --&gt;
Cultivation of orchids started in England in the 19th century. Orchids were brought to Europe by companies or individuals who had financed collecting expeditions. Commissioned professional collectors would travel for months all over the world in search of rare new species. These expensive expeditions were often shrouded in secrecy and it was not unusual for collectors to spread misleading information about the locations where new orchids were found.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Orchid Culture Guide [http://www.orchidsusa.com/1Introduction.htm Orchid History]&lt;/ref&gt;
New exotic orchids were most often sold at auction in London, fetching extravagant prices.
During this time very little was known about the cultivation of orchids and their survival rate was dismal.
Through experimentation and by gathering more information on the growing conditions of orchids in their natural habitat, knowledge was slowly being developed and by 1851 B. S. Williams published the first edition of “The Orchid Grower’s Manual”. Today, the collecting of orchids in the wild is now banned by the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES) adopted in 1973. Still some orchids are endangered. Orchid smuggling is thought to contribute to the loss of some species of orchid in the wild.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8118">[[File:PaperPhone Flexible Smartphone.jpg|thumb|PaperPhone (2011) was the first flexible smartphone prototype and the first OUI with bend interactions on a real flexible display.|281x281px]]
In [[human–computer interaction]], an '''organic user interface''' ('''OUI''') is defined as a [[user interface]] with a non-flat display.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After [[Douglas Engelbart|Engelbart]] and [[Ivan Sutherland|Sutherland's]] [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), which was based on the [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), and [[Alan Kay|Kay]] and [[Mark Weiser|Weiser's]] [[ubiquitous computing]], which is based on the flat panel [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD), OUI represents the third wave of display interaction paradigms, pertaining to multi-shaped and [[flexible display]]s. In an OUI, the display surface is always the locus of interaction, and may actively or passively change shape upon analog (i.e., as close to non-quantized as possible) inputs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Roel Vertegaal and Ivan Poupyrev, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1349026.1349033 Organic User Interfaces: Introduction], Communications of the ACM 51(6), 26–30, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These inputs are provided through direct physical [[Gesture recognition|gestures]], rather than through indirect [[Point and click|point-and-click]] control. Note that the term "Organic" in OUI was derived from [[organic architecture]], referring to the adoption of natural form to design a better fit with [[human ecology]]. The term also alludes to the use of [[organic electronics]] for this purpose.

Organic user interfaces were first introduced in a special issue of the ''Communications of the ACM'' in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first International Workshop on Organic User Interfaces took place at CHI 2009 in Boston, Massachusetts. The second workshop took place at TEI 2011 in Madeira, Portugal. The third workshop was held at MobileHCI 2012 in Monterey, California, and the fourth workshop at CHI 2013 in Paris, France.

==Types==
According to Vertegaal and Poupyrev,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; there are three general types of organic user interface:

'''Flexible (or deformable) user interfaces:''' When flexible displays are deployed, shape deformation, e.g., through bends, is a key form of input for OUI. Flexible display technologies include [[Flexible organic light-emitting diode|flexible OLED]] (FOLED) and [[Flexible display#Flexible electronic paper based displays|flexible E Ink]], or can be simulated through 3D [[Projection mapping|active projection mapping]].

'''Shaped user interfaces:''' Displays with a static non-flat display. The physical shape is chosen so as to better support the main function of the interface. Shapes may include spheres, cylinders or take the form of everyday objects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Actuated (or kinetic) user interfaces:''' Displays with a programmable shape controlled by a computer algorithm. Here, display shapes can actively adapt to the physical context of the user, the form of the data, or the function of the interface. An extreme example is that of [[Claytronics]]: fully physical 3D [[voxel]]s that dynamically constitute physical 3D images.

==Organic design principles==

Holman and [[Roel Vertegaal|Vertegaal]] present three design principles that underlie OUI:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;David Holman and Roel Vertegaal, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1349026.1349037 Organic user interfaces: designing computers in any way, shape, or form], Communications of the ACM 51(6), 26–30, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Input equals output:''' In traditional GUIs, input and output are physically separated: Output is generated graphically on the screen on the basis of input provided by a control device such as a mouse. A key feature of OUI is that the display surface, and its physical deformations are always the locus of user interaction.

'''Function equals form:''' Coined by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], this means the shape of an interface determines its physical functionality, and vice versa. Shapes should be chosen such that they best support the functionality of the interface. An example is a spherical multitouch interface,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which is particularly suited to geographic information interfaces, which were previously limited to [[Mercator projection|distorted flat projections]] of spherical earth data.

'''Form follows flow:''' OUIs physically adapt to the context of a user's multiple activities, e.g., by taking on multiple shapes. An example of this is the "clamshell" phone, where the physical metaphor of altering the phone's shape (by opening it) alters the state of the user interface (to open communications). Another example is folding a thin-film tablet PC into a smaller, pocket-sized smartphone for mobility.

==Example implementations==

It featured a flexible [[Electronic paper#Electrophoretic|electrophoretic display]] and an array of 5 bend sensors that allowed for user navigation of content. Examples of actuated OUIs include shape changing prototypes like MorePhone and Morphees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://big.cs.bris.ac.uk/projects/morphees Roudaut A., Karnik A., Löchtefeld, M. and S.

Eyes-on: Samsung's Youm flexible-display tech at CES 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; are early commercial prototypes of OUIs. It is widely expected that OUIs will be introduced on the market by the year 2018.

Note that OUIs differ from a [[natural user interface]] (NUI) in that NUIs are limited to touch or remote gestural interactions with a flat display only. Although remote gestural interaction violates the principle of ''Input Equals Output'', OUIs generally subsume NUIs. Also note that OUI is a successor to and form of [[tangible user interface]] that always features a bitmapped display skin around its multi-shaped body. Finally, note that all OUIs are examples of [[Haptic technology|haptic technologies]], as their physical shapes, like real objects, provide passive tactile-kinaesthetic feedback even in non-actuated cases.

[[File:SFParklet.jpg|thumb|right|A parklet on [[Valencia Street]] in [[San Francisco]].]] 
A '''parklet''' is a [[sidewalk]] extension that provides more space and amenities for people using the [[street]]. Usually parklets are installed on parking lanes and use several [[parking space]]s. Parklets typically extend out from the sidewalk at the level of the sidewalk to the width of the adjacent parking space.&lt;ref name=Parklet_Manual /&gt;&lt;ref name="Experimenting with the Margin" /&gt;

Parklets are intended for people. Parklets offer a place to stop, to sit, and to [[leisure|rest]] while taking in the activities of the street. In instances where a parklet is not intended to accommodate people, it may provide greenery, [[art]], or some other visual amenity. A parklet may accommodate [[bicycle parking]] within it, or bicycle parking may be associated with it.&lt;ref name="Experimenting with the Margin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abad Ocubillo|first=Robin|title=Experimenting with the Margin: Parklets and Plazas as Catalysts in Community and Government|year=2012|publisher=University of Southern California|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll3/id/89034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A parklet may be thought of as permanent, but must be designed for quick and easy removal for [[emergency|emergencies]] or other reasons such as [[snow removal]] without damage to the [[curb (road)|curb]] or street. As initially conceived, a parklet is always [[public accommodation|open to the public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfpavementtoparks.sfplanning.org |title=Pavement to Parks |publisher=Sfpavementtoparks.sfplanning.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some cities have allowed restaurants to create parklets that are not open to the public such as Long Beach, California, Fargo, North Dakota and Montreal, Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Long Beach|title=Long Beach’s Very Own Retro Row is Home to the 1st Parklet in Southern California No. 9 Restaurant Also Participating in the City Pilot Program|url=http://www.longbeach.gov/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=5648&amp;TargetID=55|work=City of Long Beach}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=UCLA Complete Streets Initiative|title=Reclaiming the Right-of-Way: A Toolkit for Creating and Implementing Parklets|year=2012|publisher=UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs|location=Los Angeles, CA|url=http://www.its.ucla.edu/research/parklettoolkit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[San Francisco]] has been credited with introducing the first parklet.&lt;ref name="ames"&gt;{{cite news |last= Grunewald |first=Katie |url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/article_d8fd6008-adf7-11e2-96a3-001a4bcf887a.html |title=Student Society of Landscape Architecture demonstrates parklet |publisher=Iowa State Daily |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, parklets have been introduced in cities such as [[Ames, Iowa]]&lt;ref name="ames"/&gt; and [[Puebla de Zaragoza]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inaugura Puebla Capital y Colegio de Arquitectos el concepto Parklets |url= http://www.cmicpuebla.org.mx/secciones/?se=1375|newspaper=Milenio| language=Spanish| accessdate= 2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world’s first formal public parklets were initially conceived by Italian/Brazilian designer and London resident Suzi Bolognese (Sb Design Studio) and installed in San Francisco in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://inhabitat.com/sao-paulo-replaces-parking-spots-with-mini-parklets-for-a-more-pedestrian-friendly-urban-environment/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In August 2012, the School of Architecture at University of Southern California published a graduate thesis "Experimenting with the Margin: Parklets and Plazas as Catalysts in Community and Government," which provided a comprehensive history of the creation of parklet and plaza programs in four California cities.&lt;ref name="Experimenting with the Margin" /&gt; In September 2012, the [[UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs]] published a report, "Reclaiming the Right-of-Way: A toolkit for Creating and Implementing Parklets", examining case studies for parklets in seven cities across North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Complete Streets Initiative Releases Guide to Creating 'Parklets' | date=6 September 2012 | url= http://luskin.ucla.edu/news/school-public-affairs/complete-streets-initiative-releases-guide-creating-parklets | publisher= [[UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs]]| accessdate= 2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2013, The San Francisco Planning Department published a Parklet Manual&lt;ref name="Parklet_Manual"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130425020459/http://sfpavementtoparks.sfplanning.org/docs/SF_P2P_Parklet_Manual_1.0_FULL.pdf San Francisco Parklet Manual, Version 1.0] (February 2013). San Francisco Planning Department&lt;/ref&gt; which serves as a comprehensive overview of the goals, policies, process, procedures and guidelines for creating a parklet in San Francisco. The Manual also serves as a resource for those outside of San Francisco working to establish parklet programs in their own cities.

==Design and purpose==
[[File:Парклет Івано-Франківськ 01.jpg|thumb|right|A parklet in [[Ivano-Frankivsk]].]]
Parklets are designed to provide a [[public place]] for passersby to relax and enjoy the atmosphere of the city around them, in places where either current [[urban park]]s are lacking or where the existing sidewalk width is not large enough to accommodate vibrant street life activities. Parklets can be designed to be either permanent fixtures, or can be designed to be temporary/seasonal in places where snow removal is a concern. Seasonal parklets are found in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago.&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Chicago|title=People Spots|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/make_way_for_people/people_spot.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Philadelphia&gt;{{cite web|last=Saffron|first=Inga|title=Transforming parking spots to parklets: Philadelphia joins an urban trend|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-08-04/news/29850967_1_spaces-parklets-parking-spots}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cities choose to install these sites in order to create more public space by creating "places for people to sit, relax and enjoy the city."&lt;ref name=Van&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Vancouver, BC|title=Parklets: converting street parking spaces to mini plazas|url=https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/parklets.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vancouver 2013 Parklet Pilot Program Guide explains parklets purpose and design as "benefit local businesses, residents, and visitors by providing unique public spaces that attract customers and foster community conversation. They can also have additional benefits such as adding more space for people to walk in congested areas. The typical design is a platform that extends the sidewalk and provides amenities like seats, tables, bike racks, and landscaping"&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt;

==Impact studies==
In September 2010, The San Francisco Great Streets Project (then part of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition) published a study, "Divisadero Trial Parklet Impact Report," on one of the first eight parklets built in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Divisadero&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Liza|title=Divisadero Trial Parklet Impact Report|date=September 2010|publisher=San Francisco Great Streets Project|url=http://sfgreatstreets.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DivisaderoReportPart1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study was followed in January 2012 by a "Parklet Impact Study" analyzing three corridors in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Liza|title=Parklet Impact Study|date=January 2010|location=San Francisco, CA|url=http://sfgreatstreets.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Parklet_Impact_Study_wAppendix.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; From October 2012 to March 2013, Los Angeles research collaborative [http://parkletstudies.carbonmade.com Parklet Studies] worked under the [http://completestreets.dlanc.com/parklets.php Complete Streets Working Group of Downtown Los Angeles Neighborhood Council] to design and implement a one-year study of the Parklets in downtown Los Angeles.  The final report was released in March 2013.

==Locations==
In the [[United States]], San Francisco hosts more parklets than any other City.&lt;ref name="SFP2P Website" /&gt;  The first one-day parklet installation was created in 2005 as an unofficial [[activism|activist]] project by feeding a [[parking meter]] with coins, unrolling [[sod|grass sod]], and placing a potted tree on top.&lt;ref name="powell"&gt;{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/07/13/MNDT1K95SP.DTL&amp;tsp=1|date=13 July 2011|title=Parklets offer a place to pause on busy Powell St.|first=John|last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city's "Pavement to Parks" program was formed to facilitate installation of parklets as longer-term, yet still temporary, fixtures.&lt;ref name="Experimenting with the Margin" /&gt;   As of 2011 the program had received over 50 applications from sponsors around the city.&lt;ref name="cpdr"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephens|first=Josh|title=‘Parklets’ Create Public Space, 120 Square Feet at a Time|url=http://www.cp-dr.com/node/2977|work=California Planning &amp; Development Report|publisher=California Planning &amp; Development Report|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 the Union Square Business Improvement District installed the most ambitious parklet, a 2-block long installation along Powell Street near [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]], funded by a corporate donation by [[Audi]].&lt;ref name="powell"/&gt;

Parklets are typically spaces for passive recreation, The first parklets with active recreation were installed in Los Angeles, CA in February 2013. Two sites on Spring Street, in Downtown Los Angeles, each feature two exercise bicycles on site. Upon evaluation, 20% of people surveyed in the sites said they previously used the machines; but only 5% of activity observed recorded use of the machines. Active recreation use of parklets may need some additional motivation to increase use at the exercise machines.&lt;ref name=Eval&gt;{{cite web|last=UCLA Complete Streets Initiative &amp; Parklet Studies|title=Reclaiming the Right-of-Way: Evaluation Report|url=http://www.its.ucla.edu/research/parkletasessment.pdf|work=Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies|publisher=Luskin School of Public Affairs|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102182905/http://www.its.ucla.edu/research/parkletasessment.pdf|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Parklet on the street in London has been installed in July 2015.

In April 2018, a Parklet was also created on [https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/pop-up-leeds-park-is-calling-for-the-summer-1-9131954 The Calls in Leeds], UK, as a result of a partnership between Leeds Business Improvement District (LeedsBID), Leeds City Council, and LAAND landscape architects.

'''Pitch drop-back''' is the phenomena by which an aircraft which is perturbed in flight path angle from its trim position by a [[step input]] exhibits an output which is indicative of a second order system.&lt;ref name=ifac&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac-papersonline.net/Detailed/38674.html |title=Longitudinal stability and control of large tilt-rotor aircraft |publisher=IFAC-PapersOnLine |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pilot who actuates an elevator input may find that the aircraft then "droops" or "drops back" to a position further toward the start position.

'''Politics of the International Space Station'''  begins with the 1972 milestone in co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union in space, the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. This cooperative venture resulted in the July 1975 docking of [[Soyuz 19]] with an [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo]] spacecraft. From 1978 to 1987, the USSR's [[Interkosmos]] programme included allied Warsaw Pact countries, and countries which were not Soviet allies, such as India, Syria and France, in manned and unmanned missions to Space stations Salyut 6 and 7. In 1986 the USSR extended this co-operation to a dozen countries in the [[Mir]] programme. From 1994 to 1998, NASA Space Shuttles and crew visited MIR in the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]]me. In 1998, assembly of the [[International Space Station]] began.&lt;ref name="OnOrbit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |title=On-Orbit Elements |publisher=NASA |author=NASA |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029013438/http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, a meeting in Quebec City between the leaders of the Canadian Space Agency and those from Japan, Russia, the United States and involved European nations resulted in a renewed pledge to maintain the International Space Station until at least 2020. NASA reports to be still committed to the principles of the mission but also to use the station in new ways, which were not elaborated. CSA President Steve MacLean stated his belief that the station's Canadarm will continue to function properly until 2028, alluding to Canada's likely extension of its involvement beyond 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Canada+renews+pledge+International+Space+Station+until+2020/6235789/story.html Canada renews pledge to International Space Station until 2020.] The Vancouver Sun. 1 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of modules, station usage by participant nations, and responsibilities for station resupply are established by the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). This international treaty was signed on 28 January 1998 by the United States of America, Russia, Japan, Canada and eleven member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name="PartStates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=Human Spaceflight and Exploration—European Participating States|accessdate=17 January 2009|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|title=ISS Intergovernmental Agreement|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=19 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610083738/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|archivedate=10 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the United Kingdom, all of the signatories went on to contribute to the Space Station project. A second layer of agreements was then achieved, called Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), between NASA and ESA, CSA, RKA and JAXA. These agreements are then further split, such as for the contractual obligations between nations, and trading of partners' rights and obligations.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; Use of the Russian Orbital Segment is also negotiated at this level.&lt;ref name="RSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_rsa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Russian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PottersWheel''' is a [[MATLAB]] toolbox for mathematical modeling of time-dependent [[dynamical system]]s that can be expressed as [[chemical reaction network]]s or [[ordinary differential equations]] (ODEs).&lt;ref&gt;T. Maiwald and J. Timmer (2008) "Dynamical Modeling and Multi-Experiment Fitting with PottersWheel", ''Bioinformatics'' 24(18):2037–2043&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the automatic calibration of model parameters by fitting the model to experimental measurements. CPU-intensive functions are written or – in case of model dependent functions – dynamically generated in C. Modeling can be done interactively using graphical user interfaces or based on MATLAB scripts using the PottersWheel function library. The software is intended to support the work of a mathematical modeler as a real [[potter's wheel]] eases the modeling of pottery.

== Seven modeling phases ==

The basic use of PottersWheel covers seven phases from model creation to the prediction of new
experiments.

=== Model creation ===

[[File:Formalization-of-Jak-Stat-Pathway.png]]

The dynamical system is formalized into a set of reactions or differential equations using a visual model designer or a text editor. The model is stored as a MATLAB *.m ASCII file. Modifications can therefore be tracked using a version control system like [[subversion]] or [[Git (software)|git]]. Model import and export is supported for [[SBML]]. Custom import-templates may be used to import custom model structures. [[Rule-based modeling]] is also supported, where a pattern represents a set of automatically generated reactions.

Example for a simple model definition file for a reaction network A → B → C → A with observed species A and C:

&lt;source lang=matlab&gt;
function m = getModel();

% Starting with an empty model
m = pwGetEmtptyModel();

% Adding reactions
m = pwAddR(m, 'A', 'B');
m = pwAddR(m, 'B', 'C');
m = pwAddR(m, 'C', 'A');

% Adding observables
m = pwAddY(m, 'A');
m = pwAddY(m, 'C');
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Data import ===

External data saved in *.xls or *.txt files can be added to a model creating a ''model-data-couple''. A mapping dialog allows to connect data column names to observed species names. Meta information in the data files comprise information about the experimental setting. Measurement errors are either stored in the data files, will be calculated using an error model, or are estimated automatically.

=== Parameter calibration ===

To fit a model to one or more data sets, the corresponding model-data-couples are combined into a ''fitting-assembly''. Parameters like initial values, rate constants, and scaling factors can be fitted in an experiment-wise or global fashion. The user may select from several numerical integrators, optimization algorithms, and calibration strategies like fitting in normal or logarithmic parameter space.

=== Interpretation of the goodness-of-fit ===

[[File:Fitting-data-with-PottersWheel.png]]

The quality of a fit is characterized by its ''chi-squared'' value.  As a rule of thumb, for
''N'' fitted data points and ''p'' calibrated parameters, the chi-squared value should have a similar value
as ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'' or at least&amp;nbsp;''N''. Statistically, this is expressed using a [[chi-squared test]] resulting in a [[p-value]] above a significance threshold of e.g.&amp;nbsp;0.05. For lower p-values, the model is

* either not able to explain the data and has to be refined,
* the standard deviation of the data points is actually larger than specified,
* or the used fitting strategy was not successful and the fit was trapped in a local minimum.

Apart from further chi-squared based characteristics like [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]] and [[Bayesian information criterion|BIC]], data-model-residual analyses exist, e.g. to investigate whether the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] follow a [[Gaussian distribution]]. Finally, parameter [[confidence intervals]] may be estimated using either the [[Fisher information matrix]] approximation or based on the [[profile-likelihood function]], if parameters are not unambiguously identifiable.

If the fit is not acceptable, the model has to be refined and the procedure continues with step 2. Else, the dynamic model properties can be examined and predictions calculated.

=== Model refinement ===

If the model structure is not able to explain the experimental measurements, a set of physiologically reasonable alternative models should be created. In order to avoid redundant model paragraphs and copy-and-paste errors, this can be done using a common core-model which is the same for all variants.  Then, ''daughter''-models are created and fitted to the data, preferably using batch processing strategies based on MATLAB scripts. As a starting point to envision suitable model variants, the PottersWheel ''equalizer'' may be used to understand the dynamic behavior of the original system.

=== Model analysis and prediction ===

A mathematical model may serve to display the concentration time-profile of unobserved species, to determine sensitive parameters representing potential targets within a clinical setting, or to calculate model characteristics like the half-life of a species.

Each analysis step may be stored into a modeling report, which may be exported as a Latex-based PDF.

=== Experimental design ===

An experimental setting corresponds to specific characteristics of ''driving input functions'' and
initial concentrations. In a signal transduction pathway model the concentration of a ligand
like EGF may be controlled experimentally.  The driving input designer allows investigating the effect of a continuous, ramp, or pulse stimulation in combination with varying initial concentrations using the equalizer.  In order to discriminate competing model hypotheses, the designed experiment should have as different observable time-profiles as possible.

== Parameter identifiability ==

Many dynamical systems can only be observed partially, i.e. not all system species are accessible experimentally. For biological applications the amount and quality of experimental data is often limited. In this setting parameters can be structurally or practically non-identifiable. Then, parameters may compensate each other and fitted parameter values strongly depend on initial guesses. In PottersWheel non-identifiability can be detected using the [[Profile Likelihood Approach]].&lt;ref&gt;''Structural and practical identifiability analysis of partially observed dynamical models by exploiting the profile likelihood'', A. Raue, C. Kreutz, T. Maiwald, J. Bachmann, M. Schilling, U. Klingmüller and J. Timmer, Bioinformatics 2009
&lt;/ref&gt; For characterizing functional relationships between the non-identifiable parameters PottersWheel applies random and systematic fit sequences.&lt;ref&gt;''Data-based identifiability analysis of non-linear dynamical models'', S. Hengl, C. Kreutz, J. Timmer and T. Maiwald, Bioinformatics 2007 23(19):2612–2618&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation model (PCBH)''' is a psychological approach to population-based clinical health care that is simultaneously co-located, collaborative, and integrated within the primary care clinic.  The goal of PCBH is to improve and promote overall health within the general population. This approach is important because approximately half of all patients in primary care present with psychiatric comorbidities, and 60% of psychiatric illness is treated in [[primary care]].&lt;ref name="Pirl"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pirl | first1 = W.F. | last2 = Beck | first2 = B.J. | last3 = Safren | first3 = S. A. | last4 = Kim | first4 = H | year = 2001 | title = A descriptive study of psychiatric consultations in a community primary care center | url = | journal = Primary Care Companion Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 190–194 | doi = 10.4088/PCC.v03n0501 | pmc = 181214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary Care practice has traditionally adopted a generalist approach whereby physicians are trained in the medical model and solutions to problems typically involve medications, procedures, and advice. Appointment times are short, with the goal of seeing a large number of patients in a day. Many patients present with mental health care needs whose symptomology may overlap with medical disorders and which may exacerbate, complicate, or masquerade as physical symptoms. In addition, many medical problems present with associated psychological sequelae (e.g. stress, emotional reactions, dysfunctional lifestyle behaviors), that are amenable to change, through behavioral intervention, that can improve outcomes for these health problems. Over 50% of medical visits to primary care clinics today are related to chronic medical conditions (e.g. chronic pain, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, obesity). As we learn more and more about the contributing factors to the development and maintenance of these medical problems, there is growing evidence that the PCBH model affords us the opportunity for early identification and behavioral/medical intervention that can prevent some acute problems from becoming chronic health care problems. Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) work side-by-side with all members of the clinical care team (including primary care providers (PCPs) and nursing staff) to enhance preventive and clinical care for mental health problems that have traditionally been treated solely by physicians. The role of the BHC is to facilitate systemic change within primary care that facilitates a multidisciplinary approach both from a treatment and reimbursement standpoint.  BHCs typically collaborate with physicians to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients’ changing needs&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Robinson, P.J. and Reiter, J.T. (2007). Behavioral Consultation and Primary Care (pp 1-16). N.Y.: Springer Science + Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this review the terms Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation and Behavioral Health Consultation will be used interchangeably.

Such issues treated in primary care may include response to physical illness, stress, affective concerns, substance use and abuse, and developmental and situational issues among others. Primary care psychologists are co-located with primary care providers and usually share the same physical space in practice.

[[Collaborative Care]]: This model uses databases or what are known as registries to track and monitor patients with certain conditions. Typical examples in primary care include diabetes and depression. Often the person managing the registry is a nurse or mental health professional who performs follow-up phone calls and assists the primary care team in following evidence-based protocols. There is often also a consulting psychiatrist who oversees the provision of care in primary care.&lt;ref name="Hunkeler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunkeler | first1 = E. | last2 = Katon | first2 = W. | last3 = Tang | first3 = L. | last4 = Williams | first4 = J. | last5 = Kroenke | first5 = K. | last6 = Lin | first6 = E. | last7 = Harpole | first7 = L.| year = 2006 | title = Long term outcomes from the IMPACT randomised trial for depressed elderly patients in primary care | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 332 | issue = 7536| pages = 259–63 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38683.710255.BE | pmid=16428253 | pmc=1360390|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
Primary care has often been termed the "De Facto" mental health system in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;Cummings, N.A., O’Donohue, W., Hays, S.C., &amp; Follette, V. (2001). Integrated behavioral healthcare: Positioning mental health practice with medical/surgical practice. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research shows that approximately half of all mental health care services are provided solely by primary care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Narrow | first1 = W. | last2 = Reiger | first2 = D. | last3 = Rae | first3 = D. | last4 = Manderscheid | first4 = R. | last5 = Locke | first5 = B. | year = 1993 | title = Use of services by persons with mental and addictive disorders: Findings from the Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 2| pages = 95–107 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1993.01820140017002 | pmid = 8381266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, primary care practitioners prescribe about 70% of all [[psychotropic medications]] and 80% of [[antidepressants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beardsley | first1 = R. | last2 = Gardocki | first2 = G. | last3 = Larson | first3 = D. | last4 = Hidaldo | first4 = J. | year = 1988 | title = Prescribing of psychotropic medication by primary care physicians and psychiatrists | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 12| pages = 1117–1119 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1988.01800360065009 | pmid = 2904248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while it seems there are various "specialty" mental health clinics and psychiatrists alike, the primary care environment continues to lend itself to an array of psychiatric issues. One reason is that physical health problems can contribute to psychological dysfunction and vice versa.  Examples of the frequent comorbity between medical and psychological problems include: chronic pain can cause depression; panic symptoms can lead to complaints of heart palpitations; and stress can contribute to irritable bowl syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;O’Donohue, W.T., Cummings, N.A., Cucciare, M.A., Runyan, C.N., &amp; Cummings, J.L. (2006). Integrated behavioral health care: A guide to effective intervention. Amherst, NY: Humanities Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  While these mind-body relationships may seem obvious, often the presenting problem is far less clear, with the physical health problem being masked by psychosocial concerns.  In fact, of the 10 most common complaints in primary care, less than 16% had a diagnosable physical etiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kroenke | first1 = K. | last2 = Mangelsdorff | first2 = A. | year = 1989 | title = Common symptoms in ambulatory care: Incidence, evaluation, therapy, and outcome | url = | journal = American Journal of Medicine | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 262–266 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(89)90293-3 | pmid = 2919607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychosocial impact on primary care is tremendous (approximately 70% of all visits); however, it is curious that few mental health providers have traditionally placed themselves where the demand for their services is arguably the greatest. 
 
Despite the availability of outpatient mental health resources, research indicates that patients are still driven to the primary care setting. In fact, studies show that as little as 10% of patients actually follow through when being referred by a physician to receive outpatient mental health treatment.&lt;ref name="Slay"&gt;Slay, J.D., &amp; McCleod, C. (1997) Evolving an integration model: The Healthcare Partners experience.  In N.A. Cummings, J.L. Cummings, and J. Johnson (Eds.) Behavioral health in primary care: A guide for clinical integration (pp 121-144).  New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   Many experts believe this low completion rate is tied to the stigma that often surrounds mental health care, causing patients to deny or refuse to seek help for psychiatric needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mak | first1 = W.W.S. | last2 = Poon | first2 = C.Y.M. | last3 = Pun | first3 = L.Y.K. | last4 = Cheung | first4 = S.F. | year = 2007 | title = Meta-analysis of stigma and mental health | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 245–261 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.03.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a general rule, patients who do choose to address their mental health concerns express a preference for services in primary care likely due to its familiarity and less stigmatizing environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = A.J. | year = 2005 | title = Mental health treatment preferences of primary care patients | url = | journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 581–586 | doi = 10.1007/s10865-005-9019-2 | pmid = 16228695 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, as many medical providers will admit, their training has left them ill-prepared to appropriately treat the psychiatric sequalae that presents in their clinic.  The PCBH model has sought to address this dilemma by providing access to mental health services on site to more effectively target the biological, psychological, and social aspects of patient care.  Resulting from close collaboration between physicians and mental health providers, the patients’ needs are more adequately met by care that is more comprehensive and collaborative between physicians and mental health providers.  Furthermore, the patients are more likely to follow through with primary care services, with referral rates around 80-90%.&lt;ref name="Slay"/&gt;

==The Behavioral Health Consultant Model==
Behavioral Health Consultants are culturally competent generalists who provide treatment for a wide variety of mental health, psychosocial, motivational, and medical concerns, including management of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, smoking cessation, sleep hygiene, and diabetes among others.  BHCs also provide support and management for patients with severe and persistent mental illness and tend to be familiar with psychopharmacological interventions.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt; Paralleling general medicine, patients who require more extensive mental health treatment are typically referred to specialty care. BHC appointments are typically 15–30 minutes long with the goal of utilizing brief interventions to reduce functional impairment for the population as a whole.  BHCs tend to provide focused feedback to PCPs with succinct, action oriented recommendations to help effectively manage patients’ needs.  BHC interventions tend to be more cost effective&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James, L.C. (2009)  What administrators should know about the primary care setting. In L.C. James &amp; W.T. O’Donohue (Eds.). The primary care toolkit (pp 13-19).  N.Y.: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt; and offer increased access to care, with improved patient and provider satisfaction.

===Evidence Base For The BHC Model===
A comparison of an enhanced-referral system to a BHC model found that more than 80% of medical providers rated communication between themselves and the BHC as occurring "frequently," relative to less than 50% in an enhanced-referral model of care. Providers strongly preferred an integrated care model to the enhanced-referral model.&lt;ref name="Gallo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallo | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Zubritsky | first2 = C. | last3 = Maxwell | first3 = J. | last4 = Nazar | first4 = M. | last5 = Bogner | first5 = H.R. | last6 = Quijano | first6 = L.M | year = 2004 | title = Primary care clinicians evaluate integrated and referral models of behavioral health care for older adults: Results from a multisite effectiveness trial (PRISM-E) | url = | journal = Annals of Family Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 305–309 | display-authors = 6 | doi = 10.1370/afm.116 | pmid = 15335128 | last7 = Syropoulos | first7 = HJ | last8 = Cheal | first8 = KL | last9 = Chen | first9 = H | pmc = 1466686 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another single-site study at an urban community health center found that embedding BHCs resulted in reduced referrals to specialty mental health (8% of depressed patients were referred) along with improved adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the care of depression and reduced prescriptions for antidepressants.&lt;ref name="Serrano"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serrano | first1 = N | last2 = Monden | first2 = K. | year = 2011 | title = The effect of behavioral health consultation on the care of depression by primary care clinicians | url = | journal = Wisconsin Medical Journal | volume = 110 | issue = 3| pages = 113–118 | pmid = 21748995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, a recent literature review revealed that improved outcomes in mental health care were associated with several fundamental characteristics, including collaboration and co-location with PCP and mental health providers, as well as systematic follow-up, medication compliance, patient psycho-education, and patient input into treatment modality.&lt;ref name="Craven"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Craven |first1=MA|last2= Bland |first2=R |title=Better practices in collaborative mental health care: an analysis of the evidence base |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=51 |issue=6 Suppl 1 |pages=7S–72S |date=May 2006 |pmid=16786824 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general the number of empirical investigations that have examined the clinical impact and cost-offset of the BHC model is still limited, although a growing body of evidence supports the utility of other integrated behavior health programs (with varying degrees of integration) in academic settings, Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, and community health care settings.

====Depression Care====
Specifically targeting depression, Schulberg, Raue, &amp; Rollman (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schulberg | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Raue | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Rollman | first3 = B.

The authors concluded that evidence-based psychotherapies adapted for the primary care setting are comparable to pharmacotherapy alone and superior to PCP's usual care. The use of brief evidence-based psychotherapies, such as those reviewed by Schulberg et al., 2002, are fundamental within the PCBH model.  The PCBH model emphasizes a problem-focused and functional-contextual approach to assessment and treatment of behavioral health and mental disorders.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; Wolf and Hopko's (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolf | first1 = N.

Research also shows that providing basic training in CBT to PCPs is not enough to produce robust clinical outcomes (King et al., 2002);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Michael King | first1 = O.

====Anxiety Care====
Although less empirical attention has been directed toward improving treatment of anxiety disorders in primary care, Stanley et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stanley | first1 = M. | last2 = Beck | first2 = J. | last3 = Novy | first3 = D. | year = 2003| title = (2003).

Additionally, a collaborative care approach that packaged brief CBT with pharmacotherapy reduced disability, increased remitted symptoms, and decreased anxiety sensitivity for individuals diagnosed with panic disorder relative to usual care and demonstrated greater improvement in depression, anxiety, and disability measures at 6 month follow-up,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roy-Byrne | first1 = P. | last2 = Craske | first2 = M. | last3 = Stein | first3 = M.| year = 2005 | title = A randomized effectiveness trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy and medication for primary care panic disorder | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 290–8 |pmid=15753242 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.62.3.290 | pmc=1237029|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roy-Byrne | first1 = P. | last2 = Katon | first2 = W. | last3 = Cowley | first3 = D. | last4 = Russo | first4 = J. | year = 2001 | title = A randomized effectiveness trial of collaborative care for patients with panic disorder in primary care | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 58 | issue = 9| pages = 869–76 |pmid=11545671 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.58.9.869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, clinical guidelines for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in primary care recommend behavior therapy and/or SSRI.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

====Health Behavior Change====
In regard to other health behaviors, strict utilization of the BHC model has shown significant improvements in sleep difficulties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodie | first1 = J.

However, they also suggested that within a population-based model of care modest changes in behavioral health "translate to significant effects."

====Alternative Models Of Care====
Traditional Outpatient Psychotherapy: Commonly called "Specialty" care, traditional outpatient psychotherapy usually involves treatment of mental health concerns in an outpatient clinic or another setting independent of medical care.  Sessions are usually 50 minutes in length and the duration of treatment may vary from weeks to years depending on the mental health concern. Typically, little contact occurs between therapists and patients’ physicians or psychiatrists, and coordination of care may be difficult, time consuming, and expensive. The payment and access systems for specialty mental health are also usually distinct from and more cumbersome than that for primary care treatment.

Co-located Care Model: Behavioral health providers and PCPs practice within the same office or building but maintain separate care delivery systems, including records and treatment plans. However, behavioral health providers and PCPs may consult one another for enhanced treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

==Policy==
Funding has been a barrier to the implementation of the Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultant model.  The cost of treatment and lack of affordable health care has been a barrier for many people with mental illness to receive treatment.  In the private sector insurance market mental health treatment is often segregated from other medical care, isolated in separate systems of care and payment.  Typically this makes it more difficult for patients to access services readily, if at all.  For uninsured patients the United States federal government can provide (depending on eligibility criteria) Medicaid which provides insurance coverage for a large number of individuals with severe and persistent mental illness.  The federal government provides money to each state to fund Medicaid programs and provides general mandates on how the money must be spent.  Because the federal government has special relationships with [[Veteran's Administration]] hospitals and clinics and [[Federally Qualified Health Center|federally qualified health centers]] and because [[Bureau of Primary Health Care|several federal agencies]] have identified integrated care as key targets for improved primary care, the PCBH model has been able to take root in these systems whereas only a few PCBH programs exist in private insurance environments. One major barrier in some states (states can set some of their own rules with regard to Medicaid) is the prohibition of same-day billing.  This makes it impossible for a PCBH program since the fundamental concept behind PCBH is the provision of services (medical and mental health visit) on the same day.  Typically eligible professionals for Medicaid reimbursement in federally qualified health centers include psychiatrists, psychologists and licensed clinical social workers.  Access to care and payment tends to be less restrictive with Medicare, another federal program for persons without private insurance.

The other major issue impacting the development of the PCBH model is the dearth of well-trained mental health workers. At present professional training programs with an emphasis in primary care are limited in number which has led to the growth of internships of varying kinds to train students and retrain professionals (see training programs below).

===PCBH and Health Disparities In The United States===
As the population of the United States becomes more diverse, the approach to population-based care must also adjust accordingly.  Projections published by the U.S. Census Bureau estimate that by the year 2042 White, non-Hispanic people will no longer be the majority of the population in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Retrieved from:  https://www.census.gov/ prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The changing population of the United States is generating a need to incorporate cultural competence into the way primary care services are delivered. These changes in the population are concurrent with increasing evidence of disparities in the quality of care that is provided to historically underserved populations within the United States.  Underserved populations have low levels of access and utilization based on economic, cultural, and systemic barriers to care.

Behavioral Health providers in Primary Care settings have an opportunity to directly impact health care disparities by designing "…strategies to enhance cooperative or healthy behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haley | first1 = W.E. | last2 = McDaniel | first2 = S.H. | last3 = Bray | first3 = J.H. | last4 = Frank | first4 = R.G. | last5 = Heldring | first5 = M. | last6 = Johnson | first6 = S.B. | last7 = Lu | first7 = E.G. | year = 1998 | title = Psychological practice in primary care settings: Practical tips for clinicians | url = | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 237–244 | display-authors = 7 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7028.29.3.237 | last8 = Reed | first8 = Geoffrey M. | last9 = Wiggins | first9 = Jack G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The premise is that mismatches in models (i.e., expectations about illness and health interactions) between the patient and the health provider may render medical care ‘psychologically’ inaccessible to ethnic minorities, resulting in poorer health outcomes for these populations (possibly via noncompliance)."&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, T., &amp; Swartzman, L. (2001), Cross-cultural differences in illness models and expectations for the health care provider-client/patient interaction. In S. Kazarian and D. Evans (Eds.), Cultural health psychology, (pp. 45-61). San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strategies that help bridge mismatches improve treatment outcomes and make care more accessible for underserved populations.

By establishing a role in primary care, the front-line of health-care delivery, Behavioral Health providers gain direct access to patients and providers.  Healthy People 2010, published in 2007, recommended "that early intervention efforts to protect and promote mental health, including screening and the promotion of mental health awareness, become an essential component of primary care visits and school health assessments.".&lt;ref&gt;Wright, D., (2007).

(2004). Primary care, psychology, and primary care psychology. In Haas, L.J. (Ed.), Handbook of Primary Care Psychology, (pp. 5-19). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the difference in how patients, particularly those from underserved groups, may express their distress and respond to the stigma of mental illness providing Behavioral Health services through primary care will likely make services more psychologically and physically accessible.

Providing culturally-competent, population based care can difficult to conceptualize, particularly in the context of the fast-paced environment of primary care.  Hunter ''et al.'' propose "a patient-centered, culturally competent approach for effective communication and care…that includes the Explanatory model of health and illness, Social and environmental factors affecting adherence, Fears and concerns about medication and side effects, Treatment understanding model of culturally competent practice".&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;  By adopting this kind of approach, Behavioral Health providers can help primary care providers meet the medical, psychological, and cultural needs of the patient.

==History==
In the early 1960s, Kaiser Permanente, an early Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), uncovered that 60% of physician visits were either individuals who were somatizing stress or whose physical condition was exacerbated by emotional factors.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt; These findings prompted Kaiser to explore various strategies to better manage psychosocial complaints, with ultimate goal of cost reduction.  Psychotherapy, which was offered as a prepaid benefit, was studied as a method to reduce primary care visits while also more properly (and less expensively) addressing the problem at hand. Studies revealed that by participating in brief psychotherapy, medical utilization reduced by 65%.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;  The initiatives at Kaiser Permanent set in motion a large body of research on medical cost-offset, a term for the reduction in medical costs that occurs as a result of a patient receiving appropriately designed behavior health services in lieu of more expensive medical services.  The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded several replications examining medical cost offset in the years to follow, with reductions of cost around 30 to 65%.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, K.R., &amp; Vischi, T.R. (1980). The Bethesda Consensus Conference on Medical Offset. Alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health administration report. Rockville, MD: Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;   One important trend that emerged in this literature was the greater the collaboration between primary care, the better the cost offset.  Likewise, the more "traditional" the behavioral interventions, the less the medical cost offset.
 
In 1981, The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) sponsored the Hawaii Medicaid Project, a seven-year prospective study examining the impact of a new, collaborative behavioral health system among 36,000 Medicaid beneficiaries and 91,000 federal employees in Honolulu. This landmark trial compared the medical cost-offset among patients who received brief and targeted interventions, those who received a 52-session annual psychotherapy benefit, and those who received no treatment. The results showed that the brief, targeted interventions reduced saved $350 per patient per year while psychotherapy actually increased costs by $750 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pallack | first1 = M.S. | last2 = Cummings | first2 = N.A. | last3 = Dorken | first3 = H. | last4 = Henke | first4 = C.J. | year = 1994 | title = Medical costs, Medicaid, and managed mental health treatment: The Hawaii study | url = | journal = Managed Care Quarterly | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 64–70 |pmid=10134004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hawaii Medicaid Project became the prototype for cost offset research and spawned future projects among managed care organizations, with goal of reducing costs.  In 1987, Humana followed suit by studying brief behavioral intervention among Medicare recipients in Florida, with the intention of reducing medical utilization among recent widows and widowers.  Known as the Bereavement Program, Humana learned after 2 years $1400 could be saved per patient via brief group intervention for bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, N.A. (1997). Approaches in prevention in the behavioral health of older adults. In P. Hartman-Stein (Eds.) Innovative behavioral healthcare for older adults: A guide-for changing times (pp. 1-23). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, other HMOs and regional group practices began to integrate behavioral health services into primary care, including Kaiser Permanente, Healthcare partners, Group Health Cooperative of the Puget Sound,  Kaiser Group Health of Minnesota, and Duke University Medical Center.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;

In the years to follow, behavioral health integration started to gain support from a federal level, as VA systems began to conduct research around the impact of primary care psychologists, beginning with the Healthcare Network of Upstate New York (VISN2).  In the last decade, additional VA systems have followed suit with primary care behavioral health programs of their own to meet the increasing mental health demands of soldiers returning from war.  More recently, federal support has begun to take hold by increasing funding for integrated behavioral health services for various federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in the United States. Primary care behavioral health was seen as a solution in FQHCs to address the mental health needs of the Medicaid and uninsured populations, with the goal of better treatment and reduced overall costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3309">A '''rank abundance curve''' or '''Whittaker plot''' is a chart used by ecologists to display [[relative species abundance]], a component of [[biodiversity]]. It can also be used to visualize [[species richness]] and [[species evenness]]. It overcomes the shortcomings of [[diversity index|biodiversity indices]] that cannot display the relative role different variables played in their calculation.

[[Image:Rank abundance chart.JPG|thumb|A rank abundance curve]]

The curve is a 2D chart with relative abundance on the Y-axis and the abundance rank on the X-axis.
* X-axis: The abundance rank. The most abundant species is given rank 1, the second most abundant is 2 and so on.
* Y-axis: The relative abundance. Usually measured on a log scale, this is a measure of a species abundance (e.g., the number of individuals) relative to the abundance of other species.

==Interpreting a rank abundance curve==
The rank abundance curve visually depicts both species richness and species evenness. Species richness can be viewed as the number of different species on the chart i.e., how many species were ranked. Species evenness is reflected in the slope of the line that fits the graph (assuming a linear, i.e. logarithmic series, relationship). A steep gradient indicates low evenness as the high-ranking species have much higher abundances than the low-ranking species. A shallow gradient indicates high evenness as the abundances of different species are similar.

==Quantitative comparison of rank abundance curves==
Quantitative comparison of rank abundance curves of different communities can be done using RADanalysis package in [[R (programming language)|R]]. This package uses the [[max rank normalization]] method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Saeedghalati | first1 = M. | title = Quantitative Comparison of Abundance Structures of Generalized Communities: From B-Cell Receptor Repertoires to Microbiomes | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005362 | journal = PLoS Comput. Biol. | volume =  | issue =  | pages =  | year = 2017 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a rank abundance distribution is made by normalization of rank abundance curves of communities to the same number of ranks and then normalize the relative abundances to one.

[[File:Gustave Courbet 010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|''[[Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet]]'', 1854. A [[Realism (art movement)|Realist]] painting by [[Gustave Courbet]]]]

'''Realism''', sometimes called '''naturalism''', in [[the arts]] is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without [[artificiality]] and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements.  Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.

In the visual arts, illusionistic realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. But realist or naturalist works of art may, as well or instead of illusionist realism, be "realist" in their subject-matter, and emphasize the mundane, ugly or sordid.  This is typical of the 19th-century  [[Realism (art movement)|Realist movement]] that began in France in the 1850s, after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[social realism]], [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], or [[kitchen sink realism]]. The Realist painters rejected [[Romanticism]], which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late [[18th century]].

There have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the [[opera]] style of [[Verismo (music)|verismo]], [[literary realism]], [[Realism (theatre)|theatrical realism]], and [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist cinema]]. 

==Visual arts==
[[File:The Arnolfini Portrait, détail (2).jpg|thumb|left|Realist or illusionistic detail of the [[convex mirror]] in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], 1434]]
Realism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects i.e., it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called [[Naturalism (visual art)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization|naturalism]], [[mimesis]] or [[Illusionism (art)|illusionism]]. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].  It becomes especially marked in European painting in the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and other artists in the 15th century.  However such "realism" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century [[Realism art movement]] painters such as [[Gustave Courbet]] are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of [[academic painting]], which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes.  It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances.  Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and "veristic" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between "realistic" (usually related to visual appearance) and "realist" is often useful, as is the term "illusionistic" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aSBAUzb8SokC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Realism+painting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sfslUYLPDKK30QXLmIHIAQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Realism%20painting&amp;f=false Stremmel, Kerstin,  ''Realism''], pp. 6–9, 2004, Taschen, {{ISBN|3822829420|978-3822829424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finocchio, Ross.

===Illusionistic realism===
[[File:Frederic Leighton - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lord Leighton]]'s ''[[Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna]]'' of 1853–55 is at the end of a long tradition of illusionism in painting, but is not Realist in the sense of Courbet's work of the same period.]]

The development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art.  It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.

The art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] and [[Early Renaissance]] periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, [[Idealism (art)|idealism]] remained the norm.

The accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked "realism", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquets]] in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].

===Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects===
[[File:Simon Bening (Flemish - Gathering Twigs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcutting, miniature from a set of [[Labours of the Months]] by [[Simon Bening]], c. 1550]]

The depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. [[Drolleries]] in the margins of medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times.

Early Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of [[Flanders]], and in some of these, notably the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the [[Merode Altarpiece]], by [[Robert Campin]] and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects.  However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]] in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from [[books of hours]], concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing [[landscape art]] and the depiction of everyday working-class people.
[[File:Annibale Carracci - Butcher's Shop - WGA04409.jpg|thumb|[[Annibale Carracci]], ''The Butcher's Shop'', early 1580s]]

In the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included [[Pieter Aertsen]] and his nephew [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young [[Annibale Carracci]] in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with [[Bartolomeo Passerotti]] somewhere between the two. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life.  Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in [[genre painting]] in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] sprouting several [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|different subgenres]] of such scenes, the [[Bamboccianti]] (though mostly from the [[Low Countries]]) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of [[bodegones]], and the introduction of unidealized peasants into [[history paintings]] by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and [[Velázquez]].  The [[Le Nain brothers]] in France and many Flemish artists including [[Adriaen Brouwer]] and [[David Teniers the Elder]] and [[David Teniers the Younger|Younger]] painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women.

Much art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of [[Old master print|prints]], was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message.  From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as [[Gustave Doré]] to show the horrors of city slums.  Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris.

Medieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of [[marine painting]] largely disappeared in [[fine art]] until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] and [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few [[railway]] scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment.

[[American realism]], a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.

===Realist movement===
{{main|Realism (art movement)}}
The Realist movement began in the mid-19th century as a reaction to [[Romanticism]] and [[History painting]]. In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. Its chief exponents were [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |title=NGA Realism movement |publisher=Nga.gov |date=1941-01-06 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144138/http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/realist-movement |title=National Gallery glossary, Realism movement |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://impressionist1877.tripod.com/realism.htm |title=Philosophy of Realism |publisher=Impressionist1877.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ross Finocchio, formerly of the Department of European Paintings at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of [[Émile Zola]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], and [[Gustave Flaubert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Nineteenth-Century French Realism &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Realist movement had equivalents in all other Western countries, developing somewhat later. In particular the [[Peredvizhniki]] or ''Wanderers'' group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ivan Shishkin]], and had a great influence on Russian art. In Britain artists such as [[Hubert von Herkomer]] and [[Luke Fildes]] had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues.

===Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization===
[[File:La familia de Carlos IV.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Goya]], ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', 1800–01]]

Realism or naturalism as a style meaning the honest, unidealizing depiction of the subject, can be used in depicting any type of subject, without any commitment to treating the typical or everyday.  Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and [[Baroque]]. [[Demetrius of Alopece]] was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the [[Ancient Roman Republic]] even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. [[Goya]]'s portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons.

[[File:Eilif Peterssen-Laksefiskeren (1889).jpg|thumb|left|[[Eilif Peterssen]], ''The Salmon Fisher'', 1889.]]
A recurring trend in [[Christian art]] was "realism" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all [[Christ]] and his physical sufferings in his [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]].  Following trends in [[devotional literature]], this developed in the [[Late Middle Ages]], where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf.  These were especially found in Germany and [[Central Europe]].  After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the [[Baroque]], especially in Spanish sculpture.

Renaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 30–32, and the whole short chapter on Leonardo&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was an early idealizer, stressing the typical,&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 14–20&lt;/ref&gt; with others such as [[Michelangelo]] supporting selection of the most beautiful – he refused to make portraits for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 59–64&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henri BIVA, ca 1905-06, Matin à Villeneuve, Salon 1906 postcard - original painting, oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm, private collection.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Biva]], c. 1905–06, ''[[Matin à Villeneuve|Matin à Villeneuve (From Waters Edge)]]'', oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm.]]
In the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative "classical-idealism" of [[the Carracci]] and the "naturalist" style of the [[Caravaggisti]], or followers of [[Caravaggio]], who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used "naturalist" as a self-description. [[Bellori]], writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to "Those who glory in the name of naturalists" (''naturalisti'').&lt;ref&gt;"Quelle che si gloriamo del nome de naturalisti", quoted in Raben, 134, note 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century "Naturalism" or the "'''Naturalist school'''" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of "naturalist" as a student of [[Natural history]], as the [[biological sciences]] were then generally known.  The originator of the term was the French art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]], who in 1863 announced that: "The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science".&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;Needham&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]] adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of [[Impressionism]], but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

The term "continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of [[Modernism]] and also was not [[Academic art]].  The later periods of the French [[Barbizon School]] and the [[Düsseldorf school of painting]], with its students from many countries, and in 20th-century American [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] are movements which are often also described as "Naturalist", although the term is rarely used of British painting.  Some recent art historians have deepened the confusion by claiming either Courbet or the Impressionists for the label.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

==Literature==
{{Main|Literary realism}}
Broadly defined as "the faithful representation of reality",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Donna M. Campbell |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/realism.htm |title=Realism in American Literature |publisher=Wsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realism as a literary movement was based on "[[objective reality]]." It focused on showing everyday activities and life, primarily among the middle or lower class society, without romantic idealization or dramatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Realism |title=Realism definition of Realism in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be regarded as the general attempt to depict subjects as they are considered to exist in third person [[objective reality]], without embellishment or interpretation and "in accordance with secular, [[empirical]] rules."&lt;ref&gt;in so far as such subjects are "explicable in terms of natural causation without resort to supernatural or divine intervention" [[#refMorris2003|Morris, 2003]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MFAW6dh24ZwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=realism&amp;ei=ROOkS_LBA5TszASD95nXCA&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the approach inherently implies a belief that such [[reality]] is [[ontological]]ly independent of human kind's conceptual schemes, linguistic practices and beliefs, and thus can be known (or knowable) to the artist, who can in turn represent this 'reality' faithfully. As [[Ian Watt]] states, modern realism "begins from the position that truth can be discovered by the individual through the senses" and as such "it has its origins in [[Descartes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], and received its first full formulation by [[Thomas Reid]] in the middle of the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWatt1957|Watt, 1957]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

While the preceding [[Romantic era]] was also a reaction against the values of the [[Industrial Revolution]], realism was in its turn a reaction to romanticism, and for this reason it is also commonly derogatorily referred as "traditional" "bourgeois realism".&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"/&gt; Some writers of [[Victorian literature]] produced works of realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian Literature|url=http://www.online-literature.com/periods/victorian.php|publisher=The Literature Network|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rigidities, conventions, and other limitations of "bourgeois realism," prompted in their turn the revolt later labeled as [[Modernist literature|modernism]]; starting around 1900, the driving motive of modernist literature was the criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and world view, which was countered with an antirationalist, antirealist and antibourgeois program.&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"&gt;[[John Barth]] (1979) ''[[The Literature of Replenishment]]'', later republished in ''[[The Friday Book]]' '(1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff75"&gt;[[Gerald Graff]] (1975) ''Babbitt at the Abyss: The Social Context of Postmodern.

==Theatre==
{{Main|Theatrical realism}}
Theatrical realism is said to have first emerged in European drama in the 19th century as an offshoot of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the age of science.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Our Dramatic Heritage, Volume 6|last=Hill|first=Philip|publisher=Associated University Presses|year=1992|isbn=978-0838634219|location=Cranbury, NJ|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of Theatre History|last=Kuritz|first=Paul|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1988|isbn=978-0135478615|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also specifically cited the invention of photography as the basis of the realist theater&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Theatre: A Concise Introduction, 3rd edition|last=Downs|first=William|last2=Wright|first2=Lou Anne|last3=Ramsey|first3=Erik|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2013|isbn=978-1111348311|location=Boston, MA|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre Histories: An Introduction, 2nd edition|last=Zarrilli|first=Phillip|last2=McConachie|first2=Bruce|last3=Williams|first3=Gary Jay|last4=Sorgenfrei|first4=Carol|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0415462235|location=Oxon|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others view that the association between realism and drama is far older as demonstrated by the principles of dramatic forms such as the presentation of the physical world that closely matches reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary British Drama|last=Lane|first=David|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0748638215|location=Edinburgh|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of realism in the [[theatre]] was to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life. In its dramas, people emerge as victims of forces larger than themselves, as individuals confronted with a rapidly accelerating world.&lt;ref&gt;Simard, Rodney. ''Postmodern Drama: Contemporary Playwrights in America and Britain.''  New York: UP of America, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; These pioneering playwrights were unafraid to present their characters as ordinary, impotent, and unable to arrive at answers to their predicaments. This type of art represents what we see with our human eyes. [[Anton Chekhov|Anton Chekov]], for instance, used camera works to reproduce an uninflected [[slice of life]], exposing the rhetorical and suasive character of realistic theatricality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Drama and the Rhetoric of Theater|last=Worthen|first=W.B.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0520286870|location=Berkeley, CA|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Thomas Postlewait noted that throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there were numerous joinings of [[melodrama]]tic and realistic forms and functions, which could be demonstrated in the way melodramatic elements existed in realistic forms and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Theatre|last=Saxon|first=Theresa|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0748645206|location=Edinburgh|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, realism in drama preceded fictional realism by about two decades as theater historians identified the first impetus toward realism during the late 1870s and early 1880s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Realism and American Drama, 1880–1940|last=Murphy|first=Brenda|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0521327114|location=Cambridge|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its development is also attributed to [[William Dean Howells]] and [[Henry James]] who served as the spokesmen for realism as well as articulator of its aesthetic principles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The realistic approach to theater collapsed into [[nihilism]] and the [[Absurdism|absurd]] after World War II.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

==Cinema==
{{See also|Neorealism (art)|Poetic realism|Socialist realism}}

[[Italian Neorealism]] was a cinematic movement incorporating elements of realism that developed in post-WWII Italy. Notable Neorealists included [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Luchino Visconti]], and [[Roberto Rossellini]]. Realist films generally focus on social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of realism in film: seamless realism and aesthetic realism. Seamless realism tries to use narrative structures and film techniques to create a "reality effect" to maintain its [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic realism, which was first called for by French filmmakers in the 1930s and promoted by [[Andre Bazin]] in the 1950s, acknowledges that a "film cannot be fixed to mean what it shows", as there are multiple realisms; as such, these filmmakers use location shooting, natural light and non-professional actors to ensure the viewer can make up her/his own choice based on the film, rather than being manipulated into a "preferred reading".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siegfried Kracauer]] is also notable for arguing that realism is the most important function of cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dudley Andrew]], ''The Major Film Theories: An Introduction'', Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 1976, Part II.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic realist filmmakers use [[long shot]]s, [[deep focus]] and eye-level 90 degree shots to reduce manipulation of what the viewer sees.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; Italian neorealism filmmakers from after WWII took the existing realist film approaches from France and Italy that emerged in the 1960s and used the to create a politically-oriented cinema. French filmmakers made some politically-oriented realist films in the 1960s, such as the [[cinéma vérité]] and documentary films of [[Jean Rouch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, British, French and German new waves of filmmaking produced "slice-of-life" films (e.g., [[kitchen sink drama]]s in the UK).&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan.

==Opera==
{{main|Verismo}}
Verismo was a post-Romantic operatic tradition associated with Italian composers such as [[Pietro Mascagni]], [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]], [[Umberto Giordano]], [[Francesco Cilea]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]]. They sought to bring the naturalism of influential late 19th-century writers such as [[Émile Zola]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Henrik Ibsen]] into opera. This new style presented true-to-life drama that featured gritty and flawed lower-class protagonists&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Chronology Of Western Classical Music 1600-2000|last=Paxman|first=Jon|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1783231218|location=London|pages=425–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some described it as a heightened portrayal of a realistic event.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Tanner's Worth of Tune: Rediscovering the Post-war British Musical|last=Wright|first=Adrian|publisher=The Boydell Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1843835424|location=Suffolk, UK|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an account considered [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Luisa Miller]]'' and ''[[La traviata|La Traviata]]'' as the first stirrings of the verismo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tosca|last=Carner|first=Mosco|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0521228244|location=Cambridge|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; some claimed that it began in 1890 with the first performance of [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', peaked in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;"Verismo" in Stanley Sadie (ed.) ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians'', London: Macmillan/New York: Grove, 1980, vol. 19 p. 670, {{ISBN|1561591742}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, which dealt with the themes of infidelity, revenge, and violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Verismo also reached Britain where pioneers included the [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] theatrical partnership of the [[dramatist]] [[W. S. Gilbert]] and the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] (1842–1900).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Specifically, their play ''[[Iolanthe]]'' is considered a realistic representation of the nobility although it included fantastical elements.

'''Religiocentrism''' or '''religio-centrism''' is defined ([[Raymond Corsini|Corsini]] 1999:827) as the "conviction that a person's own religion is more important or superior to other religions." In analogy to [[ethnocentrism]], religiocentrism is a [[value-neutral]] term for psychological [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]].

==Terminology==
The [[neologism]] ''religiocentrism'' combines ''[[wikt:religio-|religio-]]'' (e.g., [[wikt:religiophobia|religiophobia]]) and ''[[wikt:-centrism|-centrism]]'' (e.g., [[Eurocentrism]]). [[Derivation (linguistics)|Derivations]] include ''religiocentric'' or ''religio-centric''.

Although the precise origins of ''religiocentrism'' and ''religiocentric'' remain unclear, the words have been used since the early 20th century. The American economist Adrian Augustus Holtz (1917:15) described how early German school reforms were "carried on in a way that allowed for a religio-centric educational system." [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (1920:307) said, "Maud Dyer was neurotic, religiocentric, faded; her emotions were moist, and her figure was unsystematic."

The related term ''[[Christocentric]]'' theologically means "forms of Christianity that concentrate on the teaching of [[Jesus Christ]]", but is sometimes used as a near [[synonym]] of ''religiocentric''. For instance (Hamilton 2002), "No matter where it appears, government-sponsored Christocentrism, or even religiocentrism, undermines this nation's ideals."

==Academic studies==
Religiocentrism is commonly discussed in contexts of [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[anthropology]].

The Australian social psychologists John J. Ray and Dianne Doratis defined religiocentrism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ethnocentrism" is the social scientist's value-neutral term for ethnic or racial prejudice. It refers to ethnically-based sentiments of exclusiveness without any implication of their moral worth or justifiability... By analogy, the term religiocentrism is derived here to mean ''religiously'' based sentiments of exclusiveness—beliefs that one should marry within one's own religion, work with members of one's own religion, and in general prefer members of one's own religion above others. This will also entail ''ipso facto'' devaluative judgments of other religions. (1971:170)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ray and Doratis designed a groundbreaking attitude scale to measure religiocentrism and ethnocentrism. Their religiocentrism scale comprises 33 items (for instance, "I think my religion is nearer to the truth than any other" and "Most Moslems, Buddhists and Hindus are very stupid and ignorant"), with five-point [[Likert scale]] psychometric response options from "Strongly agree" (Scored 5) to "Strongly disagree" (1). To verify [[internal consistency]] among respondents, 11 items were reverse scored ("It makes no difference to me what religion my friends are" is the converse of "I think that it's better if you stick to friends of the same religion as your own"), resulting in a [[Kuder–Richardson Formula 20|reliability coefficient]] of .88 among 154 first-year university students. The authors tested attitudes among Australian fifth-form students in two Catholic and two public schools, and discovered that neither ethnocentrism nor religiocentrism showed any correlation with religious background. Ray and Doratis concluded (1971:178), "Ethnocentrism, religiocentrism and religious conservatism were all shown to be separate and distinct factors of attitudes in their own right. They are not just three aspects of the one thing. Religiocentric people do however tend to be both religiously conservative and ethnocentric."

The Hungarian-Jewish historian and anthropologist [[Raphael Patai]] mentions religiocentrism as a variable in relationships between religion and culture, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Each religion also has a definite outlook on its own value in relation to that of other religions. Its relationship to other religions may range from complete toleration to the complete lack of it, with a corresponding range of self-evaluation. This variable, best called religio-centrism (on the analogy of ethnocentrism), can serve as an additional avenue of approach to the study of our subject. (1954:234)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Comparing Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, and Western cultures, Patai finds,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion in the Far East is characterized by the absence of religio-centrism: there is a marked toleration of other religions and a mutual borrowing and influencing; in the Middle East and in the West there is a high degree of religio-centrism, with intolerance and scorn of other religions: each religion is exclusive and regards itself as the "one and only" true faith. (1954:252)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a later survey of the potentials for world peace, Patai differentiated the major modern religions between "theistic" and "nontheistic".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The three great monotheistic religions of the Middle East and the West, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, are the foremost theistic religions and the dominant faiths of about one half of mankind. Common to all theistic religions is a pronounced religiocentrism, expressed most poignantly in the conviction that one's own religion is the one and only true one, and that all the other faiths are erroneous and hence depreciable. In this conviction were rooted the great religious wars which pitted, not only Muslims against Christians, but also various Muslim sects against one another, and likewise made various Christian denominations bitter enemies... The situation is more hopeful in the great nontheistic religions of South, Southeast, and East Asia. These religions, notably Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Confucianism, and Taoism, lack the element of self-assurance and certainty that each is the exclusive possessor of the only truth. (1987:24-25)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response, [[Andrew Wilson (academic)|Andrew Wilson]], Professor of Scriptural Studies of the [[Unification Theological Seminary]], criticized Patai's opinion as theologically plausible but historically erroneous, citing examples (1987:28) of "rampant communal violence between Hindus and Buddhists in Sri Lanka and between Sikhs and Hindus in India."

Religiocentrism has a specialized meaning for sociologists (Chalfant, Beckley, and Palmer 1994:51). "This term is related to a common word used in sociological literature, ''ethnocentrism''. Similarly, we might refer to feelings of rightness and superiority resulting from religious affiliation as ''religiocentrism''. Religiocentrism inhibits the ability of a society to achieve adaptation, integration and goal-attainment."

[[Mohammed Abu-Nimer]], the Director of the Peacebuilding and Development Institute at [[American University]], distinguishes between religiocentrism and "religiorelativism".
&lt;blockquote&gt;A religiorelative person is firm in his/her belief that other religions have the right to exist and be practiced, even if such norms and beliefs are contradictory to one's own set of religious beliefs. Such a person is prone not to engage in violence or discriminatory actions against the others. In contrast, a religiocentric person is a believer who denies other religions' "truth" and who holds an absolute truth that leaves no room for different religious practices. Such a person becomes more prone to dehumanize, exclude, and discriminate against other religious groups and individuals. Often, as a result of negative and destructive exposure and experience with conflict and war, religiocentric beliefs not only are exacerbated and easily translated into violence against the enemy (that is, the different other), but also actually grow and prohibit human and peaceful contact with the other. However, there are conflict resolution and peace-building activities and forums that can assist peace workers in such settings to transform a religiocentric into a religiorelative believer. (2004:497)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abu-Nimer (2004:479-501) analyzes three typical reactions of a religiocentric person to another religion: [[denial]] (e.g., Israel not allowing Arabs to purchase or use state land), [[defense mechanisms]] ("There is no salvation outside the Church"), and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]] ("We are all the children of God").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="988">'''Salt equivalent''' is usually quoted on food [[nutrition]] information tables on food labels, and is a different way of defining sodium intake, noting that salt is chemically [[sodium chloride]].

To convert from sodium to the approximate salt equivalent, multiply sodium content by 2.5:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_\mathrm{NaCl}}{m_\mathrm{Na}} = \frac{m_\mathrm{Na}+m_\mathrm{Cl}}{m_\mathrm{Na}} \approx \frac{23\mathrm{u} + 35.5\mathrm{u}}{23\mathrm{u}} = \frac{58.5}{23} \approx 2.5&lt;/math&gt;

==Types of stellar collisions and mergers==

===Type Ia supernova===
White dwarfs are the remnants of low-mass stars and, if they form a binary system with another star, they can cause large stellar explosions known as [[type Ia supernova]]. The normal route by which this happens involves a white dwarf drawing material off a [[main sequence]] or [[red giant]] star to form an [[accretion disc]]. However, a much rarer brand of type Ia supernova occurs when two white dwarfs orbit each other closely.&lt;ref name = "González Hernández"&gt;{{cite journal | last = González Hernández | first = J. I. |author2=Ruiz-Lapuente, P. |author3=Tabernero, H. M. |author4=Montes, D. |author5=Canal, R. |author6=Méndez, J. |author7= Bedin, L.

When they finally merge, if their combined mass approaches or exceeds the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], [[carbon-burning process|carbon fusion]] is ignited, raising the temperature. Since a white dwarf consists of [[degenerate matter]], there is no safe equilibrium between [[Kinetic theory of gases|thermal pressure]] and the weight of overlying layers of the star. Because of this, [[thermal runaway|runaway fusion reactions]] rapidly heat up the interior of the combined star and spread, causing a [[supernova explosion]].&lt;ref name = "González Hernández"/&gt; In a matter of seconds, all of the white dwarf's mass is thrown into space.&lt;ref name=TXT&gt;Freedman, Roger A., Robert M. Geller, William J. Kaufmann III(2009). ''The Universe 9th Edition'',p.543-545. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York. {{ISBN|1-4292-3153-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutron star mergers===
{{Main|Neutron star merger}}
Neutron star mergers occur in a fashion similar to the rare brand of [[type Ia supernova]]e resulting from merging white dwarfs. When two [[neutron star]]s orbit each other closely, they spiral inward as time passes due to gravitational radiation. When they meet, their merger leads to the formation of either a heavier neutron star or a black hole, depending on whether the mass of the remnant exceeds the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]]. This creates a magnetic field that is trillions of times stronger than that of Earth, in a matter of one or two milliseconds. Astronomers believe that this type of event is what creates [[Gamma-ray burst#Short gamma-ray bursts|short gamma-ray bursts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/500535a|pmid=23985867|title=Astrophysics: Radioactive glow as a smoking gun|journal=Nature|volume=500|issue=7464|pages=535–6|year=2013|last1=Rosswog|first1=Stephan|bibcode=2013Natur.500..535R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[kilonova|kilonovae]].&lt;ref name=Metzger2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzger, B. D. |author2=Martínez-Pinedo, G. |author3=Darbha, S. |author4=Quataert, E. |author5=Arcones, A. |author6=Kasen, D. |author7=Thomas, R. |author8=Nugent, P. |author9=Panov, I. V. |author10=Zinner, N.

===Thorne–Żytkow objects===
{{main article|Thorne–Żytkow object}}
If a neutron star collides with [[red giant]] of sufficiently low mass and density, both can survive in the form of a peculiar hybrid known as Thorne–Żytkow object, with a neutron star surrounded by a red giant.

=== Binary star mergers ===
{{Main|KIC 9832227}}
About half of all the stars in the sky are part of binary systems, with two stars orbiting each other.  Some binary stars orbit each other so closely that they share the same atmosphere, giving the system a peanut shape.  While most contact binary stars are stable, a few have become unstable and have merged in the past for reasons not well understood (see relevant section below).

==Formation of planets==
When two low-mass stars in a binary system merge this creates an &lt;!-- EXCRETION DISK IS NOT A TYPO PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE--&gt;[[excretion disk]]&lt;!-- EXCRETION DISK IS NOT A TYPO--&gt; from which new planets can form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1102.3336|last1= Martin|first1= E. L.|title= A binary merger origin for inflated hot Jupiter planets|journal= Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume= 535|pages= A50|last2=  Spruit|first2= H. C.|last3=  Tata|first3= R.|year= 2011|doi= 10.1051/0004-6361/201116907|bibcode= 2011A&amp;A...535A..50M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
While the concept of stellar collision has been around for several generations of astronomers, only the development of new technology has made it possible for it to be more objectively studied. For example, in 1764, a cluster of stars known as [[Messier 30]] was discovered by astronomer [[Charles Messier]]. In the twentieth century, astronomers concluded that the cluster was approximately 13 billion years old.&lt;ref name= VAMP&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Stellar+collisions+and+vampirism+give+blue+straggler+stars+a+%22cosmic...-a0215188997 "Stellar Collisions and vampirism give blue stragglers stars a 'cosmic facelift'"], [[Asian News International]], 29 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] resolved the individual stars of Messier 30. With this new technology, astronomers discovered that some stars, known as “[[blue straggler]]s”, appeared younger than other stars in the cluster.&lt;ref name=VAMP/&gt; Astronomers then hypothesized that stars may have “collided”, or “merged”, giving them more fuel so they continued fusion while fellow stars around them started going out.&lt;ref name=VAMP/&gt;

==Stellar collisions and the Solar System==
While stellar collisions may occur very frequently in certain parts of the galaxy, the likelihood of a collision involving the [[Sun]] is very small. A probability calculation predicts the rate of stellar collisions involving the Sun is 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref name='DAB'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/stellar_collisions_000601.html | title = Researchers Claim First Proof That Stars Collide | accessdate = 15 January 2014 | last = Lucentini | first = Jack | date = 1 June 2000 | website = [[Space.com]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040419035725/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/stellar_collisions_000601.html | archivedate = 19 April 2004|quote="By one calculation, the sun is likely to have one crash per 10,000 trillion, trillion years (that’s 28 zeros), and it will burn out on its own accord much sooner than that."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For comparison, the age of the universe is of the order 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years. The likelihood of close encounters with the Sun is also small. The rate is estimated by the formula:
:''N'' ~ 4.2 · ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Myr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
where ''N'' is the number of encounters per million years that come within a radius ''D'' of the Sun in [[parsec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Perturbation of the Oort Cloud by Close Stellar Approaches | display-authors=1 | date=24 August 1998 | last1=Garcia-Sanchez | first1=J. | last2=Weissman | first2=P.

P. | title=Asteroid and Comet Dynamics | location=Tatrauska Lomnica, Slovak Republic | hdl=2014/19368}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the mean radius of the Earth's orbit, 1 [[astronomical unit|AU]], is {{nowrap|4.82 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; parsecs}}.

Our star will likely not be directly affected by such an event, but the Earth may be easily affected by a nearby collision. Astronomers say that if a stellar collision happens within 100 light years of the Earth, the resulting gamma-ray burst could possibly destroy all life on Earth.&lt;ref name=DAB/&gt; This is still very unlikely though because there are no stellar clusters this close to the Solar System.

==KIC 9832227 and binary star mergers==
[[KIC 9832227]] is an example of an eclipsing [[contact binary]] star system.  It is mainly composed of two stars orbiting each other so closely that they share the same atmosphere, giving the system a peanut shape.  While astronomers have found hundreds of such contact binaries, KIC 9832227 is unusual in that it is unstable.  The merger of the cores of the two stars is predicted to be observed in 2022, exploding in the form of a [[luminous red nova]] in [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Kinemuchi |first=Karen |date=1 October 2013 |title=To Pulsate or to Eclipse?

[[File:StephaneLupasco.jpg|thumb|Stéphane Lupasco]]
'''Stéphane Lupasco''' (born '''Ştefan Lupaşcu'''; 11 August 1900 – 7 October 1988) was a [[Romania]]n [[philosopher]] who developed [[non-Aristotelian logic]].

==Early years==
Stéphane Lupasco was born in [[Bucharest]] on 11 August 1900. His family belonged to the old [[Moldavia]]n [[aristocracy]]. His father was a lawyer and politician, but it was his mother, a pianist and student of [[César Franck]], who established the family in [[Paris]] in 1916. After high school at the [[Lycée Buffon]], he studied [[philosophy]], [[biology]] and [[physics]] at the [[Sorbonne]] and, briefly, [[law]]. He participated fully in the artistic and intellectual life of Paris in the 20s and 30s and defended his State Doctoral Thesis in 1935.

==Academic career==
In 1946, he was named Research Assistant at the [[French National Science Research Centre]], a post he was obliged to leave ten years later because of the inability of the Centre to decide in which Scientific Section his work belonged! The next ten or fifteen years were those of greatest acceptance of his work by the public and other thinkers, but unfortunately not by mainstream logicians and philosophers. His ''Trois Matières'', published in 1960 was a bestseller, and people began calling Lupasco the [[Descartes]], the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], the [[Hegel]] of the 20th Century, a new [[Claude Bernard]], a new [[Bergson]], etc. He continued to publish books in the 70s and 80s, the last being ''L’Homme et ses Trois Ethiques'' in 1986, two years before his death on October 7, 1988 in Paris. An Award of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1984 was among the few honors that came to Lupasco during his lifetime. Lupasco was one of the founding members of the International Center for Transdisciplinary Research (Centre International de Recherches et Etudes Transdisciplinaires (CIRET)), founded in Paris in 1987 by [[Basarab Nicolescu]], [[Edgar Morin]], [[René Berger]], [[Michel Random]] and other key figures of the French intelligentsia. As Nicolescu has recalled, Lupasco was deeply affected by the stubborn resistance of the academic community to honest debate and discussion of his new principles and postulates, and it is with an understandable bitterness that Lupasco saw in this resistance another example of the operation of his principles.

==Summary of work==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2011}}
Lupasco’s style as an author is not an easy one, and requires the uninterrupted attention of the reader. It is not infrequent to find sentences of almost a page in length, containing multiply nested clauses. His writing is extremely dense in terms of the ideas and meaning of each successive phrase, with only occasional illustrative examples. Lupasco makes many references to his prior publications, unfortunately, often without adequate indexation. As Nicolescu has remarked, Lupasco’s exclusion from French academic life had both advantages and disadvantages: Lupasco was freed from the constraints of teaching and publication of research papers in a rigid format, and he obviously did not find it necessary to apply the discipline of providing references to his sources. In the ''Psychic Universe'', published when Lupasco was seventy-nine, one sees nothing about current work in psychiatry. (Lupasco unfortunately did not read English well, and hence no references to the “anti”-psychiatry of [[R. D. Laing]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], close in spirit to his work, are to be found.) A recent study by Brenner (2008) up-dates Lupasco’s work and shows its relevance to current issues in science and philosophy, as well as logic.

==Influence==
Lupasco was not well served by the (few) exegetes that had looked closely at his work. Only one book, by the sociologist [[Marc Beigbeder]], presents both a substantial description of Lupasco’s theory and development of it as a “logic of society”. A brief monograph by the philosopher [[Benjamin Fondane]], dating from 1944 (just prior to his deportation and death) and published in 1998, discusses the limitations of Lupasco’s view of [[affectivity]] and [[ontology]]. A book by an obscure English artist, [[George Melhuish]], uses Lupasco’s ideas to develop his own concept of the structure of the universe, a sympathetic but not very rigorous reading of his work. Aside from Nicolescu's personal library it has been claimed that access to these and several other texts  are otherwise unavailable. A complete understanding of, for example, Lupasco’s analysis of those precursors that [[André Glucksmann]] has called “Les Maîtres Penseurs” – [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Marx]] – must be sought in several different books. The attention of the reader is rewarded, however, by Lupasco’s regular restatements of his basic theses, often in a way that is more economic, meaningful and coherent.

In his introduction to Lupasco’s ''The Principle of Antagonism and the Logic of Energy'', Nicolescu points out that once the reader gets beyond the (relatively few) mathematical formulas in this book, Lupasco’s language is perfectly accessible. “It exemplifies, in a self-referential manner, the ternary aspects of actualization, potentialization and included middle which give it the charm and the privilege of incantations that are at the same time scientific, philosophical and poetic.”

Summarizing briefly, stimulated by [[Einstein]]'s works and [[quantum]] theory, Lupasco founded a new [[logic]], questioning the ''[[tertium non datur]]'' principle of classical logic. He introduced a third state, going beyond the [[String duality|duality]] principle, the T-state. The T-state is  neither 'actual', nor 'potential' (categories replacing in Lupasco's system the 'true' or 'false' values of standard bivalent logic), but a resolution of the two contradictory elements at a higher level of reality or complexity. Lupasco generalised his logic to [[physics]] and [[epistemology]] and above all to a new theory of [[consciousness]].

==Recent studies==
A key reference in French is the compendium of 1999, "Stéphane Lupasco -The Man and the Work" by H. Badescu and B. Nicolescu. The first comprehensive update and comparison of Lupasco's thought in English is the 2008 book by J. E. Brenner, "Logic in Reality". Other useful new references are the combined papers of a Symposium on Lupasco in 2009 "At the Confluence of Two Cultures: Lupasco Today," in French and a biographical paper by Brenner, "The Philosophical Logic of Stéphane Lupasco (1900 - 1988)" in English.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">'''The Lovers' Guide''' is a sex and relationships advice brand, produced by Lifetime Productions International Ltd, which launched with the release of the first ''Lovers' Guide'' video in 1991. Presented by the sexologist Dr Andrew Stanway, and produced by [[Robert Page (Lifetime Group)|Robert Page]] and William Campbell, this became the only non-fiction film to top the UK video charts; it sold 1.3 million copies in the UK and went into 13 languages and 22 countries around the world. The release caused controversy. While the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] (British Board of Film Classification) granted the title an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]], which would normally be a license for general UK distribution, this was technically merely advisory and the producer, Robert Page, faced charges of obscenity, which were subsequently dropped.

''The Lovers' Guide'' is distinct for using explicit video material to illustrate the instructional points being made. While the explicit nature of the visual content would usually warrant an [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate]] in the UK, restricting sales to licensed sex shops, all ''Lovers' Guide'' videos and DVDs have been granted 18 certificates.

''Lovers' Guide'' products has expanded to ten further DVDs, a book, an encyclopaedia, two CD-ROMs and cassettes and CDs of the soundtracks. It has also been shown on encrypted television. These have been produced, distributed and retailed with partners such as W.H. Smith, Woolworths, Carlton, Bloomsbury, Warners, Sony and Universal. The brand website is [http://www.loversguide.com/].

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

A '''tribal chief''' is the leader of a [[tribe|tribal society]] or [[chiefdom]].

==Description==
Tribal societies with [[social stratification]] under a single (or [[Diarchy|dual]]) leader emerged in the [[Neolithic]] period out of earlier tribal structures with little stratification, and they remained prevalent throughout the [[Iron Age]].

In the case of  [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tribal societies existing within larger colonial and post-colonial states, tribal chiefs may represent their tribe or ethnicity in a form of [[self-government]].

The most common types are the chairman of a council (usually of "[[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]s") and/or a broader [[popular assembly]] in "parliamentary" cultures, the war chief (may be an alternative or additional post in war time), the hereditary chief, and the politically dominant [[medicineman]] (in "[[theocracy|theocratic]]" cultures).

The term is usually distinct from chiefs at lower levels, such as [[village headman|village chief]] (geographically defined) or [[clan chief]] (an essentially genealogical notion). The descriptive "tribal" requires an ethno-cultural identity (racial, linguistic, religious etc.) as well as some political (representative, legislative, executive and/or judicial) expression. In certain situations, and especially in a [[Colonialism|colonial]] context, the most powerful member of either a [[confederation]] or a [[federation]] of such tribal, clan or village chiefs would be referred to as a [[paramount chief]]. This term has largely fallen out of use, however, and such personages are now often called [[king]]s.

A woman who holds a chieftaincy in her own right or who derives one from her marriage to a male chief has been referred to alternatively as a '''chieftainess''', a '''chieftess''' or, especially in the case of the former, a '''chief'''.

==History==
[[File:Arminius1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arminius]], a chieftain of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Cherusci]] tribe who defeated three [[Roman legions]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].]]
Anthropologist [[Elman Service]] distinguishes two stages of tribal societies: simple societies organized by limited instances of social rank and prestige, and more stratified societies led by chieftains or tribal kings ([[chiefdom]]s). Historically, tribal societies represent an intermediate stage between the [[band society]] of the [[Paleolithic]] stage and [[civilization]] with centralized, super-regional government based in [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|cities]]. Stratified tribal societies led by tribal kings thus flourished from the [[Neolithic]] stage into the [[Iron Age]], albeit in competition with civilisations and [[empire]]s beginning in the [[Bronze Age]]. 
An important source of information for tribal societies of the Iron Age is [[Greco-Roman ethnography]], which describes tribal societies surrounding the urban, imperialist civilisation of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman era|Roman]] periods.

After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, tribal kingdoms were again established over much of Europe in the wake of the [[Migration period]]. By the [[High Middle Ages]], these had again coalesced into super-regional monarchies.

Tribal societies remained prevalent in much of the [[New World]]. Exceptions to tribal societies outside of Europe and Asia were Paleolithic or Mesolithic band societies in [[Oceania]] and in parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Europeans forced centralized governments onto these societies during [[colonialism]], but in some instances tribes have retained or regained partial self-government.

==Modern states or regions providing an organized form of tribal chiefships==

===Arabia===
Arabs, in particular peninsular [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabs]] and nomadic Bedouins, are largely organized in tribes, many of whom have official representatives in governments. Tribal chiefs are known as [[Sheikh]]s, though this term is also sometimes applied as an honorific title to spiritual leaders of Sufism.
===Bolivia===
The [[Afro-Bolivian community|Afro-Bolivian people]], a recognized ethnic constituency of Bolivia, are led by a 
[[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|king]] whose title is also recognized by the Bolivian government.

===Botswana===
In Botswana, the reigning chiefs of the various tribes are legally empowered to serve as advisers to the government as members of the [[Ntlo ya Dikgosi]], the national [[House of Chiefs]]. In addition to this, they also serve as the ex officio chairs of the tribal ''kgotlas'', meetings of all of the members of the tribes, where political and social matters are discussed.

===Canada===
{{main|band government}}
The band is the fundamental unit of governance among the [[First Nations in Canada]] (formerly called "Indians").  Most bands have elected chiefs, either directly elected by all members of the band, or indirectly by the band council, these chiefs are recognized by the Canadian state under the terms of the [[Indian Act]].  As well, there may be traditional hereditary or charismatic chiefs, who are usually not part of the Indian Act-sanctioned formal government.  There were 614 bands in Canada in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100016202/1100100016204 Frequently Asked Questions About Aboriginal Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922104948/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100016202/1100100016204 |date=2013-09-22 }}. Aadnc-aandc.gc.ca (2010-09-15). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a national organization, the [[Assembly of First Nations]], which elects a "national chief" to act as spokesperson of all First Nations bands in Canada.

===Ghana===
The offices and traditional realms of the chiefs of Ghana are constitutionally protected by the republican constitution of the country. The chiefs serve as custodians of all traditional lands and the cultures of the traditional areas. They also serve as members of the Ghanaian [[National House of Chiefs]].

===Nigeria===
Although the [[Nigerian traditional rulers]] aren't mentioned in Nigeria's current constitution, they derive their powers from various so-called ''Chiefs laws'' and are therefore legally recognized. They usually serve as members of each federating state's [[State Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs]].

===Oceania===
The [[Solomon Islands]] have a Local Court Act which empowers chiefs to deal with crimes in their communities, thus assuring them of considerable effective authority.

===Philippines===
Apo Rodolfo Aguilar (Kudol I) serves as the chieftain of the [[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]] tribes people living in Banuang Daan and Cabugao settlements in Coron Island, Palawan, Philippines. His position is recognized by the Filipino government.

===South Africa===
Such figures as the [[king of the Zulu Nation]] and the [[Rain Queen]] are politically recognized in South Africa because they derive their status, not only from tribal custom, but also from the Traditional Leadership Clause of the country's current constitution.

===Uganda===
The pre-colonial states that existed in what is today Uganda were summarily abolished following independence from [[Great Britain]]. However, following constitutional reforms in 1993, a number of them were restored as politically neutral constituencies of the state by the government of [[Yoweri Museveni]]. Such figures as the [[Kabaka of Buganda]] and the [[Omukama of Toro]] typify the Ugandan chieftaincy class.

===United States===
{{further|Tribe (Native American)}}

====Historical cultural differences between tribes====
Generally, a tribe or nation is considered to be part of an [[ethnic group]], usually sharing cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s. 
For example, the forest-dwelling [[Chippewa]] historically built dwellings from the bark of trees, as opposed to the [[Great Plains]]-dwelling tribes, who would not have access to trees, except by trade, for example for [[lodgepole pine|lodgepole]]s. Thus, the tribes of the Great Plains might typically dwell in skin-covered [[tipi]]s rather than bark lodges. But some Plains tribes built their lodges of earth, as for example the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]].{{ref|FieldMuseum}} The [[Pueblo people]], meanwhile, built their dwellings of stone and earth.

====Political power in a tribe====
A chief might be considered to hold all political power, say by oratory or by example. But on the North American continent, it was historically possible to evade the political power of another by migration. The [[Mingo]]s, for example, were [[Iroquois]] who migrated further west to the sparsely populated [[Ohio Country]] during the 18th century. Two Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, [[Hiawatha]] and [[the Great Peacemaker]], formulated a [[Iroquois constitution|constitution]] for the Iroquois Confederation.

The tribes [[Indian Wars|were pacified]] by units of the United States Army in the nineteenth century, and were also subject to forced schooling in the decades afterward. Thus, it is uncommon for today's tribes to have a purely Native American cultural background, and today Native Americans are in many ways simply another ethnicity of the secular American people. Because formal education is now respected, some like [[Peter MacDonald (Navajo leader)|Peter MacDonald]], a Navajo, left their jobs in the mainstream U.S. economy to become chairpeople of their tribal councils or similar self-government institutions.

Not all tribal leaders need be men; [[Wilma Mankiller]] was a well-known Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Also, though the fount of power might be the chief, he or she is typically not free to wield power without the consent of a council of elders of some kind. For example: [[Cherokee]] men were not permitted to go to war without the consent of the council of women.

Tribal government is an official form of government in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstgov.gov/Government/State_Local/Tribal_Sites.shtml |title=A-Z Index of Tribal Governments, A &amp;#124; USA.gov |publisher=Firstgov.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in a number of countries around the world.

Historically, the U.S. government treated tribes as seats of political power, and made treaties with the tribes as legal entities. Be that as it may, the territory of these tribes fell under the authority of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] as reservations held in trust for the tribes. Citizenship was formerly considered a tribal matter. For example, it was not until 1924 that the [[Pueblo people]] were granted U.S. citizenship, and it was not until 1948 that the Puebloans were granted the right to vote in state elections in New Mexico. In Wisconsin, the [[Menominee Nation]] has its own county [[Menominee County, Wisconsin]] with special car license plates; 87% of the county's population is Native American.

Mainstream Americans often find pride and comfort in realizing that at least part of their ethnic ancestry is Native American, although the connection is usually only sentimental and not economic or cultural. Thus, there is some political power in one's ability to claim a Native American connection (as in the [[Black Seminole]]).

====Economic power in a tribe====
Because the Nations were sovereign, with treaty rights and obligations, the Wisconsin tribes innovated [[Indian gaming]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051231031253/http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/dec05/381080.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, on-reservation gambling casinos, which have since become a [[United States dollar|US$]]14&amp;nbsp;billion industry nationwide. This has been imitated in many of the respective states that still have Native American tribes. The money that this generates has engendered some political scandal. For example, the [[Tiwa people|Tigua]] tribe, which fled their ancestral lands in New Mexico during the Pueblo revolt of 1680, and who then settled on land in [[El Paso County, Texas]], has paid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Myers |first=Lisa |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7575874/ |title=4.2 million dollars in political contributions in Texas |publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-04-20 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a low probable return to the tribe because of the [[Jack Abramoff]] publicity.

Many of the tribes use professional management for their money. Thus, the [[Mescalero Apache]] renovated their Inn of the Mountain Gods to include gambling as well as the previous tourism, lodging, and skiing in the older Inn.

The Navajo nation defeated bids to open casinos in 1994, but by 2004 the [[Shiprock]] casino was a ''[[fait accompli]]''.

{{For|other types of typology|Typology (disambiguation)}}


'''Typology''' (in urban planning and architecture) is the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] classification of (usually physical) characteristics commonly found in buildings and urban places, according to their association with different categories, such as intensity of development (from natural or rural to highly urban), degrees of formality, and school of thought (for example, modernist or traditional).  Individual characteristics form patterns.  Patterns relate elements hierarchically across physical scales (from small details to large systems). 

For an authoritative essay on Typology in urban planning and architecture, see Rafael Moneo's 1978 Essay 'On Typology', published in Oppositions magazine. In this article the history of the notion of type is traced from its origins in the French Enlightenment until the late 20th century.

The following is an example of a set of characteristics with typological associations:&lt;br /&gt;  

[[Single-family detached home]]s set well back from a street on large [[land lot|lots]] (about, one-fifth acre to two or more acres) and surrounded by mowed lawns with naturalistic ornamental plantings of trees and shrubs are associated typologically with North American [[suburban]] places.&lt;br /&gt; 

Single-family residences that come all the way forward on an individual lot so that the front of the building is coincident with front lot line, or which are set back only a few feet to accommodate a lightwell or front entry stoop, are associated typologically with highly urbanized places in North America.  

An emphasis on typology is characteristic of [[New Urbanism]].  New Urbanists believe it is important to match the physical development characteristics of a place within the appropriate typology for that place, as determined by local preferences taken in context with urban patterns as evidenced throughout history.  Modernists, in keeping with their general disinclination to keep within the constraints of tradition and hierarchies of patterns, are less likely to focus on identifying the correct typology of a site.

'''Uses and gratifications theory''' (UGT) is  an approach to understanding why and how people actively seek out specific media to satisfy specific needs. UGT is an audience-centered approach to understanding [[mass communication]].&lt;ref name="SeverinTankard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Severin|first=Werner|last2=Tankard|first2=James|year=1997|isbn=0801317037|title=Communication theories: Origins, methods, and uses in the mass media|publisher=[[Longman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diverging from other media effect theories that question "what does media do to people?", UGT focuses on "what do people do with media?"&lt;ref name=Katz_1959&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Elihu|authorlink=Elihu Katz|title=Mass Communications Research and the Study of Popular Culture: An Editorial Note on a Possible Future for this Journal|journal=Departmental Papers (ASC)|year=1959|pages=1–6|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1168&amp;context=asc_papers&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar_url%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Frepository.upenn.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1168%2526context%253Dasc_papers%26sa%3DX%26scisig%3DAAGBfm3sEC9JZkct13HTnv8rJNash_GE2Q%26oi%3Dscholarr#search=%22http%3A%2F%2Frepository.upenn.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1168%26context%3Dasc_papers%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It postulates that media is a highly available product and the audiences are the consumers of the same product

This [[communication theory]] is [[positivistic]] in its approach, based in the [[Social psychology|socio-psychological]] communication tradition, and focuses on communication at the [[mass media]] scale.&lt;ref name="West 2007 392–409"&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Richard|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.|year=2007|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|pages=392–409|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driving question of UGT is: ''Why'' do people use media and what do they use them for? UGT discusses how users deliberately choose media that will satisfy given needs and allow one to enhance knowledge, relaxation, social interactions/companionship, diversion, or escape.&lt;ref name=Severin_Tankard&gt;{{cite book|last=Severin|first=Werner J.|title=Communication Theories: Origins, Methods and Uses in the Mass Media|year=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|isbn=0801333350|last2=Tankard Jr.|first2=James W.|chapter=2: New Media Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McQuail_2010&gt;{{cite book|last=McQuail|first=Denis|authorlink=Denis McQuail|title=Mass communication theory: an introduction|year=2010|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=[[London]]|isbn=1849202923|pages=420–430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"What Can Uses and Gratifications Theory Tell Us About Social Media?" Education|Ithink. 29 July 2010. Web. 17 October 2011. &lt;http://matei.org/ithink/2010/07/29/what-can-uses-and-gratifications-theory-tell-us-about-social-media&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

It assumes that audience members are not passive consumers of media. Rather, the audience has power over their [[media consumption]] and assumes an active role in interpreting and integrating media into their own lives. Unlike other theoretical perspectives, UGT holds that audiences are responsible for choosing media to meet their desires and needs to achieve gratification. This theory would then imply that the media compete against other information sources for viewers' gratification.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, Elihu]], [[Jay Blumler|Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. "Uses and Gratifications Research." ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'' 4th ser. 37 (1973–1974): 509-23. JSTOR. Web. 14 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://jstor.org/stable/2747854&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

UGT has a [[heuristic]] value today because it gives communication scholars a "perspective through which a number of ideas and theories about media choice, consumption, and even impact can be viewed".&lt;ref name=Baran_Davis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baran|first1=Stanley J.|last2=Davis|first2=Dennis K.|title=Mass communication theory : foundations, ferment, and future|year=2009|publisher=[[Cengage|Wadsworth]]|location=[[Boston]], MA|isbn=0495898872|pages=416|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpokJDPWt_MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Mass+communication+theory+:+foundations,+ferment,+and+future&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zFJhUqXwLoS69gTnhIGICg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mass%20communication%20theory%20%3A%20foundations%2C%20ferment%2C%20and%20future&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and gratifications approach==
Mark Levy and [[Sven Windahl]] provide a good description of what it means to be an "active consumer" of media:

:"As commonly understood by gratifications researchers, the term "audience activity" postulates a voluntaristic and selective orientation by audiences toward the communication process. In brief, it suggests that media use is motivated by needs and goals that are defined by audience members themselves, and that active participation in the communication process may facilitate, limit, or otherwise influence the gratifications and effects associated with exposure. Current thinking also suggests that audience activity is best conceptualized as a variable construct, with audiences exhibiting varying ''kinds'' and ''degrees'' of activity."&lt;ref name=Levy_Windahl&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levy|first=Mark|author2=Sven Windahl|title=The concept of audience activity|journal=Media gratifications research: Current perspectives|year=1985|pages=109–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assumptions of the theory===
Unlike other theories concerning media consumption, UGT gives the consumer power to discern what media they consume, with the assumption that the consumer has a clear intent and use. This contradicts previous theories such as '''mass society theory''', that states that people are helpless victims of mass media produced by large companies; and '''individual differences perspective''', which states that intelligence and self-esteem largely drive an individual's media choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gusfield|first1=Joseph R.|title=The reflexivity of social movements: Collective behavior and mass society theory revisited.|date=1994|publisher=[[Temple University Press]]|location=[[Philadelphia]]|isbn=978-1566391870|page=60|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these differing theories, UGT is unique in its assumptions:&lt;ref name="West 2007 392–409"/&gt;
*The audience is active and its media use is goal oriented
*The initiative in linking need gratification to a specific medium choice rests with the audience member
*The media compete with other resources for need satisfaction
*People have enough self-awareness of their media use, interests, and motives to be able to provide researchers with an accurate picture of that use.
*Value judgments of media content can only be assessed by the audience.

===Heuristic approach of UGT===
Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch synthesized that UGT's approach was focused on "the social and psychological origins of needs, which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources, which lead to differential patterns of media exposure (or engagement in other activities), resulting in need gratifications and some other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones."&lt;ref name=Severin_Tankard /&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

According to Katz, Blumler and Gurevitch's research there were five components comprising the Uses and Gratifications Approach. The components are:&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, Elihu]], [[Jay Blumler|Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. "Uses and Gratifications Research."The Public Opinion Quarterly 4th ser. 37 38(1973–1974): 509-23. JSTOR. Web. 14 Oct. 2011.&lt;http://jstor.org/stable/2747854&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The audience is conceived as active.
#In the mass communication process, much initiative in linking gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. 
#The media compete with other sources of satisfaction.
#Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. 
#Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms.

According to the research, goals for media use can be grouped into five uses.&lt;ref name=McQuail_2010 /&gt; The audience wants to:
#be informed or educated
#identify with characters of the situation in the media environment
#simple entertainment
#enhance social interaction
#escape from the stresses of daily life

===Gratifications sought (GS) vs. gratifications obtained (GO)===
GS and GO is one of the research issues dealing with U&amp;G theory, and it is a contrast between "what you were seeking from experience" versus "what you actually got from the experience - whether it was a satisfying experience or not."

==History==
Beginning in the 1940s, researchers began seeing patterns under the perspective of the uses and gratifications theory in radio listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lazarsfeld|first1=Paul F.|authorlink=Paul Lazarsfeld|title=Radio and the printed page; an introduction to the study of radio and its role in the communication of ideas.|date=1940|publisher=[[Duell, Sloan, and Pearce]]|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early research was concerned with topics such as children's use of comics and the absence of newspapers during a newspaper strike. An interest in more psychological interpretations emerged during this time period. 

In 1948, Lasswell introduced a four-functional interpretation of the media on a macro-sociological level. Media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society and individuals&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

===Stages of the theory===
Uses and gratifications theory was developed from a number of prior communication theories and research conducted by fellow theorists.

====Stage 1====
*In 1944, researchers began to look into the earliest forms of uses and gratifications with their work classifying the reasons for why people chose specific types of media. Whilst researchers were studying, Herzog interviewed various soap opera fans and was able to identify three types of gratifications. The three gratifications categories, based on why people listened to soap operas, were emotional, wishful thinking, and learning.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*According to West and Turner, UGT was an extension of [[Needs and Motivation Theory]], as outlined by [[Abraham Maslow]] in 1954, which argues that people actively looked to satisfy their needs based on a hierarchy. These needs are organized as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] in the form of a pyramid with the largest, most fundamental needs at the base and the need for self-actualization at the top. From the bottom-up the pyramid contains Biological/Physical, Security/Safety, Social/Belonging, Ego/Self-Respect and Self-actualization at the top.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In 1954 [[Wilbur Schramm]] developed the fraction of selection, a formula for determining which form of mass media an individual would select. The formula helped to decide the amount of gratification an individual would expect to gain from the medium over how much effort they had to make to achieve gratification.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"&gt;West, Richard L., and Lynn H. Turner. "Uses and Gratifications Theory." Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2010. 392-409. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stage 2====
*In 1969 [[Jay Blumler]] and [[Denis McQuail]] studied the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]] in the United Kingdom by examining people's motives for watching certain political programs on television. By categorizing the audience's motives for viewing a certain program, they aimed to classify viewers according to their needs in order to understand any potential mass-media effects.&lt;ref name=Severin_Tankard /&gt; The audience motivations they were able to identify helped lay the groundwork for their research in 1972 and eventually uses and gratifications theory.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In 1972 Denis McQuail, Jay Blumler and Joseph Brown suggested that the uses of different types of media could be grouped into 4 categories. The four categories were: diversion, personal relationships, personal identity and surveillance.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In 1973-74 McQuail, Blumler and Brown were joined by [[Elihu Katz]], [[Michael Gurevitch]] and [[Hadassah Haas]], in their media exploration. The collaborative research began to indicate how people saw the mass media.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;

====Stage 3====
*The most recent interest surrounding Uses and Gratifications Theory is the link between the reason why media is used and the achieved gratification.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*UGT researchers are developing the theory to be more predictive and explanatory by connecting the needs, goals, benefits, and consequences of media consumption and use along with individual factors.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*Work in UGT was trailblazing because the research of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch built on Herzog's research and caused a paradigm shift from how media influences people to how audiences use media, diminishing the dominance of the limited effects approach to mass media studies.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In the 1980s, Rehman (1983) applied UGT to study the relationship between the movie audience expectations and satisfaction derived from going to the movies.

==Modern applications of uses and gratifications research==
===Mobile phone usage===
[[Mobile phones]], a comparatively new technology, have many uses and gratifications attached to them. Due to their nature of mobility, constant access, and options to both add and access content, this field is expanding with new research on the motivations behind using mobile phones.

In general, people use mobile phones for the following uses and gratifications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=L.|author2=Wei, R.|title=More than just talk on the move: A use-and-gratification study of the cellular phone|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2000|volume=77|issue=2|pages=308–320|doi=10.1177/107769900007700206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Affection/sociability
*Entertainment
*Instrumentality
*Psychological reassurance
*Fashion/status
*Mobility
*Immediate access

Uses and gratifications do, however, differ based on location and audience:
*Using mobile phones on buses, cars, and trains is related to the UG of mobility and immediate access
*Talking to business partners is related to the UG of instrumentality
*Talking to family members is related to the UG of mobility and affection

The specific function of text messaging has been studied&lt;ref name="Grellhesl 2012 2175–2181"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grellhesl|first=Melanie|author2=Narissra M. Punyanunt-Carter|title=Using the Uses and Gratifications Theory to Understand Gratifications Sought through Text Messaging Practices of Male and Female Undergraduate Students|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2012|volume=28|issue=6|pages=2175–2181|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; to find its uses and gratifications and explore any potential gender differences. The researchers proposed seven uses and gratifications; they are listed below, from highest to lowest ranked according to the study's results:
*Accessibility/mobility
*Relaxation
*Escape
*Entertainment
*Information seeking
*Coordination for business
*Socialization/affection seeking
*Status seeking

The results also displayed gender differences (in an undergraduate population): women scored the UG of accessibility/mobility, relaxation and escape, and coordination higher than the men did. These results may imply social and societal expectations for females around independence but connected to family and friends and/or a tendency for women to rely more on detailed conversation in text messaging than men.&lt;ref name="Grellhesl 2012 2175–2181"/&gt;

Since many now use their mobile phones as devices to connect to the internet and both contribute and retrieve content, researchers have investigated the UG of smart devices which engage multiple media. The uses and gratifications for contributing mobile content differ from those for retrieving mobile content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chua|first=Alton Y.K.|author2=Dion Hoe-Lian Goh|author3=Chei Sian Lee|title=Mobile Content Contribution and Retrieval: An Exploratory Study Using the Uses and Gratifications Paradigm|journal=Information Processing &amp; Management|year=2012|volume=48|issue=1|pages=13–22|doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2011.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Contribution''': Leisure, entertainment, easy access, and passing time are all motivations for adding material.
*'''Retrieval''': Efficient access of information resources/services and the need for high quality information are uses and gratifications for accessing content.

===Internet usage===
The [[Internet]] provides a new and deep field for exploring UGT. It was found to have three main categories of gratifications: content gratification, process gratification, and social gratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stafford|first=Thomas F.|author2=Marla Royne Stafford|author3=Lawrence L. Schkade|title=Determining Uses and Gratifications for the Internet|journal=Decision Sciences|date=Spring 2004|volume=35|issue=2|pages=259–288|doi=10.1111/j.00117315.2004.02524.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Content''': Uses for the Internet include the need for researching or finding specific information or material, which are gratified with content.
*'''Process''': Users gain gratification from the experience of purposeful navigating or random browsing of the Internet in its functional process.
*'''Social''': Uses encompass a wide range of forming and deepening social ties.

Scholars like LaRose et al. utilize UGT to understand Internet usage via a socio-cognitive framework to reduce uncertainties that arise from homogenizing an Internet audience and explaining media usage in terms of only positive outcomes (gratifications). LaRose et al. created measures for self-efficacy and self-disparagement and related UGT to negative outcomes of online behavior (like Internet addiction) as well.&lt;ref name=LaRose_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaRose|first=Robert|author2=Dana Mastro|author3=Matthew S. Eastin|title=Understanding Internet Usage: A Social-Cognitive Approach to Uses and Gratifications|journal=Social Science Computer Review|year=2001|volume=19|issue=395|url=http://www.ensani.ir/storage/Files/20110209150302-%D9%81%D9%87%D9%85%20%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C%20%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%AA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media usage===
Recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=Louis|title=Generational Differences in Content Generation in Social Media: The Roles of the Gratifications Sought and of Narcissism|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2013|volume=29|issue=3|pages=997–1006|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; has looked at [[social networking services]], personal and subject-based [[blogs]], and [[internet forums]] put together to study the U&amp;G in posting social content, the relationship between gratifications and narcissism, and the effects of age on this relationship and these gratifications. Users have motivations of the following overall:
*'''Social and affection'''
*'''Need to vent negative feelings'''
*'''Recognition'''
*'''Entertainment'''
*'''Cognitive needs'''

Forums were found to be the main media for venting negative feelings, potentially due to the fact that comparatively, forums are more of a one-way street. Use of social media cures loneliness and satisfies a compulsion for addictive behaviors. Similar to the variables of gender, location, and audience as previous research has found, the U&amp;G differed by category of narcissism. The researchers found four multi-dimensional narcissistic personality types: feeling authoritative or superior, exhibitionistic, exploitative, and often hungry for vanity. The U&amp;G differed depending on the specific type of narcissism a given user had. For instance, those who were exhibitionistic tended to focus on the social media U&amp;G of showing affection, expressing negative feelings, and being recognized. Those who viewed themselves as superior had higher uses and gratifications by cognitive motivations than by recognition. The vain narcissists were most gratified by recognition and attention, and they did not vent negative feelings. Exhibitionists were motivated by all gratifications of social media. No generational differences were found in the narcissistic tendencies.

====Friend-networking sites====
Basic research finds that socialization motivates use of friend-networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook. Particulars under socialization might be finding old friends, making new friends, learning about events, creating social functions, and feeling connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raacke|first=John|author2=Jennifer Bonds-Raacke|title=MySpace and Facebook: Applying the Uses and Gratifications Theory to Exploring Friend-Networking Sites|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|year=2008|volume=11|issue=2|pages=169–174|doi=10.1089/cpb.2007.0056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some further exploration has demonstrated that although emotional, cognitive, social, and habitual uses are motivational to use social media, not all uses are consistently gratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Zheng|author2=John M. Tchernev|author3=Tyler Solloway|title=A Dynamic Longitudinal Examination of Social Media Use, Needs, and Gratifications Among College Students|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2012|volume=28|issue=5|pages=1829–1839|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In research examining [[Facebook]] groups' users' gratifications in relation to their civic participation offline, 1,715 college students were asked "to rate their level of agreement with specific reasons for using [[Facebook]] groups, including information acquisition about campus/community, entertainment/recreation, social interaction with friends and family, and peer pressure/self satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Park, Namsu, Kerk F. Kee, and Sebastian Valenzuela. "Being Immersed in Social Networking Environment: Facebook Groups, Uses and Gratifications, and Social Outcomes. "CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior 12.6 (2009) 729-33. Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The study ultimately yielded results through principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation. The results showed that there were four needs for using Facebook groups, "socializing, entertainment, self-status seeking, and information."
*'''Socializing''': Students were interested in talking and meeting with others to achieve a sense of community and peer support on the particular topic of the group.
*'''Entertainment''': Students engaged with the groups to amuse themselves.
*'''Self-Seeking''': Students sought out or maintained their personal status, as well as those of their friends, through the online group participation.
*'''Information''': Students used the group to receive information about related events going on and off campus.

====Twitter====
[[Twitter]] is an online micro-blogging platform that contains both mass-media functions and interpersonal communication options via sending tweets. Research has found a positive correlation between active time spent on Twitter and the gratification of a need for "an informal sense of camaraderie"—connection—with other users. Furthermore, the frequency of tweets and number of replies and public messages mediated the relationship between Twitter users. This helped increase both use and gratification of the media by satisfying the need for connection.&lt;ref name=Chen_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Gina Masullo|title=Tweet this: A uses and gratifications perspective on how active Twitter use gratifies a need to connect with others|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=March 2011|volume=27|issue=2|pages=755–762|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.023|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Snapchat====
Snapchat is a photo-sharing social media platform with more than 178 million users worldwide. Similar to other forms of social media, people use Snapchat to fulfill specific media needs. Compared to social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, Snapchat is used more to fulfill private media needs. For example, Phua, Jin, and Kim found that Snapchat interactions were similar to interactions found in close interpersonal relationships. The application has been used to attain emotional support from others, look for advice on important decisions, and seek help to solve problems, satisfying the need to socialize, vent negative feelings, and connect with others.&lt;ref name=Phua_2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phua|first1=Joe|last2=Jin|first2=Seunga Venus|last3=Kim|first3=Jihoon|title=Uses and Gratifications of social networking cites for bridging and bonding social capital: A comparison of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=72|issue=July 2017|pages=115–122|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.041|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other applications====
Many other aspects of UGT are featured in using various websites that are related to social networking. Many review services, such as [[Yelp.com]], have an aspect of social networking, with user profiles and interconnectivity. Many news websites feature the ability to share articles and pictures directly from their page to users' personal social networking pages across platforms. Understandably, information seeking is an overwhelming U&amp;G for these applications, especially the review sites like Yelp.com. Other U&amp;G included entertainment, convenience, interpersonal utility, and passing time. A more sinister aspect of UGT and a reason to use social media establishes a platform for cyberbullying.

People engage in cyberbullying online and through social media in order to gratify themselves. Cyberbullying fulfills a need to be vengeful and malicious, while avoiding face-to-face contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Amy|author2=Stephen Comp|author3=Jeannie Horovitz|author4=Madeline Hovarter|author5=Maya Miki|author6=Jennifer L.

===Instant messaging===
As with text messaging, similar U&amp;G were studied&lt;ref name="Leung 2001 482–500"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=L.|title=College student motives for chatting on ICQ|journal=New Media &amp; Society|year=2001|volume=3|issue=4|pages=482–500|doi=10.1177/14614440122226209}}&lt;/ref&gt; with instant messaging, or participating in an "[[online chat]]," and these results were also mitigated by gender:
*'''Relaxation'''
*'''Entertainment'''
*'''Fashion'''
*'''Inclusion'''
*'''Affection'''
*'''Sociability'''
*'''Escape'''

Again, differences were found based on amount of use and gender. Those who used the instant messaging service frequently ("heavy users") were found to be most motivated by affection and sociability; those who did not ("light users") were most motivated by fashion. Women chatted longer and for sociability; men chatted for less time per session and for entertainment and relaxation.&lt;ref name="Leung 2001 482–500"/&gt;

===Online gaming===
This new branch of research explores the U&amp;G of starting to play games online. Achievement, enjoyment and social interaction are all motivations for starting to play an online game, and their success at the game as well as the extent to which their uses were gratified predicted their continuance in playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Jen-Her|author2=Shu-Ching Wang|author3=Ho-Huang Tsai|title=Falling in Love with Online Games: The Uses and Gratifications Perspective|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2010|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1862–1871|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.07.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile Gaming and Augmented Reality===
In 2017, researchers applied Uses and Gratification Theory to study user behavior among [[Pokémon Go]] users. Results show that enjoyment, physical activity, nostalgia, image, normative influences and flow drive various forms of user behavior. In addition, perceived physical risks (but not perceived privacy risks) lead to weaker forms of usage. Findings of this study show that Uses and Gratification theory provides a promising framework to study Augmented Reality, and that U&amp;GT provides a robust framework that can be supplemented with other theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauschnabel|first=Philipp A.|last2=Rossmann|first2=Alexander|last3=Dieck|first3=M.

===Animated news===
In 2011, a test was conducted with 312 college students to investigate their viewing of animated news. The use of melodramatic animation in news was seen as an emerging technique used in news reporting at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://enx.sagepub.com/content/6/3/131.short|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105001915/http://enx.sagepub.com/content/6/3/131.short|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-05|title=Can News Be Imaginative?

Factor analysis and hierarchical regression were employed for data analysis.

In the study, seven motives were identified, through factor analysis, for viewing such animated news videos. These motives included companionship, social interaction, relaxation, information seeking, interpersonal learning, entertainment and pass time.
*'''Social interaction motive''': getting information for facilitating discussion with others
*'''Relaxation motive''': watching animated news to release pressure and unwind
*'''Information-seeking motive''': viewing animated news to stay abreast of current events or to search for information
*'''Entertainment motive''': viewing animated news for amusement and enjoyment
*'''Pass time motive''': viewing animated news to occupy time or when individuals have nothing better to do
*'''Interpersonal learning motive''': the desire to understand the minds of friends or significant others by watching the animated news videos that are shared by these individuals
*'''Companionship motive''': to alleviate loneliness

The results of hierarchical regression analysis suggest predictive relationships among personality characteristics (sensation seeking and locus of control), the seven motives, the effects of perceived news credibility and newsworthiness, and the intention to share such animated news videos with others.

===Entertainment media===
Research has shown that media taken in for entertainment purposes (i.e., movies, songs, television, etc.) have a wide range of uses and emotional gratifications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartsch|first=Anne|author2=Reinhold Viehoff|title=The Use of Media Entertainment and Emotional Gratification|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=March 29, 2010|volume=5|pages=2247–2255|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.07.444}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that these are not mutually exclusive but can overlap with each other. Rehman (1983) demonstrated a relationship between gratifications sought and obtained from the movies and movie attendance.
*'''Mood management''': This is the most prominently cited emotional gratification of media use. People prefer to maintain a state of intermediate arousal; this is a pleasant medium. When in a bad mood, bored, or over-aroused, people will seek media as regulation for or distraction from their mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zillman|first=D|title=Mood management through communication choices|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=1988|volume=31|pages=327–340|doi=10.1177/000276488031003005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zillman|first=D|title=Mood Management in the context of selective exposure theory.|journal=Communication Yearbook|year=2000|volume=23|pages=103–123|editor1-first=M.

*'''Affective disposition''': Affective disposition theory states that people enjoy "rooting for" characters depicted as good and moral. Users experience gratification when good things happen to characters with "good" morals and also when bad things happen to "evil" or "bad" characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication and emotion: Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann|year=2003|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=61–84|author=Raney, A.

*'''Modes of reception''': "Emotional involvement correlates with other modes of reception, especially with diegetic involvement (getting absorbed in the fictional world), socio-involvement (identifying with characters), and ego-involvement (relating the film to one's own life). ...Emotional involvement can be helpful for the pursuit of a broader variety of goals in the reception process. ... It can be concluded that the experience of emotions can be functional in a number of other ways than just regulating emotions in terms of affective valence and arousal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartsch|first=Anne|author2=Reinhold Viehoff|title=The Use of Media Entertainment and Emotional Gratification|journal=Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences|year=2010|volume=5|pages=2247–2255|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.07.444}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sückfull|first=M.|title=Rezeptionsmodalitäten.

*'''Intrinsic motivation''': If the user experiences a challenge to his or her media-related skills, but not to the point of being frustrated or overwhelmed, then the gratification is a reward in a feeling of competence that inspires the user to continue using the media in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vorderer|first=P|title=Psychology of Entertainment|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|author2=Steen, F. and Chan, E.|editor=Bryant, J.|editor2=Vorderer, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Mood adjustment''': Users are gratified by using media to adjust their mood to whatever is currently happening. For instance, once already provoked by an aggressor and promised a chance to retaliate, males were found to prefer bad news over good news in that emotionally charged moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knobloch|first=S.|title=Mood adjustment via mass communication|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2003|volume=53|pages=233–250|doi=10.1093/joc/53.2.233|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/72504/1/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02588.x.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knobloch-Westerwick|first=S.|author2=Alter, S.|title=Mood adjustment to social situations through mass media use: How men ruminate and women dissipate angry moods|journal=Human Communication Research|year=2006|volume=32|pages=58–73|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2006.00003.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related theories==
===Media system dependency theory===
[[Media system dependency theory]] (MSDT or media dependency theory) has been studied as an offshoot of UGT. However, media dependency theory focuses on audiences' goals for media consumption as the source of their dependency; while uses and gratification theory focuses on audience's needs as drivers for media consumption. MSDT states that as a person becomes increasingly dependent on media to satisfy their needs, that media will become more important in a person's life and thereby have increased influence and effects that person. MSDT acknowledges and builds upon UGT because it is based on the assumptions that people have different uses for media that arise from their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ball-Rokeach |first1=S.J. |last2=DeFleur |first2=M.L.|authorlink=Melvin Defleur|title=A dependency model of mass-media effects |journal=Communication Research |date=January 1976 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–21 |doi=10.1177/009365027600300101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social cognitive theory===
Building on UGT, [[Social Cognitive Theory]] helped distinguish GS versus GO stimulus for media consumption. Social cognitive theory explains behavior in terms of the reciprocal causation between individuals, environments, and behaviors. This allows for a more personal application of UGT instead of a large, blanketing assumption about a large audience of mass media. If GO is greater than GS then there will be more audience satisfaction. Lastly, audiences' GS are not always the reality of their GO.&lt;ref name=LaRose_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmgreen_1985&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palmgreen|first=P|author2=L. Wenner|author3=K. Rosengren|title=Uses and gratifications research: The past ten years.|journal=Media gratifications research|year=1985|pages=1–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultivation theory===
[[Cultivation theory]] is concerned with understanding the role that media play in shaping a person's world view—specifically television. Whereas UGT tries to understand the motivations that drive media usage, Cultivation theory focuses on the psychological effects of media. Cultivation theory is used especially to study violence in television and how it shapes audience's understanding of the reality of violence in society. Often, because of media's influence, audiences have a more heightened and unrealistic perception of the amount of violence. A UGT approach may be implemented to Cultivation theory cases to understand why an audience would seek violent media and if audiences seek [[Research on the effects of violence in mass media|television violence]] to satisfy the need of confirmation of their worldview.

==Theory criticism==
Uses and gratifications has, almost since its inception, been viewed by some as the Pluto of communication theory, which is to say critics argue that it does not meet the standards necessary to be theory. Critics argue that it instead is more of an approach to analysis or a data-collecting strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, 2002; Severin and Tankard, 1997; McQuail 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the criticism most commonly raised in academic literature:
*Gratifications are more dependent on input by researchers than on decisions made by research subjects.&lt;ref name="Lometti, G. E. 1977"&gt;Lometti, G. E., Reeves, B., &amp; Bybee, C. R. (1977). Investigating the assumptions of uses and gratifications research. Communication Research, 4(3), 321-338.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Early research required participants to identify gratifications associated with specific channels of communication, raising the possibility that they would conflate gratifications and channels. Lometti et al. argued that this could "substantially overestimate" the number of gratifications, and that attempts to address it using in-depth interviews were problematic (p.&amp;nbsp;323).&lt;ref name="Lometti, G. E. 1977"/&gt;
*Audiences of different ages likely have different motivations for using identical media, and also likely have different gratifications.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, B. S. (1974). Gratifications of television viewing and their correlates for British children. The uses of mass communications: Current perspectives on gratifications research, 3, 71-92.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Due to the individualistic nature of uses and gratification, it is difficult to take the information that is collected in studies. Most research relies on pure recollection of memory rather than data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, Elihu]], [[Jay Blumler|Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. "Uses and Gratifications Research."The Public Opinion Quarterly 4th ser. 37 (1973–1974): 509-23. JSTOR. Web. 14 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes self-reports complicated and immeasurable.
*The theory has been denounced by media hegemony advocates who say it goes too far in claiming that people are free to choose the media and the interpretations they desire.&lt;ref&gt;Severin, W. J., &amp; Tankard, J. W. (1997). Uses of mass media. Communication theories: Origins, methods, and uses in the mass media.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Audiences interpret the media in their own terms and any debate for or against this can be argued, and depending on the circumstances, won by either side. Each individuals' actions and effects on those actions will depend solely on the situation. Each individual has unique uses to which the media attempts to meet their gratifications.

Using this sociologically-based theory has little to no link to the benefit of psychology due to its weakness in operational definitions and weak analytical mode. It also is focused too narrowly on the individual and neglects the social structure and place of the media in that structure. Ruggiero (2000) wrote that "most scholars agree that early research had little theoretical coherence and was primarily behaviorist and individualist in its methodological tendencies."&lt;ref name="Ruggiero, T. E. 2000"&gt;Ruggiero, T. E. (2000). Uses and gratifications theory in the 21st century. Mass communication &amp; society, 3(1), 3-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Blumler (1979) and other critics have argued that line between gratification and satisfaction is blurred, and Blumler wrote that "the nature of the theory underlying uses and gratifications research is not totally clear."&lt;ref&gt;Blumler, J. G. (1979). The role of theory in uses and gratifications studies. Communication research, 6(1), 9-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such criticism, contemporary thought suggests that uses and gratifications as theory may be in the process of gaining new life as a result of new communication technology. While it was easy to question the agency of media consumers who had three television networks from which to choose, it's much harder to argue that a consumer who now has 100 cable channels and Internet-streaming video is not making his own decisions.

===The active audience===
Among the most criticized tenets of uses and gratifications as theory is the assumption of an active audience. Ruggerio (2000) noted three assumptions that are necessary to the idea of active audience: First, media selection is initiated by the individual.&lt;ref name="Ruggiero, T. E. 2000"/&gt; Second, expectations regarding the use of media must be a product of individual predispositions, social interactions and environmental factors. And third, the active audience exhibits goal-directed behavior. This concept of active audience finds, at best, limited acceptance outside of the United States.&lt;ref name="Ruggiero, T. E. 2000"/&gt;

Jay Blumler presented a number of interesting points, as to why Uses and Gratifications cannot measure an active audience. He stated, "The issue to be considered here is whether what has been thought about Uses and Gratifications Theory has been an article of faith and if it could now be converted into an empirical question such as: How to measure an active audience?" (Blumler, 1979). Blumler then offered suggestions about the kinds of activity the audiences were engaging with in the different types of media.

*'''Intentionality''': "Occurs when people's prior motive determine use of media"&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
*'''Selectivity''': "Audience members' use of media reflect their existing interests"&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
*'''Imperviousness to Influence''': "Refers to audience members' constructing their own meaning from media content"&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;

25 years later, in 1972, Blumler, McQuail and Brown extended Lasswell's four groups. These included four primary factors for which one may use the media:&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Diversion''': Escape from routine and problems; an emotional release&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Personal Relationships''': Social utility of information in conversation; substitution of media for companionship&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Personal Identity or Individual Psychology''': Value reinforcement or reassurance; self-understanding, reality exploration&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Surveillance''': Information about factors which might affect one or will help one do or accomplish something&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973) saw mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others. They developed 35 needs taken from the largely speculative literature on the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:
*'''Cognitive Needs''': Acquiring information, knowledge and understanding&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Television (news), video (how-to), movies (documentaries or based on history)
*'''Affective Needs''': Emotion, pleasure, feelings&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Movies, television (soap operas, sitcoms)
*'''Personal Integrative Needs''': Credibility, stability, status&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Video
*'''Social Integrative Needs''': Family and friends&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Internet (e-mail, instant messaging, chat rooms, social media)
*'''Tension Release Needs''': Escape and diversion&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Television, movies, video, radio, internet

A '''vanitas''' is a symbolic work of art showing the transience of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death, often contrasting symbols of wealth and symbols of ephemerality and death. Best-known are ''vanitas'' [[still life]]s, a common genre in [[Netherlandish art]] of the 16th and 17th centuries; they have also been created at other times and in other [[medium (art)|media]] and [[Genre#Visual arts|genres]].&lt;ref&gt;Search for 'vanitas' at Harvard Art Museums: [https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/?q=vanitas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The [[Latin]] noun [[wikt:vanitas#Latin|''vanitas'']] (from the Latin adjective ''vanus'' 'empty') means 'emptiness', 'futility', or 'worthlessness', the traditional Christian view being that earthly goods and pursuits are transient and worthless.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=vanitas ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt; It alludes to [[Ecclesiastes]] {{bibleref2-nb|Eccl.|1:2; 12:8|VULGATE}}, where ''vanitas'' translates the Hebrew word ''hevel'', which also includes the concept of transitoriness.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Fredericks, ''Coping with Transience: Ecclesiastes on Brevity in Life'', p. 15 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Treasury of Sayings and Quotations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYOcAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |first=Susan |last=Ratcliffe |date=October 13, 2011 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|OUP]] |location=[[Oxford]] |id={{ISBN|0-19960912-8}} |isbn=978-0-199-60912-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IYOcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=%226+Vanitas+vanitatum%22+futility 127]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Bonbon to Cha-cha.

==Themes==
[[File:Pier Francesco Cittadini Vanitas-Stillleben.jpg|thumb|245px|[[Pier Francesco Cittadini]] from 17th century school]]

Vanitas themes were common in medieval funerary art, with most surviving examples in sculpture. By the 15th century, these could be extremely morbid and explicit, reflecting an increased obsession with death and decay also seen in the ''[[Ars moriendi]],'' the ''[[Danse Macabre]]'', and the overlapping motif of the ''[[Memento mori]].''  From the Renaissance such motifs gradually became more indirect and, as the still-life genre became popular, found a home there.  Paintings executed in the vanitas style were meant to remind viewers of the transience of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death. They also provided a moral justification for painting attractive objects
.

==Motifs==
[[File:Harmen Steenwijck - Vanitas.JPG|245px|thumb|left|''Vanitas'' by [[Harmen Steenwijck]]]]

Common vanitas symbols include skulls, which are a reminder of the certainty of death; rotten fruit (decay); bubbles (the brevity of life and suddenness of death); smoke, watches, and hourglasses (the brevity of life); and musical instruments (brevity and the ephemeral nature of life). Fruit, flowers and butterflies can be interpreted in the same way, and a peeled lemon was, like life, attractive to look at but bitter to taste. Art historians debate how much, and how seriously, the vanitas theme is implied in still-life paintings without explicit imagery such as a skull. As in much moralistic genre painting, the enjoyment evoked by the sensuous depiction of the subject is in a certain conflict with the moralistic message.&lt;ref&gt;For more on this topic, see [https://books.google.it/books?id=QkeBswEACAAJ&amp;dq=the+living+dead+ecclesiastes+through+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYx7rVrrDdAhXIKewKHZ9oB1MQ6AEIKTAA ''The Living Dead: Ecclesiastes through Art''], exh. cat. edited by Corinna Ricasoli, Paderborn: Ferdinand Schöningh 2018, and the bibliography therein.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Composition of flowers'' is a  less obvious style of Vanitas by [[Abraham Mignon]] in the [[National Museum, Warsaw]]. Barely visible amid vivid and perilous nature (snakes, poisonous mushrooms), a bird skeleton is a symbol of vanity and shortness of life.

'''Vihara''' ({{lang-sa|vihāra}}) generally refers to a [[monastery]] for [[bhikkhu|Buddhist renunciates]]. The concept is ancient and in early [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] texts, it meant any arrangement of space or facilities for pleasure and entertainment.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lahiri2015p181"/&gt; The term evolved into an architectural concept wherein it refers to living quarters for monks with an open shared space or courtyard, particularly in Buddhism. The term is also found in Ajivika, Hindu and Jain monastic literature, usually referring to temporary refuge for wandering monks or nuns during the annual Indian monsoons.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1946p137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p203"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-50165-X|pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Jainism, the monks continue to wander from town to town except during the rainy season ([[Chaturmas#Jainism|Chaturmas]]), the term "vihara" refers their wanderings.&lt;ref&gt;Gomaṭeśvara sahasrābdī mahotsava darśana, Niraj Jain, Śravaṇabelagola Digambara Jaina Muzaraī Insṭīṭyuśaṃsa Mainejiṅga Kameṭī, 1984, Page 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulasī prajñā, Jaina Viśva Bhāratī., 1984, Page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Vihara or vihara hall has a more specific meaning in the [[architecture of India]], especially ancient [[Indian rock-cut architecture]].  Here it means a central hall, with small cells connected to it sometimes with beds carved from the stone. Some have a shrine cell set back at the centre of the back wall, containing a [[stupa]] in early examples, or a Buddha statue later. Typical large sites such as the [[Ajanta Caves]], [[Aurangabad Caves]], [[Karla Caves|Karli Caves]], and [[Kanheri Caves]] contain several viharas. Some included a [[chaitya]] or worship hall nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, George, ''The Penguin Guide to the Monuments of India, Volume 1: Buddhist, Jain, Hindu'', p. 67 and see individual entries, 1989, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140081445}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vihara was originated to be a shelter for Monks when it rains.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
Vihāra is a Sanskrit word that appears in several Vedic texts with context sensitive meanings. It generally means a form of "distribution, transposition, separation, arrangement", either of words or sacred fires or sacrificial ground. Alternatively, it refers to a form of wandering roaming, any place to rest or please oneself or enjoy one's pastime in, a meaning more common in late Vedic texts, the Epics and Gryhasutra literature.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/1000/mw__1036.html Vihara], Monier Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary Etymologically Arranged, Oxford University Press, page 1003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hermann Oldenberg|author2=Friedrich Max Müller|title=The Grihya-sûtras, Rules of Vedic Domestic Ceremonies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xBWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA330|year=1892|publisher=Clarendon Press: Oxford|pages=54–56, 330–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith1998p151"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian K. Smith|title=Reflections on Resemblance, Ritual, and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nkruE6UCz54C&amp;pg=PA151 |year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-1532-2|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its meaning in post-Vedic era is more specifically a form of rest house or temple or monastery in ascetic traditions of India, particularly for a group of monks.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara/&gt; It particularly referred to a hall that were used as temples or where monks met and some walked about.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara/&gt;&lt;ref name=palivihara/&gt; In performance arts context, the term means the theatre, playhouse, convent or temple compound to meet, perform or relax in. Later it referred to a form of temple or monastery construction in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, wherein the design has a central hall and attached separated shrines for residence either for monks or for gods, goddesses and some sacred figure such as Tirthankaras or the Buddha or a Guru. The word means a Jain or Hindu temple or "dwelling, waiting place" in many medieval era inscriptions and texts, from ''vi-har'' which means "to construct".&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1946p137"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Hindu Temple|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNcXrBlI9S0C&amp;pg=PA137|year=1946|publisher=Princeton University Press (Reprint: Motilal Banarsidass)|isbn=978-81-208-0223-0|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p203"/&gt;

It contrasts with Aranya (Sanskrit) or Aranna (Pali) which means "forest".&lt;ref name=palivihara&gt;[http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.3.pali.1288899 Vihara], Pali English Dictionary, T. W. Rhys Davids, William Stede, editors; Pali Text Society; page 642&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith1998p151"/&gt; In medieval era, the term meant any monastery, particularly for Buddhist monks.&lt;ref name=palivihara/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Powers|author2=David Templeman|title=Historical Dictionary of Tibet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVlyX6iSDEQC&amp;pg=PA204 |year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow  |isbn=978-0-8108-7984-3|pages=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Matha]]'' is another term for monastery in Indian religious tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter|title=Buddhist Philosophy from 350 to 600 A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WHHJ6O7b-IC&amp;pg=PA265 |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1968-9|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; today normally used for Hindu establishments.

The northern [[India]]n state of [[Bihar]] derives its name from the word "vihara", due to the abundance of Buddhist monasteries in that area. The word "vihara" has also been borrowed in [[Malay language|Malay]] where it is spelled "biara," and denotes a monastery or other non-Muslim place of worship. In [[Thailand]] and [[China]] (called ''{{lang|zh-Latn|jingshe}}''; {{zh|精舎}}), "vihara" has a narrower meaning, and designates a [[shrine]] hall or retreat house.  It is called a "Wihan" ({{lang|th|วิหาร}}) in Thai, and a "Vihear" in [[Khmer language|Khmer]]. In [[Burmese language|Burmese]], ''wihara'' ({{my|ဝိဟာရ}}, {{IPA-my|wḭhəɹa̰|IPA}}), means "monastery," but the native Burmese word ''[[kyaung]]'' ({{my|ကျောင်း}}, {{IPA-my|tɕáʊɴ|IPA}}) is preferred. Monks wandering from place to place preaching and seeking [[alms]] often stayed together in the [[sangha]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  In the [[Punjabi language]], an open space inside a home is called a 'vehra'.

==Origins==
[[File:Ellora Cave 12 si0253.jpg|thumb|Cave 12, [[Ellora]], a late multi-story rock-cut vihara.  Further decoration of the pillars was probably intended.]]

===Viharas as pleasure centers===
During the 3rd-century BCE era of [[Ashoka]], ''vihara yatras'' were travels aimed at enjoyments, pleasures and hobbies such as hunting. These contrasted with ''dharma yatras'' which related to religious pursuits and pilgrimage.&lt;ref name="Lahiri2015p181"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nayanjot Lahiri|title=Ashoka in Ancient India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaVRCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-91525-1|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ashoka converted to Buddhism, states Lahiri, he started ''dharma yatras'' around mid 3rd century BCE instead of hedonistic royal ''vihara yatras''.&lt;ref name="Lahiri2015p181"/&gt;

===Viharas as monasteries===
The early history of viharas is unclear. Monasteries in the form of caves are dated to centuries before the start of the common era, for [[Ajivika]]s, [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]s and [[Jainism|Jaina]]s. The rock-cut architecture found in cave viharas from the 2nd-century BCE have roots in the [[Maurya Empire]] period.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"/&gt; In and around the [[Bihar]] state of India are a group of residential cave monuments all dated to be from pre-common era, reflecting the Maurya architecture. Some of these have Brahmi script inscription which confirms their antiquity, but the inscriptions were likely added to pre-existing caves.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. R. Allchin|author2=George Erdosy|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5kI02_zW70C |year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37695-2|pages=247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest layer of Buddhist and Jain texts mention legends of the Buddha, the Jain Tirthankaras or [[sramana]] monks living in caves.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gwynne2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gwynne|title=World Religions in Practice: A Comparative Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sU8nDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51|date=30 May 2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-97228-1|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jain1991p66"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kailash Chand Jain|title=Lord Mahāvīra and His Times|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8-TxcO9dfrcC&amp;pg=PA66|year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0805-8|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; If these records derived from an [[oral tradition]] accurately reflect the significance of monks and caves in the times of the Buddha and the Mahavira, then cave residence tradition dates back to at least the 5th century BCE. According to Allchin and Erdosy, the legend of First Buddhist Council is dated to a period just after the death of the Buddha. It mentions monks gathering at a cave near Rajgiri, and this dates it in pre-Mauryan times.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"/&gt; However, the square courtyard with cells architecture of ''vihara'', state Allchin and Erdosy, is dated to the Mauryan period. The earlier monastic residences of Ajivikas, Buddhists, Hindus, and Jains were likely outside rock cliffs and made of temporary materials and these have not survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. R. Allchin|author2=George Erdosy|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5kI02_zW70C |year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37695-2|pages=240–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known gift of immovable property for monastic purposes ever recorded in an Indian inscription is credited to Emperor Ashoka, and it is a donation to the Ajivikas.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2011p96"/&gt; According to Johannes Bronkhorst, this created competitive financial pressures on all traditions, including the Hindu Brahmins. This may have led to the development of viharas as shelters for monks, and evolution in the [[Ashrama (stage)|Ashrama]] concept to ''agraharas'' or Hindu monasteries. These shelters were normally accompanied by donation of revenue from villages nearby, who would work and support these cave residences with food and services. The Karle inscription dated to the 1st century CE donates a cave and nearby village, states Bronkhorst, "for the support of the ascetics living in the caves at Valuraka [Karle] without any distinction of sect or origin". Buddhist texts from Bengal, dated to centuries later, use the term ''asrama-vihara'' or ''agrahara-vihara'' for their monasteries.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2011p96"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst|title=Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BaX58-E5-3MC |year=2011|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-20140-8|pages=96–97 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GrundrissAjantaHoehle1.jpg|thumb|270px|Plan of cave 1 at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], a large ''vihara'' hall for prayer and living, 5th century]]
Buddhist viharas or monasteries may be described as a residence for monks, a centre for religious work and meditation and a centre of Buddhist learning. Reference to five kinds of dwellings (Pancha Lenani) namely, ''Vihara, Addayoga, Pasada, Hammiya'' and ''Guha'' is found in the Buddhist canonical texts as fit for monks. Of these only the ''Vihara'' (monastery) and ''Guha'' (Cave) have survived.

At some stage of Buddhism, like other Indian religious traditions, the wandering monks of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] dedicated to asceticism and the monastic life, wandered from place to place. During the rainy season (cf. [[vassa]]) they stayed in temporary shelters. In Buddhist theology relating to rebirth and merit earning, it was considered an act of merit not only to feed a monk but also to shelter him, sumptuous monasteries were created by rich lay devotees.

==Architecture==
The only substantial remains of very early viharas are in the rock-cut complexes, mostly in north India, the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] in particular, but this is an accident of survival. Originally structural viharas of stone or brick would probably have been at least as common everywhere, and the norm in the south.  By the second century BCE a standard plan for a vihara was established; these form the majority of Buddhist rock-cut "caves".  It consisted of a roughly square rectangular hall, in rock-cut cases, or probably an open court in structural examples, off which there were a number of small cells.  Rock-cut cells are often fitted with rock-cut platforms for beds and pillows.  The front wall had one or more entrances, and often a [[verandah]].  Later the back wall facing the entrance had a fairly small shrine-room, often reached through an ante-chamber.  Initially these held [[stupa]]s, but later a large sculpted [[Buddha]] image, sometimes with [[relief]]s on the walls.  The verandah might also have sculpture, and in some cases the walls of the main hall.  Paintings were perhaps more common, but these rarely survive, except in a few cases such as Caves 2, 10, 11 and 17 at the [[Ajanta Caves]].  As later rock-cut viharas are often on up to three storeys, this was also probably the case with the structural ones.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 48, 54-56, 119-120; Michell, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

As the vihara acquired a central image, it came to take over the function of the chaitya worship hall, and eventually these ceased to be built.  This was despite the rock-cut vihara shrine room usually offering no path for circumambulation or [[pradakshina]], an important ritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 132; Michell, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In early medieval era, Viharas became important institutions and a part of Buddhist [[Universities]] with thousands of students, such as [[Nalanda]].  Life in "Viharas" was codified early on. It is the object of a part of the [[Pali canon]], the [[Vinaya|Vinaya Pitaka]] or "basket of monastic discipline".  [[Shalban Vihara]] in [[Bangladesh]] is an example of a structural monastery with 115 cells, where the lower parts of the brick-built structure have been excavated. [[Somapura Mahavihara]], also in Bangladesh, was a larger vihara, mostly 8th-century, with 177 cells around a huge central temple.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
[[File:094 Cave 12, Vihara Cells (34123037202).jpg|thumb|Cave 12, [[Ajanta Caves]], cell entries off a vihara hall]]

===Variants in rock-cut viharas===
Usually the standard form as described above is followed, but there are some variants. Two vihara halls, Cave 5 at [[Ellora]] and Cave 11 at [[Kanheri]], have very low platforms running most of the length of the main hall. These were probably used as some combination of benches or tables for dining, desks for study, and possibly beds.  They are often termed "dining-hall" or the "[[Durbar Hall]]" at Kanheri, on no good evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 359, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Cave 11 at the Bedse Caves is a fairly small 1st-century vihara, with nine cells in the interior and originally four around the entrance, and no shrine room.  It is distinguished by elaborate [[gavaksha]] and railing relief carving around the cell-doors, but especially by having a rounded roof and [[apse|apsidal]] far end, like a [[chaitya]] hall.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 351-352&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Mahabodhitemple.jpg|300px|thumb|Mahabodhi Temple|[[Mahabodhi Temple]] in India.]]

The earliest Buddhist rock-cut cave abodes and sacred places are found in the western [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] dating back to the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name="binda"&gt;{{cite book| first= Binda| last= Thapar| year= 2004| title= Introduction to Indian Architecture| edition=| publisher= Periplus Editions| location=Singapore| page= 34| isbn=  0-7946-0011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These earliest rock-cut caves include the [[Bhaja Caves]], the [[Karla Caves]], and some of the [[Ajanta Caves]].

Vihara with central shrine containing devotional images of the Buddha, dated to about the 2nd century CE are found in the northwestern area of [[Gandhara]], in sites such as [[Jaulian]], [[Kalawan]] (in the [[Taxila]] area) or [[Dharmarajika]], which states Behrendt, possibly were the prototypes for the 4th century monasteries such as those at [[Devnimori]] in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Behrendt 170"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Behrendt| first1=Kurt A.|title=Handbuch der Orientalistik|date=2004| publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004135952| pages=168–171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9_vbgkzUSkC&amp;pg=PA168|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by the discovery of clay and bronze Buddha statues, but it is unclear if the statue is of a later date.&lt;ref name="Behrendt 170"/&gt; According to Behrendt, these "must have been the architectural prototype for the later northern and western Buddhist shrines in the [[Ajanta Caves]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Ellora]], [[Nalanda]], [[Ratnagiri]] and other sites".&lt;ref name="Behrendt 170"/&gt; Behrendt's proposal follows the model that states the northwestern influences and Kushana era during the 1st and 2nd century CE triggered the development of Buddhist art and monastery designs. In contrast, Susan Huntington states that this late nineteenth and early twentieth century model is increasingly questioned by the discovery of pre-Kushana era Buddha images outside the northwestern territories. Further, states Huntington, "archaeological, literary, and inscriptional evidence" such as those in Madhya Pradesh cast further doubts.&lt;ref name=huntington401&gt;Susan L. Huntington (1990), Early Buddhist Art and the Theory of Aniconism, Art Journal, Volume 49, 1990 - Issue 4: New Approaches to South Asian Art, pages 401-408&lt;/ref&gt; Devotional worship of Buddha is traceable, for example, to Bharhut Buddhist monuments dated between 2nd and 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name=huntington401/&gt; The [[Pandavleni Caves|Krishna or Kanha Cave]] (Cave 19) at Nasik has the central hall with connected cells, and it is generally dated to about the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Himanshu Prabha Ray|title=Archaeology and Buddhism in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-wrDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66|year=2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-39432-1|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pia Brancaccio|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C |year=2010|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-18525-9|pages=61 with footnote 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early stone viharas mimicked the timber construction that likely preceded them.&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/ajanta/aja02.html|title= Entrance Cave 9, Ajanta|publisher=art-and-archaeology.com|accessdate = 2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inscriptional evidence on stone and copper plates indicate that Buddhist viharas were often co-built with Hindu and Jain temples. The [[Gupta Empire]] era witnessed the building of numerous viharas, including those at the [[Ajanta Caves]].&lt;ref name="Asher1980p15"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick M. Asher|title=The Art of Eastern India: 300 - 800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-gGxzx6wxIC&amp;pg=PA15|year=1980|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-1-4529-1225-7|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these viharas and temples though evidenced in texts and inscriptions are no longer physically found, likely destroyed in later centuries by natural causes or due to war.&lt;ref name="Asher1980p15"/&gt;

===Viharas as a source of major Buddhist traditions===
As more people joined Buddhist monastic ''sangha'', the senior monks adopted a code of discipline which came to be known in the [[Pali Canon]] as the Vinaya texts.&lt;ref name="Silk2008p137"/&gt; These texts are mostly concerned with the rules of the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]''. The rules are preceded by stories telling how the Buddha came to lay them down, and followed by explanations and analysis. According to the stories, the rules were devised on an ad hoc basis as the Buddha encountered various behavioral problems or disputes among his followers. Each major early Buddhist tradition had its own variant text of code of discipline for vihara life. Major vihara appointed a ''vihara-pala'', the one who managed the vihara, settled disputes, determined sangha's consent and rules, and forced those hold-outs to this consensus.&lt;ref name="Silk2008p137"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan A. Silk|title=Managing Monks: Administrators and Administrative Roles in Indian Buddhist Monasticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RYTDAAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-532684-0|pages=39–58, 137–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three early influential monastic fraternities are traceable in Buddhist history.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"/&gt; The Mahavihara established by Mahinda was the oldest. Later, in 1st century BCE, King Vattagamani donated the Abhayagiri vihara to his favored monk, which led the Mahavihara fraternity to expel that monk.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"/&gt; In 3rd century CE, this repeated when King Mahasena donated the Jetavana vihara to an individual monk, which led to his expulsion. The Mahinda Mahavihara led to the orthodox Theravada tradition.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"/&gt; The Abhayagiri vihara monks, rejected and criticized by the orthodox Buddhist monks, were more receptive to heterodox ideas and they nurtured the Mahayana tradition. The Jetavana vihara monks vacillated between the two traditions, blending their ideas.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey| title= An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viharas of the Pāla era===
[[File:Shalvan Vihara, Mainamati 10 September 2016 34.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Shalvan Vihara]], the Buddhist monastery that operated between 7th-12th century in what is now [[Mainamati]], Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan L.

{{Main|Mahavihara|Buddhism}}
A range of monasteries grew up during the Pāla period in ancient Magadha (modern Bihar) and Bengal. According to Tibetan sources, five great [[mahavihara]]s stood out: [[Vikramashila]], the premier university of the era; [[Nalanda]], past its prime but still illustrious, [[Somapura Mahavihara|Somapura]], [[Odantapuri|Odantapurā]], and [[Jagaddala Mahavihara|Jagaddala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=English |first=Elizabeth |date=2002 |title=Vajrayogini: Her Visualization, Rituals, and Forms |publisher=Wisdom Publications |page=15 |isbn=0-86171-329-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sukumar Dutt, the five monasteries formed a network, were supported and supervised by the Pala state. Each of the five had their own seal and operated like a corporation, serving as centers of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dutt |first=Sukumar |date=1962 |title=Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture |location=London |publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd |pages=352–3 |oclc=372316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable monasteries of the [[Pala Empire]] were Traikuta, Devikota (identified with ancient Kotivarsa, 'modern Bangarh'), and [[Pandit Vihara]]. Excavations jointly conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India and University of Burdwan in 1971-1972 to 1974-1975 yielded a Buddhist monastic complex at Monorampur, near Bharatpur via Panagarh Bazar in the [[Bardhaman]] district of West Bengal. The date of the monastery may be ascribed to the early medieval period. Recent excavations at [[Jagjivanpur]] (Malda district, West Bengal) revealed another Buddhist monastery (''Nandadirghika-Udranga Mahavihara'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tathyabangla.org.in/public/i_cadeprt/archeology/arch3.asp |title=Jagjivanpur, A newly discovered Buddhist site in west Bengal |publisher=Information &amp; Cultural Affairs Department, Government of West Bengal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809033739/http://www.tathyabangla.org.in/public/i_cadeprt/archeology/arch3.asp |archivedate=9 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the ninth century.

Nothing of the superstructure has survived. A number of monastic cells facing a rectangular courtyard have been found. A notable feature is the presence of circular corner cells. It is believed that the general layout of the monastic complex at Jagjivanpur is by and large similar to that of Nalanda. Beside these, scattered references to some monasteries are found in epigraphic and other sources.  Among them Pullahari (in western Magadha), [[Halud Vihara]] (45&amp;nbsp;km south of Paharpur), Parikramana vihara and Yashovarmapura vihara (in Bihar) deserve mention. Other important structural complexes have been discovered at [[Mainamati]] (Comilla district, Bangladesh). Remains of quite a few viharas have been unearthed here and the most elaborate is the [[Shalban Vihara]]. The complex consists of a fairly large vihara of the usual plan of four ranges of monastic cells round a central court, with a temple in cruciform plan situated in the centre. According to a legend on a seal (discovered at the site) the founder of the monastery was [[Bhavadeva]], a ruler of the Deva dynasty.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Southeast Asia===
[[File:Chiang-Mai Thailand Wat-Chedi-Luang-01.jpg|thumb|Vihara, locally called ''wihan'', of [[Wat Chedi Luang]] in Northern [[Thailand]]]]
As Buddhism spread in southeast Asia, monasteries were built by local kings. The term ''vihara'' referred to the assembly hall of these monasteries. Many of these viharas continue to play an important role in the modern era practice of Theravada Buddhism. For example, during the twelfth lunar month in Thailand, lay Buddhists visit a monastery and circumambulate the vihara and the reliquary as a means to earn merit. Devotees may hold banana boats containing burning incense sticks, flowers, sticky rice and few coins as they complete the circle. These boats are then carried to a local river or pond and set afloat.&lt;ref name="Swearer1995p33"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald K. Swearer|title=The Buddhist World of Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LReQ_nw9HEMC&amp;pg=PA33|year=1995|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2165-0|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other times, the lay Buddhists gather for ''kathina'' ceremonies in the vihara where they donate robes, soap, towels, canned food, cigarettes and other material goods for the monks, with the belief that the merit they so earn will enable them to live in [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|heavenly samsara]] after some future rebirth.&lt;ref name="Swearer1995p23"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1397">In [[architecture]], '''visibility graph analysis''' ('''VGA''') is a method of analysing the inter-visibility connections within buildings or urban networks.  Visibility graph analysis was developed from the architectural theory of [[space syntax]] by Turner et al. (2001), and is applied through construction of a [[visibility graph]] within the open space of a plan.

Visibility graph analysis uses various measures from the theory of [[small-world network]]s and [[centrality]] in [[network theory]] in order to assess perceptual qualities of space and the possible usage of it.

Visibility graph analysis was firstly implemented in Turner's Depthmap software and is now widely used by both academics and practitioners through the [[open source]] and [[multi-platform]] [https://github.com/varoudis/depthmapX depthmapX] developed by Tasos Varoudis.
