'''''A General View of Positivism''''' (''Discours sur l'ensemble du positivisme'') was an 1848 book by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]], first published in English in 1865. A founding text in the development of [[positivism]] and the discipline of [[sociology]], the work provides a revised and full account of the theory Comte presented earlier in his multi-part ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'' (1830–1842). Comte outlines the epistemological view of positivism, provides an account of the manner by which sociology should be performed, and describes his [[law of three stages]].

== Life and work ==
Carter earned a [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] at the [[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]], a [[Master's degree|MA]] at the [[University of Sussex]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] at [[St Cross College, Oxford|St Cross College]] at the [[University of Oxford]].
Carter's first academic position was Lecturer in Political Theory at [[University College Dublin]]. He then became Head of the Philosophy Department at [[Heythrop College]], [[University of London]]. Subsequently, he was Professor of Philosophy and Environmental Studies at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].  He has been a Visiting Professor at the [[University of British Columbia]] and at the [[University of Bucharest]]. For a number of years Carter was joint editor of the ''[[Journal of Applied Philosophy]]''.

He works principally in [[political philosophy]], [[moral philosophy]], and [[environmental philosophy]]. Carter has published on a wide range of topics: within political philosophy he has written on political obligation, equality, and [[property right]]s; within environmental philosophy he has written on the moral status of both nonhuman animals and ecosystems; within [[applied ethics]] he has written on problems regarding future persons and world hunger; within [[political theory]] he has written on theories of the state and [[Third World]] underdevelopment; and within [[anarchism and Marxism]] Carter has written on their respective theories of history. He is currently developing an environmentalist moral theory that is, [[normative ethics|normatively]],  [[value pluralism|value pluralist]] and, [[metaethics|metaethically]], [[projectivism|projectivist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/philosophy/ourstaff/ |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016085729/http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/philosophy/ourstaff/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-10-16 |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;University of Glasgow :: Philosophy :: Our staff&lt;/nowiki&gt; |accessdate=2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; topics he has previously written about in moral theory.

Some of Carter's work in environmental philosophy is discussed critically by [[Robin Attfield]].&lt;ref name="Attfield"&gt;See for example Attfield, R., ''Environmental Ethics: An Overview for the Twenty-First Century''. Polity-Blackwell (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's state-primacy theory has been discussed by [[Robyn Eckersley]]&lt;ref name="Eckersley"&gt;Eckersley, R. ''The Green State: Rethinking Democracy and Sovereignty''. MIT Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized by [[John Barry (politician)|John Barry]].&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, J. ''Rethinking Green Politics: Nature, Virtue and Progress''. Sage (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and, most fully, by Simon Hailwood.&lt;ref name="Hailwood"&gt;Hailwood, S. ''How to be a Green Liberal: Nature, Value and Liberal Philosophy''. Acumen (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Carter has responded by arguing that his critics fail to take sufficiently into account the problems the military causes in modern societies: "it is telling how little attention green liberal critics of the state-primacy theory have paid to the role of the military and to its highly distorting effects. Failing to examine in any detail military requirements within ostensibly 'liberal democracies', whether existing or imagined, is more like simply ignoring an argument rather than answering it."&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;Carter, A. "Beyond primacy: Marxism, anarchism and radical green political theory," ''Environmental Politics'' 19, 6 (2010): 951-972, here at 971n.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter was one of the founder members of the London-based Anarchist Research Group.&lt;ref name="Goodway"&gt;Goodway, D. (ed.), ''[[For Anarchism: History, Theory, and Practice]]''. Routledge (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Ward]] has described Carter, with [[Murray Bookchin]], as one of the leading [[eco-anarchism|eco-anarchist]] thinkers.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, C. ''Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of academia, Carter is a former Chair of the [[World Development Movement|World Development Movement Scotland]] and a former Board Member of [[Friends of the Earth Scotland]]. He is also a former Board Member and a former Trustee of [[Friends of the Earth (EWNI)|Friends of the Earth]].

==Publications==
Carter's publications include over 50 articles in academic journals and he is the author of 3 books:

The '''Architects' Alliance of Ireland (AAoI)''' ({{lang-ga|Ailtirí 'Comhaontas na hÉireann}}) is an Irish pressure group founded in 2009.  Its purpose is to lobby for a change in recent legislation in Ireland.

Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007 requires long-established self-trained architects to undergo assessments before continuing to practice. The Alliance regards the present assessment test as inappropriate and overly expensive.  It sees itself as in conflict with the [[Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland]].

The Alliance has declared its founders to be Leonard Barrett (Midleton), Liam Hazel (Skibbereen), Brian Montaut (Bray) and Adrian Turner (Athlone).

==The foundation and aims of the Alliance==
The Architects' Alliance of Ireland (AAoI)&lt;ref name=aaoi&gt;[http://www.architectsalliance.ie Architects' Alliance of Ireland web site]&lt;/ref&gt; was formed at the start of 2009 in response to Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007.&lt;ref name=line&gt;{{cite news|title=Architects draw the line at new register|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/architects-draw-the-line-at-new-register-1952707.html|accessdate=29 March 2011|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environ.ie/en/Legislation/DevelopmentandHousing/BuildingStandards/FileDownLoad,5078,en.pdf The Building Control Act 2007], Irish Legislation&lt;/ref&gt; The Act sought for the first time to control the use of the term "architect" in the Republic of Ireland. Prior to the passing of the Act any practitioner could legally use the title architect. The [[Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland]] (RIAI) claims that it is to protect the consumer that the Building Control Act protected the title.

The AAoI is lobbying for an amendment of the legislation to allow self-taught and other qualified practitioners, established 7 years prior to the enforcement of the Building Control Act 2007, to be automatically registered as architects without undergoing  examinations that they consider discriminative. AAoI claims that automatic registration is a privilege that was offered to established RIAI members. It also claims that the current assessment is designed by the RIAI to fail the large majority of applicants. In May 2010 and July 2012 it gave evidence before an [[Oireachtas]] (national parliament) committee, the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.&lt;ref name=grandfather /&gt;&lt;ref name=committee2010b&gt;{{cite web|title=Registration of Architects:Discussion |url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/ENJ/2010/05/18/00005.asp |work=Joint Committee Environmental Matters |publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xRi740Mn?url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/ENJ/2010/05/18/00005.asp |archivedate=25 March 2011 |date=18 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is arguing for a [[grandfather clause]] and is lobbying for an amendment to that effect before the RIAI, [[Teachta Dála|TD]]s, Ministers and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name=grandfather&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0519/1224270654863.html Call for 'grandfather clause' in legislation for architects' register] ''The Irish Times'' - Wednesday, 19 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Law Society Gazette|date=April 2010|url=http://www.lawsociety.ie/Documents/Gazette/Gazette%202010/April2010.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2011|author=Brian Montaut (AAoI)|title=Protecting the 'royals' has a price?|page=15|volume=104|issue=3|publisher=Law Society of Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claims to have found inconsistencies in the legislation and its implementation, and has complained to the [[Irish Government]], the [[Competition Authority (Ireland)|Competition Authority of Ireland]], and the European Commission. 
The lobbying efforts of the Alliance gained the support of [[John O'Donoghue (politician)|John O'Donoghue]] TD who has tabled The Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riai.ie/uploads/files/RIAI_QUESTIONS_ETC_GRANDFATHER_CLAUSE_PRESS_RELEASE_26_07_10.pdf "RIAI questions need for additional ‘grandfather clause’" ] Tuesday, 27 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2010/4110/B4110D.pdf The Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a change in government the bill was never presented in front of the [[Dail]] (lower house of the Irish Parliament).

AAoI is concerned about the RIAI having a [[monopoly]] on architecture in the Republic of Ireland. The RIAI has represented the profession in Ireland since 1839, prior to the creation of the Republic of Ireland, when the country was still under the influence of British rules. Members and supporters of the RIAI claim that their institute has been involved in the training and governing of architects for many years, that it played a very important role in ensuring high standards in the profession. The AAoI claims that the RIAI is a limited company which has used its influence in front and within the government for the Building Control Act to suit RIAI interests as well as the interest of RIAI members and directors.&lt;ref name=committee2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Registration of Architects: Discussion |url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/ENJ/2010/05/18/00005.asp |work=Joint Committee Environmental Matters |publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xRi740Mn?url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/ENJ/2010/05/18/00005.asp |archivedate=25 March 2011 |date=18 May 2010 |quote=Deputy Phil Hogan: There is a perception that the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland is operating a closed shop and an exclusive club because of the registration fees and the technical examination methodology it uses |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAoI claims that the registration system set up by the RIAI favours the Institution's own members while discriminating against others, especially self-taught architects. The RIAI claims that the registration system simply recognises that RIAI members have already passed rigorous professional examinations and assessments similar to those required by the new legislation. On this ground, the AAoI stated that its members are ready to pass a similar examination (so called part 3), but are opposed to the actual examinations specially designed for self-taught architects, that they consider discriminative and overly expensive.&lt;ref&gt;The Registration of Architects - [http://www.architectsalliance.ie/JOC%20Minutes.pdf Minutes of Dail Committee Meeting]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the cost for the Irish Prescribed Register Examination called ARAE&lt;ref&gt;ARAE Architects Register Admission Examination [http://www.ARAE.ie web site]&lt;/ref&gt; for self-trained architects was €11,500 + €2,000 for lectures, compared to €3,500 in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=committee2010a&gt;{{cite web|title=Registration of Architects: Discussion |url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/ENJ/2010/05/18/00005.asp |work=Joint Committee Environmental atters |publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xRi740Mn?url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/ENJ/2010/05/18/00005.asp |archivedate=25 March 2011 |date=18 May 2010 |quote=Vice Chairman Pádraic McCormack: Witnesses will see that the committee is struggling to come to a conclusion that will solve this problem.

==Background==
Although in 2006 the Competition Authority of Ireland had recommended the creation of an Architects Council of Ireland to be independent of the RIAI, the 2007 Act left the RIAI as the registration body, albeit with various safeguards.&lt;ref name=compauth&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition in professional services: Architects |url=http://www.tca.ie/images/uploaded/documents/architects%20executive%20summary.pdf |publisher=Competition Authority of Ireland |year=2006 |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621214454/http://www.tca.ie/images/uploaded/documents/architects%20executive%20summary.pdf |archivedate=21 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcenaney&gt;{{cite news|last=McEnaney|first=Tom|title=New body 'should regulate architects'|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/new-body-should-regulate-architects-106628.html|accessdate=29 March 2011|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=8 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grandfather2007&gt;{{cite web|title=The Grandfather Clause in the Building Regulation Act 2007 |url=http://www.ruairiquinn.ie/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Registration-of-Architects.pdf |publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas |accessdate=29 March 2011 |author=Oireachtas Research &amp; Library Service |date=23 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194752/http://www.ruairiquinn.ie/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Registration-of-Architects.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish legislation states that practitioners with a minimum of 7 years of experience but without recognised formal qualification must be assessed through an examination to continue practising in the State.&lt;ref name=ohalloran&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Halloran|first=Marie|title=Testing time for architects|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/property/2010/0805/1224276219351.html|accessdate=29 March 2011|newspaper=Irish Times|date=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAoI considers the examination as inappropriate and exclusionary. The current system allows RIAI members to be automatically registered.

AAoI wants a grandfather clause to be included in the Act for an automatic registration of self-trained professionals who have practised as architects for a minimum of 7 years within the [[Republic of Ireland]]. European countries such as the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaruk.info/Legislation/Act31.PDF Architects (Registration) Act 1931] (UK)&lt;/ref&gt; France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=606CAD25CBEA6D17169D0D5D82D5C464.tpdjo14v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000522423&amp;dateTexte=19770104&amp;categorieLien=id#JORFTEXT000000522423 Loi n°77-2 du 3 janvier 1977 sur l'architecture] (Architects Act in France)&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordredesarchitectes.be/fr/textes/juridique/loi_du_20_fevrier_1939.htm Loi du 20 fevrier 1939] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226220737/http://www.ordredesarchitectes.be/fr/textes/juridique/loi_du_20_fevrier_1939.htm |date=26 December 2010 }} (Architects Act in Belgium)&lt;/ref&gt; Italy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordinearchitetti.fi.it/writable/Documenti/Conoscere%20l'ordine/A3/COMPETENZE/A3_1-12%20RD%2024-06-1923%20n.1395.pdf legge 24 June 1923 No. 1395] (Architects Act in Italy)&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;Refer to document on the Dutch Registration System drafted after a meeting between the General Secretary and Dr. Hans Groenevald, Director of the Stichting Bureau Architectenreglster, (SBA) in the Hague on 1 October 1993. 1 October 1993 is a significant date because on that day the protection of the title "architect" came into force in the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; when first implementing the registration of architects, have included a grandfather clause in their legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Grandfather Clause in the Building Regulation Act 2007 |url=http://www.ruairiquinn.ie/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Registration-of-Architects.pdf |publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas |accessdate=29 March 2011 |author=Oireachtas Library &amp; Research Service |date=23 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194752/http://www.ruairiquinn.ie/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Registration-of-Architects.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal opinion provided to AAoI advises that such a change would not be in conflict with European Union law.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Anthony|title=Querist: Architects’ Alliance Re: Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2010 Opinion|url=http://www.architectsalliance.ie/AC%20LEGAL%20OPINION%20Nov2010.pdf|publisher=Architects' Alliance|accessdate=30 March 2011|date=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examinations for Self-taught Architects==
The ARAE is an examination for practitioners who have gained 7 years of experience at any given time. Since 2012 the cost of the ARAE was lowered to €8,500 (+ optional €1,350  for an additional lecture course which is essential to the examination).&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.arae.ie ARAE website]&lt;/ref&gt; The position of AAoI is that the ARAE still is unaffordable for the large majority of self-taught architects due to the cost of the examination and the loss of income associated to it. Since 2009, only 30 architects out of many hundreds of potential applicants have successfully completed the ARAE Examination. The RIAI claims that the methodology is specifically designed for practising architects, and that it is suited to those in employment as examinations are arranged in stages over one calendar year. On the contrary, AAoI has explained in many meetings that the ARAE methodology is unsuitable for practicing architects, with many lectures and examinations organised during office hours and spanning on a period of approximately 10 months. An employee would not be able to pass the ARAE without the permission of his employer, without opting out of employment for many weeks. A self-employed would have problems to meet the demands of its clients while preparing and passing the ARAE. He would need to refuse projects and contracts to ensure success to the examination.

The "Technical Assessment" is an examination for self-trained architects with more than 10 years of experience gained in the Republic of Ireland prior to the enforcement of architects’ registration. AAoI claims that the fees are inappropriate (€6,500 in 2009, lowered to €4,500 in 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Refer to [http://www.riai.ie/news/article/technical_assessment_charges/ technical assessment cost] from the RIAI website&lt;/ref&gt; and that the RIAI is manipulating the procedure by setting up academic and administrative standards that do not reflect the practice of architecture before the implementation of registration. The RIAI claims that the examinations are based on internationally recognised standards and that 80% of candidates to date have been successful. The AAoI claims that the 80% success rate to the technical assessment is false and that the percentage is nearer to 50%. AAoI declared that less of a dozen of practitioners (out of hundreds of potential applicants) have applied for the Technical Assessment. The RIAI claims that the majority of those on the registration board are not architects and that they are not affiliated to the RIAI. AAoI stated that the sub-boards assessing applicants are made of 3 RIAI affiliated architects only, and that it would be difficult for any member of the assessment board not affiliated to the RIAI, to challenge the opinion and position of RIAI members on architectural subjects. AAoI members claim that the assessment is set up by their competitors. The RIAI states that the fees for registration are now approved by the government.

== Chronological Development ==

===AAoI actions and related events 2011===
AAoI members lobbied local TDs ([[Teachta Dála]]) for addressing newly elected [[Phil Hogan|Minister Hogan]] on the subject of their concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to the AAoI website [http://www.architectsalliance.ie/news.html News Page]&lt;/ref&gt; Phil Hogan supported the Alliance as a TD and may have required the recent changes in examination fees. In 2012, the position of the Alliance is that the actual examinations are still inappropriate and discriminatory for all self-trained architects established prior to the publication of the Building Control Bill 2005. Some members of the RIAI claim that the examinations are seen by most registered architects as very appropriate to the profession, that they are based on internationally recognised basic standards and discriminate only between those who know the necessary subject matter and those who do not. The RIAI claims that this is important if consumers are to be protected. On this ground AAoI thinks that consumers are not protected by the RIAI. It claims that the RIAI is a limited company acting mainly for the interests of its directors and members. AAoI stated that despite many failures well advertised in Irish newspapers, the RIAI never defended consumers over its members, and that in the contrary, it always protected and reduced its members'liability instead of acting toward consumers' interests. The AAoI claims that the RIAI wrongly uses the subjects of Public Safety to limit competition, that public safety can be implemented by other means and that limiting the competition for architects to RIAI ltd membership will not serve the public nor protect consumers.

===AAoI actions and related events 2012===
Members of the new government have decided to review the actual situation in order to find a solution to the conflict. Architects' Alliance of Ireland gained the support of TDs and Senators. Deputy [[Ciarán Lynch]], chairman of the "''Joint committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht''", organised a meeting with the RIAI and the AAoI in order to debate and  find solutions for the registration of the so-called "grandfather architects". The issue of the Building Control (amendment) Regulations 2012 was also the subject of the meeting, but it was only rarely addressed during the 2 hours debate. During the meeting, AAoI explained how new regulations are preventing its members to provide a full architectural service despite the previous RIAI's assertions stating that: "''The Act does prevent those not on the Register from using the title architect but it does not limit or control in any way the functions of those providing services in the field of architecture.''"&lt;ref&gt;"Environment Committee to discuss Building Control Act 2007 with architects’ groups", [http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/mediazone/pressreleases/name-8596-en.html see related web page from the Government web page].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee on the Environment agreed to establish an informal working group to request the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government to take special consideration of the situation of long-standing practitioners in the field of architecture. The group shall work with all the stakeholders to provide a solution, on a strictly once-off basis. The group shall ensure that this process is open, fair and transparent and that the costs involved are reduced to the minimum possible and that any unnecessary costs, administration and [[red tape]] are avoided. The Committee agreed the informal working group would be composed of: Deputy [[Luke 'Ming' Flanagan|Luke Flanagan]] IND; Deputy [[Sandra McLellan]] SF; Deputy [[Ged Nash]] LAB; Senator [[Cáit Keane]] FG.&lt;ref&gt;See latest news from AAoI website dated 17 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===AAoI actions and related events 2013===

====Independent Review====
The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government,  Mr  [[Phil Hogan]], T.D., appointed Garrett Fennell Solicitor to conduct an independent review of the arrangements for the registration of Architects under the Building Control Act 2007.&lt;ref&gt;More information about the independent review can be accessed from the [http://www.riai.ie/index.php/news/article/ministers_review_of_arrangements_for_the_registration_of_architects RIAI website]&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett Fennell is currently serving as chairperson of the Admissions Board established for the Statutory Register.

The terms of reference to the Review were as follows:

1. To carry out an independent review of the arrangements generally for the registration of  Architects under the Building Control Act 2007

2. To take stock of the overall experience to date in relation to the operation of the registration system with a view to seeing how the system can be further improved.

3. Having regard to the lower than expected number of applications from practically trained architects, to review and make specific recommendation on how the registration of practically trained architects can be better encouraged.

The AAoI and anyone concerned were invited to make a submission for consideration on or before 10 May 2013 to architectsreview@environ.{{not a typo|ie}}.

Information submitted are subject to the Freedom of Information Acts and may be placed in the public domain. Administrative assistance in relation to this review was provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government but Garrett Fennell Solicitor's consideration, treatment and report on the issues raised will be prepared in line with the Terms of Reference and independently of the Department and the registration body.&lt;ref&gt;AAoI Submission to the independent review can be accessed from [http://www.architectsalliance.ie/Data.html#D AAoI website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 03/09/2013 Mr Garret Fennell, Solicitor, issued his report for the independent review.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/BuildingStandards/FileDownLoad,34097,en.pdf copy of the report] can be accessed from the Department of the Environment website&lt;/ref&gt; The Report was published on 24/09/2013 with a Press Notice.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/BuildingStandards/News/MainBody,34098,en.htm Press Notice] can be accessed from the Department of the Environment website&lt;/ref&gt;

====Report from The Joint Committee on the Environment====

on 17 July 2013, The Joint Committee on the Environment issued its report on the Title of "Architect".&lt;ref&gt;JOINT COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT, CULTURE AND THE  [[GAELTACHT]] 31ST DÁIL ÉIREANN / 24TH SEANAD ÉIREANN [http://architectsalliance.ie/EJOC%20Report-on-the-Title-of-Architect.pdf REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE TITLE OF ARCHITECT JULY 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The 54 pages report includes over 15 formal recommendations in relation to the existing legislation (the Building Control Act 2007) which gave protection to the 'title' of architect. One of the recommendations to the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, gives consideration to the inclusion of a typical, self-extinguishing ‘grandfather’ clause in the Building Control Act 2007 – as is provided in other States' legislation. Another recommendation is for the Technical Assessment Board to advise on the applicability of Irish law and how it facilitates or not the easy transfer of skills across the European Union and the recognition of skills gained outside Ireland and in Ireland.

During the meeting held on 17 July, [[Michael McCarthy (politician)|Michael McCarthy]] TD, [[Cathaoirleach]] of the [[Oireachtas]] Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, said: "When a State starts to protect the use of the term ‘Architect’ and confines it to those on the architects’ register, issues can arise relating to the position of existing self-trained practitioners, colloquially termed ‘grandfathers’. These issues have been successfully addressed by other Member States in so-called ‘grandfather’ clauses in legislation."&lt;ref&gt;Refer to [http://www.architectsalliance.ie/news.html AAoI Website News Page], entry date 17 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===AAoI actions and related events 2014===

In 2014, AAoI launched a website to inform the public on the direction taken by the Irish government to reinforce building control in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;the website can be accessed at http://si9.ie/&lt;/ref&gt; Statutory Instrument No.19 of 2014&lt;ref&gt;The document is published here: http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.si.2014.0019.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a final action from the Irish Government to prevent members of AAoI offering services in Ireland. Despite having always claimed to protect the title "architect" without taking away the rights of AAoI members as professionals practicing architecture in the State, the Minister for the Environment signed a statutory instrument which now deprives professionally trained architects from their rights to design and to oversee the construction of a project. The AAoI strongly opposed the new legislation which was enforced despite strong opposition from other groups&lt;ref&gt;many professionals and members of the public involved with building their own houses or extensions have expressed concerns about the new legislation. Some of the concerns can be accessed on the [http://bregsforum.wordpress.com/category/irish-building-control/ Bregs forum]&lt;/ref&gt; and despite The Competition Authority warning which explained that: "As a general principle, new legislation should not impose any unnecessary restrictions on the pool of people eligible to offer a service."&lt;ref&gt;Refer to: [http://architectsalliance.ie/The%20Competition%20Authority%20Building%20Control%20Regulations%20Opinion.pdf "Consultation on Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012 - Submission to Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critics and oppositions ==
The architectural professional bodies assert that, until the 2007 Act, clients were put at risk from "cowboy" operators and there were no disciplinary controls over individuals outside the professional bodies.&lt;ref name=grandfather2007 /&gt; The RIAI oppose the proposed amendment of the Building Control Act 2007. Their position is that:" ''The Building Control Act marks a key shift in widening access to the profession by introducing access to those who have not pursued the standard higher education route. There is a registered admission examination and technical assessment. Up to 1966, entry to the architecture profession could be gained through the RIAI examination system but there has been a general shift towards formal qualifications. The pendulum has swung back to some degree with the shift to an outcomes-based assessment in higher education and away from the input model. The Building Control Act has both models, input from qualifications and output based on the assessment obtained without formal education''."&lt;ref&gt;This is a quote from the RIAI director during the Joint Committee on the Environment. It can be verified in the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i61IYOhfhns&amp;feature=related Videos] or in the [https://www.webcitation.org/5xRi740Mn?url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/ENJ/2010/05/18/00005.asp Minutes of Dail Committee Meeting].&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIAI opposed John O'Donoghue's Private Member's Bill the Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2010. A private member's Bill that can be brought to the Dáil by any single TD and the behest of his supporters. The Institute's position is that John O'Donoghue's proposed amendment to the current legislation, if enacted, would be in breach of EU law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepost.ie/news/ag-counsels-caution-on-architect-registration-54638.html "AG counsels caution on architect registration"] published in the Sunday Business Post  -20 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute organised political lobbying against John O'Donoghue's Private Member's Bill issuing statements that the proposed amendment damages Irish architects and Irish architecture, that it undermines consumers' protection, and that it disadvantages younger architectural graduates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riai.ie/uploads/files/WHATS_WRONG_WITH_THE_PROPOSED_AMENDMENT.pdf "What is wrong with the proposed amendment?"] as published on RIAI website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status ==

The number of individuals and practices joinning the association has grown from a dozen to more than a hundred.&lt;ref name=ohalloran /&gt; Some registered architects and many engineers, technicians or surveyors and others are also supporting the cause of AAoI.&lt;ref&gt;See AAoI presentation during the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Debate (18 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The association declares "protecting diversity and promoting choice in Irish Architecture", it also claims "promoting and protecting the provision of architectural services in Ireland".  Some members have suggested that the group should develop into a professional representative body.&lt;ref name=aaoi /&gt;

'''Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center''' in [[Rüschlikon]]/ZH is a Research Facility for [[Nanotechnology]] owned by [[IBM]].

This building was named after the two Nanotech-Pioneers and [[Nobelaureates]] [[Gerd Binnig]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]], who invented the [[Scanning Tunneling Microscope]] in the year 1986 in the Zurich Research Laboratory next to the Nanotechnology Center.

The Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center is specialized on [[basic research]] but also in [[photonics]] and [[nanotechnology]].  The facility is based on the premise of open collaboration with IBM scientists and external partners.  One of these partners is [[ETH Zurich]], the renowned Swiss university that agreed to rent part of the Center for 10 years. [[Empa|EMPA]] is a third partner.

== Noise-Free-Labs ==
Something special in the new building are the so-called "noise-free" labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Dexter|title=IBM Goes for World Record in "Noise-Free" Labs|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/nanotechnology/ibm-goes-for-world-record-in-noisefree-labs-|accessdate=11 November 2010|publisher=IEEE|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They protect the experiments against environmental influences (that could influence and falsify the most sensitive experiments) like vibrations or [[Electromagnetic field|electro-magnetic fields]]. Additionally, the labs are optimized to emit as little sound, electro-magnetic fields and vibrations during air-conditioning to achieve stable temperatures and humidity. The experiments are separated from the researcher and associated equipment and are mostly controlled in remote operation. Some rooms fulfil [[ISO 5]] standards for [[cleanrooms]] as some production tools are installed in these ultra-silent rooms dedicated to most accurate fabrication or characterization on the 1 nanometer scale. The labs are unique in the world as all disturbances relevant for nanotechnology are compensated simultaneously and kept at utmost constancy.

==History==
The [[foundation stone]] was laid on 2009 and after two years of construction the building was opened on May 17, 2011 for research.  Swiss government official Didier Burkhalter attended the ceremony and was an official speaker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2868">The '''Bonn Challenge''' is a global effort to restore 150 million hectares of the world's degraded and deforested lands by 2020. It was hosted and launched by Germany and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN)  in [[Bonn]] on 2 September 2011, in collaboration with the Global Partnership on Forest/Landscape Restoration and targets delivery on the [[Rio Convention]]s and other outcomes of the 1992 [[Earth Summit]].&lt;ref name="IUCN policy" /&gt;  As at 2013 over 20 million hectares of land had been pledged for restoration from countries including [[Brazil]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Rwanda]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On the Road to the Bonn Challenge|url=http://www.forestlandscaperestoration.org/resource/road-bonn-challenge|publisher=Global Partnership on Forest/Landscape Restoration|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]], Costa Rica, [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[Rwanda]] and Brazil have embarked on successful landscape restoration programmes.&lt;ref name="3 News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Governments sign up to Bonn Challenge restoring degraded land|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Governments-sign-up-to-Bonn-Challenge-restoring-degraded-land/tabid/1160/articleID/258215/Default.aspx|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=3 News|date=19 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for the Evaluation of Language and Communication Technologies (CELCT)''' was an organisation devoted to the evaluation of language technologies, located in [[Povo]], [[Trento]] ([[Italy]]).

CELCT was established in 2003 by [[Fondazione Bruno Kessler|FBK]] (Fondazione Bruno Kessler) and [[German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence|DFKI]] (Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz), and was funded by the [[Trentino|Autonomous Province of Trento]]. The goals of CELCT were "to set up infrastructures and develop skills in order to operate successfully in the field of the evaluation of language and communication technologies, becoming a reference point in the field at the national and European levels."&lt;ref name="CELCT"&gt;{{cite web|title=CELCT web site|url=http://www.celct.it/about-us.php|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CELCT interpreted its mission by carrying out several activities in the field of [[language technology|HLT]] evaluation, mainly focusing on the organization of national and international evaluation campaigns and on the creation of [[speech corpus|speech]] and [[text corpus|text]] corpora in different [[language]]s and at different linguistic [[annotation]] levels.&lt;ref name="CELCT" /&gt;

CELCT's activities were closed on December 31, 2013. The staff working at CELCT at the time of its closure is continuing their research activities within [[Fondazione Bruno Kessler|FBK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Fondazione Bruno Kessler website|url=http://www.fbk.eu/|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron''' (English ''German Electron Synchrotron'') commonly referred to by the abbreviation '''DESY''', is a national research center in [[Germany]] that operates [[particle accelerator|particle accelerators]] used to investigate the structure of matter. It conducts a broad spectrum of inter-disciplinary scientific research in three main areas: [[particle physics|particle]] and [[high energy physics]]; [[photon]] science; and the development, construction and operation of [[particle accelerators]]. Its name refers to its first project, an [[electron]] [[synchrotron]]. DESY is publicly financed by the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], the [[States of Germany]], and the [[German Research Foundation]] (DFG). DESY is a member of the [[Helmholtz Association]] and operates at sites in [[Hamburg]] and [[Zeuthen]].

== Functions ==
DESY's function is to conduct [[fundamental research]]. It specializes in:

*'''[[Particle accelerator]]''' development, construction and operation.
*'''[[Particle physics]]''' research to explore the fundamental characteristics of matter and forces, including [[astroparticle physics]]
*'''[[Photon|Photon science]]''' research in surface physics, [[material science]], [[chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[geophysics]] and [[medicine]] through the use of [[synchrotron radiation]] and [[free electron laser]]s

In addition to operating its own large accelerator facilities, DESY also provides consulting services to research initiatives, institutes and universities. It is closely involved in major international projects such as the [[European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser]], the [[Large Hadron Collider]] in Geneva, the [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]] at the South Pole and the [[International Linear Collider]].&lt;ref name = DESYabout&gt;[http://www.desy.de/about_desy/index_eng.html DESY About] retrieved 24 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sites ==
DESY operates in two locations. The primary location is in a suburb of [[Hamburg]]. In 1992, DESY expanded to a second site in [[Zeuthen]] near [[Berlin]].

[[File:DESY main entrance 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Main entrance of the DESY campus in Hamburg.]]
=== Hamburg ===
The DESY Hamburg site is located in the suburb [[Bahrenfeld]], west of the city. Most of DESY's research in high energy physics with elementary particles has been taking place here since 1960. The site is bounded by the ring of the former [[PETRA]] particle accelerator (since 2007 PETRA III, a synchrotron source) and part of the larger HERA ([[Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage]]) ring. Besides these accelerators there is also the [[free electron laser]] FLASH, and its offspring XFEL, which became operational in 2017. This project is meant to secure DESY's future place among the top research centers of the world.

=== Zeuthen ===
Following [[German reunification]], the DESY expanded to a second site: The Institute for High Energy Physics ({{lang-de|Institut für Hochenergiephysik IfH}}) in Zeuthen, southeast of [[Berlin]], was the high energy physics laboratory of the [[German Democratic Republic]] and belonged to the [[Academy of Sciences of the GDR]]. The institute was merged with DESY on 1 January 1992.

== Employees and training ==
DESY employs approximately 2000 people, of which 650 are scientists, working in the fields of accelerator operation, research and development. Staff is distributed on the two sites as follows:

*Hamburg: 1800 employees, of which 600 are scientists
*Zeuthen: 200 employees, of which 50 are scientists

DESY also trains more than 100 apprentices in commercial and technical vocations, and more than 700 undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs. DESY also hosts 3000 scientists from over 40 countries annually.&lt;ref name = DESYportrait&gt;[http://www.desy.de/about_desy/desy_portrait/index_eng.html DESY Portrait] retrieved 24 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Budget and financing ==
The research center has an annual budget around € 192 million. Of this, approximately € 173 million is budgeted for the Hamburg site and € 19 million for Zeuthen. The primary source of financing is the [[Federal Ministry for Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry for Education and Research]] ({{lang-de|Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung}}) with 10% support coming from the German States of [[Hamburg]] and [[Brandenburg]]. Individual experiments and projects at the accelerators are financed by the participating German and foreign institutes, which in turn are often publicly financed. Special projects are funded by the [[German Research Foundation]].&lt;ref name = DESYportrait/&gt;

== International Co-operation ==
[[Image:DESY1.jpg|thumb|Segment of a particle accelerator at ''DESY'']]

2500 external scientists used  the DESY facilities for research with photons at PETRA III and FLASH in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://photon-science.desy.de/facilities/petra_iii__flash_schedules/index_eng.html All Beamtime and Operating Schedules] retrieved 23 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The International Project HERA ===
The construction of the accelerator HERA was one of the first  really internationally financed projects of this magnitude. Beforehand the construction of scientific facilities was always financed by the country in which it is located. Only the costs for the experiments were carried by the conducting national or foreign institutes. But due to the enormous scope of the HERA project many international facilities consented to already help with the construction. 
All in all more than 45 institutes and 320 corporations participated with donations of money and/or materials in the construction of  the facility, more than 20% of the costs were carried by foreign institutions.

Following the example of HERA, many scientific projects of a large scale are financed jointly by several states. By now this model is established and international cooperation is pretty common with the construction of those facilities.

== Particle Accelerators, Facilities and Experiments at DESY ==
[[Image:Desy.jpg|thumb|German 1984 postal stamp - 25th anniversary of DESY's foundation]]
DESY's accelerators were not built all at once, but rather were added one by one to meet the growing demand of the scientists for higher and higher energies to gain more insight into particle structures. In the course of the construction of new accelerators the older ones were converted to pre-accelerators or to sources for [[synchrotron radiation]] for laboratories with new research tasks (for example for HASYLAB).

Nowadays, after the shutdown of the accelerator HERA in 2007, DESY's most important facilities are the high intensity source for [[synchrotron radiation]], [[PETRA]]&amp;nbsp;III, the synchrotron-research lab HASYLAB, the free-electron laser FLASH (previously called VUV-FEL), the test facility for the [[European x-ray free electron laser|European XFEL]], and the European XFEL itself. The development of the different facilities will be described chronologically in the following section.

=== DESY ===
The construction of the first particle accelerator '''DESY''' (''D''eutsches ''E''lektronen ''Sy''nchrotron, "German Electron Synchrotron") began in 1960. At that time it was the biggest facility of this kind and was able to accelerate electrons to 7.4 GeV. On 1 January 1964 the first electrons were accelerated in the synchrotron, starting research on [[quantum electrodynamics]] and the search for new elementary particles.

The international attention first focused on DESY in 1966 due to its contribution to the validation of quantum electrodynamics, which was achieved with results from the accelerator. In the following decade DESY established itself as a center of excellence for the development and operation of high-energy accelerators.

The synchrotron radiation, which comes up as a side effect, was first used in 1967 for absorption measurements. For the arising spectrum there had not been any conventional radiation sources beforehand. The [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory|European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)]] made use of the possibilities that arose with the new technology and in 1972 established a permanent branch at DESY with the aim of analyzing the structure of biological molecules by means of synchrotron radiation.

The electron-synchrotron DESY II and the proton-synchrotron DESY III were taken into operation  in 1987 and 1988 respectively as pre-accelerators for HERA.

=== DORIS III ===
DORIS ('''Do'''ppel-'''Ri'''ng-'''S'''peicher, "double-ring storage"), built between 1969 and 1974, was DESY's second circular accelerator and its first storage ring with a circumference of nearly 300 m. Constructed as an electron-positron storage ring, one could conduct collision-experiments with electrons and their antiparticles at energies of 3.5 GeV per beam. In 1978 the energy of the beams was raised to 5 GeV each.

With evidence of the "excited charmonium states" DORIS made an important contribution to the process of proving the existence of heavy quarks. In the same year there were the first tests of X-ray lithography at DESY, a procedure that was later refined to X-ray depth lithography.

In 1987 the [[ARGUS (experiment)|ARGUS detector]] of the DORIS storage ring was the first place where the conversion of a B-meson into its antiparticle, the anti-B-meson was observed. From this one could conclude that it was possible, for the second-heaviest quark - the bottom-quark - under certain circumstances to convert into a different quark. One could also conclude from this that the unknown sixth quark - the top quark - had to possess a huge mass. The top quark was found eventually in 1995 at the Fermilab in the USA.

After the commissioning of HASYLAB in 1980 the synchrotron radiation, which was generated at DORIS as a byproduct, was used for research there. While in the beginning DORIS was used only ⅓ of the time as a radiation source, from 1993 on the storage-ring solely served that purpose under the name DORIS III. In order to achieve more intense and controllable radiation, DORIS was upgraded in 1984 with [[Wiggler (synchrotron)|wigglers]] and [[undulator]]s. By means of a special array of magnets the accelerated positrons could now be brought onto a slalom course. By this the intensity of the emitted synchrotron radiation was increased a hundredfold in comparison to conventional storage ring systems.

DORIS III provided 33 photon beamlines, where 44 instruments are operated in circulation. The overall beam time per year amounts to 8 to 10 months. It was finally shut down in favour of it successor PETRA III in the end of 2012.

==== OLYMPUS ====
The former site of [[ARGUS (experiment)|ARGUS]] in DORIS is now the location of the OLYMPUS experiment, which began installation in 2010.&lt;ref name="DESYolympus"&gt;{{cite web|title=OLYMPUS - Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY |url=https://www.desy.de/research/facilities__projects/olympus/index_eng.html |accessdate=5 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; OLYMPUS uses the toroidal magnet and pair of [[Wire chamber#Drift chambers|drift chambers]] from the MIT-Bates BLAST experiment along with refurbished time-of-flight detectors and multiple luminosity monitoring systems. OLYMPUS measures the positron-proton to electron-proton cross section ratio to precisely determine the size of two-photon exchange in elastic ep scattering. This may help resolve the proton form factor discrepancy between recent measurements made using polarization techniques and ones using the Rosenbluth separation method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OLYMPUS Collaboration|url=http://web.mit.edu/OLYMPUS/index.html|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; OLYMPUS took data in 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref name="DESYolympus" /&gt;

=== PETRA II ===
{{main|PETRA}}
PETRA ('''P'''ositron-'''E'''lektron-'''T'''andem-'''R'''ing-'''A'''nlage, "positron-electron tandem-ring facility") was built between 1975 and 1978. At the time of its construction it was the biggest storage ring of its kind and still is DESY's second largest synchrotron after HERA. PETRA originally served for research on elementary particles. The discovery of the gluon, the carrier particle of the strong nuclear force, in 1979 is counted as one of the biggest successes. PETRA can accelerate electrons and positrons to 19 GeV.

Research at PETRA lead to an intensified international use of the facilities at DESY. Scientists from China, England, France, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway and the USA participated in the first experiments at PETRA alongside many German colleagues.

In 1990 the facility was taken into operation under the name PETRA II as a pre-accelerator for protons and electrons/positrons for the new particle accelerator HERA. In March 1995, PETRA II was equipped with undulators to create greater amounts of synchrotron radiation with higher energies, especially in the X-ray part of the spectrum. Since then PETRA serves HASYLAB as a source of high-energy synchrotron radiation and for this purpose possesses three test experimental areas. Positrons are accelerated to up to 12 GeV nowadays.

[[File:PETRA III Max von Laue Hall 2014.png|thumb|right|PETRA III Max von Laue hall at DESY campus in Hamburg.]]
=== PETRA III ===
PETRA III is the third incarnation for the PETRA storage ring operating a regular user programme as the most brilliant storage ring based X-ray source worldwide since August 2010. The accelerator produces a particle energy of 6 GeV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hasylab.desy.de/facilities/petra_iii/index_eng.html|title=PETRA III|publisher=Hasylab, Desy|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PETRA III Max von Laue Hall inside 2014.png|thumb|View inside the PETRA III Max von Laue hall at DESY campus in Hamburg.]]
=== HASYLAB ===
[[Image:DESY2.jpg|thumb|The [[ARGUS (experiment)|ARGUS]] detector at ''DESY'']]

The HASYLAB ('''Ha'''mburger '''Sy'''nchrotronstrahlungs'''lab'''or, "Hamburg Synchrotron radiation Laboratory") is used for research with synchrotron radiation at DESY. It was opened in 1980 with 15 experimental areas (today there are 42). The laboratory adjoins to the storage ring DORIS in order to be able to use the generated synchrotron radiation for its research. While in the beginning  DORIS served only one third of the time as a radiation source for HASYLAB, since 1993 all its running time is available for experiments with synchrotron radiation. On top of the 42 experimental areas DORIS provides, there are also three test experimental areas available for experiments with high-energy radiation generated with the storage ring PETRA.

After the upgrade of DORIS with the first wigglers, which produced far more intense radiation, the first [[Mössbauer spectrum]] acquired by means of synchrotron radiation was recorded at HASYLAB in 1984.

In 1985 the development of more advanced X-ray technology made it possible to bring to light the structure of the influenza virus. In the following year researchers at HASYLAB were the first to successfully make the attempt of exciting singular grid oscillations in solid bodies. Thus it was possible to conduct analyses of elastic materials, which were possible prior to this only with nuclear reactors via neutron scattering.

In 1987 the workgroup for structural molecular biology of the Max Planck Society founded a permanent branch at HASYLAB. It uses synchrotron radiation to study the structure of ribosomes.

Nowadays many national and foreign groups of researchers conduct their experiments at HASYLAB: All in all 1900 scientists participate in the work. On the whole the spectrum of the research ranges from fundamental research to experiments in physics, material science, chemistry, molecular biology, geology and medicine to industrial cooperations.

One example is OSRAM, which  since recently uses HASYLAB to study the filaments of their light bulbs. The gained insights helped to notably increase the life span of the lamps in certain fields of application.

In addition researchers at HASYLAB analysed among other things minuscule impurities in silicon for computer chips, the way catalysators work, the microscopic properties of materials and the structure of protein molecules.

=== HERA ===
{{main|Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage}}
HERA ('''H'''adron-'''E'''lektron-'''R'''ing-'''A'''nlage, "Hadron Electron Ring Facility") was DESY's largest synchrotron and storage ring, with a circumference of 6336 metres. The construction of the subterranean facility began in 1984 and was an international task: In addition to Germany, 11 further countries participated in the development of HERA. The accelerator began operation on 8 November 1990 and the first two experiments started taking data in 1992. HERA was mainly used to study the structure of [[proton]]s and the properties of [[quarks]]. It was closed on 30 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-mpy.desy.de/cgi-bin/status2004?Accelerator=HERA&amp;Time=24+hours&amp;Format=100%25 Last run of HERA]. Read 30 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

HERA was the only accelerator in the world that was able to collide protons with either electrons or positrons. To make this possible, HERA used mainly superconducting magnets, which was also a world first. At HERA, it was possible to study the structure of protons up to 30 times more accurately than before. The resolution covered structures 1/1000 of the proton in size. In the years to come, there were made many discoveries concerning the composition of protons from quarks and [[gluons]].

HERA's tunnels run 10 to 25 metres below ground level and have an inner diameter of 5.2 metres. For the construction, the same technology was used as for the construction of subway tunnels. Two circular particle accelerators run inside the tube. One accelerated electrons to energies of 27.5 GeV, the other one protons to energies of 920 GeV in the opposite direction. Both beams completed their circle nearly at the speed of light, making approximately 47 000 revolutions per second.

At two places of the ring the electron and the proton beam could be brought to collision. In the process, electrons or positrons are scattered at the constituents of the protons, the quarks. The products of these particle collisions, the scattered [[lepton]] and the quarks, which are produced by the fragmentation of the proton, were registered in huge detectors. In addition to the two collision zones, there are two more interaction zones. All four zones are placed in big subterranean halls. A different international group of researchers were at work in each hall. These groups developed, constructed and run house-high, complex measurement devices in many years of cooperative work and evaluate enormous amounts of data.

The experiments in the four halls will be presented in the following section:

==== H1 ====
{{main|H1 (particle detector)}}
H1 is a universal detector for the collision of electrons and protons and was located in DESY's HERA-Hall North. It had been active since 1992, measured 12 m × 10 m &amp;times; 15 m and weighed 2,800 tons.

It was designed for the decryption of the inner structure of the proton, the exploration of the strong interaction as well as the search for new kinds of matter and unexpected phenomena in particle physics.

==== ZEUS ====
{{main|ZEUS}}
ZEUS is like H1 a detector for electron-proton collisions and was located in HERA-Hall South. Built in 1992, it measured 12 m &amp;times; 11 m &amp;times; 20 m and weighs 3600 tons.

Its tasks resemble H1's.

==== HERA-B ====
{{main|HERA-B}}
HERA-B was an experiment in HERA-Hall West which collected data from 1999 to February 2003. By using HERA's proton beam, researchers at HERA-B conducted experiments on heavy quarks. It measured 8 m &amp;times; 20 m &amp;times; 9 m and weighed 1 000 tons.

==== HERMES ====
{{main|HERMES experiment}}
The HERMES experiment in HERA-Hall East was taken into operation in 1995. HERA's longitudinally polarised electron beam was used for the exploration of the [[nucleon spin structure|spin structure of nucleons]]. For this purpose the electrons were scattered at energies of 27.5 GeV at an internal gas target. This target and the detector itself were designed especially with a view to spin polarised physics. It measured 3.5 m &amp;times; 8 m &amp;times; 5 m and weighed 400 tons.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;!--At the moment HERMES is able to conduct ''inclusive'' measurements (only for the scattered lepton) and ''semi-inclusive'' measurements (for the scattered leptons and some of the hadronic products). In the future the recoil-detector which was recently installed will enable researchers to conduct ''exclusive'' measurements (for all endproducts).--&gt;

[[File:FLASH II 2014.jpg|thumb|left|FLASH II experimental hall at DESY campus in Hamburg.]]
=== FLASH ===
FLASH ('''F'''ree-electron -'''LAS'''er in '''H'''amburg) is a superconducting linear accelerator with a [[free electron laser]] for radiation in the vacuum-ultraviolet and soft X-ray range of the spectrum. It originated from the TTF (TESLA Test Facility), which was built in 1997 to test the technology that was to be used in the planned linear collider TESLA, a project which was replaced by the ILC ([[International Linear Collider]]). For this purpose the TTF was enlarged from 100 m to 260 m.

At FLASH technology for the [[European x-ray free electron laser|European XFEL]] is tested as well as for the ILC. Five test experimental areas have been in use since the commissioning of the facility in 2004.

[[File:CFEL 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Center for Free-Electron Laser Science, CFEL, at DESY campus in Hamburg.]]

===European XFEL===
{{main|European x-ray free electron laser}}
The European x-ray free electron laser (European XFEL) is the world's largest and brightest&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Altarelli: [http://www.xfel.eu/sites/site_xfel-gmbh/content/e63594/e63599/e81230/e70177/e83541/ryn-workshop-2010-altarelli_eng.pdf The European X-ray Free-Electron Laser]&lt;/ref&gt; x-ray laser. It is a European project in collaboration with DESY. First x-rays were produced in May 2017, user operation started September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/worlds-biggest-ever-x-ray-laser-shines-its-first-light-10862791|title=World's biggest ever X-ray laser shines its first light|date=2017-05-04|accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DESYxfel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.desy.de/aktuelles/news_suche/index_ger.html?openDirectAnchor=1222|title=Größter Röntgenlaser der Welt erzeugt erstes Laserlicht|date=2017-05-04|accessdate=2017-05-04|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3.4&amp;nbsp;km long tunnel contains a 2.1&amp;nbsp;km long [[superconducting]] [[linear accelerator]] where electrons are accelerated to an energy of up to 17.5 [[GeV]].&lt;ref name="XFELfacts"&gt;{{cite web |title=European XFEL facts &amp; figures|url= http://www.xfel.eu/overview/facts_and_figures/ |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="XFELconstruct"&gt;{{cite web |title=European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser tunnel construction completed|url=http://phys.org/news/2012-06-european-x-ray-free-electron-laser-tunnel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produces extremely short and powerful X-ray flashes that have many applications in chemistry, biology and material science.

=== Further Accelerators ===
In addition to the larger ones, there are also several smaller particle accelerators which serve mostly as pre-accelerators for PETRA and HERA. Among these are the linear accelerators LINAC I (operated from 1964 to 1991 for electrons), LINAC II (operated since 1969 for positrons) and LINAC III (operated since 1988 as a pre-accelerator for protons for HERA).

== Plans for the future ==
DESY is involved in the project [[International Linear Collider]] (ILC). This project consists of a 30-kilometer-long linear accelerator. An international consortium decided to build it with the technology originally developed for the TESLA project. There has been no final decision on where to build the accelerator but Japan is the most likely candidate.

}}'''Denise Scott Brown''' (née '''Lakofski'''; born October 3, 1931) is an American [[architect]], planner, writer, educator, and principal of the firm Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lumiere.lib.vt.edu/iawa_db/view_all.php3?person_pk=343&amp;table=bio&amp;|title=View all information for Denise Scott Brown|work=vt.edu|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Brown and her husband and partner, [[Robert Venturi]], are regarded as among the most influential architects of the twentieth century, both through their architecture and planning, and theoretical writing and teaching.

==Education and teaching==

Born to Jewish parents Simon and Phyllis (Hepker) Lakofski, Denise Lakofski had the vision from the time she was five years old that she would be an architect. Pursuing this goal, she spent her summers working with architects, and from 1948 to 1952, studied in [[South Africa]] at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. She briefly entered [[liberal politics]], but was frustrated by the lack of acceptance of women in the field. Lakofski traveled to [[London]] in 1952, working for the [[Modernist architecture|modernist]] architect [[Frederick Gibberd]]. She continued her education there, winning admission to the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] to learn “useful skills in the building of a just South Africa,” within an intellectually rich environment which embraced women. She was joined there by Robert Scott Brown, whom she had met at Witwatersrand in 1954, and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownlee|first1=David B.|last2=De Long|first2=David G.|last3=Whitaker|first3=Kathryn|title=Out of the Ordinary|date=2001|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|location=Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denise Lakofski and Robert Scott Brown were married on July 21, 1955. The couple spent the next three years working and traveling throughout Europe, and in 1958, they moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], to study at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s planning department. In 1959, Robert died in a car accident. Denise Scott Brown completed her master's degree in city planning in 1960 and, upon graduation, became a faculty member at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/06.09/15-radmedal.html|title=Harvard Gazette: Architect to receive Radcliffe Medal|author=Harvard News Office|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=25 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215447/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/06.09/15-radmedal.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching, she completed a master's degree in architecture.  At a 1960 faculty meeting, she argued against demolishing the university's library (now the [[Furness Library|Fisher Fine Arts Library]]), designed by [[Philadelphia]] architect [[Frank Furness]]. At the meeting, she met [[Robert Venturi]], a young architect and fellow professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/lessons-from-las-vegas/|title=Lessons from Las Vegas - 99% Invisible|work=99% Invisible|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two became collaborators and taught courses together from 1962 to 1964. Scott Brown left the University of Pennsylvania in 1965. Becoming known as a scholar in [[urban planning]], she taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and was then named co-chair of the Urban Design Program at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. During her years in the Southwest, Scott Brown became interested in the newer cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. She invited Venturi to visit her classes at [[UCLA]], and in 1966 asked him to visit [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with her. The two were married in [[Santa Monica, California]], on July 23, 1967. Scott Brown moved back to [[Philadelphia]] in 1967 to join Robert Venturi's firm, Venturi and Rauch, and became principal in charge of planning in 1969.  Denise Scott Brown later taught at [[Yale University]], and in 2003 was a visiting lecturer with Venturi at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Graduate School of Design]].

==Architecture and planning==
[[File:Denise Scott Brown 1978 © Lynn Gilbert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denise Scott Brown in 1978, photographed by [[Lynn Gilbert]]]]
In 1972, with Venturi and [[Steven Izenour]], Scott Brown wrote ''[[Learning from Las Vegas|Learning From Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form]]''. The book published studies of the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] Strip, undertaken with students in an architectural research studio course which Scott Brown taught with Venturi in 1970 at [[Yale]]'s School of Architecture and Planning. The book joined Venturi's previous ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' ([[Museum of Modern Art]], 1966) as a rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes, and a pointed acceptance of American sprawl and vernacular architecture.  The book coined the terms "Duck" and "Decorated Shed" as applied to opposing architectural styles. Scott Brown has remained a prolific writer on architecture and urban planning.

Scott Brown and Venturi strove for understanding the city in terms of social, economic and cultural perspectives, viewing it as a set of complex systems upon planning. As part of their design process, the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm studies the trends of an area, marking future expansions or congestions. These studies influence plans and design makeup. Such an approach was used for their Berlin Tomorrow Competition, putting the population movement and daily pattern in consideration. Similarly, the [[Bryn Mawr College]] plan took into consideration the landmark of the early campus and the usages of campus space prior to planning.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Moos|first1=Stanislaus|title=Venturi Scott Brown &amp; Associates Buildings and Projects, 1986-1998|date=1999|publisher=The Monacelli Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scott Brown holds a systematic approach to planning in what is coined as “FFF studios.” In it, form, forces and function determine and help define the urban environment.&lt;ref name="Out of the Ordinary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownlee|first1=David B.|last2=De Long|first2=David G.|last3=Hiesinger|first3=Kathryn B.|title=Out of the Ordinary|date=2001|publisher=Department of Publishing|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm studied both the expansion of Dartmouth College campus along with the wilderness surrounding the perimeter of the area.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The fusion of Eastern and Western ideas in the [[Nikko Hotels|Nikko hotel chain]] are evident by merging the Western notion of comfort (62 Stanislaus Von Moos) with historical [[kimono]] patterns with their hidden order. The architecture applies a post-Las Vegas modern feel while projecting the traditional Japanese shopping street. Guest rooms are typically made with Western taste, with fabrics, wallpaper, and carpet exclusively from the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm that reflect the scenery outside. In contrast, the exterior “street” complex reflects Japanese urban and traditional life.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

With the firm, renamed Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown in 1980, and finally Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989, Scott Brown has led major civic planning projects and studies, and more recently has directed many university campus planning projects. By the beginning of the 1980s, Venturi and Brown had made huge success with their ideas and concepts. Critics characterized them as the most influential and visionary architects of the time and continued their path with a clear approach, with their radical theories of design.&lt;ref name="Out of the Ordinary"/&gt; She has also served as principal-in-charge with [[Robert Venturi]] on the firm's larger architectural projects, including the [[Sainsbury Wing]] of [[London National Gallery|London's National Gallery]], the capitol building in [[Toulouse]] and the Nikko Hotel and Spa Resort in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vsba.com/whoweare/index_team.html|title=VSBA Homepage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Robert Venturi was named as winner of the 1991 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Blau (April 8, 1991) [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/08/arts/robert-venturi-is-to-receive-pritzker-architecture-prize.html Robert Venturi Is to Receive Pritzker Architecture Prize] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Brown did not attend the award ceremony in protest.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Robin Pogrebin (April 17, 2013) [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/arts/design/bid-for-pritzker-prize-to-acknowledge-denise-scott-brown.html Partner Without the Prize] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The prize organization, the Hyatt Foundation stated that, in 1991, it honored only individual architects, a practice that changed in 2001 with the selection of [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron|Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, the award was given to two recipients in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.pritzkerprize.com/laureates/year| work= |publisher=The Pritzker Architecture Prize |title = The Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureates| accessdate= April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Women In Design, a student organization spearheaded by Caroline Amory James and Arielle Assouline-Lichten&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/news/caroline-james-and-arielle-assouline-lichten-honored-by-bwaf.html|title=Harvard Graduate School of Design  - Homepage|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] started a petition for Scott Brown to receive joint recognition with her partner [[Robert Venturi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/arts/design/bid-for-pritzker-prize-to-acknowledge-denise-scott-brown.html?ref=design| work= The New York Times |title = Partner Without the Prize| accessdate= April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When awarded the [[Jane Drew Prize]] in 2017 Scott Brown referred to the Pritzer controversy and subsequent petition saying "I was very touched by the Pritzker petition – and that is my prize in the end. 20,000 people wrote from all over the world and every one of them called me Denise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/denise-scott-brown-recognised-with-2017-jane-drew-prize/10017080.article|title = Denise Scott Brown recognised with 2017 Jane Drew Prize| accessdate= February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Room at the top ===
In 1989, Scott Brown published her famous essay, "Room at the top? Sexism and the Star System in Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic753413.files/14_Outsiders%20in%20the%20Profession/Brown_Sexism.pdf |format=PDf|title=Room at the top? Sexism and the Star System in Architecture|website=www.isites.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Scott Brown wrote the essay in 1975, she decided not to publish it at the time, out of fear for damaging her career. The essay describes her struggle to be recognized as an equal partner of the firm, in an architecture world that was predominantly male. She has since been an advocate for Women in Architecture and has spoken out about discrimination within the profession on several accounts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11628">'''Environmental full-cost accounting''' ('''EFCA''') is a &lt;!--conventional--&gt; method of [[cost accounting]] that traces [[direct costs]] and allocates [[indirect costs]]&lt;ref&gt; Schaltegger, S. &amp; Burritt, R. (2000), ''Contemporary Environmental Accounting: Issues, Concepts and Practice'', Sheffield: Greenleaf Publishing, p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt; by collecting and presenting information about the possible environmental, social and economical [[Cost-benefit analysis|costs and benefits]] or advantages{{spaced ndash}}in short, about the "[[triple bottom line]]"{{spaced ndash}}for each proposed alternative. It is also known as '''true-cost accounting''' ('''TCA'''), but, as definitions for "true" and "full" are inherently subjective, experts consider both terms problematical.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;See [[Green economics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since costs and advantages are usually considered in terms of [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[economic]] and [[social]] impacts, full or true cost efforts are collectively called the "triple bottom line".  A large number of standards now exist in this area including [[Ecological Footprint]], [[eco-label]]s, and the [[United Nations]] [[ICLEI|International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives]] approach to triple bottom line using the ecoBudget metric.  The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has several accredited standards useful in FCA or TCA including for [[greenhouse gas]]es, the [[ISO 26000]] series for [[corporate social responsibility]] coming in 2010, and the [[ISO 19011]] standard for [[audit]]s including all these.

Because of this evolution of terminology in the [[public sector]] use especially, the term full-cost accounting is now more commonly used in [[management accounting]], e.g. infrastructure management and finance.  Use of the terms FCA or TCA usually indicate relatively conservative extensions of current management practices, and incremental improvements to [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] to deal with waste output or resource input.

These have the advantage of avoiding the more contentious questions of social cost.

== Concepts ==
Full-cost accounting embodies several key concepts that distinguish it from standard [[accounting]] techniques. The following list highlights the basic tenets of FCA.

Accounting for:
# [[Cost]]s rather than outlays (see explanation below);
# Hidden costs and externalities;
# Overhead and indirect costs;
# Past and future outlays;
# Costs according to lifecycle of the product.

===1. Costs rather than outlays===
Expenditure of cash to acquire or use a resource. A cost is the cash value of the resource as it is used. For example, an outlay is made when a vehicle is purchased, but the cost of the vehicle is incurred over its active life (e.g., 10 years). The cost of the vehicle must be allocated over a period of time because every year of its use contributes to the [[depreciation]] of the vehicle's value.

===2. Hidden costs===
The value of goods and services is reflected as a cost even if no cash outlay is involved. One community might receive a grant from a state, for example, to purchase equipment. This equipment has value, even though the community did not pay for it in cash. The equipment, therefore, should be valued in an FCA analysis.

Government subsidies in the [[energy production|energy]] and [[food production]] industries keep true costs low through artificially cheap product [[pricing]]. This [[price manipulation]] encourages unsustainable practices and further hides negative externalities endemic to [[fossil fuel]] production and modern [[mechanized agriculture]].

===3. Overhead and indirect costs===
FCA accounts for all overhead and indirect costs, including those that are shared with other public agencies. Overhead and indirect costs might include [[legal service]]s, administrative support, [[data processing]], [[Electronic billing|billing]], and purchasing. Environmental costs as indirect costs include the full range of costs throughout the life-cycle of a product ([[Life cycle assessment]]), some of which even do not show up in the firm's bottom line. &lt;ref&gt;Schaltegger, S. &amp; Burritt, R. (2000): Contemporary Environmental Accounting. Issues, Concepts and Practice. Sheffield: Greenleaf Publ., p.112&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains fixed overhead, fixed administration expense etc.

===4. Past and future outlays===
Past and future cash outlays often do not appear on annual budgets under cash accounting systems. Past (or upfront) costs are initial investments necessary to implement services such as the acquisition of vehicles, equipment, or facilities. Future (or back-end) outlays are costs incurred to complete  operations such as facility closure and postclosure care, equipment retirement, and post-employment health and retirement benefits.

== Examples ==

===Waste management===
For example, the State of Florida uses the term full-cost accounting for its solid waste management. In this instance, FCA is a systematic approach for identifying, summing, and reporting the actual costs of [[solid waste management]]. It takes into account past and future outlays, overhead (oversight and support services) costs, and operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dep.state.fl.us/waste/categories/fca/default.htm Solid Waste Full Cost Accounting], ''www.dep.state.fl.us'', Department of Environmental Protection, Florida, Accessed 24.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/fullcost/index.htm Full Cost Accounting on Municipal Solid Waste Management at US-EPA], ''www.epa.gov'', US Environmental Protection Agency, Accessed 24.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated solid waste management systems consist of a variety of [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) activities and paths. Activities are the building blocks of the system, which may include [[waste collection]], operation of [[transfer station (waste management)|transfer station]]s, transport to [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|waste management facilities]], waste processing and disposal, and sale of byproducts. Paths are the directions that MSW follows in the course of integrated solid waste management (i.e., the point of generation through processing and ultimate disposition) and include [[recycling]], [[composting]], [[waste-to-energy]], and [[landfill]] disposal. The cost of some activities is shared between paths. Understanding the costs of MSW activities is often necessary for compiling the costs of the entire solid waste system, and helps municipalities evaluate whether to provide a service itself or contract out for it. However, in considering changes that affect how much MSW ends up being recycled, composted, converted to energy, or landfilled, the analyst should focus the costs of the different paths. Understanding the full costs of each MSW path is an essential first step in discussing whether to shift the flows of MSW one way another.

====Benefits====
; Identify the costs of MSW management : When municipalities handle MSW services through general [[tax fund]]s, the costs of MSW management can get lost among other expenditures. With FCA, managers can have more control over MSW costs because they know what the costs are.

; See through the peaks and valleys in MSW cash expenditures : Using techniques such as depreciation and [[amortization]], FCA produces a more accurate picture of the costs of MSW programs, without the distortions that can result from focusing solely on a given year's cash expenditures.

; Explain MSW costs to citizens more clearly : FCA helps you collect and compile the information needed to explain to citizens what solid waste management actually costs. Although some people might think that solid waste management is free (because they are not billed specifically for MSW services), others might overestimate its cost. FCA can result in "bottom line" numbers that speak directly to residents. In addition, public officials can use FCA results to respond to specific public concerns.

; Adopt a business-like approach to MSW management : By focusing attention on costs, FCA fosters a more businesslike approach to MSW management. Consumers of goods and services increasingly expect value, which means an appropriate balance between quality and cost of service. FCA can help identify opportunities for streamlining services, eliminating inefficiencies, and facilitating [[cost-saving]] efforts through informed planning and decision-making.

; Develop a stronger position in negotiating with vendors : When considering privatization of MSW services, solid waste managers can use FCA to learn what it costs (or would cost) to do the work. As a result, FCA better positions public agencies for negotiations and decision-making. FCA also can help communities with publicly run operations determine whether their costs are competitive with the private sector.

; Evaluate the appropriate mix of MSW services : FCA gives managers the ability to evaluate the cost of each element of their solid waste system, such as recycling, composting, waste-to-energy, and landfilling. FCA can help managers avoid common mistakes in thinking about solid waste management, notably the error of treating avoided costs as revenues.

; Fine-tune MSW programs : As more communities use FCA and report the results, managers might be able to "benchmark" their operations to similar communities or norms. This comparison can suggest options for "re-engineering" current operations. Furthermore, when cities, counties, and towns know what it costs to manage MSW independently, they can better identify any savings that might come from working together.

== Motives for adoption ==

Various motives for adoption of FCA/TCA have been identified.  The most significant of which tend to involve anticipating market or regulatory problems associated with ignoring the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole process or event accounted for.  ''In [[green economics]], this is the major concern and basis for critiques of such measures as [[GDP]].''  The [[public sector]] has tended to move more towards longer term measures to avoid accusations of political favoritism towards specific solutions that seem to make financial or economic sense in the short term, but not longer term.

Corporate decision makers sometimes call on FCA/TCA measures to decide whether to initiate [[Product recall|recalls]], practice voluntary [[product stewardship]] (a form of recall at the end of a product's useful life).  This can be motivated as a [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] against future liabilities arising from those who are negatively affected by the waste a product becomes.  Advanced theories of FCA, such as [[Natural Step]], focus firmly on these.  According to [[Ray Anderson (entrepreneur)|Ray Anderson]], who instituted a form of FCA/TCA at Interface Carpet, used it to rule out decisions that increase [[Ecological Footprint]] and focus the company more clearly on a sustainable marketing strategy.

The [[urban ecology]] and [[industrial ecology]] approaches inherently advocate FCA&amp;nbsp;— treating the [[built environment]] as a sort of ecosystem to minimize its own wastes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5357">'''Eyring Research Institute''' was founded as an American non-profit organization, on September 6, 1972, in [[Provo, Utah]].

==History==
[[Image:Eyring Research.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Eyring Research Institute, [[Provo, Utah]]]]
[[Carlyle Harmon]] established the Eyring Research Institute with Dr. Ronald G. Hansen as President. This Institute did consulting work in various areas of contract research in cooperation with [[BYU]].

{{quote|text=ERI spawned many high-tech spin-offs, including [[WordPerfect]], [[Novell]], and [[Dynix]] in computers and some in the military and communication areas that have all benefited the world.|sign=Cleo Harmon, wife of the Founder and the Secretary of the President at Eyring Research Institute|source=''The Life of Frank Carlyle Harmon'', published 1999.}}

Being asked by [[BYU]] to assist them with their patent policy Carlyle Harmon was in a position to make suggestions as to research projects being funded at [[BYU]].

{{quote|I knew the government was clamping down hard on conducting research at educational institutions and I had a desire to build an institute to do contract research. I talked with Dr. Armin Hill, Dean of the College of Engineering and Technology at BYU. Following our discussions, it was determined to organize an entity that would actually do the work and get projects going. We felt that we could get enough part-time qualified BYU scientists working as supervisors to start our own research institute, and using this method we could do some worthwhile research.

I also worked closely with the President of BYU, [[Dallin H. Oaks|Dallin Oaks]], who has since been called to be an Apostle of the LDS Church.

I finally came up with "Eyring Research Institute" because [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]] was the greatest scientist the LDS (Mormons) had produced. Henry Eyring said, "Anything I can do to help the Church, I will do." Henry Eyring also agreed to be one of our trustees and later was one of our directors.
          
Our first funded project is known as TISC (Totally Integrated Simulation Computer) and this AirForce program provided work for the Institute for over thirteen years of continuous funding. It was sponsored by the U.S. AirForce facility that simulates flights of the Minuteman II &amp; III, and Migetman. In addition to TISC, we had two major multimillion dollar programs that have run for more than ten years, such as MDAS (Minuteman Data Acquisition System, and Missile Reliability System, both of which bring in data from every single missile in our missile force ("Star Wars" program). Much of our work became classified and more sophisticated and we enjoyed a remarkable reputation.}}

The Utah Supreme Court terminated ERI's tax exempt status in 1979 because the Court found that ERI was not devoted to a charitable purpose. In 1979 about 96% of the ERI's work was for the government including many top-secret projects and the remaining 4% was for private organizations. ERI was given to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] on July 31, 1979. Then, ERI was purchased back from the LDS Church beginning on August 1, 1979, creating it as a for-profit entity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The focus of our new for-profit business was on four major technical divisions, which all reported to Admiral Hart, who had been with us since before the change from a not-for-profit company.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carlyle Harmon stayed with ERI until 1988, "In 1988 I was squeezed out of my own Institute. I truly felt like a man without a country."

Carlyle Harmon was complimented by President [[Ronald Reagan]] for his efforts in making the Reagan "Star Wars" [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) Program for the Military.

Cleo Harmon, Carlyle's wife, used to work as the Secretary to the President of ERI.

A '''''faluche''''' is a traditional [[cap]] worn by students in France. It is a black velvet [[beret]], decorated with colored ribbons and badges.

Several student groups wear the ''faluche'', especially ''[[bitard]]s'', ''[[basochar]]ds'', and ''[[faluchard]]s''. Previously, the ''faluche'' was associated almost exclusively with ''faluchards'', although other folklore exists concerning the ''faluche''.

== History ==

Following demonstrations in 1884, the student association ''[[Association générale des étudiants]]'' of Paris ("A") was formed. On June 12, 1888, the Parisian students were invited to celebrate the 800th anniversary at the [[University of Bologna]] in Italy. At the celebration, the French students reportedly felt somewhat drab in comparison to the other students.  The attire of the French delegation involved simply dark clothing brightened by one rosette in a buttonhole, and a ribbon in ''[[saltire]]'' with the colors of the town of Paris. Other European students, by contrast, had a wide variety of costumes and hairstyles: the Belgian students from secular schools had ''pennes'', and those from Catholic schools had ''callotes''; the Spaniards were bedecked with ribbons which proclaimed membership in specific universities; the Germans had their own caps; the Swiss had their thin ''[[kepi]]s'' with small visors; the Italians wore a [[Louis XI]]-style hat, and others.

The French students thus decided to create a specific style of cap for themselves. They chose the black velvet beret of the inhabitants of the [[Bologna]] area, in remembrance of the students' congress in Bologna, which they fondly remembered.

On June 25, 1888, the date of the French students' return to Paris, that the ''faluche'' was really launched. Its popularity spread at the 600th anniversary of the [[University of Montpellier]] which took place May 22&amp;ndash;25, 1890. From there, the tradition rapidly spread to other cities, with badges and ribbons added later.

The symbols used, initially transmitted orally, varied by university. This is why a synthesis was made in [[Lille]] on March 8, 1986, inspired by the [[Toulouse]] code. It was adopted as a national code in December 1986 in Toulouse, and it was at this time that the concept of ''Grand Master'' began. Then in 1988, at the time of the centenary of Faluche in [[Reims]], a new more complete code was published, taking into account the Montpellier characteristics.

At the time of the German occupation during World War II, the wearing of the ''faluche'' was forbidden, except for the day of [[Saint Nicholas]].

In 1988 the 100th anniversary of the ''faluche'' was celebrated in [[Reims]], which has continued annually, in a different city each year.

== A "regulated" cap ==

The colors and badges related to the ''faluche'' recall the life of the student. A written code makes it possible to ensure a homogeneity within the ''faluchard'' movement so that each student can read the ''faluche'' and thus know the course of each person.

=== Circular ===

The circular is covered with a fabric band with the colors of the studied discipline.

=== Characteristics ===

* In [[Amiens]] and [[Reims]], the ribbons of city and areas are out of velvet, pointing out thus the tradition tisserande of these cities. Except the students in sciences which have their satin ribbons.
* In [[Bordeaux]], the currency is on the circular, under the nickname. The badges on the circular are embroidered.
* In [[Dijon]], the ribbons are out of velvet because it is the city which organized the States Généraux in 1989
* In [[Grenoble]], the initial ones are in embroidered letters, the leg of Grand Chambellan is cut at a peak, the pines chartreuse is located on the ribbon of town of study and there is no oath at the end of the baptism.
* In [[Nantes]] the personal and codes parts are reversed. A red pompom is drawn up at the top pointing out the origins of Nantes, harbor city. By extension this symbol is tolerated for any origin of a harbor city.
** The students into dental raise a ribbon of purple velvet circular with a red velvet edging which recalls their first year of medicine.
** The students in economic sciences have like emblem the mercury caduceus and the balance (they were accommodated by the Droit corporation after the room of association had burned).
*  To [[Lyon]], the military students of the health service of the armies, or standards, carry a third ribbon, blue-white-red, between the two other ribbons. In the middle of this tricolour ribbon the badge of the school of the health service of the armies of [[Lyon-Bron]] is. In pharmacy, always in Lyon, the single attribute of the Grand Maître is a sun carried to the frontal, with the top of the circular green.
* In [[Poitiers]], all the ribbons are braided. Moreover, the color of the circular Sage-femme is red velvet, identical to the Médecine circular but with the cross of Ankh. Moreover, the évèque of the south is named there.
* In [[Rouen]], there is a third cross, that of the GD (Grand Délateur) which has as a role to prepare and to manage the "sanctions" during the baptisms. The former engineers have as a circular, a large black ribbon with a blue edging in the medium. The medical students (who place their caduceus on velvet and not on the crculaire) reverse the personal and official sides of their faluche. The students of law do not carry the colors of the town of Rouen but those of Jeanne d' Arc and their ribbons are not out of velvet but out of satin, (to be noted that this tradition is erased little by little). It is finally one of the only harbour cities not to raise the pompom.
* In [[Toulon]] the faluche does not have a Grand Maitre nor of Grand Chambelan. It is assembled Resident of Toulon which decides on the jury and the officiants at the beginning of the baptism by vote.
* In [[Tours]] the code is strictly followed.
* In [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] the color of a circular BTS is red, white, red. Moreover, the GM and GC are called Bitards Valentinois (in honor of Bitards Poitevins because the first GM Valentinois were established by our neighbors of Poitou-Charentes and the Center). There is a "braid of sponsorship" (with the colors of the town of birth and province of birth), it is offered by the godson to the godfather when he considers his work accomplished.

==== Local codes ====

The [[Alsace|Alsatian]] and [[Montpellier|Montpelliérains]] ''faluchards'' have a different code than that usually called national code;

* The Alsatian ''faluche'': in addition to differences in terms of colors of dies, badges and of provision of the ribbons, the Alsatian ''faluche'' is recognizable with the existence of velvet passers by on a flexible circumference (without reinforcement of leather or plastic), and of a mobile circular (which is not bent on the aforementioned circumference). The membership of the ''faluchard'' to the board of directors or the office of an association of die results in the presence of a "V" on the basis of the back of the ''faluche'' and pointing towards its center, with the colors of the die. In addition, there exists in its center neither ''Grand Maître'', neither ''Grand Chamberlans'', nor Bishops. A collegial assembly old ''faluchards'' (the TVA for ''Très Vénérables Anciens'', co-opted among old the ''faluchards'', which has more than two years of ''faluche''), all confused dies, have the role of being the guarantors of the local traditions ''faluchardes'' and of tallying the various ceremonies. They do not remain about it less ''faluchards'' like the others. Some ''faluchards'' (especially in medicine) carry the ribbon of the memory in memory of the left Alsatian students in [[Clermont-Ferrand]] during World War II.
* In Montpellier, the ''faluche'' is characterized by the presence from four burst with the colors from the studied principal discipline, thus forming four parts of black velvet equal. This tradition pays homage to [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]], who studied with the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier to the 16th century.

==Organization==

The ''faluchards'' in the majority of the dies and for each city elect a ''Grand Maître'' (GM) appointed like guarantor of the traditions and supported by a ''Grand Chamberlan'' (GC) whom it chooses. Their badge is a registered cross of the expression to the merit, which they carry at the end of a ribbon of the color of their die. The cross of GM is enamelled of white and that of GC is gilded. In [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] and ''Grenoble'', the GC has a ribbon points some without cross with the colors of their discipline.

There are also three bishops who "reign" in a part of France: They "reign" in the towns of [[Amiens]], [[Dijon]] and [[Poitiers]]. The bishop is recognized for his empathy and is charged to regulate the conflicts like celebrating the marriages ''faluchards''.

In [[Nice]] there are also 12 knights who carry a kilt, representing the various dies of ''faluchés'' the ''niçois'', charged with organizing the ''faluchages'' and to be the guards of the traditions. The GM and GC are selected among the knights. There is even a specific code for the knighthood falucharde niçoise.

There are also orders (which do not have anything official) within the ''faluche''. The membership of a brotherhood can be displayed on the ''faluche'' by a ribbon or a badge particular to each brotherhood.

The '''Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act''' ({{USBill|113|hr|4292}}) is a bill that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt; Under current law, works of art loaned by foreign governments generally are immune to certain decisions made by federal courts and cannot be confiscated if the President, or the President’s designee, determines that display of the works is in the national interest.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt; However, commercial activity in which foreign governments are engaged does not have immunity in federal courts.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt; H.R. 4292 would clarify that importing works of art into the United States for temporary display is not a commercial activity, and thus that such works would be immune from seizure.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

==Background==
A similar bill was passed by the House during the [[112th United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=lawyersCHP1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalheritagelaw.org/Default.aspx?pageId=1842909|publisher=The Lawyers' Committee for Cultural Heritage Preservation|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=4292sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4292 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4292|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act would amend the federal judicial code with respect to denial of a foreign state's immunity from the jurisdiction of U.S. or state courts (under the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]]) in cases where rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property (or any property exchanged for it) is: (1) present in the United States in connection with a commercial activity carried on by the foreign state in the United States; or (2) owned by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state, and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the United States.&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

The bill would prohibit consideration as a commercial activity (excluded from jurisdictional immunity) any activity in the United States of a foreign state, or of any carrier, associated with a temporary exhibition or display if: (1) the work of art (or other object of cultural significance) is imported into the United States from any foreign country pursuant to an agreement for its temporary exhibition or display between a foreign state that is its owner or custodian and the United States or cultural or educational institutions within it; and (2) the [[President of the United States|President]] has determined, with notice in the [[Federal Register]], that such work is culturally significant and its temporary exhibition or display is in the national interest. (Thus, grants jurisdictional immunity to the foreign state and associated carrier for such works.)&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

The bill would deny application of this prohibition to cases concerning rights in property taken in violation of international law in which: (1) the action is based upon a claim that the work was taken between January 30, 1933, and May 8, 1945, by the government of Germany or any government in Europe occupied, assisted, or allied by the German government; (2) the court determines that the activity associated with the exhibition or display is commercial; and (3) that determination is necessary for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the foreign state.&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on April 2, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo4292&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4292|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45296|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on information provided by the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]], the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4292 would have no significant effect on the federal budget. Enacting H.R. 4292 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

Under current law, works of art loaned by foreign governments generally are immune to certain decisions made by federal courts and cannot be confiscated if the President, or the President’s designee, determines that display of the works is in the national interest. However, commercial activity in which foreign governments are engaged does not have immunity in federal courts. H.R. 4292 would clarify that importing works of art into the United States for temporary display is not a commercial activity, and thus that such works would be immune from seizure.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

H.R. 4292 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on March 25, 2014 by [[Steve Chabot|Rep. Steve Chabot (R, OH-1)]].&lt;ref name=4292allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4292 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4292/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] and the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice]].&lt;ref name="4292allactions"/&gt; The bill was scheduled to be voted on under [[suspension of the rules]] on May 6, 2014.&lt;ref name=HouseExIRS&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=The week ahead: House to hold ex-IRS official in contempt|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/205099-the-week-ahead-house-to-hold-ex-irs-official-in-contempt|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
According to a legislative digest provided by House Republicans, the bill "narrowly amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to make it easier for U.S. cultural and educational institutions to borrow art and other culturally significant objects from foreign countries."&lt;ref name=4292gop&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative Digest - H.R. 4292|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-4292-the-foreign-cultural-exchange-jurisdictional-immunity-clarification-act/|publisher=House Republican Conference|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the changes made by the bill would not provide any immunity to art or objects that were "taken in violation of international law by [[Nazi Germany]] between January 30, 1933 and [[Victory in Europe Day|May 8, 1945]]."&lt;ref name="4292gop"/&gt;

In an editorial, [[Tess Davis]] of the [[University of Glasgow]] and [[Marc Masurovsky]] of the [[Holocaust Art Restitution Project]], spoke out in opposition to the bill.&lt;ref name=Davis1&gt;{{cite news|title=US bill would allow museums to knowingly exhibit stolen art|url=http://theconversation.com/us-bill-would-allow-museums-to-knowingly-exhibit-stolen-art-25637|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=The Conversation|date=2 May 2014|author=Tess Davis|author2=Marc Masurovsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis and Masurovsky argue that the bill would "prevent claimants from recovering their rightful property" and enable museums to "knowingly be able to exhibit stolen and looted art and antiquities."&lt;ref name="Davis1"/&gt; Davis and Masurovsky argue that the bill would weaken U.S. law and undermine the American tradition of honoring property rights.

'''"Found in collection"''' '''or FIC''' is a term used by a [[museum]] to refer to "undocumented objects that remain without status after all attempts to reconcile them to existing records of permanent collection and loan objets are completed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Buck| first1=edited by Rebecca A.| last2=Gilmore| first2=Jean Allman| title=MRM5: Museum registration methods| date=2010| publisher=AAM Press, American Association of Museums| location=Washington, DC| isbn=978-1-933253-15-2| page=477| edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the best efforts of museum staff, museums often have FIC items. This term was developed so that collections with incomplete provenance would be handled ethically and with transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Code of Ethics for Museums| url=http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/code-of-ethics| website=American Alliance of Museums| publisher=American Alliance of Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paperwork and information accompanying the material, the museum has several choices in how to proceed.

==Occurrences==
Museums today are meticulous about the documentation they keep when [[Collection (artwork)#Accessioning|accessioning]] new items into their collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=NPS Museum Handbook, Part II: Museum Records| url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mushbkII.html| website=National Park Service-Museum Management Program| publisher=National Park Service| accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not always the case. As the museum field professionalized so did the standard of paperwork required to accession a collection. Items can become FIC artifacts if records were not kept initially or if the documentation regarding the property transfer was lost in a disaster such as a fire or flood. Additionally, if the museum is old, it has decades of accessioning paperwork that may require its own preservation plan.

===Lapsed loans===
FIC collections can also be the result of long-term or permanent loans where contact has lapsed between the two parties. It is for this reason that most museums now renew their loans on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Loan Abandoned Property Disposition|url=https://www.arcsinfo.org/programs/resources/legislation/old-loan-abandoned-property-disposition|website=Old Loan Abandoned Property Disposition|publisher=Association of Registrars and Collections Specialists|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58834-322-2|pages=319–354|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key participants==
*[[Registrar (museum)|Registrar]]/[[Collection manager|Collections Manager]]: Ultimately registrars and collections managers are in charge of accession paperwork and artifact documentation. Collections staff are responsible for assembling as much information as possible on the provenance of the objects in order to help the Collections Committee and other staff make the most informed decision they can. 
* Collections Committee: A Collections Committee at a museum is composed of [[curator]]s, collections staff, educators and senior administrators who decide what will become part of the museum's collection based on the museum's [[Collections policy|collections management policy]]. Just as importantly, the Committee rules on items that should be removed from a museum's collection due to duplication or lack of relevance to the museum's mission. The Committee will also discuss collections related issues including any FIC artifact concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing a Collections Management Policy|url=http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/developing-a-cmp-final.pdf?sfvrsn=2|website=Developing a Collections Management Policy|publisher=American Alliance of Museums|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lawyer|Legal Counsel]]: The Collections staff and legal counsel need to work closely together. There are very specific laws governing museums and unclaimed property. 
*Director/President &amp; Board of Trustees: The Director and Board of Trustees all need to sign off and be aware of accessions and deaccessions to their museum's collection. They rely heavily on the recommendation of the Collections Committee.
*[[Public relations|Public Relations Officer]]: While museums try to deal with FIC items openly, the knowledge that museums may not have complete intellectual and physical control of their collections can sometimes cause controversy or public concern. The Public Relations Officer is in charge of explaining how museum's work, how the situation has occurred, and what is being done to solve the problem. Public education and transparency can go a long way towards keeping the relationship between the community and museum positive.
* Claimant: During the FIC process a claimant may come forward to stake a claim to the found property. Depending on the nature of the claim and whether or not the claimant is a person or organization different procedures will be followed. However, the claimant must provide some type of documentary evidence to support their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58834-322-2|pages=391–395|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What constitutes ownership==
Museums require three pieces of information to accession a collection. 
#  Written intent to donate on behalf of the donor.
#  Acceptance of the collection into the museum's holdings by the museum (usually through the Collections Committee). 
#  Physical possession of the collection.

The most common way this is achieved is through a [[Deed of gift|Deed of Gift]], which states these three criteria in one document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Deeds of Gift|url=http://www2.archivists.org/publications/brochures/deeds-of-gift|website=A Guide to Deeds of Gift|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What action can be taken==
'''Please seek professional legal advice when dealing with FIC materials.''' Regardless of whether or not the museum wishes to retain ownership of the item, if possible the collections staff should contact the previous owner to either obtain a deed of gift or return the collection.

===Short term===
In order to keep track of the FIC collection, a temporary number should be assigned that is completely different in format from the museum's accession number to avoid further confusion. Whether the item is to be accessioned or [[Collection (artwork)#Deaccessioning|deaccessioned]], it requires establishing a chain of custody, which can be started with the application of a temporary number and assemblage of any associated documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buck|first1=edited by Rebecca A.|last2=Gilmore|first2=Jean Allman|title=MRM5 : museum registration methods|date=2010|publisher=AAM Press, American Association of Museums|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-933253-15-2|pages=109–118|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long term===
*If the museum wishes to keep the collection:
It should try to obtain ownership by following its state's unclaimed property laws or applicable international conventions. If during the found property process a claimant wishes to challenge the museum's tie to the collection, the claimant must support their case with evidential paperwork. 
* If the museum does not want the collection:
If the museum does not want to keep the artifacts due to them being irrelevant to its mission or outside of its collecting scope, it has several options. If the museum can contact the previous owner or  heirs it should do so and return the collection. If the collection has no associated paperwork, the museum should follow the appropriate laws and conventions. Once it establishes ownership through that process the museum can legally and ethically follow its deaccession procedures. This may involve transfer the collection to another cultural institution, selling the collection at public auction, or if all other methods fail, destruction of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAMD Policy on Deaccessioning|url=https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf|website=AAMD|publisher=Association of Art Museum Directors|accessdate=1 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803191723/https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf|archivedate=3 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International conventions ==
The [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]] was created to provide a platform and environment in which countries could discuss situations in which cultural property may have been illegally transported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1588343222|pages=87–93|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history cultural property has been taken as the spoils of war or trafficked by desperate individuals in order to make a profit.  For this reason museums may have to consider the 1970 UNESCO convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property when sifting through FIC collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illicit Trafficking of Cultural Property|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/1970-convention/|website=1970 Convention|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to pay particularly close attention to documentation of items that may have been acquired from conflict zones as sometimes customs forms and bills of sale are faked.

==Federal legislation==

=== Antiquities act of 1906 ===
[[Antiquities Act|The Antiquities Act of 1906]], signed by Theodore Roosevelt, was the first federal law enacted in response to a growing concern regarding the protection of cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1588343222|pages=143–144|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law stated that antiquities could not be removed or damaged on federal property without the express permission of the government.  While not completely enforced in its day, it did set a precedent for caring for national cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Antiquities Act of 1906|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/anti1906.htm|website=American Antiquities Act of 1906 16 USC 431-433|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 ===
The [[Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979|Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA)]] was a much needed upgrade to the 1906 Antiquities Act. It updated definitions to close loopholes and increased fines and penalties for violators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1588343222|pages=145–146|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If museums have FIC collections that may have been obtained in violation of the 1906 and 1979 legislation, they should seek legal advice and follow the provisions in the Acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA)|url=http://www.nps.gov/archeology/tools/Laws/arpa.htm|website=NPS Archaeology Program|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act===
The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|Native American Graves Protection Act (NAGPRA)]] was signed into law in 1990 to specifically to "affirm the rights of lineal descendants, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations to custody of Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony that are in the control of federal agencies and museums".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buck|first1=edited by Rebecca A.|last2=Gilmore|first2=Jean Allman|title=MRM5 : museum registration methods|date=2010|publisher=AAM Press, American Association of Museums|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-933253-15-2|pages=448–457|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately throughout the history of the United States, Native American cultural property and even human remains were not acquired with the consent, let alone documentation. Because of this, Native American and Native Hawaiian artifacts are often FIC. In trying to resolve these culturally sensitive FIC items, NAGPRA legislation should be followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National NAGPRA|url=http://www.nps.gov/nagpra|website=National NAGPRA|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''genetic predisposition''' is a [[genetics|genetic]] characteristic which influences the possible [[phenotypic]] development of an individual organism within a species or population under the influence of [[natural environment|environmental]] conditions. In medicine, '''[[genetic susceptibility]]''' to a [[disease]] refers to a genetic predisposition to a health problem,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/predisposition What does it mean to have a genetic predisposition to a disease?], US Department of Health&lt;/ref&gt; which may eventually be triggered by particular environmental or lifestyle factors, such as [[tobacco smoking]] or [[Dieting|diet]].  [[Genetic test]]ing is able to identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to certain diseases.

==Behavior==

[[Instinct|Predisposition]] is the capacity we are born with to learn things such as language and concept of self.  Negative environmental influences may block the predisposition (ability) we have to do some things.  [[ethology|Behaviors]] displayed by animals can be influenced by genetic predispositions. Genetic predisposition towards certain human behaviors is [[Ethology|scientifically investigated]] by attempts to identify patterns of human behavior that seem to be invariant over long periods of time and in very different cultures.

For example, philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has proposed that humans are genetically predisposed to have a [[theory of mind]] because there has been [[evolution]]ary selection for the human ability to adopt the [[intentional stance]].{{Ref|stance}} The ''intentional stance'' is a useful behavioral strategy by which humans assume that others have [[mind]]s like their own. This assumption allows you to predict the behavior of others based on personal knowledge of what you would do.

In 1951, [[Hans Eysenck]] and [[Donald Prell]] published an experiment in which [[twins|identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins]], ages 11 and 12, were tested for neuroticism.  It is described in detail in an article published in the ''[[Journal of Mental Science]]''. in which Eysenck and Prell concluded that, "The factor of neuroticism is not a statistical artifact, but constitutes a biological unit which is inherited as a whole....neurotic Genetic predisposition is to a large extent hereditarily determined."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Mental Health'', July 1951, Vol. XCVII, "The Inheritance of Neuroticism: An Experimental Study", H. J. Eysenck and D. B. Prell, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Osborne Wilson|E. O. Wilson's]] [[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis|book on sociobiology]] and his book [[Consilience (book)|Consilience]] discuss the idea of genetic predisposition to behaviors

The field of [[evolutionary psychology]] explores the idea that certain behaviors have been selected for during the course of evolution.

The '''United Nations High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development''' ('''HLPF''') is a subsidiary body of both the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] responsible for the entire organization's policy on [[Sustainable development|sustainable development]]. It adopts negotiated declarations, reviews commitment and the progress of the [[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. The Forum replaced the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] on the 24 September 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1556 |title=High-level Political Forum |date=n.d. |website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org |publisher=United Nations |access-date=14 November 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings of the Forum are open to all Member States of the United Nations. 

== History ==

The HLPF has its origin in the '''Commission on Sustainable Development''' ('''CSD'''), which was created in 1992 to ensure follow-up of the [[Earth Summit|Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/intergovernmental/csd |title=Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) |date=n.d. |website= sustainabledevelopment.un.org |publisher=United Nations |access-date=November 14, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Commission met a total of 20 times, with its last session on 20 September 2013.

At the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Conference on Sustainable Development]], or Rio+20, it was decided that the Commission would be replaced by the '''High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.''' This new Forum would meet under the auspices of both the Economic and Social Council, as well as the General Assembly. The Forum was formally created by Resolution 67/290 on 9 July 2013. &lt;ref name="67-290"&gt;{{UN doc |docid=A-RES-67-290 |body=A |session=67 |type=R |resolution_number=290 |title= Format and Organizational Aspects of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate= 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the Forum is held under the authority of both the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly, the body hosts two different types of meetings:
* While under the auspices of the General Assembly: Once every four years at the level of Heads of State and Government for a period of two days.
* While under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council: Yearly, for a period of eight days, including a three-day ministerial segment.
Its meetings are held in July.

== Mandate ==

The HLPF was created with the aim to strengthen sustainable development governance at the United Nations. It works to achieve this through its mandate, which states the following in respect to sustainable development: &lt;ref name="67-290"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="66-288"&gt;{{UN doc |docid=A-RES-66-288 |body=A |session=66 |type=R |resolution_number=288 |title= The Future We Want |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate= 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to various differences in cultural histories and environmental [[resources]], [[West African]] nations developed [[glass]] traditions distinct from [[Egypt]], [[North Africa]] and the rest of the world. The presence of glass in Sub-Saharan Africa mostly consists of the importation of [[glass beads]] shipped primarily from the [[Middle East]] and [[India]]n as early as 200-300AD; later, from [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Venice]].

As most African cultures have long histories of crafting and adornment with beads made from [[wood]], [[bone]] and [[exoskeleton|shell]], the introduction of glass as a bead material was widely and rapidly received.  The exchange of glass beads for local [[good (economics)|goods]] such as [[ivory]], [[gold]] and [[slaves]] aided in the accumulation of [[wealth]] and creation of unequal power dynamics still apparent today.&lt;ref name=Dubin&gt;Dubin 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Archaeological]] evidence, primarily from various burial sites from the West and coastal port cities in the East, confirm the [[import]] of hundreds of thousands of glass beads.4 &lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;&lt;ref name=david&gt;Davidson 1972&lt;/ref&gt; 3 These assemblages boast rich varieties in [[shape]], [[colour]], [[Surface texture|texture]] and [[Pattern#Visual|patterning]].  While most Sub-Saharan glass was imported as pre-formed beads, there is evidence of the importation of glass fragments and [[ingots]] to be used in local beadmaking practices.5 Preliminary excavations also exhibit evidence of indigenous glass production from raw materials, a [[technology]] previously thought unknown to this region of the world.6 4, recent evidence has shown that glass making has been started separate from the general glass trade centuries before European and Arab contact &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/glass-africa-made-before-european-arrival-colonialisation-advanced-technology-a8168601.html|title=Glass was made in Africa centuries before arrival of Europeans|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural and Historical Significance==

===Symbolism===

As subsistence-level herding was common throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa, bead adornment was an apt medium for self and cultural expression; whereas a more permanent art form would have proven impractical.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  Through various bead shape formations, colouring choices and assemblage methods, individuals were able to express complex information which was particularly useful in the absence of written language.  Notions such as age, marital status and relative economic wealth were communicated through careful selection of symbolic glass beads.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  The remelting and reworking of existing beads also suggests that the shape and style of glass beads held specific cultural values; various regions were able to imitate more favourable foreign styles, create unique forms or produce much larger beads than what was available through international trade, effectively expressing local distinctiveness.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; 7 8  Glass beads also provided a means of connecting with ones ancestors.  Known as Heirloom beads, these beads were typically translucent, resembling wax, having a discoid shape and usually could be dated back to the middle and late Iron Age.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;  Whether strung as jewellery, attached to clothing or stored unassembled, Heirloom beads were extremely prized and often passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; Additionally, glass beads have been linked to a number of religious and symbolic practices, primarily as offerings to deities at sacred locations and constructed shrines.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt; 4

===Beads as Economic Wealth===

Glass beads in Sub-Saharan regions were used as an economic tool, denoting wealth and political power.  Yoruba kings, or Obas, often encouraged complicated and abundant glass beadworking as a visual symbol of their nation’s wealth.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;   Production of beads in great quantities could also be offered by Obas to various deities as a symbol of appreciation of such granted political and economic power.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  Aje Ilekes, discs of melted cullet (recycled material) glass with beads embedded, were produced by intentionally destroying and remelting glass beads, serving as a status symbol of power and wealth.  Aje Ilekes are still used today as a monetary system, often exchanged as wedding dowry.4  In the archaeological record it is common to find numerous glass beads and beadworking tools such as stone anvils and crucibles included in burial sites suggesting the objects’ cultural and economic importance.4

==Importation and Trade==

===Early Chronology===

Attempts to determine date and origin of glass beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa have been made with varying success.  It is generally agreed that glass beads were present in the Sub-Saharan world by at least 300AD, having been imported from the Middle East and South East Asian regions.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  Transported by sea, shipments arrived to coastal ports such as Mtwapa and Ungwana in Kenya and were then distributed inland via local trade networks and kinship relations.3 On land, glass bead cargos travelled through North Africa south to areas such as Gao in Mali, as well as Nigeria, Ghana and Benin.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  The expansion of the Roman Empire helped to broaden trade patterns and the introduction of the camel as means of transport significantly fostered the spread of imported goods.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; European nations entered the African trading market, beginning with Portugal, Italy and Bohemia in the 15th century, followed by the Dutch, English, French, Belgians and Germans.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  By the 17th century, the Netherlands managed to secure an impressive monopoly on the glass bead exchange with Sub-Saharan Africa.  A Dutch merchant and entrepreneur named Sir Nicholas Crisp is recorded to have been awarded a patent “for the sole making and vending of beads and beugles to trade to Guinea,” in 1632.7

===Trade Wind Beads===

During the Medieval Period, trade of a particular style of glass bead, the Trade Wind bead, dominated the market.  These beads ranged in colour and length but could be mass-produced.3 Termed “Trade Wind beads” due to the use of monsoon winds for navigation, these beads were shipped throughout the Indian Ocean Trading Complex, especially to East, West and South African coastal ports.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  3   India and Sri Lanka contributed greatly to the exchange of Trade Wind beads though it has been disputed whether these countries also partook in the primary production of glass used for such beads. The mineral soda-alumina (abbreviated m-Na-Al or mNa) chemical composition of most Trade Wind Beads found in Sub-Saharan regions suggests a connection to the mineral-soda sources and alumina rich sand ubiquitous in India; however, there is no archaeological evidence to support this hypothesis to date.3 Other analysts propose a Middle Eastern, Venetian and/or Portuguese origin for the Trade Wind beads found in Sub-Saharan regions.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

===Slave Beads===
{{main article|Trade beads}}

European nations became increasingly involved in the glass bead trade with Africa which consequently aided in the foreign exploitation of natural resources, including slaves.  Because Westerners viewed Africans as “the uncivilised of the World,”7 glass beads known crudely as “slave beads” were commonly exchanged for human cargo which could then be shipped and traded for other desired goods.  The residual effects from the glass bead trade had dramatically varying results across Sub-Saharan Africa.  While most regions suffered economic and social hardship due to abusive foreign monopolies, some nations prospered from this interaction.  Coastal ports serving as initial points of contact often benefited from access to imported goods, reaping profits from their own subsequent distribution to regions inland.  Scholars have suggested that the rise of Empires in Ghana and Mali between the 8th-13th centuries, as well as the Kingdoms of Benin and Akan during the 16th century are intrinsically related to the access and distribution of foreign glass beads.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  3 5

==Bead Manufacture==

===Glass Manufacture: Primary and Secondary Glass Production===

Primary glass production involves the combination of the raw materials Soda, Lime and Silica, heated at specific temperatures in order to produce a basic glass compound (see Glass and Anglo-Saxon Glass).  Traditionally, glass has been made from either the mixture of ground quartz stones (providing the silica) and plant ash (supplying the soda and lime elements); or, by utilizing sand as a silica and lime source and then adding a chemical natron for the remaining soda needed.  The production of primary glass has seen much variation throughout its history, each region slightly altering the chemical composition to better suit its particularly environmental and cultural needs (i.e. adding various fluxes/chemical additives in order to lower the required melting temperature).  The addition of mineral deposits to alter the colour of glass can be carried out in the primary stage or can be added in later stages of production. The secondary production of glass typically involves processes of colouring, remelting, shaping and decorating of the glass object.  While some archaeological evidence suggests the concurrence of both primary and secondary glass production at the same site, in the case of glass beads these processes often occurred separately.  As access to premade glass and foreign colorants increased, beadmaking from imported goods developed into a technology which could be conducted in virtually any location across the globe.10

===Beadworking===
{{main article|Glass beadmaking}}

The production of beads from imported glass shards, cullet (scraps) and undesired glass beads has a lively presence in Sub-Saharan history.  Imported glass was either formed by melting such imported glass, potentially adding desired colorants, and then shaping the melt into a bead form; or, by grinding down the imported glass to form a powder which would then be shaped, heated and cooled.  The archaeological evidence of beadworking in Sub-Saharan Africa provides examples of both types.5 9 &lt;ref name=david/&gt;

===Wound Glass Beads===

With melted glass working, beads found were generally formed by either a wound, drawn or moulded process.  Wound glass beads, also known as Tubular, Cylindrical, Spherical or Melon-Shaped, were formed by folding molten glass around a metal rod called a mandrel.  Once the glass had cooled slightly, the material was slipped off the mandrel and pinched and prodded until it reached a desired shape.9&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

===Drawn Glass Beads===

Also known as Cane beads, Drawn beads were formed by dipping an iron blowpipe into molten glass and slightly blowing air through the pipe, allowing for a “gather,” or hollow glass ball, to form at the end.  A rod called a ‘puntil’ was used to pull the gather into a longer, hollow form which would then cool and be broken into individual beads.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; As glassblowing technology did not exist in early Sub-Saharan African regions, locally produced drawn beads were made by trapping air bubbles in molten glass and then drawing the glass into a cane form.8

===Moulded Glass Beads===

Little evidence of beads produced from moulds are found in Sub-Saharan Africa,&lt;ref name=david/&gt; however it is understood that beads of this form were produced by dropping molten glass into a preformed open clay mould and then “punched” with a core to take on the mould’s form.  Holes could then be drilled through moulded beads or, beads produced from half moulds could then be adhered together.9

===Powder Glass Beads===
{{main article|Powder glass beads}}

The glass beads of Sub-Saharan Africa that were not melted from pre-existing glass material were instead formed by grinding glass into a fine powder to be worked further.  Sources for such glass included scraps from broken glass bottles, cullets (recycled glass) or pre-existing glass beads which were no longer wanted.  The grinding process generally caused colouring to be lost; therefore, various pigments were often added at this stage (see the colouring section below).  After the desired colour was achieved, powdered glass was either worked in its dry form or was wetted with water or saliva to create a paste.  This paste was next formed by hand into various bead shapes.  Powder Glass Beads were then heated, allowed to cool and finally, polished.8 Garden Roller beads, such as the Bodom beads of Ghana.8 were the earliest form of  powder glass beads found, made by threading glass in a mould with a mandrel.  This process was extremely labour-intensive and expensive as the mould used was unable to be reused.8 More common were the Kiffa beads, typically associated with Mauritania.  These beads were produced from the wet-form of powder glass production, and have been found since the 8th century.  The paste produced in wet-form production was shaped into a bead using frames typically made of leaves of grass and then were decorated and coloured using a needle.8

===Lapidary Beads===

Though technically made from glass, the lapidary style of bead production is more akin to stone working than proper glass manufacturing.  This process involved the recycling of imported glass by chipping, knapping, drilling and polishing pieces to a desired bead form.  Evidence from areas outside of Ile-Ife, Nigeria suggests that individuals scavenged for discarded glass remains from earlier burial sites at Olokun Grove.  Glass remains that had been brought to the upper soil layers (either naturally or via “mining”) were collected and worked to produce new glass beads.4

===Colouring===

Colouring of glass could either be achieved by adding bits of pre-existing coloured glass, such as bottle shards or beads, by adding scrap metals, or by adding mineral pigments directly.9 The beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa generally contained the following pigment sources: Red was achieved by adding small amounts of metallic copper.  The presence of Iron could also produce a red colour, as well as form green and brown tones.3 &lt;ref name=david/&gt; When copper was present and cooled in an oxidizing atmosphere (i.e. great exposure to oxygen) glass could achieve a blue-green colour.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; To get a clear blue colour cobalt was often used.3 To produce a purple colour manganese was added, and in the right environments manganese was also used as a decolouring agent.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;  Yellow and opaque white were created by the addition of antimony and lead or tin and lead and if a stronger orange colour was desired zinc was then added as well.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;  While the colouring of imported glass certainly took place in local Sub-Saharan beadworking sites, this does not imply that the minerals utilized came from local sources.  Many glass pigments were most likely imported from abroad to Sub-Saharan beadworking sites.3

===Beadworking Sites===

Archaeological evidence, coupled with historical documentation and oral tradition provide evidence of numerous Sub-Saharan beadmaking sites.  Found Nupe beads from Nigeria suggest native individuals produced beads from scrap glass and bottles.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; Remains from the Ashanti region in Ghana imply beadmaking from moulds using imported powdered glass.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;  Sites such as Gao, Mali and Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria provide evidence for the production of Carnelian Bead.  It is not known whether the Carnelian was a local material; however, bead production has been confirmed due to the discovery of lumps of imported raw glass and other glassworking equipment.5 Mapungbwe, South Africa provides another example of beadmaking.  This site dates between 600-1200AD and contains evidence of glass working from pulverized bottles, ingots and other beads.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;

===Primary Production Evidence===

The most conclusive archaeological evidence for the primary production of glass in Sub-Saharan Africa comes from Ile-Ife, Nigeria, though finds in Gao, Mali, Benin and Ghana also support such inferences.4 Crucibles with glass layering and exterior vitrification indicative of production from raw materials prompted further compositional analysis.  Archaeologist concluded that the glass found in the crucibles of Ile-Ife had a uniquely high percentage of lime and alumina compounds,4 a glass formula known only to exist in Korea.  Importation of glass from Korea can be ruled out as this area only produced small quantities of glass, supplies no evidence of glass bead production and mainly only experimented with glazing.4 European, Middle Eastern, Indian and Chinese origins for the glass found at Ile-Ife can also be excluded as none of these traditions produced glass high in both lime and alumina.4 It has been suggested that this unique high-lime, high alumina glass could represent an entirely new glass making technology6 in which the alkali (soda) and alumina were derived from separate mineral sources.  The lime source would also have been added separately; most probably in the form of limestone, marble or shell.6 These proposed sources for lime, native to Nigeria and other Sub-Saharan regions, comprise a novel yet plausible primary production process.  Neighbouring areas, such as the sites at Ita Yemoo and Igbo-Ukwu, contain glass working evidence such as crucibles, cullets, and beads, all with high-lime, high-alumina glass compositions suggesting the secondary production of glass imported from Ile-Ife.4 Whether primary production technology was learned and transferred from abroad or locally invented is unknown.  Most reasonably, the presence of imported glass beads pre-existed primary production technology which was later developed through processes of trial and error.4 6 The invention of glass distinctive to Sub-Saharan Africa could have been spurred due to a shortage of imported glass beads as material accessibility and supply often directed the course of glass production technology throughout the course of history (See History of Glass).

[[File:New-Delhi, Indian Social Institute.JPG|thumb|right|Indian Social Institute, Lodi Rd., New-Delhi]]
The '''Indian Social Institute''' (ISI)], founded in 1951 in [[Pune]] ([[India]]), is a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] centre for research, training, and action for socio-economic development and [[human rights]] in [[India]]. Founded by [[Jerome D'Souza]], in [[Pune]], it was shifted to [[New Delhi]] in 1963 where it is located at the Lodi Institutional Area.

== Origin and foundation ==
Even though the [[Society of Jesus]] was active in the social field right from the end of the 19th century, following on the ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' encyclical of [[Leo XIII]], it became more actively so after the second world war. In 1949, [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Superior General]] [[Jean-Baptiste Janssens]] wrote an ‘Instruction on the Social Apostolate’ (10 October 1949) - the first letter ever entirely given to this new apostolic field - calling for a new ‘social mentality’ among the Jesuits. To achieve this he asked that Jesuit formation programmes be revised, [[education]] curriculum in Jesuit schools and colleges be adapted, and centres specialized in social information and action be opened. Even the more spiritual kind of apostolic work ([[Sodality of Our Lady|Marian congregation]], [[Spiritual Exercises]], and retreat work) were not to remain unaffected.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

As a response to this, in 1951, the Indian Institute of Social Order was founded in [[Pune]] (India) by Jesuit [[Jerome D'Souza]], a well-known [[educationist]] and member of the [[Indian Constituent Assembly]]. Started soon after the [[independence of India]] it was meant to help [[Indian Christians]] in general, and Jesuits in particular, to enter more actively into the issues of the common socio-economic national welfare. It was meant in the words of its founder to "contribute to the emergence of a new social order in post-independence India."{{fact|date=September 2018}}

The quarterly journal ''Social Action'' was launched in 1951. Concurrently several regional training centres were established in various parts of the country, the '''Xavier Institute''' in [[Ranchi]], '''Loyola School of Social Work''' in Madras (now [[Chennai]]), and another one in [[Trivandrum]], ([[Kerala]]). The regional centres responded more directly to the demands coming from the field.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

The Indian Institute of Social Order was transferred to [[New Delhi]] in 1963, under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Moyersoen (1900–1969). In 1967 it was renamed Indian Social Institute. Notable sociological studies were published, such as the "Chotanagpur Survey", the first such study of the tribal groups of Central India, by Francisco Ivern. Under repeated demands coming from the social fields an extension service was started.  One of its first ventures was to organize a [[cooperative]] movement among fishermen, most of them being [[Serfdom|bonded labourers]]. Setting up cooperatives became the main thrust of the extension service.

A [[tribal]]-orientated development group was started in the late 1960s, the Vikas Maitri, and a programme for women’s development in the 1970s, both fostering self dignity and awareness in marginalized groups. A Mobile Orientation Team was also started to reach out to peoples’ organizations at the grassroots level.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

'''Interactive media''' normally refers to products and services on digital computer-based systems which respond to the user's actions by presenting content such as [[text (literary theory) | text]], [[moving image]], [[animation]], [[video]], [[Digital audio | audio]], and [[video games]].

==Definition==
[[Interactivity|Interactive]] media is a method of communication in which the output from the media comes from the input of the users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interactive media|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interactive-media.asp|website=Investopedia|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Smart Devices Interact With Pervasive Screens: A Survey", 
P.C. Ng, K.E. Eun, J. She, M. Baldauf, ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) 
Volume 13, Issue 4, August 2017.
[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3115933]&lt;/ref&gt;
Interactive media works with the user's participation. The media still has the same purpose but the user's input adds interaction and brings interesting features to the system for better enjoyment.

==Development==
The analogue videodisc developed by NV [[Philips]] was the pioneering technology for interactive media. Additionally, there are several elements that encouraged the development of interactive media including the following: 
* The laser disc technology was first invented in 1958. It enabled the user to access high-quality analogue images on the computer screen. This increased the ability of interactive video systems. 
* The concept of the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), which was developed in the 1970s, popularized by [[Apple Computer, Inc.]] was essentially about visual metaphors, intuitive feel and sharing information on the virtual desktop. Additional power was the only thing needed to move into multimedia.
* The sharp fall in hardware costs and the unprecedented rise in the computer speed and memory transformed the personal computer into an affordable machine capable of combining audio and color video in advanced ways. 
* Another element is the release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990 by [[Microsoft]] into the mainstream IBM clone world. It accelerated the acceptance of GUI as the standard mechanism for communicating with small computer systems. 
* The development by NV [[Philips]] of optical digital technologies built around the compact disk (CD) in 1979 is also another leading element in the interactive media development as it raised the issue of developing interactive media.&lt;ref&gt;Lat chem, C., Williamson, J., &amp; Henderson-Lancet, L. (1993). Interactive multimedia practice and promise. London; Philadelphia: Koran page.&lt;/ref&gt; 
All of the prior elements contributed in the development of the main hardware and software systems used in interactive media.

==Terminology==
Though the word ''media'' is plural, the term  is often used as a singular noun.

Interactive media is related to the concepts [[interaction design]], [[new media]], [[interactivity]], [[human computer interaction]], [[cyberculture]], [[digital culture]], [[interactive design]], and includes [[augmented reality]].

An essential feature of interactivity is that it is mutual: user and machine each take an active role (see [[interaction]]). Most [[interactive computing]] systems are for some human purpose and interact with humans in human contexts.&lt;ref name="Dix"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dix  | first1 = Alan  | last2 = Finlay  | first2 = Janet  | last3 = Abowd  | first3 = Gregory D.  | last4 = Beale  | first4 = Russell  | authorlink = Alan Dix  | title = Human-computer interaction. 3rd edn.  | publisher = Pearson Education  | year = 2004  | page = xvi  | isbn = 9780130461094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manovich complains that 'In relation to computer-based media, the concept of interactivity is a tautology.  .... Therefore, to call computer media “interactive” is meaningless – it  simply means stating the most basic fact about computers.'.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Manovich  | first = Lev  | authorlink = Lev Manovich  | title = The Language of New Media  | publisher = MIT Press  | location = Cambridge  | year = 2001  | page = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the term is useful to denote an identifiable body of practices and technologies.

Interactive media are an instance of a computational method influenced by the sciences of cybernetics, [[autopoiesis]] and system theories, and challenging notions of reason and cognition, perception and memory, emotions and affection.

Any form of interface between the [[end user]]/[[audience]] and the medium may be considered interactive. Interactive media is not limited to [[electronic media]] or digital media. [[Board game]]s, [[pop-up book]]s, [[gamebook]]s, [[flip book]]s and [[constellation wheel]]s are all examples of printer interactive media. Books with a simple [[table of contents]] or [[Index (publishing)|index]] may be considered interactive due to the [[non-linear]] control mechanism in the medium, but are usually considered non-interactive since the majority of the [[user experience]] is non-interactive reading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media psychology]] is the newest emerging dimension of media theory applied to interactive media. {{cite web |url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/MEDIADEF-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011010440/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/MEDIADEF-2.html |archivedate=2011-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

===Effects on learning===
Interactive media is helpful in the four development dimensions in which young children learn: social and emotional, language development, cognitive and general knowledge, and approaches toward learning. Using computers and educational computer software in a learning environment helps children increase communication skills and their attitudes about learning. Children who use educational computer software are often found using more complex speech patterns and higher levels of verbal communication. A study found that basic interactive books that simply read a story aloud and highlighted words and phrases as they were spoken were beneficial for children with lower reading abilities. Children have different styles of learning, and interactive media helps children with visual, verbal, auditory, and tactile learning styles.&lt;ref&gt;Glaucoma, Christina R., M.A. The Effects of Interactive Media on Preschoolers' Learning: A Review of the Research and Recommendations for the Future. P. 13-17. Ed. Eileen Espresso, Patti Miller, and Christine Cordoba.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intuitive understanding===
Interactive media makes technology more intuitive to use. Interactive products such as smartphones, iPad's/iPod's, interactive whiteboards and websites are all easy to use. The easy usage of these products encourages consumers to experiment with their products rather than reading instruction manuals.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Stuart. "The Disadvantages and Advantages of Interactive Media." EHow. Demand Media, 10 May 2011. Web. 23 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Interactive media promotes dialogic communication. This form of communication allows senders and receivers to build long term trust and cooperation. This plays a critical role in building relationships. Organizations also use interactive media to go further than basic marketing and develop more positive behavioral relationships.&lt;ref&gt;DeYeso, Jennifer. "The Effect of Interactive and Traditional Media on Relationship Building." Slideshare. LinkedIn Corporation, 25 Apr. 2012. Web. 23 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on families==
The introduction of interactive media has greatly affected the lives and inner workings of families, with many family activities having integrated with technology quite seamlessly, allowing both children and parents to adapt to it as they see fit. However, parents have also become increasingly worried about the impact that it will have on their family lives. This is not necessarily because they are opposed to technology, but because they fear that it will lessen the time that they get to spend with their children. Studies have shown that although interactive media is able to connect families together when they are unable to physically, the dependence on this media also continues to persist even when there are opportunities for family time, which often leads the adults to believe that it distracts children more than it benefits them.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Katie Headrick; Takeuchi, Lori; Stevens, Reed.

==Types==
===Distributed interactive media===
The media which allows several geographically remote users to interact synchronously with the media application/system is known as Distributed Interactive Media. Some common examples of this type of Media include Online Gaming, Distributed Virtual Environment, Whiteboards which are used for interactive conferences and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Mauve, Martin; Vogel, Jiirgen (2001) "Consistency Control for Distributed Interactive Media" Sept. 30-Oct. 5, 2001, Ottawa, Canada 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A couple of basic examples of [https://www.interactivemedia.az/en/ interactive media] (also known as a company in Azerbaijan) are video games and websites. Websites, especially social networking websites provide the interactive use of text and graphics to its users, who interact with each other in various ways such as chatting, playing online games, sharing posts that may include their thoughts and/or pictures and so forth. Video games are also one of the common examples of Interactive Media as the players make use of the joystick/controller to interactively respond to the actions and changes taking place on the game screen generated by the game application, which in turn reacts to the response of the players through the joystick/controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interactive-media.asp|title=Interactive Media|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=28 September 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies and implementation==
Interactive media can be implemented using a variety of platforms and applications that use technology. Some examples include mobile platforms such as touch screen smartphones and tablets, as well as other interactive mediums that are created exclusively to solve a unique problem or set of problems. Interactive media is not limited to a professional environment, it can be used for any technology that responds to user actions. This can include the use of [[JavaScript]] and [[AJAX]] in web pages, but can also be used in programming languages or technology that has similar functionality.

One of the most recent innovations to use interactivity that solves a problem that individuals have on a daily basis is [[Delta Airlines]]'s "Photon Shower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/delta-teases-us-shower-beats-jet-lag-473471/|title=Delta teases us with 'shower' that beats jet lag - CNN Travel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device was developed as a collaboration between Delta Airlines and Professor [[Russell Foster]] of [[Cambridge University]]. The device is designed to reduce the effect of [[Jet lag|jet lag]] on customers that often take long flights across time zones. The interactivity is evident because of how it solves this problem. By observing what time zones a person has crossed and matching those to the basic known sleep cycles of the individual, the machine is able to predict when a person's body is expecting light, and when it is expecting darkness. It then stimulates the individual with the appropriate light source variations for the time, as well as an instructional card to inform them of what times their body expects light and what times it expects darkness. Growth of interactive media continues to advance today, with the advent of more and more powerful machines the limit to what can be input and manipulated on a display in real time is become virtually non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PS_technology_WEB2.pdf | title=Technology and Interactive Media as Tools in Early Childhood Programs Serving Children from Birth through Age 8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324042025/http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PS_technology_WEB2.pdf|archivedate=24 March 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031121333/https://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/PS_technology_Examples.pdf|url=https://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/PS_technology_Examples.pdf|title=Selected Examples of Effective Classroom Practice Involving Technology Tools and Interactive Media|archivedate=31 October 2012|publisher=|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exacttarget.com/blog/5-interactive-media-examples-of-the-new-mad-men/|title=Marketing|website=Salesforce.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''interpretant''', in [[semiotics]], is the effect of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] on someone who reads or comprehends it. The concept of "interpretant" is part of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s "triadic" theory of the sign. For Peirce, the interpretant is an element that allows taking a ''representamen'' for the sign of an ''object'', and is also the "effect" of the process of ''semeiosis'' or signification.

Peirce delineates three types of interpretants: the immediate, the dynamical, and the final or normal.

==Immediate Interpretant==
"The Immediate Interpretant consists in the Quality of the Impression that a sign is fit to produce, not to any actual reaction." (Letter to William James, CP 8.315, 1909)

==Dynamical Interpretant==
"[The] Dynamical Interpretant consists in direct effect actually produced by a Sign upon an Interpreter of it. [---] [The] Dynamical Interpretant is that which is experienced in each act of Interpretation and is different in each from that of the other... [it] is a single actual event." (Letter to Lady Welby, SS 110-1, 1909)

==Final or Normal Interpretant==
"[The] Final Interpretant is [...] the effect the Sign would produce in any mind upon which the circumstances should permit it to work out its full effect. [---] ...[It] is the one Interpretative result to which every Interpreter is destined to come if the Sign is sufficiently considered. [---] The Final Interpretant is that toward which the actual tends." (Letter to Lady Welby, SS 110-1, 1909)

The '''Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences''' (for short, '''Ioffe Institute''', {{lang-ru|Физико-технический институт им. А. Ф. Иоффе}}) is one of [[Russia]]'s largest research centers specialized in [[physics]] and technology. The institute was established in 1918 in [[Petrograd]] (now St. Petersburg) and run for several decades by [[Abram Ioffe]]. The Institute is a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

== Present structure of the Institute ==
As of 2018, the Ioffe institute employs about 1500 people, around 1000 of whom are scientific researchers (including 560 with a PhD degree and 250 with a [[Doktor Nauk]] degree). 
Most of the research staff members are top graduates of the St. Petersburg (former Leningrad) universities. 

From 2013 till mid-May 2018 the Ioffe institute was under formal jurisdiction of the Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FASO Russia), now it is under jurisdiction of the established in May 2018 [[Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Russia)|Ministry of Science and Higher Education]], like all other institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS).

The Institute is organized into five divisions:
* Center for Nano-Heterostructure Physics
* Solid State Electronics
* [[Solid State Physics]]
* [[Plasma Physics]], Atomic Physics and [[Astrophysics]]
* Physics of [[Dielectrics]] and [[Semiconductor]]s
Each of the divisions includes several laboratories. The institute has its own graduate school and a scientific council. There exists an intensive collaboration with the research and industrial establishments in Russia and worldwide.

The institute publishes four scientific journals: ''Semiconductors'' ({{lang-ru|Физика и техника полупроводников}}), ''Physics of the Solid State'' ({{lang-ru|Физика твёрдого тела}}) and ''Technical Physics'' (journal + letters) ({{lang-ru|Журнал технической физики (основной + письма}})).

== Founding of the institute ==
The foundation date of the Ioffe Institute is September 23, 1918 – the day of signing the decree on the establishment of the physical and technical department in the (established in March of the same year) State Roentgenological and Radiological Institute in [[Petrograd]]. Despite tremendous economic problems after the World War I and the [[October Revolution]] (1917), the development of science was one of the priorities of the new Communist government. 

[[File:Физико-технический институт им. А. Ф. Иоффе. Вид с Политехнической ул. Ограда 3.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The entrance plaque, preserved from the Soviet times]]
The abovementioned department was headed by [[Abram Ioffe|A. F. Ioffe]]. In 1922, on its basis, the State Physicotechnical Radiology Institute has emerged. After several reorganizations and renaming, since 1933, the institute became “Leningrad Physicotechnical Institute”. The form “Physicotechnical” is a Russian variant for “Physical &amp; Technical”. Three decades later, in the 1960s, the word “Ioffe” was added to the institute name, in honor of the first director. 

Since 1939, the Institute has been a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (since 1991 – of the Russian Academy of Sciences). In 1967, it was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. These details were reflected in the institute name, especially in Russian. Also now, for historical reasons, there remained the entrance plaque (s. photo): “Academy of Sciences of the USSR, A. F. Ioffe Physicotechnical Institute, awarded the Order of Lenin” ({{lang-ru|Oрдена Ленина Физико-технический институт им. А. Ф. Иоффе АН СССР}}).  

Presently, in English texts, for example in scientific papers, the name “[А. F.] Ioffe [Physical-Technical] Institute [of the Russian Academy of Sciences]” is used (the optional fragments are enclosed in square brackets). 

== Main scientific achievements ==
The Ioffe Institute is considered the cradle of Soviet physics. Such outstanding scientists as [[Lev Landau|L. D. Landau]], [[Pyotr Kapitsa|P. L. Kapitsa]] started their career here, many physicists — among them [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Y. B. Zeldovich]], [[Igor Kurchatov|I. V. Kurchatov]], [[Igor Tamm|I. E. Tamm]] — have worked at the Institute for some time.

The research of the Institute covers nearly all fields of the contemporary physics, including the solid-state, semiconductors, quantum electronics, astrophysics, plasma, fluid dynamics, cosmology, nuclear synthesis. 

More than 100 employees of the Institute were recognized by awarding the highest prizes and orders of the Soviet Union and of Russia – in particular the Lenin and State Prizes of the USSR, State Prizes of Russia, Government prizes and special prizes of the Soviet/Russian Academy of Sciences.

Twice, the Nobel Prize was awarded for the works performed at the Ioffe Institute. In 1956, academician [[Nikolay Semyonov|N. N. Semyonov]] (together with [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood|C. N. Hinshelwood]]) got the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for a discovery and study of [[Chain reaction|chain reactions]]: the works were made and published in 1927, when N. N. Semyonov was a staff member of the Institute. In 2000, [[Zhores Alferov|Zh. I. Alferov]], director of the Ioffe Institute at that time, became a [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize laureate in Physics]] (together with [[Herbert Kroemer|H. Kroemer]] and [[Jack Kilby|J. Kilby]]) for the development of semiconductor heterostructures for high-speed optoelectronics.

The Ioffe Institute has played a central role in the development of photovoltaic solar power in Russia and internationally, and thus in the development of renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289325179_Russian_renewable_energy_The_potential_for_international_cooperation?_iepl%5BgeneralViewId%5D=OStyJJLs4S7luUUqaA1Fgqd0DanTtxPXfOHk&amp;_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=searchReact&amp;_iepl%5BviewId%5D=Lpu67iamSHgmLs0G5oXdoM4C869MSvhr7uPn&amp;_iepl%5BsearchType%5D=publication&amp;_iepl%5Bdata%5D%5BcountLessEqual20%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5Bdata%5D%5BinteractedWithPosition1%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5Bdata%5D%5BwithoutEnrichment%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5Bposition%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5BrgKey%5D=PB%3A289325179&amp;_iepl%5BtargetEntityId%5D=PB%3A289325179&amp;_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationTitle|title=Russian Renewable Energy: The Potential for International Cooperation|last=Overland|first=Indra|last2=Kjaernet|first2=Heidi|publisher=Asghate|year=2009|isbn=|location=Farnham|pages=48, 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buildings ==
The main building of the Ioffe Institute (s. photo at the top of the article and the very left part of the photo below) is located at Polytechnicheskaya Street, 26. It was built in a [[Neoclassicism]] style in 1912–1916 by the architect G. D. Grimm and served as "a refuge for the elderly needy hereditary noblemen in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the Romanovs' house" at the forty-prized ones, on the second floor they arranged Church (now the Small Assembly Hall of the Institute).&lt;ref&gt; Глезеров С.

[[File:KurchatovStr.jpg|thumb|300px|Buildings belonging to the Ioffe Institute; this photo was shot from the Academician Ioffe square]]
In 1920 the building was adapted to the Institute by the design of civil engineers P. I. Sidorov and Yu. V. Bilinsky. The ceremonial transfer of the building to the Institute took place on February 4, 1923. Until 1953, the apartment of A. F. Ioffe was located in the same building.&lt;ref&gt;Алфёров Ж. И. Папа Иоффе и его «детский сад» (Лекция из цикла «Наука и культура XXI века», АФТУ, 10 октября 2008 года) // Наука и культура: избранные лекции / Сост. Ю. В. Трушин. — СПб: БАН, 2009. — С. 127—167. — 208 с. — {{ISBN|978-5-336-00105-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1927—1928 there appeared a yard part, and in 1970 the building was reconstructed and expanded along Kurchatov Street.  

Beyond this historical building, a more modern building on another side of the Kurchatov Street (the right part of the photo) also belongs to the Ioffe Institute. It was constructed in the 1970s. Furthermore, some laboratories of the Ioffe Institute are placed in Shuvalovo, a north-west outskirts of St. Petersburg.  

In front of the main facade are the busts of [[Abram Ioffe]] (sculptor G. D. Glickman, 1964) and [[Boris Konstantinov]] (sculptor [[Mikhail Anikushin]], 1975). On either side of the main entrance are memorial plaques: to the left of the entrance are S. N. Zhurkov, [[Yulii Borisovich Khariton]], [[Anatoly Alexandrov (physicist)|Anatoly Alexandrov]], [[Yakov Frenkel]], and {{ill|Vladimir Tuchkevich|lt=V. M. Tuchkevich|ru|Тучкевич, Владимир Максимович}}; right of the entrance - [[Igor Kurchatov]], B. P. Konstantinov, [[Nikolay Semyonov]].

'''Jean Hani''' (1917-2012) was a French philosopher and [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] author, and a professor of Greek civilization and literature at the [[University of Picardie Jules Verne|University of Amiens]].

==Life and Works==
Very little is known about Jean Hani's personal life other than his year of birth. [[Jean Borella]]'s mention of the author's modesty and his older age "studious retirement" seem to agree with this scarcity of information.&lt;ref name="borellahani"&gt;"Regard sur l'œuvre de Jean Hani" in ''Connaissance des Religions'', Dec. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in 1917, Hani proved a bright secondary student, pursuing his university studies in Classical Literature, and finally obtaining a doctorate with a dissertation about the influence of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]] on the thought of [[Plutarch]].&lt;ref name=hanithese&gt;''La religion Egyptienne dans la pensée de Plutarque'', Paris, Les belles lettres, 1976. Library record at Paris Sorbonne IV, 1971, Worldcat ref. 490686029&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a lecturer at the [[University of Picardie Jules Verne|University of Amiens]], he founded the Centre de Recherches sur l'Antiquité Classique, and he led for many years a Séminar of History of Greek religion.&lt;ref name=borellahani/&gt; After his retirement, in addition to his prolific activity as an author of [[Traditionalist School|Traditional]] works, he became a frequent collaborator of journals like [[:fr:Connaissance des religions|''Connaissance des Religions'']] and [[:fr:Vers la tradition|''Vers la tradition'']]. Hani has been praised for his studies on Christian symbolism, particularly on the mass&lt;ref&gt;''The Divine Liturgy: Insights Into Its Mystery'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the esoterism of Christian architecture.&lt;ref name="borellahani"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Symbolism of the Christian Temple'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three kinds of works may be discerned within Hani's production: works of Classical philology, works dealing with history of religions and works dealing with traditional and sacred symbolism. The first group is represented by his annotated translations of [[Plutarch]], published partly within the well-known [[Collection Budé]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarque, ''Oeuvres morales Tome VIII : Traités 42-45''. He also collaborated in Plutarque, ''Oeuvres morales Tome II : Traités 10-14''.&lt;/ref&gt; The second group is represented by his doctoral dissertation mentioned above.&lt;ref name="hanithese"/&gt; And the third group includes works like ''Le Symbolisme du temple chrétien'' (1962), ''Les Métiers de Dieu'' (1975), ''La Divine liturgie'' (1981) and ''La Royauté sacrée'' (1984)&lt;ref name="biblio"&gt;See bibliography below.&lt;/ref&gt; where his mastery of traditional hermeneutics and exegesis is firmly established. These books have been translated into English and several other European languages.&lt;ref name="biblio"/&gt;

According to [[Jean Borella]],&lt;ref name="borellahani"/&gt; the principles expounded in ''Le Symbolisme du temple chrétien'' have already been put into practice in the establishment of some contemporary monastic foundations.{{examples|date=October 2011}} Borella also considers Hani to be the first author in academia to successfully marry [[René Guénon|Guénon]]'s insights to the contemporary study of Hellenistic religions and Christianity.&lt;ref name="borellahani"/&gt;

'''Land reclamation''', usually known as '''reclamation''', and also known as '''land fill''' (not to be confused with a [[landfill]]), is the process of creating new [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]] from [[ocean]], [[Stream bed|riverbeds]], or [[lake beds]]. The land reclaimed is known as '''reclamation ground''' or '''land fill'''.

In a number of other jurisdictions, including parts of the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asmr.us | title=American Society for Mining and Reclamation | accessdate=2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "reclamation" can refer to returning disturbed lands to an improved state. In [[Alberta]], Canada, for example, reclamation is defined by the provincial government as "The process of reconverting disturbed land to its former or other productive uses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Powter | first = Chris | title = Glossary of Reclamation and Remediation Terms used in Alberta | publisher = Government of Alberta | year = 2002 | url = http://environment.gov.ab.ca/info/library/6843.pdf | isbn = 0-7785-2156-7 | accessdate = 2012-04-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120409204116/http://environment.gov.ab.ca/info/library/6843.pdf | archivedate = 2012-04-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Oceania]] it is frequently referred to as [[land rehabilitation]].

== Methods ==
Land reclamation can be achieved with a number of different methods. The most simple method involves simply filling the area with large amounts of heavy rock and/or [[cement]], then filling with clay and dirt until the desired height is reached. The process is called "infilling"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lambi, Cornelius Mbifung|year=2001|title=Environmental issues: problems and prospects|location=Bamenda, Cameroon|publisher=Unique Printers|page=152|isbn=978-9956-11-005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the material used to fill the space is generally called "infill".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Supplement Engineering Field Handbook Chapter 16: Streambank and Shoreline Protection|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|page=16–WI–36|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_024948.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Road Maintenance ESA Program, Part 2: Best Management Practices|publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation|page=2.42|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/nr/rdonlyres/f70e7937-f4dd-4ecc-9909-0c108c97c37a/0/part2.pdf|access-date=2014-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611025636/http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/F70E7937-F4DD-4ECC-9909-0C108C97C37A/0/Part2.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Draining of submerged [[wetland]]s is often used to reclaim land for [[Agriculture|agricultural]] use. [[Deep cement mixing]] is used typically in situations in which the material displaced by either [[dredging]] or draining may be contaminated and hence needs to be contained. Land dredging is also another method of land reclamation. It is the removal of sediments and debris from the bottom of a body of water. It is commonly used for maintaining reclaimed land masses as sedimentation, a natural process, fills channels and harbors naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/dredging.html|title=What is dredging?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest large scale projects was the [[Beemster|Beemster Polder]] in the Netherlands, realized in 1612 adding {{convert|70|km2}} of land. In Hong Kong the [[Praya Reclamation Scheme]] added {{convert|50|to|60|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land in 1890 during the second phase of construction. It was one of the most ambitious projects ever taken during the [[Colonial Hong Kong]] era.&lt;ref name="Bard"&gt;Bard, Solomon.  [2002] (2002). Voices from the Past: Hong Kong 1842–1918. HK University press. {{ISBN|962-209-574-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 20% of land in the [[Tokyo Bay]] area has been reclaimed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Petry| first = Anne K.| title = Geography of Japan| publisher = Japan Digest, [[Indiana University]]| date = July 2003| url = http://iis-db.stanford.edu/docs/129/geo.pdf| accessdate = 2009-07-30| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928055810/http://iis-db.stanford.edu/docs/129/geo.pdf| archivedate = 2011-09-28| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably [[Odaiba]] artificial island.	[[Fontvieille, Monaco|Le Portier]], [[Monaco]] and [[Gibraltar]] are also expanding due to land reclamation. The city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] was largely built on reclaimed land, as was [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].

[[Artificial island]]s are an example of land reclamation. Creating an artificial island is an expensive and risky undertaking. It is often considered in places with high population density and a scarcity of flat land. [[Kansai International Airport]] (in [[Osaka]]) and [[Hong Kong International Airport]] are examples where this process was deemed necessary. The [[Palm Islands]], [[The World (archipelago)|The World]] and hotel [[Burj al-Arab]] off [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] are other examples of artificial islands (although there is yet no real "scarcity of land" in Dubai), as well as the [[Flevopolder]] in the [[Netherlands]] which is the largest artificial island in the world.

== Agriculture ==
[[File:Bingzhou Peninsula area - land reclamation - DSCF9204.JPG|thumb|Land reclamation in progress in Bingzhou (丙州) Peninsula (formerly, island) of the Dongzui Bay (东咀港). [[Tong'an District]], [[Xiamen]], China]]
Agriculture was a drive for land reclamation before [[industrialisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel R. |last=Curtis |title=Into the frontier: medieval land reclamation and the creation of new societies. Comparing Holland and the Po Valley, 800–1500 |url=https://academia.edu/1932594/Into_the_frontier_medieval_land_reclamation_and_the_creation_of_new_societies._Comparing_Holland_and_the_Po_Valley_800-1500 |publisher=Academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In South China, farmers reclaimed [[paddy field]]s by enclosing an area with a stone wall on the [[sea shore]] near a [[river mouth]] or [[river delta]].  The species of rice that grow on these grounds are more [[salt]] tolerant.  Another use of such enclosed land is the creation of [[fish pond]]s.  It is commonly seen on the [[Pearl River Delta]] and [[Hong Kong]].  These reclaimed areas also attract species of [[bird migration|migrating birds]].

A related practice is the [[drainage|draining]] of swampy or seasonally submerged [[wetland]]s to convert them to [[Farmland (farming)|farmland]]. While this does not create new land exactly, it allows commercially productive use of land that would otherwise be restricted to [[wildlife]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat.]] It is also an important method of [[mosquito control]].

Even in the post-industrial age, there have been land reclamation projects intended for increasing available agricultural land.  For example, the village of [[Ōgata, Akita|Ogata]] in [[Akita, Japan]], was established on land reclaimed from [[Lake Hachirogata]] (Japan's second largest lake at the time) starting in 1957. By 1977, the amount of land reclaimed totalled {{convert|172.03|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ogata.or.jp/english/history.html |title=The History of Ogata-Mura &amp;#124; Ogata-mura |publisher=Ogata.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924055244/http://www.ogata.or.jp/english/history.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beach restoration ==
{{Main|Beach nourishment}}
Beach rebuilding is the process of repairing [[beach]]es using materials such as [[sand]] or [[mud]] from inland. This can be used to build up beaches suffering from [[beach starvation]] or erosion from [[longshore drift]]. It stops the movement of the original beach material through longshore drift and retains a natural look to the beach. Although it is not a long-lasting solution, it is cheap compared to other types of [[Coastal management|coastal defences]]. An example of this is the city of Mumbai.&lt;ref name="Mumbai"/&gt;

== Landfill ==
As [[human overpopulation|human overcrowding of developed areas]] intensified during the 20th century, it has become important to develop land re-use strategies for completed [[landfill]]s.  Some of the most common usages are for parks, [[golf course]]s and other sports fields. Increasingly, however, office buildings and industrial uses are made on a completed landfill. In these latter uses, [[methane]] capture is customarily carried out to minimize explosive hazard within the building.

An example of a [[Class A office space|Class A office building]] constructed over a landfill is the [[Dakin Building]] at [[Sierra Point, Brisbane, California|Sierra Point]], [[Brisbane, California]]. The underlying fill was deposited from 1965 to 1985, mostly consisting of construction debris from [[San Francisco]] and some municipal wastes. [[Aerial photograph]]s prior to 1965 show this area to be [[wikt:tideland|tideland]]s of the San Francisco Bay. A clay cap was constructed over the debris prior to building approval.&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Awosika and Marc Papineau, ''Phase One [[Environmental Site Assessment]], 7000 Marina Boulevard, Brisbane, California'', prepared for [[Argentum International]] by Certified.  Engineering &amp; Testing Company, Boston, Massachusetts, July 15, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable example is [[Sydney Olympic Park]], the primary venue for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games, which was built atop an industrial wasteland that included landfills.

Another strategy for landfill is the incineration of landfill trash at high temperature via the [[Plasma arc waste disposal|plasma-arc gasification process]], which is currently used at two facilities in [[Japan]], and will be used at a planned facility in [[St. Lucie County]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-09-09-fla-county-trash_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=Florida county plans to vaporize landfill trash |date=2006-09-09 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
[[File:bay area fill.jpg|thumb|Parts (highlighted in brown) of the [[San Francisco Bay]] were reclaimed from wetlands for urban use.]]
Draining wetlands for ploughing, for example, is a form of [[habitat destruction]]. In some parts of the world, new reclamation projects are restricted or no longer allowed, due to [[environmental movement|environmental protection]] laws. Reclamation projects have strong negative impacts on coastal populations, although some species can take advantage of the newly created area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Kim|first2=Kyungmin|last3=Heo|first3=Kyongman|last4=Jablonski|first4=Piotr G.|last5=Jang|first5=Yikweon|title=Impact of land reclamation and agricultural water regime on the distribution and conservation status of the endangered Dryophytes suweonensis|journal=PeerJ|date=4 October 2017|volume=5|page=e3872|doi=10.7717/peerj.3872|url=https://peerj.com/articles/3872/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental legislation ===
[[File:Hong Kong reclamation.png|thumb|A map of reclaimed land in Hong Kong: Grey (built), red (proposed or under development). Many of the urban areas of Hong Kong are on reclaimed land.]]
The State of California created a state commission, the [[San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission]], in 1965 to protect San Francisco Bay and regulate development near its shores.  The commission was created in response to growing concern over the shrinking size of the bay.

Hong Kong legislators passed the [[Protection of the Harbour Ordinance]], proposed by the [[Society for Protection of the Harbour]], in 1997 in an effort to safeguard the increasingly threatened [[Victoria Harbour]] against encroaching land development.&lt;ref name="bill"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallis |first=Keith |title=Bill seeks to protect harbour |date=February 12, 1996 |publisher=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong Standard]] |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=23201&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19960212&amp;sear_year=1996 |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604140503/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=23201&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19960212&amp;sear_year=1996 |archivedate=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several large reclamation schemes at Green Island, West Kowloon, and [[Kowloon Bay]] were subsequently shelved, and others reduced in size.

== Dangers ==
Reclaimed land is highly susceptible to [[soil liquefaction]] during earthquakes,&lt;ref name=abag&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/liquefac/Lq_rept.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723055040/http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/liquefac/Lq_rept.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can amplify the amount of damage that occurs to buildings and infrastructure. [[Subsidence]] is another issue, both from [[soil compaction]] on filled land, and also when wetlands are enclosed by [[levee]]s and drained to create [[Polder]]s.

[[File:Le Ménestrel 1st Edition - 1 December 1833.jpg|thumb|242 px|Front page of the first edition of ''Le Ménestrel'' (1 December 1833)]]
'''''Le Ménestrel''''' (The Minstrel) was an influential French music journal published weekly from 1833 until 1940. It was founded by Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry and originally printed by Poussièlgue. In 1840 it was acquired by the music publishers [[Éditions Alphonse Leduc#Heugel|Heugel]] and remained with the company until the journal's demise at the beginning of World War II. With the closure of its chief rival, ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris|La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' became France's most prestigious and longest-running music journal.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) pp. 2 and 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
In 1827 [[François-Joseph Fétis]] had founded ''La Revue Musicale'', France's first periodical devoted entirely to classical music. By 1834 it had two serious competitors, ''Le Ménestrel'' established in 1833 and [[Maurice Schlesinger]]'s ''Gazette Musicale'' established in 1834. ''Le Ménestrel'' was founded by the Paris publisher Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry, with the first edition (printed by Poussièlgue) appearing on 1 December 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Gautier (1995) p. 156; ''Le Ménestrel'' (1 December 1833)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835, Schlesinger bought ''La Revue Musicale'' from Fétis and merged the two journals into ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris|La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]''. Until ''La Revue et Gazette'' ceased publication in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' was to be its main rival in terms of influence and breadth of coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

E. D'Arlhac took over the directorship of ''Le Ménestrel'' in July 1835, but relinquished it the following March to the journalist and critic [[Jules Lovy]], who had been a writer for the journal since its foundation. By 1836 ''Le Ménestrel'' had a weekly print run of 600 copies, although as [[Katharine Ellis]] points out, the number of actual readers was probably much larger. At the time, Paris alone had over 500 ''[[cabinet de lecture|cabinets de lecture]]'', private reading rooms and precursors to the modern library popular in early 19th century France where for a small fee the public could read the latest issues of newspapers and journals.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) pp. 1-2 and 268-269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. Books: A Living History. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011. p.105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, Harry Earl. The "Cabinet de Lecture" in France, 1800-1850. The Library Quarterly, 48(1). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, the newly formed music publishing partnership of [[Jacques-Léopold Heugel]] and [[Jean-Antoine Meissonnier]] acquired ''Le Ménestrel''. Heugel became the director, and Jules Lovy stayed on as editor-in-chief until his death in 1863. Lovy was succeeded by the critic and music historian [[Joseph d'Ortigue]]. Later editors-in-chief included [[Arthur Pougin]] who served from 1885 to 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; However, after d'Ortigue's death in 1866, only the Heugel name appeared on the [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]]. When Jacques-Léopold died in 1883, his son Henri-Georges Heugel took over as director. He was in turn succeeded by his own son Jacques-Paul who served as the director for the remainder of the journal's existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Ménestrel'' (3 February 1933) p. 52; Feurzeig (1994) p. 126; Nichols and Drake (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le Ménestrel'' was published weekly for a period spanning 107 years, initially coming out on Sunday (later changed to Saturday and then Friday). The [[Franco-Prussian War]] caused publication to be suspended from late December 1870 through November 1871, and publication was suspended again for the duration of [[World War I]], with the first post-war issue appearing on 17 October 1919. At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the journal carried on until the invasion of France. The 24 May 1940 issue announced that following the German attacks and the closure of theatres and concert halls in Europe and France as well as the [[Paris Conservatory]], the journal was suspending publication with the hope of resuming in the autumn.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Ménestrel'' (24 May 1940). Original text: "Nous souhaitons pouvoir reprendre, à l'automne, l'effort que nous nous sommes imposé pendant la première phase de la guerre, conscients d'avoir ainsi servi modestement, mais de notre mieux, la cause impérissable de la pensée et de l'art français."&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, it proved to be the last issue of ''Le Ménestrel''. The Heugel company continued to operate as an independent music publisher until 1980 when it was sold to [[Éditions Alphonse Leduc]].

Notable people who wrote for the journal include [[Henri Duponchel]], [[Max d'Ollone]], [[Alphonse Royer]] and [[Paul Collin]].

In 1956 he became a partner of [[Oppenheimer Holdings|Oppenheimer &amp; Co.]] Inc, then in 1959 Levy co-founded the Oppenheimer [[mutual funds]]. There he started dozens of mutual funds that, at his death, had grown to manage more than $120 billion. In 1982, he sold both companies to the U.K.'s Mercantile House for $162 million and co-founded Odyssey Partners, a private investment partnership. It grew to be a $3 billion hedge fund before it was dissolved in 1997.

== Investment philosophy ==
Levy's financial philosophy stressed common sense and the psychology of investors.

==Wealth and philanthropy==
In 1986, to honor his father, he founded the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, now the [[Levy Economics Institute|Levy Institute]], at [[Bard College]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levyinstitute.org/about/ About the Levy Economics Institute.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Levy Institute has established itself as a sponsor of extensive work in [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] and [[post-Keynesian economics]]. In the last year of his life, Levy commuted up the [[Hudson River]] from New York City to teach a class at the Levy Institute, "Contemporary Developments in Finance", in which he focused on his belief that investing is as much a psychological as it is an economic act.

When he died in his late seventies, Levy was estimated to be worth a billion dollars, though his personal wealth might have been substantially higher were it not for his philanthropic interests.

Levy's philanthropy began in the 1950s, when he established the Jerome Levy Foundation, which still exists, giving grants to human rights and land preservation organizations. His donations grew steadily, and during his lifetime, Levy and his wife, Shelby White, gave away more than $200 million, becoming well known for their philanthropic efforts. They donated $20 million to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] for the construction of the Leon Levy and Shelby White Court,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/10/arts/design/10coll.html?pagewanted=all Hugh Eakin and Randy Kennedy, "Doubts on Donors' Collection Cloud Met Antiquities Project",] ''The New York Times'', December 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; a gallery hosting the largest selection of [[Hellenistic]] and [[Roman art|Roman]] artwork ever exhibited at that museum. The gallery included a number of pieces from Levy and White's substantial art collection, which also includes art from the [[Near East]]. Between 1997 and 2003, Levy and White donated nearly $5 million to 107 scholars for the publication of archaeological excavations that had been completed but never published. The projects funded by their program, the Shelby White-Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications, include excavations at some of the highest profile archaeological sites throughout [[Greece]] and the [[Middle East]], including [[Knossos]], [[Aphrodisias]], [[Kition]], [[Ras Shamra]], [[Sarepta]], [[Mt. Gerizim]], [[Ekron]], [[Lachish]], [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Pella]], [[Jerash]], the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], [[Assur]], [[Nineveh]], [[Nuzi]], and [[Tepe Hissar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/grantees.html Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922000854/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/grantees.html |date=2012-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also funded the Leon Levy Excavation at [[Ashkelon]], [[Israel]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://digashkelon.com/expedition/ The Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon.]&lt;/ref&gt; created the Leon Levy Visitor Center at the [[New York Botanical Garden]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybg.org/press_releases/visitor_center_release.pdf "Leon Levy Visitor Center, Dramatic New Gateway to Garden, Opens to Public May 1, 2004".] Press release, April 21, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and financed the Shelby White and Leon Levy Center for Mind Brain and Behavior at [[Rockefeller University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswire.rockefeller.edu/2008/03/25/4-5-million-grant-funds-interdisciplinary-fellowships-at-rockefeller/ "$4.5 million grant funds interdisciplinary fellowships at Rockefeller", The Rockefeller University.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708021704/http://newswire.rockefeller.edu/2008/03/25/4-5-million-grant-funds-interdisciplinary-fellowships-at-rockefeller/ |date=2012-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where Levy was a member of the Board. Levy also served as President of the Board of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], Vice Chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at [[New York University]], and was a director of [[Bard College]], and many other not-for-profit boards.

The Leon Levy Foundation and Shelby White, as Chairman of the Friends of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]], provided the funds for conserving the extraordinarily well-preserved [[Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center|Lod Mosaic]] and established the Shelby White and Leon Levy Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center, which will house the mosaic once it returns from its 2010-2016 international exhibition tour.&lt;ref name="mfa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-07-01 |url= http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early+History+-+Archaeology/Lod_mosaic_to_be_re-exposed_1-Jul-2009.htm |title= Lod mosaic to be re-exposed |work= [[Cabinet of Israel|Government of Israel]] website |publisher= [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)]] |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lodmosaic.org/schedule.html |title=The Lod Mosaic: Exhibition Schedule, accessed 9 April, 2016 |access-date=2016-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409161134/http://www.lodmosaic.org/schedule.html |archive-date=2016-04-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long interested in ancient history, Levy in his final years, along with White, began discussions about the creation of a path-breaking institute where advanced scholars would explore trade and cultural links among ancient civilizations.

After his death in 2003, Levy’s philanthropy was continued through the [[Leon Levy Foundation]], and one of its earliest initiatives was the fulfillment of that plan. In spring, 2006, the Leon Levy Foundation pledged $200 million to New York University for the creation of the [[Institute for the Study of the Ancient World]], a center for advanced scholarly research and graduate education, intended to cultivate cross-cultural study of the ancient world, from the western [[Mediterranean]] to [[China]].

===Antiquities controversy===
The donation created controversy among some academics who believe that collectors of antiquities encourage the looting of ancient sites. In their 2006 book ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities &amp;ndash; From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'', [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] and Cecelia Todeschini lay out the dynamics of the illegal trade in [[antiquities]] and use Leon Levy and Shelby White as an example of collectors whose purchases may have led to unethical dealing in artifacts.

One [[NYU]] professor, Randall White, resigned from NYU’s existing Center for Ancient Studies &amp;ndash; which is independent of the new [[Institute for the Study of the Ancient World]] &amp;ndash; saying that he opposed the acceptance of a donation from a foundation whose benefactor had sometimes been associated with such questionable practices and trafficking. Several scholars outside NYU, notably from [[Bryn Mawr College]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[University of Cincinnati]], also commented negatively on NYU's acceptance of the gift. Many other scholars, however, supported the institute and the gift. Professor James McCredie, of the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU's graduate teaching and advanced research center for art history, wrote a letter to Provost David McLaughlin endorsing the project. It was signed by IFA's seven professors of ancient art and architecture, and the controversy soon died out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elginism.com/similar-cases/academic-backlash-against-leon-levy-foundation/20060401/379/ | title=Academic backlash against Leon Levy foundation donation | publisher=Elginism |work=Science, 31 Mar 2006: Vol. 311, Issue 5769 | date=April 1, 2006 | accessdate=September 28, 2016 | author=[[Michael Balter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pogrebin, Robin]] (April 1, 2002) [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/01/arts/01gift.html?pagewanted=all "$200 Million Gift Prompts a Debate Over Antiquities"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and works==
In 2002, Levy published a memoir, written with Eugene Linden, called ''The Mind of Wall Street: A Legendary Financier on the Perils of Greed and the Mysteries of the Market'' (Perseus Book Group).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Wall-Street-Alan-Abelson/dp/1587991764 ''The Mind of Wall Street '' at Amazon.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Master of Science degree in engineering''' (abbreviated '''MSE''', '''M.Sc.Eng.''' or '''MScEng''') is a type of [[Master of Science degree]] awarded by [[universities]] in many countries. It is an [[academic degree]] to be differentiated from a [[Master of Engineering degree]].

A Master of Science degree in engineering can require completion of a [[thesis]] and qualifies the holder to apply for a program leading to a [[Doctor of Philosophy degree]] (often abbreviated Ph.D. or D.Phil) in engineering while a [[Master of Engineering]] degree can require completion of a project rather than [[thesis]] and usually does not qualify its holder to apply for a [[Ph.D]] or [[D.Phil]] in engineering. The Master of Science in engineering is considered equivalent to [[diplom]] degree in engineering in the countries that haven't a specific distinction between M.Eng. and M.Sc.Eng.

Equivalent degrees are:

* Dipl. ing. (''[[Diplôme d'ingénieur]]'') before name, France;
* Dipl.-Ing. (''Diplom-Ingenieur'') before name, Austria;
* Dipl.-Ing. (''Diplom-Ingenieur'') before name, Germany &lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Phased out due to [[Bologna process]]; not to be confused with Dipl.-Ing. degrees with additions such as "FH", "DA" or "DH" which are considered as Bachelor's degrees)&lt;/small&gt;;
* Ir (''burgerlijk ingenieur'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]) before name, The Netherlands/Belgium (NL);
* Ir (''Ingénieur Civil'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]) before name, Belgium (FR);
* Civ.ing. (''Civilingenjör'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]), Sweden;
* Cand.polyt. (''Civilingeniør'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]), Denmark;
* Siv.ing. (''sivilingeniør'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]), Norway;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">'''Missions Héliographiques''' was a 19th-century project to photograph landmarks and monuments around France so that they could be restored.

The project was established by [[Prosper Mérimée]], France's Inspector General of Historical Monuments and author of ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'', in 1851.  The intent was to supplement [[Monument historique]], a program Mérimée started in 1837 to classify, protect and restore [[France|French]] landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Rosenblum|Rosenblum, Naomi]].

Although the [[daguerrotype]] originated in [[France]], Mérimée preferred the [[calotype]], which offered more detailed textures.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Marianne. European Architecture. J 362E.

Mestral and Le Gray photographed areas southwest from [[Paris]], Le Secq the north and east. Bayard, who chose to work with glass negatives instead of paper, went west to [[Brittany]] and [[Normandy]].  Baldus covered the south and east, including the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/heli/hd_heli.htm Mission Héliographique, 1851 | Thematic Essay | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ninon Hesse''' (née Ausländer, born 18 September 1895 in [[Czernowitz]], died 22 September 1966 in [[Montagnola]]) was an [[Art history|art historian]] and [[Hermann Hesse]]'s third wife.

Ninon Ausländer was born to a Jewish lawyer in Czernowitz and studied [[archaeology]], art history and [[medicine]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. In 1918, she married [[Caricature|caricaturist]] B. F. Dolbin, whom she left in 1920; the official [[divorce]] only took place in 1931.

Although she had written a letter to Hesse after reading his [[novel]] ''[[Peter Camenzind]]'' in 1910, she only met him in 1922. The two lived together from 1927 and got married in 1931.

Ninon Hesse played an important role in Hermann Hesse's life not only as the love of his life, but also as she helped him to continue with his work when his eyes got weak by reading to him and writing for him and by collecting and editing his writings and letters after his death in 1962.

'''''No Way to Heaven''''' is a 2008 documentary feature about people allegedly living on light ([[Breatharianism]]), directed and produced by Swiss filmmakers Janos Tedeschi and Christof Schaefer. It is the world’s very first full-length film on this topic.

''No Way to Heaven'' premiered in Switzerland in January 2008. The film had theatrical release in Switzerland in January 2009 and went on to screen in Estonia and the Netherlands.

==Synopsis==
''No Way to Heaven'' begins on a remote island in Southeast Asia. There, Fritz Joss, a young man from the Swiss mountains has decided to stop eating – once and for all. He plans to find sustenance in pure (sun-)light by applying what is known as the "21 day process". Fritz sets off on his endeavour, but the planned conversion to "breatharianism" is much more difficult than anticipated.

==Cast==
The film features encounters with the following characters:
* Fritz Joss, a young Swiss yogi who stops eating and drinking by applying the "21-day process".
* [[Inedia#Prahlad Jani .28.22Mataji.22.29|Prahlad Jani]], an 82-year ascetic Hindu, who for 74 years has survived allegedly without food and liquid.
* A team of doctors, headed by [[Inedia#2003 Tests|Prof. Dr. Sudhir Shah]], a neurologist and respected scientist at Sterling Hospital Ahmedabad, India, who have conducted several case studies on breatharianism, most notably with Prahlad Jani in 2004 and 2010.
* Niranjan Bhagat, who gazes at the sun ([[sungazing]]) every day for 45 minutes and hence claims does not need to eat.
* Sanjay Padhiyar, a 110-year-old Indian saint, who tells the story of how she forgot to eat during several years of meditation, living as a recluse in a cave in northern India.

DVD Extras:

* [[Jasmuheen]], an Australian esoteric teacher and author, who introduced breatharianism (and the 21-day process) in her best-selling book "Living on Light" to Western audiences in the late 90s.
* Dr. Michael Werner, a German chemist, anthroposophist and author of "Leben durch Lichtnahrung", himself a breatharian of multiple years.
* [[Inedia#2003 Tests|Prof. Dr. Sudhir Shah]] (extended interview).
* Swami Vivekananda Saraswati, a prominent yogi and teacher of Fritz Joss.

In 1948, the artistic movement of [[Eaismo]], published a manifesto illustrating some aspects of the [[atomic age]] and, at the same time, criticizing the industrial use of [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a movement of poetry and painting, founded by the Italian artist [[Voltolino Fontani]], aiming to balance the role of men in a society upset by  the danger  of [[nuclear radiation]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic group was strengthened by the poet [[Marcello Landi]] and by the literary critic Guido Favati. In 1948 Voltolino Fontani depicted the disintegration and fragmentation of an [[atom]] on canvas, by creating the artwork: ''Dinamica di assestamento e mancata stasi''.

In 1951 the painters [[Enrico Baj]] and Sergio Dangelo created the {{illm|Arte nucleare movement|it}},  criticizing and putting the repetitiveness of painting (as an artistic and commercial phenomenon) in discussion.&lt;ref &gt;Luciano Caramel, Arte in Italia, 1945-1960, Vita e Pensiero, [[Milano]] 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
Plenty of Italian artists, in [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and foreigners like [[Yves Klein]], [[Asger Jorn]], [[Arman]], [[Antonio Saura]] joined the movement. The main representative of the arte nucleare movement was [[Piero Manzoni]], who in this context, for the first time in his life, put  his talent in evidence.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.pieromanzoni.org/biografia_1933-57.htm, ''link read in April 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Eaismo, recommending artists to pursue painting values (and poetry),&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt; the arte nucleare movement tried to promote a new form of art in which painting was marginalized.&lt;ref &gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/contemporarea/AAI/ant38, Arman, Baj, Bemporad, Bertini, Colonne, Chapmans, Colucci, Dangelo, De Miceli, D'Haese, Hoeboer, Hundertwasser, Klein, Koenig, Manzoni, Nando, Noiret, A. e G.

===Historical nuclear art in Spain=== 
In the meantime, Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalì]] published the [[Mystical manifesto]] (1951), putting catholic mysticism and nuclear themes together.
In this period Dalì created artworks like [[Idillio atomico]] (1945) and [[Leda Atomica]] (1949).

===Historical nuclear art in France===

In 1949  the French artist [[Bernard Lorjou]] started to paint his monumental artwork “l’age atomique”  (The atomic age). The painting was concluded after one year and is now located in the [[Centre Pompidou]].

===Historical nuclear art in the United States===

The painter and photographer [[Eugene Von Bruenchenhein]] painted the artwork “Atomic age” in 1955,&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.ktfineart.com/past/?object_id=86&amp;show=project_images&amp;heading_id=&amp;project_id=90&amp;detail_id=602, link read in 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and other apocalyptical and post apocalyptical paintings up to 1965.

The British sculptor, [[Henry Moore]], created a bronze public sculpture, entitled, [[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)]] (1967) that depicted both the fatality of nuclear weapons as well as celebrated the invention of nuclear energy for use as electrical power. The sculpture is located on the grounds of the University of Chicago, where the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was produced at the [[Chicago Pile-1]], under the oversight of the Manhattan Project and Enrico Fermi. The sculpture is in the form of a hybrid [[mushroom cloud]] and human skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Contemporary approaches to nuclear art==

===Japan===
After the March 2011 accident that caused three nuclear reactors to melt down at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan, there have been numerous responses by contemporary Japanese artists, including Shigenobu Yoshida, [[Tatsuo Miyajima]], [[Shimpei Takeda]], [[Fuyuki Yamakawa]], Iri and Toshi Maruki, and Hiroshima bomb survivor, Tadasi Tonoshiki.&lt;ref name="WEAD Atomic Legacy Art"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9030">A '''paraprofessional educator''', alternatively known as a '''para''', '''para-pro''', '''paraeducator''', '''instructional assistant''', '''educational assistant''', '''teacher's aide''' or '''classroom assistant''', is a [[teaching]]-related position within a school generally responsible for specialized or concentrated assistance for [[student]]s in [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[secondary school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Zehrbach, Reid, et al. (1972) ''Paraprofessional Educator Manager: A New Professional Role in Early Childhood Education.'' 	Illinois Univ., Urbana. Inst. of Research for Exceptional Children. ERIC # ED064816.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all countries and states have a fixed definition of "paraprofessional" and may use all of the terms listed above, and many others, interchangeably.

== By country ==
Paraprofessionals are widely employed in schools in the United States and Canada, and in some European countries.

In England and Wales, the term used for education paraprofessionals is Teaching Assistant (TA). In recent years, legislation has been introduced which enables teachers to delegate a range of tasks to their TAs. Teaching Assistants in England and Wales can apply for Higher Level Teaching Assistant (HLTA) status, which requires them to document the ways in which their work meets a set of specified criteria. Those with HLTA status can substitute for teachers and (where appropriate) supervise other TAs. Scotland uses the term "classroom assistant" rather than "teaching assistant" as teaching is strictly not part of an assistant's responsibilities there.

In Canada, they are widely known as Educational Assistants to emphasize their role in educating special needs students.

In Japan, foreign native speakers employed as paraprofessional language educators (primarily English) are known as [[Assistant Language Teacher]]s. Similar institutions exist in Germany and France where they are known as [[Foreign Language Assistant]]s.

==Duties==
Paraprofessional educators generally assist [[teacher]]s in the [[classroom]], supervise students outside of the classroom, or provide administrative support for teaching.&lt;ref name=BLS&gt;Teacher Assistants in the [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos153.htm Occupational Outlook Handbook] 2010-11 Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Job duties range from filling teaching positions to supplementing regular classroom [[curriculum]] with additional enrichment activities for students. Other positions include classroom aides, special education aides, school library technical assistants, and tutors.

Some paraprofessionals work directly with students, in which case they may listen to students practice reading aloud, help students understand and complete their assignments, or assist students with special needs.&lt;ref name=BLS /&gt;  

Many paraprofessionals are assigned to supervise groups of students who are eating, playing outside, or on [[field trip]]s. They may be assigned to perform clerical work for a teacher, in which case they may grade assignments, type up records for attendance or grades, set up equipment, and help prepare [[Instructional_materials|materials for instruction]], e.g., by making photocopies of worksheets.&lt;ref name=BLS /&gt; 

Many teacher assistants work primarily or exclusively with students who have special educational needs. Their duties vary according to the needs of the student, and may include physical care for students who are unable to care for themselves (such as feeding, lifting, moving, or cleaning), behavioral management, or academic assistance.&lt;ref name=BLS /&gt;

Some paraprofessionals don't work with the school directly, rather the school district.  Paraprofessionals can work in other programs that the school district provide, such as [[Childcare|school aged childcare]] and recess/ lunch duties. This links the paraprofessional to the students, but not the teacher or schools itself.  

The role of the paraprofessional educator is constantly evolving. Today, more than ever, paraprofessionals are teaching lessons, working with small groups for remediation, leading extracurricular clubs/sports and are no longer simply the "teacher's aide" of the past.

==Requirements==
Requirements to become a paraprofessional vary widely, normally ranging from a [[high school diploma]], [[G.E.D.]], two years of [[college]] education, or an [[associate degree]]. Some positions may require experience, particularly as an aide in an instructional role like in [[special education]] and in [[English as a Second Language]] instruction.

===Regulation===
In the United States, the [[No Child Left Behind]] federal legislation requires that educational paraprofessionals be "highly qualified".&lt;ref&gt;[http://arkedu.state.ar.us/commemos/static/fy0203/1623.html Paraprofessional certification.] Arkansas State Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of highly qualified is left to the individual states, as are the means for measuring qualification. The [[United States Department of Education]] has issued guidelines regarding paraprofessionals whose positions are funded under [[Title&amp;nbsp;I]] of the federal legislation. According to the Department of Education, "Paraprofessionals who provide instructional support", include those who:
#Provide one-on-one tutoring if such tutoring is scheduled at a time when a student would not otherwise receive instruction from a teacher,
#Assist with classroom management, such as by organizing instructional materials,
#Provide instructional assistance in a computer laboratory,
#Conduct parental involvement activities,
#Provide instructional support in a library or media center,
#Act as a translator, or
#Provide instructional support services under the direct supervision of a highly qualified teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/paraguidance.doc Title I, Section 1119(g)(2): Paraprofessional Guidance], U.S. Department of Education. Retrieved 2/9/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certification===
Some jurisdictions offer or require certification for some paraprofessionals. Others may require a contracted paraprofessional to pass an examination. Some require none of the above

A paraprofessional certificate is typically a certificate that an educator has obtained by passing an exam enabling them to perform a task requiring extensive knowledge, but not requiring a college degree and teaching license. Subject areas could include any areas of education such as a GED Teacher, Alternate School Teacher, ISS Teacher, After School Tutor, Home School Teacher, Credit Recovery Teacher, Continuing Education Teacher, and any Special Education area which could be but is not limited to CML, tutoring, and providing any needs to an individual student.

===Training===

The training of paraprofessional educators varies widely by state and district.  The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) in collaboration with the National Paraeducator Resource Center (NPRC) has validated some guidelines for use in training paraeducators to serve "individuals with exceptionalities"  A link to these can be found here [http://www.cec.sped.org/Standards/Paraeducator-Preparation-Guidelines [link&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;].   Professional development companies, such as 321insight.com and PD360 provide targeted training to enhance paraeducator competency.

===Salaries===
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' records of Occupational Employment Statistics, teacher assistants earn an average salary of $25,270. Teacher assistants in Elementary and Secondary Education make an average of $25,490, while teacher assistants working at Child Day Care services earn less and teacher assistants working in higher education earn more. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes259041.htm Teacher Assistants.] Bureau of Labor Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special education==
Paraprofessional educators are frequently used to help support student/s in [[special education]] settings.  Paraprofessional educators in these roles work with students with a variety of disabilities including learning disabilities, emotional disturbance, [[autism]] spectrum disorders, [[ADHD]], [[schizophrenia]], developmental disabilities, and communication disorders. Paraprofessional educators may work in special classrooms, resource rooms or serve as inclusion assistants who accompany individual students throughout their day. Paraprofessional educators in these roles may require specialized training in behavior management, de-escalation, personal-[[professional boundaries]], and sometimes physical restraint.&lt;ref&gt;5. Behavior Support Strategies for Education Paraprofessionals (Henson W. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research''' ('''PIK''') is a German government-funded research institute addressing crucial scientific questions in the fields of global change, climate impacts, and [[sustainable development]]. Ranked among the top environmental [[think tank]]s worldwide, it is one of the leading research institutions and part of a global network of scientific and academic institutions working on questions of global environmental change. It is a member of the [[Leibniz Association]], whose institutions perform research on subjects of high relevance to society.

== History ==

PIK was founded in 1992 by its current director, [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]]. About 400 people work at the institute that is located on [[Potsdam]]'s historic [[Telegrafenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pik-potsdam.de/institute/organization ''PIK Research Portal'' – Organization]. Web site of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Visited on August 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the natural and social sciences analyze the earth system and develop strategies and solution pathways for a sustainable development.

== Partners ==

PIK provides information to international organizations like the [[World Bank]] as well as to regional bodies like the [[Federal Government of Germany]] and the [[European Commission]]. PIK scientists also contribute to the reports of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC). The IPCC working group Climate Change mitigation is coordinated by the institute's deputy director and chief economist [[Ottmar Edenhofer]].

In 2007, PIK initiated a biennial Nobel Laureates' Symposium series on global sustainability. The fourth annual symposium is scheduled for April 22, 2015 and will be held in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="nobel"&gt;[http://www.nobelcause.org/ Nobel Laureates' Symposium series website]&lt;/ref&gt; This will be the first time that the Laureates' Symposium will be held outside Europe and will be focused on the rapid urbanization East Asia and Pacific region.&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt;

In 2010, PIK collaborated with the [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]] to found Climate-KIC (Knowledge and Innovation Community).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climate-kic.org/networks/academic-partners/ ''Climate-KIC'' – Academic Partners].

{{wiktionary|pounce}}
[[Image:PounceSprinkler.JPG|thumb|220px|A ''Pounce pot'' (or sprinkler) at the [[London Science Museum]]]]
'''Pounce''' is a fine powder, most often made from powdered [[cuttlefish bone]], that was used both to dry ink and to sprinkle on a rough writing surface to make it smooth enough for writing. This last was certainly needed if the paper came "[[Sizing|unsized]]", that is, lacking the thin gelatinous material used to fill the surface of the paper and make it smooth enough for writing with a [[quill]] or a [[nib (pen)|steel nib]]. It was also used to prepare the surface when [[Technical drawing|drafting]] with [[Technical pen|Rapidiograph pens]] on mylar, a common drafting medium in the late twentieth century. 

Although some people claim that pounce was never added afterwards to dry ink, this probably represents confusion between the two processes of preparing paper and drying the ink after writing. Experiment shows that using pounce does indeed smooth "unsized" paper but then does little or nothing to dry the ink after you have written on that prepared paper, and it is clearly the case that pouncing or sanding continued long after properly "sized" writing paper came into general use during the nineteenth century. 

The pounce or sand is gently sprinkled all over the writing on the paper. When using a quill or a steel nib, and with inks that are made up to match those typically in use during the 18th or 19th centuries, and provided the pen has been used with the fine strokes typical of handwriting of that period, the handwriting will be sufficiently dry within 10 seconds to allow the paper to be folded without blotting. Gently vibrating the paper whilst the pounce or sand is on it ensures that little or no pounce or sand sticks to the handwriting and excess sand or pounce is shaken off before folding the paper. 

In the 19th century the pounce pots or sanders often had a shallow dish round the top so that pounce or sand could be returned to the pot and reused. The process is very effective for quickly drying ink, and although [[blotting paper]] has been available since Tudor times, pounce or sand continued to be used throughout the nineteenth century because it was often cheaper.

'''Railway engineering''' is a multi-faceted [[engineering]] discipline dealing with the design, construction and operation of all types of [[rail transport]] systems. It encompasses a wide range of engineering disciplines, including [[civil engineering]], [[computer engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]] and [[production engineering]]. A great many other engineering sub-disciplines are also called upon.

== History ==
With the advent of the railways in the early nineteenth century, a need arose for a specialized group of [[engineer]]s capable of dealing with the unique problems associated with railway engineering. As the railways expanded and became a major economic force, a great many engineers became involved in the field, probably the most notable in Britain being [[Richard Trevithick]], [[George Stephenson]] and [[Isambard Kingdom shembud]]. Today, railway systems engineering continues to be a vibrant field of engineering. E.Shendya a civil engineer(now retired) introduced the Metro Railway System in India. He is also known as 'the Siddharth kashikar of India

In [[music]], a '''reduction''' is an [[arrangement]] or [[transcription (music)|transcription]] of an existing [[sheet music|score]] or [[musical composition|composition]] in which complexity is lessened to make [[musical analysis|analysis]], performance, or practice easier or clearer; the number of [[part (music)|parts]] may be reduced or [[rhythm]] may be simplified, such as through the use of [[block chord]]s.

==Orchestral==

An '''orchestral reduction''' is a [[sheet music]] arrangement of a work originally for full symphony [[orchestra]] (such as a symphony, overture, or opera), rearranged for a single instrument (typically [[piano]] or [[organ (music)|organ]]), a smaller orchestra, or a [[chamber ensemble]] with or without a keyboard (e.g. a [[string quartet]]). A reduction for solo piano is sometimes called a [[#Piano|piano reduction]] or ''piano score''.

During opera rehearsals, a [[répétiteur]] (piano player) will typically read from a piano reduction of the opera. When a choir is learning a work scored for choir and full orchestra, the initial rehearsals will usually be done with a pianist playing a piano reduction of the orchestra part. Before the advent of the [[phonograph]], arrangements of orchestral works for solo piano or [[piano four hands]] were in common use for enjoyment at home.

A reduction for a smaller orchestra or chamber ensemble may be used when not enough players are available, when a venue is too small to accommodate the full orchestra, to accompany less powerful voices, or to save money by hiring fewer players.

==Piano==
&lt;!--[[Piano transcription]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
A '''piano reduction''' or '''piano transcription''' is [[sheet music]] for the [[piano]] (a ''piano score'') that has been compressed and/or simplified so as to fit on a two-line staff and be playable on the piano. It is also considered a style of [[orchestration]] or music [[arrangement]] less well known as ''contraction scoring'', a subset of [[elastic scoring]].

The most notable example is [[Franz Liszt]]'s [[Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)|transcriptions]] for solo piano of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s symphonies, which are arguably the greatest work of transcription ever completed in the history of music.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Reflections_on_Liszt.html?id=4URhKNWu0XQC&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arnold Schoenberg]], a piano reduction should "only be like the view of a sculpture from ''one'' viewpoint", and he advises that [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|thickness]] should largely be ignored, since "the attempt to make a useful object equally usable for a variety of purposes is usually the way to spoil it completely".&lt;ref name="The Modern Piano Reduction"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schoenberg |first=Arnold |year=1975 |chapter=The Modern Piano Reduction |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbXtxJezk5cC&amp;pg=PA348 |title=Style and Idea: Selected Writings of Arnold Schoenberg |pages=348–350 |isbn=978-0-520-05294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think'']]

'''''Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think''''' is a [[festschrift]] of 25 essays written in recognition of the life and work of [[Richard Dawkins]]. It was published in 2006, to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the publication of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''. A wide range of topics is covered from many fields including [[evolutionary biology]], [[philosophy]], and [[psychology]]. Space is also given to writers who are not in full agreement with Dawkins. The book is edited by two of Dawkins' former PhD students, [[Alan Grafen]] and [[Mark Ridley (zoologist)|Mark Ridley]]. ({{ISBN|9780199291168}})

==Reception==
The reviews of the book have been mixed, but the controversial title phrase, "How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think" has been explained by considering Dawkins to have worked as an influential educator and concise author, of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', who promoted the key ideas of others about [[evolutionary biology]], also including some controversial ideas which are not as widely accepted.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite newspaper

&lt;/ref&gt;
As the author of a popular science book, Dawkins had popularized ideas by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George Williams]] about group selection, [[William D. Hamilton|William Hamilton]] on the theory of kin selection in evolution, biologist/[[geneticist]] [[John Maynard Smith]] on evolutionarily stable strategies, and [[Robert L.

'''Shakespeare's editors''' were essential in the development of the modern practice of producing printed books and the evolution of [[textual criticism]].

The 17th-century [[Folio (printing)|folio]] collections of the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] did not have editors in the modern sense of the term. In the best understanding of contemporary consensus scholarship, the plays to be included in the [[First Folio]] ([[1623 in literature|1623]]) were gathered together or "compiled" by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], two long-time colleagues of Shakespeare in the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]. The play manuscripts may have been [[proofreading|proofread]] and prepared for printing by [[Edward Knight (King's Men)|Edward Knight]], the "book-keeper" or prompter of the company. The task of [[First Folio#First Folio Technique|proofreading and correcting]] the actual printed pages of the Folio was left to the [[First Folio#Compositors|compositors]] and printers in the print-shop, yielding the uneven and often defective text that is the First Folio.

Even less is known about the creation of the [[Second Folio|Second]] ([[1632 in literature|1632]]), Third ([[1663 in literature|1663&amp;ndash;64]]), and Fourth Folios ([[1685 in literature|1685]]) than about the First; see [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)]].

In the 18th century, however, interested individuals made the first concerted efforts to bring order to the tangle of textual difficulties that the Folios of the previous century presented. The list below gives the date of each edition of Shakespeare's plays, the editor, the format of the collection, and pertinent specific information.

*[[1709 in literature|1709]], [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]; [[book size|octavo]], 6 volumes. Rowe was the first person to attempt a clean and fully comprehensible text of the plays; but he depended upon a copy of the Fourth Folio and made generally [[conjectural emendation]]s. He also added full stage directions (he was a playwright himself) and full lists of ''Dramatis personae'', and wrote the first biographical sketch of the poet. 
*[[1725 in literature|1725]], [[Alexander Pope]]; [[book size|quarto]], 6 volumes. Pope was the first to attempt a collation of the quarto texts of the plays, yet he produced what was basically a reprint of Rowe that added little of value.
*[[1733 in literature|1733]], [[Lewis Theobald]]; octavo, 7 volumes. Theobald has been called "the first Shakespeare scholar";&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; he carried forward the task of collating the quartos, and began the study of Shakespeare's sources and the order of the plays' composition. (See [[Chronology of William Shakespeare's plays|Chronology of Shakespeare's plays]].)
*[[1744 in literature|1744]], [[Thomas Hanmer (politician)|Thomas Hanmer]]; quarto, 6 volumes. Hanmer relied on Theobald's text, and made guesswork corrections. His edition was reprinted in [[1770 in literature|1770]].
*[[1747 in literature|1747]], [[William Warburton]]; octavo, 8 volumes. Warburton built upon Pope's edition; indeed, Warburton placed Pope's name before his own on the title pages of his edition. In his preface, Warburton wrote that his friend Pope "was desirous I should give a new Edition of this Poet, as he thought it might contribute to put a stop to a prevailing folly of altering the Text of celebrated Authors without Talents or Judgment. And he was willing that ''his'' Edition should be melted down into ''mine'', as it would, he said, afford him (so great is the modesty of an ingenuous temper) a fit opportunity of confessing his Mistakes." The phrase "without Talents or Judgment" refers to Theobold and Hanmer. However, Warburton did allow, rather begrudgingly, some corrections put forward by Theobold and Hanmer: "For the rest, all the Corrections which these two Editors have made on any ''reasonable'' Foundation, are here admitted into the Text; and carefully assigned to their respective Authors. A piece of Justice which the ''Oxford Editor'' never did; and which the ''Other'' was not always scrupulous in observing towards me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warburton|first1=William|title=The Works of Shakespear|date=1747|publisher=J. &amp; P. Knapton; S. Birt; T. Longman &amp; T. Shewell; and others|location=London|pages=title page, xix, &amp; xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In [[1748 in literature|1748]] Thomas Edwards published his ''Supplement to Warburton's Edition of Shakespeare'', in later editions called ''The Canons of Criticism'' &amp;mdash; a satirical but spot-on analysis of Warburton's editorial emendations, some of which are truly silly.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Thomas|title=The Canons of Criticism, and Glossary|date=1765|publisher=C. Bathurst|location=London|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Johnson had this to say: "Soon after Edwards's ''Canons of Criticism'' came out, Johnson was dining at Tonson the Bookseller's, with Hayman the Painter and some more company. Hayman related to Sir Joshua Reynolds, that the conversation having turned upon Edwards's book, the gentlemen praised it much, and Johnson allowed its merit. But when they went farther, and appeared to put that authour upon a level with Warburton, "Nay, (said Johnson,) he has given him some smart hits to be sure; but there is no proportion between the two men; they must not be named together. A fly, Sir, may sting a stately horse and make him wince; but one is but an insect, and the other is a horse still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boswell|first1=James|editor1-last=Malone|editor1-first=Edmond|title=The Life of Samuel Johnson|date=1807|publisher=T. Cadell &amp; W. Davies|location=London|page=207, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[1765 in literature|1765]], [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[The Plays of William Shakespeare]]''; octavo, 8 volumes. Johnson in turn relied upon Warburton; his edition is noteworthy mainly for its famous Preface.
*[[1768 in literature|1768]], [[Edward Capell]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Appalled by the undisciplined emendations of Hanmer and Warburton, Capell spent three decades collecting and collating the quartos. He was also the first to exploit the [[Stationers' Register]] and [[Francis Meres]]'s ''Palladis Tamia'', and to explore Shakespeare's use of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'' and Sir [[Thomas North]]'s translation of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]].''
*[[1773 in literature|1773]], [[George Steevens]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Steevens employed Johnson's text, but continued Capell's trend of adding new material. Steevens revised and re-issued his edition in [[1778 in literature|1778]]; in [[1780 in literature|1780]] Edmond Malone added another 2 volumes that contained Shakespeare's non-dramatic poems and other material. [[Isaac Reed]] revised the Steevens edition again in 1785, and Steevens himself produced one final, 15-volume revision in [[1793 in literature|1793]].
*[[1790 in literature|1790]], [[Edmond Malone]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Malone, often considered the best of the century's editors of Shakespeare, wrote the first general consideration of [[English Renaissance theatre]], utilizing resources like the records of the [[Master of the Revels]] and [[Edward Alleyn]]'s papers at [[Dulwich College]].  He is also noted for his work on the problem of chronology.

The early 19th century saw the first [[Variorum]] editions of Shakespeare's works, editions that collated and synthesized the efforts of the editors of the previous century:

*[[1803 in literature|1803]], the First Variorum edition, edited by [[Isaac Reed]]; 21 volumes.
*[[1813 in literature|1813]], the Second Variorum, a reprint of the First; 21 volumes.
*[[1821 in literature|1821]], the Third Variorum, edited by James Boswell;&lt;ref&gt;Not the famous [[James Boswell|Boswell]], the biographer of Johnson, but rather his third son (1778&amp;ndash;1822): Michael Dobson and Stanley Wells: ''The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare.'' OUP 2001. pg. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; 21 volumes.

These massive editions laid the foundation for modern textual scholarship on Shakespeare's works, and by extension on works of literature in general. In the 19th century the text, drawn primarily from Malone and Steevens, was "monumentalized"{{sfn|de Grazia|1991|p=14}} in the Cambridge edition (1863-6) and its single-volume companion, the Globe edition (1864). It was followed by the New Cambridge edition in 1921, and all modern standard editions inherit primarily from this edition.{{Sfn|de Grazia|1991|p=14}}

As for the personalities involved: some of these men were friends, like Steevens, Reed, and Malone; acquaintances called them the Shakespeare Gang. Others nourished spirits of competitiveness and resentment. Pope made Theobald the first hero of ''[[The Dunciad]].'' Warburton belittled Rowe's "Account of the Life" of Shakespeare &amp;mdash; but he reprinted it in his own edition, without change or improvement. Despite his friendship with Malone and Reed, Steevens was famous for his irascibility; in notes to his 1793 edition of Shakespeare, he concocted obscene interpretations of some passages and attributed those readings to people he didn't like.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 30, 110, 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major edition, the Cambridge Shakespeare (1863&amp;ndash;66), moved away from the practice of a single editor following his own sometimes capricious instincts and judgments. The first volume of the Cambridge Shakespeare was edited by [[William George Clark]] and John Glover, and the subsequent eight volumes by Clark and [[William Aldis Wright]]. Clark and Wright also produced the single-volume Globe Shakespeare (1864) using their Cambridge texts; together, these became the standard for the remainder of the century.

The most radical edition in the twentieth century was the [[Oxford Shakespeare]], prepared under the general editorship of [[Stanley Wells]] and [[Gary Taylor (English literature scholar)|Gary Taylor]]. It aims to present the texts as they were originally performed, which results in numerous controversial choices, including presenting multiple texts of ''[[King Lear]]'', a text of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in which the scenes presumably cut by Shakespeare are relegated to an appendix, and an emphasis on the collaborative nature of several of the plays.

'''Simplified music notation''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.simplifiedmusicnotation.org/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative form of [[music notation]] designed to make [[sight-reading]] easier. It was proposed by Peter Hayes George (1927-2012).  It is based on [[modern musical symbols|classical staff notation]], but [[sharp (music)|sharps]] and [[flat (music)|flats]] are incorporated into the shape of the [[note head]]s.  [[Musical note|Note]]s such as double sharps and double flats are written at the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] at which they are actually played, but preceded by [[symbol]]s called "history signs" to show that they have been [[transposition (music)|transposed]].  The key signature and all other information in the original [[Sheet music|score]] is retained, but the player does not need to remember the [[key signature]] and [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] while playing.

The notation was designed to help players who struggle with sight-reading,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, R.‘Songwriting and Composer Magazine’ The Magazine for International Songwriters and Composers’, 1st Quarter 2009, p.8 ‘Simplified Music Notation: ‘A More Rational Approach to Traditional Music Notation’.&lt;/ref&gt; including those who suffer from [[working memory]] impairments, [[dyslexia]] and other [[learning disability|learning difficulties]].&lt;ref&gt;Christensen N. Wayne State College, American Music Teacher, June/July 2009, p.78-81 ‘A More Rational Approach to Traditional Music Notation: Elementary Piano Compositions’&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Peter Hayes George (1927-2012) was born in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], the son of a [[diplomat]].  He attended RADA and began his career as an [[actor]] playing roles such as the lead in ‘[[Malachi's Cove (film)|Malachi's Cove]]’ directed by [[Charles Frank]] and the juvenile lead in [[Peter Brook|Peter Brook's]] London West End production ''[[Dark of the Moon (play)|Dark of the Moon]]''.  In the 1960s he gave up acting as shortcomings with his [[working memory]] made it difficult for him to accept major roles with long speeches.

After studying music for teachers at Los Angeles City College in 1962, George took up the piano.  He thought that since musicians can keep the music in front of them while playing, his memory problems would present no difficulty. However, he discovered that [[musician]]s must remember to modulate each musical note according to the [[key signature]], to continue any [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] through the [[bar (music)|bar]], and to cancel them at the end of the bar.  He also found difficulty in transposing notes such as [[sharp (music)|double sharps]] and [[flat (music)|double flats]].&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, S. [http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/business/3681103.Scoring_a_winner_in_music_learning/ Scoring a winner in music learning] in ''The Argus, Business Supplement'' 17 September 2008, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

His simplified music notation was designed in response to this.  The original concept was formed in 1977 and the notation was developed over the next 30 years. The first series of music books in his simplified music notation was [[publishing|published]] in September 2008. A second series, "Key Perfect", was published in 2010. Its early-grade piano repertoire pieces were composed and compiled by music teacher and author [[John Kember]] and international pianist and lecturer [[John York]].&lt;ref&gt;York J.'Piano Magazine' , January 2010, p.41 ‘Simplified Music Notation': 'Sight-reading breakthrough'&lt;/ref&gt;  This latest series was designed to show the effectiveness of simplified music notation as a learning tool towards improving students' reading skills in traditional notation.&lt;ref&gt;American Music Teacher, Music Merchandise section. February/March 2009, p.10-12 ‘Simplified Music Notation’&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notation ==
The basic concept of George's simplified music notation is that players should be able to play what they see, without having to adapt for key signature or complex accidentals.&lt;ref&gt;George, Peter Hayes ''A More Rational Approach to Traditional Music Notation''. The Creative Arts Research Trust ISMN 797-0-708083-12-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[sharp (music)|sharp]] and [[flat (music)|flat]] symbols in the key signature are replaced by the sharp and flat [[Musical note|note]]heads of simplified music notation: a [[triangle]] for sharps and a [[rhombus]] for flats. The traditional [[oval]] notehead is used when a note is [[natural (music)|natural]].

If there is a [[key change]] in the middle of a piece, the new key signature is shown without naturals to ‘neutralise’ the previous [[key (music)|key]]. The exception to this is where the key changes to [[C major]] or [[A minor]], where ‘neutralising’ naturals are used to make this clear.  Instead of the traditional natural symbol, an oval notehead is used.

Double sharps, and double flats (and optionally B{{music|sharp}} and E{{music|sharp}}, and F{{music|flat}} and C{{music|flat}}) are enharmonically transposed, and preceded by a symbol called a  ''history sign''.  History signs allow anybody studying the music to see how it was originally written and to analyse the [[chord progression|harmonic progression]] of the piece.  However, they can be ignored whilst [[sight-reading]].

'''Theology Digest''' (1953–2010) summarized selected recent articles from over 400 [[List of theological journals|theological journals]]. Some were in the form of formal summaries, approved by the authors of the articles, while some were briefer abstracts for whose accuracy the editors assumed responsibility. 
 
The digest was published quarterly.  In each year, three issues contained the abstracts and summaries, and the fourth contained selected lectures from the series of [[Bellarmine Lectures]] and elsewhere. All issues contained a book survey as well, covering over 200 books per issue. 

The  Digest was founded by Cyril A. Vollert, S.J., and Gerald F. Van Ackeren, S.J.,  at the Jesuit divinity school, [[St. Mary's College, Kansas|St. Mary's College]] in Kansas in 1953, but those of other denominations became involved as well.  

Theology Digest was based at Saint Louis University from 1967 until 2010.

The '''University of San Diego''' ('''USD''') is a [[Private university|private]] [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[research university]] located in the [[Linda Vista, San Diego|Linda Vista]] neighborhood of [[San Diego]], [[California]], United States. Founded in 1949 as the [[San Diego College for Women]] and San Diego University, the academic institutions merged into the University of San Diego in 1972. Since then, the university has grown to comprise nine undergraduate and graduate schools, to include the Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering, Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies, and [[University of San Diego School of Law|School of Law]]. USD offers 79 undergraduate and graduate programs, and enrolls approximately 9,073 undergraduate, paralegal, graduate and law students.

== History ==
[[File:USD Immaculata Parish Church.jpg|float|thumb|left|210px|Immaculata Parish Church at USD showing the architectural style of the campus]]

Chartered in 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gTqgQrQQJTUC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=usd+chartered+in+1949&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v2W4XLFTPP&amp;sig=iFyvNSskJ9Qz0fjowwc7BYGh3iA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjg6vKd49PdAhVn9YMKHRs9DkM4FBDoATAIegQIARAB#v=onepage&amp;q=usd%20chartered%20in%201949&amp;f=false|title=Insiders' Guide® to San Diego|last=Mellin|first=Maribeth|last2=Onstott|first2=Jane|last3=Devlin|first3=Judith|date=2009-04-22|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780762755790|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the university opened its doors to its first class of students in 1952 as the [[San Diego College for Women]]. Reverend [[Charles F. Buddy|Charles F. Buddy, D.D.]], then bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego|Diocese of San Diego]] and Reverend Mother Rosalie Hill, [[Society of the Sacred Heart|RSCJ]], a Superior [[Vicar]]ess of the [[Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]], chartered the institution from resources drawn from their respective organizations on a stretch of land known as "Alcalá Park," named for [[Didacus of Alcalá|San Diego de Alcalá]]. In September 1954, the San Diego College for Men and the School of Law opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandiego.gov/digital-archives-photos/university-san-diego-buildings-and-campus|title=University of San Diego Buildings and Campus {{!}} City of San Diego Official Website|website=www.sandiego.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two schools originally occupied Bogue Hall on the same site of University High School, which would later become the home of the [[University of San Diego High School]].  Starting in 1954, Alcalá Park also served as the diocesan chancery office and housed the episcopal offices, until the diocese moved to a vacated Benedictine convent that was converted to a pastoral center. In 1957, Immaculate Heart Major Seminary and St. Francis Minor Seminary were moved into their newly completed facility, now known as Maher Hall. The Immaculata Chapel, now no longer affiliated with USD, also opened that year as part of the seminary facilities. For nearly two decades, these schools co-existed on Alcalá Park. Immaculate Heart closed at the end of 1968, when its building was renamed De Sales Hall; St. Francis remained open until 1970, when it was transferred to another location on campus, leaving all of the newly named Bishop Leo T. Maher Hall to the newly merged co-educational University of San Diego in 1972. Since then, the university has grown quickly and has been able to increase its assets and academic programs.  The student body, the local community, patrons, alumni, and many organizations have been integral to the university's development.

[[File:Universidad de Alcala.jpg|thumb|right|210px|The ''[[Universidad de Alcalá]]'' in [[Spain]], inspiration for Mother Hill's USD]]
Significant periods of expansion of the university, since the 1972 merger, occurred in the mid-1980s, as well as in 1998, when [[Joan B. Kroc]], philanthropist and wife of [[McDonald's]] financier [[Ray Kroc]], endowed USD with a gift of $25&amp;nbsp;million for the construction of the Institute for Peace &amp; Justice. Other significant donations to the college came in the form of multimillion-dollar gifts from weight-loss tycoon [[Jenny Craig]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0P8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=university+san+diego+jenny+craig+endowment&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gjTJSyeIev&amp;sig=7l_2fHf4Jru75G4SyfmhBsFZEIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjc3rfQ5dPdAhWpxYMKHYLoCY8Q6AEwC3oECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=university%20san%20diego%20jenny%20craig%20endowment&amp;f=false|title=San Diego Magazine|last=LLC|first=CurtCo/SDM|date=December 2006|publisher=CurtCo/SDM LLC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, inventor [[Donald Shiley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/science/sdut-usd-given-20-million-create-engineering-school-2012sep25-story.html|title=USD gets $20 million for engineering school|last=Robbins|first=Gary|work=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, investment banker and alumnus Bert Degheri, and an additional gift of $50&amp;nbsp;million Mrs. Kroc left the School of Peace Studies upon her death. These gifts helped make possible, respectively, the [[Jenny Craig Pavilion]] (an athletic arena), the Donald P. Shiley Center for Science and Technology, the Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies, and the Degheri Alumni Center.  As a result, USD has been able to host the West Coast Conference (WCC) basketball tournament in 2002, 2003 and 2008, and hosted international functions such as the [[Kyoto Prize|Kyoto Laureate Symposium]] at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice and at USD's Shiley Theatre. Shiley's gift has provided the university with some additional, and more advanced, teaching laboratories than it had previously. In 2005, the university expanded the Colachis Plaza from the Immaculata along Marian Way to the east end of Hall, which effectively closed the east end of the campus to vehicular traffic. That same year, the student body approved plans for a renovation and expansion of the Hahn University Center which began at the end of 2007. The new Student Life Pavilion (SLP) opened in 2009 and hosts the university's new student dining area(s), offices for student organizations and event spaces. The Hahn University Center is now home to administrative offices, meeting and event spaces, and a restaurant and wine bar, La Gran Terazza.

In the fall of 2018, USD's total enrollment was 8,905 undergraduate, graduate, and law students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandiego.edu/about/facts.php|title=University of San Diego Facts - University of San Diego|website=www.sandiego.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environment and location ==
[[File:USDBayView.jpg|float|thumb|left|420px|View of [[Mission Bay (San Diego)|Mission Bay]] and [[SeaWorld San Diego|SeaWorld]] from campus]]
Alcalá Park sits atop the edge of a [[mesa]] overlooking [[Mission Bay, San Diego, California|Mission Bay]] and other parts of San Diego. The philosophy of USD's founder and her fellow religious relied on the belief that studying in beautiful surroundings could improve the educational experience of students. Thus, the university's buildings are designed in a 16th-century [[Spanish Renaissance]] architectural style, paying homage to both San Diego's Catholic heritage{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} and the [[University of Alcalá|Universidad de Alcalá]] in Spain. In September 2011, ''[[Travel+Leisure]]'' named it as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/7 "America's Most Beautiful College Campuses", ''Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus is located approximately two miles north of downtown San Diego, on the north crest of [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]] in the community of [[Linda Vista, San Diego, California|Linda Vista]]. From the westernmost edges of Alcalá Park the communities of [[Mission Hills, San Diego, California|Mission Hills]], [[Old Town San Diego|Old Town]], [[Point Loma]], [[Ocean Beach, San Diego|Ocean Beach]], Bay Park, [[Mission Beach, San Diego, California|Mission Beach]] and [[Pacific Beach, San Diego, California|Pacific Beach]] can be seen. Also, the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[San Diego Bay|San Diego Harbor]], the [[Coronado Islands]] and [[La Jolla, San Diego, California|La Jolla]] are visible from the campus.

== Administration ==
Though a Catholic university, the school is no longer governed directly by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego|Diocese of San Diego]]. Today, a [[Laity|lay]] [[board of trustees]] governs the university's operations. However, the Bishop of San Diego, [[Robert W. McElroy]], retains a seat as a permanent member and retains control of the school's designation of "Catholic."

== Academics ==
[[File:ShileyCenterUSD.jpg|thumb|The Donald P. Shiley Center for Science and Technology, opened in 2003]]
USD offers more than 79 degrees at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels. USD is divided into six schools and colleges. The College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Law are the oldest academic divisions at USD; the Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies is the university's newest school. USD offers an honors program at the undergraduate level, with approximately 300 students enrolled annually.

The United States encouraged [[uranium mining]] production because of the [[nuclear arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]], its opponent in the [[Cold War]]. Large [[uranium]] deposits were found on and near the [[Navajo Reservation]] in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], and these were developed through the 20th century. Absent much environmental regulation prior to the founding of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1970 and passage of related laws, the mining endangered thousands of Navajo workers, as well as producing contamination that has persisted in adversely affecting air and water quality, and contaminating Navajo lands.

Private companies hired many Navajo employees to work the mines. Disregarding the known health risks of exposure to uranium, the private companies and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] failed to inform the Navajo workers about the dangers and to regulate the mining to minimize contamination. As more data was collected, they were slow to take appropriate action for the workers. Studies show that the Navajo mine workers and numerous families on the reservation have suffered high rates of lung, cancers (including [[Xeroderma pigmentosum]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/rare-disease-suddenly-arises-on-navajo-reservation/ review of documentary "Sun Kissed"&lt;/ref&gt; and other diseases, from environmental contamination. For decades, industry and the government failed to regulate or improve conditions, or inform workers of the dangers. As high rates of illness began to occur, workers were often unsuccessful in court cases seeking compensation, and the states at first did not officially recognize [[radon]] illness. In 1990 the US Congress passed the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]], to settle such cases and provide needed compensation.

Despite efforts made in cleaning up uranium sites, significant problems from the legacy of uranium development persist today on the Navajo Nation and in the states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. Hundreds of [[abandoned mine]]s have not been cleaned up, and these present environmental and health risks in many communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-navajo19nov19,0,1645689.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Judy | last=Pasternak | title=A peril that dwelt among the Navajos | date=2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that there are 4000 mines with documented uranium production, and another 15,000 locations with uranium occurrences in 14 western states.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. EPA, Radiation Protection, "Uranium Mining Waste,"

The [[Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act]] (1978) is a [[United States environmental law]] that amended the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] and authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to establish health and environmental standards for the stabilization, [[Environmental remediation|restoration]], and disposal of [[Radioactive waste|uranium mill waste]].&lt;ref name=EPASummary&gt;{{citation|title=Laws We Use (Summaries):1978 - Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act(42 USC 2022 et seq.) |publisher=EPA |url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/laws/laws_sum.html#umtrca |accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleanup has continued to be difficult, and EPA administers several [[Superfund]] sites located in the Navajo Nation.

==History==

The Navajo people refused to let any industry mine their land in the 1930s, when the appointed federal guardian to the Navajo Nation attempted to decide what mining should take place on their land.

But pressure for mining increased in the postwar years, when the United States believed it had to develop resources to compete with the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]]. In 1948, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) announced it would be the sole purchaser of any uranium mined in the United States, to cut off dependence on imported uranium. The AEC would not mine the uranium; it contracted with private mining companies for the product.&lt;ref name=Brugge&gt;Brugge, Doug, Timothy Benally, and Esther Yazzie-Lewis. ''The Navajo People and Uranium Mining,'' Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent mining boom led to the creation of thousands of mines; 92% of all western mines were located on the [[Colorado Plateau]] because of regional resources.&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;Dawson, Susan E, and Gary E Madsen. "Uranium Mine Workers, Atomic Downwinders, and the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act." In ''Half Lives &amp; Half-Truths: Confronting the Radioactive Legacies of the Cold War,'' pp. 117-143. Santa Fe: School For Advanced Research, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Navajo Nation]] encompasses portions of [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Utah]], and their reservation was a key area for uranium mining. More than 1000 mines were established by leases in the reservation.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; From 1944 to 1986, an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 Navajo people worked in the uranium mines on their land.&lt;ref name="Fettus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fettus|first=Geoffry H.|title=Nuclear Fuel's Dirty Beginnings: Environmental Damage and Public Health Risks From Uranium Mining in the American West|url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/files/uranium-mining-report.pdf|work=National Resources Defense Council|publisher=National Resources Defense Council|accessdate=29 April 2014|author2=Matthew G. Mckinzie |date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other work was scarce on and near the reservation, and many [[Navajo people|Navajo]] men traveled miles to work in the mines, sometimes taking their families with them.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

Between 1944 and 1989, 3.9 million tons of uranium ore were mined from the mountains and plains.&lt;ref name=Pasternak&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-navajo19nov19,0,5351917.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Judy | last=Pasternak | title=A peril that dwelt among the Navajos | date=November 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the [[US Public Health Service]] made a massive study of uranium miners. In 1962 it published the first report to show a statistical correlation between cancer and uranium mining.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The federal government finally regulated the standard amount of [[radon]] in mines, setting the level at .3 WL on January 1, 1969.&lt;ref name = Brugge/&gt; The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] was established on December 2, 1970. But, environmental regulation could not repair the damage already suffered. Navajo miners contracted [[lung cancer]] at much higher rates than the rest of the population, and they have suffered higher rates of other lung diseases caused by breathing in radon.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

Private companies resisted regulation through lobbying Congress and state legislatures. In 1990, the [[United States Congress]] finally passed the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] (RECA), granting [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] for those affected by the [[radiation]]. The act was amended in 2000 to address criticisms and problems with the original legislation.&lt;ref name = Dawson/&gt;

The [[tribal council]] and Navajo delegates remained in control of mining decisions before the adverse [[Uranium#Human exposure|health effects]] of mining were identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pasternak|first=Judy|title=Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed|year=2010|publisher=Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one fully understood the [[Health effects of radon#Cancer in miners|effect of radon exposure for miners]], as there was insufficient data before the expansion of mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brugge|first=Doug|title=The Navajo People and Uranium Mining|year=2006|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judy Pasternak's ''Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed''&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 1979, the tailings pond at United Nuclear Corporation's uranium mill in [[Church Rock, New Mexico]], breached its dam. More than 1,000 tons of [[radioactive waste|radioactive mill waste]] and 93 millions of gallons of acidic, radioactive tailings solution and mine effluent flowed into the [[Puerco River]], and contaminants traveled {{convert|80|mi|km}} downstream to [[Navajo County, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=Pasternak2&gt;Pasternak, ''Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed'', Free Press, 2010, p.149, {{ISBN|1416594833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flood backed up sewers, affected nearby [[aquifers]] and left stagnating, contaminated pools on the riverside.&lt;ref name=chur&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1963288 | pmid=17666688 | doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.103044 | volume=97 | title=The Sequoyah corporation fuels release and the Church Rock spill: unpublicized nuclear releases in American Indian communities | date=September 2007 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1595–600 | last1 = Brugge | first1 = D | last2 = Bui | first2 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=water&gt;Brendan Giusti, "Radiation Spill in Church Rock Still Haunts 30 Years Later", ''The Daily Times'' ([[Farmington, New Mexico]]), July 16, 2009, Section: Local&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sz&gt;Ferenc Morton Szasz, ''Larger Than Life: New Mexico in the Twentieth Century,'' UNM Press, 2006, pp.82-83, {{ISBN|0-8263-3883-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state contingency plan relied on English-only notification of the largely Navajo public populace affected by the spill. Local residents did not learn immediately of the toxic danger.&lt;ref name=Sequoyah/&gt; The locals were accustomed to using the riverside for recreation and herb gathering. Residents who waded in the acidic water went to the hospital complaining of burning feet and were misdiagnosed with heat stroke. Sheep and cattle died en masse.&lt;ref name=water/&gt; The Navajo Nation asked the governor of New Mexico to request disaster assistance from the US government and have the site declared a disaster area, but the governor refused.&lt;ref name=Sequoyah /&gt; This limited the amount of disaster relief the Navajo Nation received.

For nearly two years, the state and federal government trucked in water to the reservation, but ended the program in 1981. Farmers had little choice but to resume use of the river for watering livestock and crops.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Shuey, MPH [http://www.sric.org/workbook/features/V11_1.html "The Puerco River: Where Did the Water Go?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226022609/http://www.sric.org/workbook/features/V11_1.html |date=2012-02-26 }}, ''Southwest Research and Information Center,'' 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health studies on exposure to uranium==
Concerned over the adverse health consequences which Europeans experienced from uranium mines, William Bale and John Harley conducted an independent study.  Their work led the US government to start the United States Public Health Study (USPHS) on uranium mine workers. Bale and Harley's studies focused on identifying the level of radon in mines and assessing any correlation with [[disease]], specifically lung cancer. Radon, they found, can attach to mine dust, which would be inhaled and subsequently concentrated in the lung tissue. Because of this action, workers breathed radon gas at concentrations up to 100 times higher than the amount of radon gas indicated.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The USPHS was subsequently launched in 1951, with two goals: to identify uranium mine [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] exposures, and to conduct a medical evaluation of the miners.&lt;ref name = Dawson/&gt;

===Ethical concerns===
The USPHS study raised ethical concerns. The Navajo workers were rarely notified of the possible dangers which the USPHS was studying.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; As late as 1960, the USPHS [[informed consent|medical consent]] form failed to inform miners about the possible health risks of working in the mine.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, created in 1994 to explore the treatment of the workers, said: "'Had they been better informed, they could have sought help in publicizing the fact that working conditions in the mines were extremely hazardous, which might have resulted in some mines being ventilated earlier than they were."&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The USPHS failed to abide by a centerpiece of [[Nuremberg Code]] (1947), by failing to have informed consent of the subjects of a research study.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

In 1952, the USPHS issued two reports, reporting exceptionally high concentrations of radon in these uranium mines, even higher than those found in European mines years before.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; Medically, there was little evidence found of sickness. But, the [[Incubation period|latency]] from exposure to disease, also found among the European cases, explains why there were few medical effects observed at this early stage.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; In a private meeting between the AEC and the USPHS, the AEC informed the USPHS scientists that not only could the high radon levels eventually cause cancer, but proper ventilation of the mines could avoid the problem.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; The government failed to take any action on this finding.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

===Continued effects and research===
The USPHS continued to study the uranium miners, eventually including 4,000 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] and non-Indian underground uranium miners.  They added miners in 1951, 1953, 1954, 1957 and 1960.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; In 1962, the USPHS published the first account of the effects of radon exposure. It found a significant [[correlation]] between radon exposure and cancer.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; Additional studies were published in 1968, 1973, 1976, 1981, 1987, 1995 and 1997; these demonstrated linear relationships between radon exposure and lung cancer, a latency period of about 20 years between radon exposure and health effects, and noted that, while smoking [[tobacco]] caused a shorter latency period for the development of cancer, it did not fully explain the relationship between radon and cancer.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; Similar reports found instances of other diseases such as [[pneumoconiosis]], [[tuberculosis]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), as well as diseases of the [[blood]].&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; A 2000 study of the number of cancer cases among Navajo uranium mine workers concluded that the miners were 28.6 times more likely to contract the disease than the study's control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brugge|first=Doug|title=The History of Uranium Mining and the Navajo People|pmc=3222290|work=American Journal of Public Health|author2=Rob Goble |date=September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many miners died from radiation-related illnesses. A 1995 report published by [[American Public Health Association]] found: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;excess mortality rates for lung cancer, pneumoconioses and other respiratory diseases, and tuberculosis for Navajo uranium miners. Increasing duration of exposure to underground uranium mining was associated with increased mortality risk for all three diseases… The most important long-term mortality risks for the Navajo uranium miners continue to be lung cancer and pneumoconioses and other nonmalignant respiratory diseases.&lt;ref name=Roscoe&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roscoe | first1 = Robert J | last2 = Deddens James | first2 = A | last3 = Salvan | first3 = Albert | last4 = Schnorr | first4 = Teressa M | year = 1995| title = Mortality Among Navajo Uranium Miners | doi = 10.2105/ajph.85.4.535 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 85| issue = | pages = 535–541 | pmc = 1615135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over the decades, Navajo miners extracted some four million tons of uranium ore, which was used by the U.S. government primarily to make nuclear weapons.  Some miners, unaware of the adverse health effects, carried contaminated rocks and tailings from local mines to build their family homes. These were found to be contaminated, with the family at risk. In 2009, those homes began to be demolished and rebuilt under a new government program, which involved temporarily relocating occupants until the homes could be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/us/27navajo.html?_r=0 |title=Uranium Contamination Haunts Navajo Country |author=Dan Frosch |date=July 26, 2009 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States government response==
Following the publication of the reports in the early 1950s, some private contractors attempted to properly ventilate their mines. The states of Colorado, New Mexico and Utah established minimum standards for radon concentrations (Dawson and Madsen 2007). But, the AEC was lax in enforcement of the rules; AEC commissioners did not establish national radon standards at the time the studies were released.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The AEC said it had no authority to regulate uranium, but it regulated [[beryllium]]. The health and activist communities have criticized the AEC for its failure to take action related to the scientific reports. The agency repressed the reports.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;

Government and uranium industry personnel were privy to the information, but it was not until the 1960s that workers were informed of the environmental dangers.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The government response continued to be slow. Regulation of the uranium industry was first debated in Congress in 1966, but little progress was made. Journalists began to publish stories detailing the illnesses of uranium miners, giving them public attention.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; In 1969, Congress set the standard radon level for mines at .3 WL.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

Navajo miners began to file lawsuits to seek compensation for health damages, but often lost in court. But the publicity, presentation of harmful evidence, and victim testimony gave support to their cause.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;[[Ted Kennedy]] (D-MA) was the first senator to propose a Radiation Compensation bill, with the goal of avoiding lawsuits and compensating victims fully, though it was defeated in 1979. [[Orrin Hatch]]'s (R-UT) 1981 compensation bill was met with a similar fate, and his attempt in 1983 did not reach the [[United States Senate|Senate]] floor.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;

===Progress toward legislation===
In 1989, Orrin Hatch, supported by fellow Utah Representative [[Wayne Owens]] (D-UT), sponsored the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] (RECA), which was signed into law by President [[George H.W. Bush]] on October 15, 1990.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA): "Offers an apology and monetary compensation to individuals who contracted certain cancers and other serious diseases following their exposure to radiation released during above-ground atmospheric nuclear weapons tests or, following their occupational exposure to radiation while employed in the uranium industry during the build-up to the Cold War." &lt;ref name=DOJ&gt;United States Department of Justice. Radiation Exposure Compensation Program, About the Program. November 6, 2009. http://www.justice.gov/civil/torts/const/reca/about.htm (accessed October 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice]] established regulations for implementing the act, related to individuals eligible for payment, and guidelines for identification, including [[marriage licenses]], [[birth certificates]] and official documents, some of which the Navajo did not possess. In some cases, the government did not recognize individual's documentation as legitimate.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;

With additional data from the studies by the [[Public Health Service]] (PHS), in 2000 the act was amended to correct shortcomings: "The RECA Amendments of 2000 broadened the scope of eligibility for benefits to include two new occupationally exposed claimant categories (uranium mill workers and uranium ore transporters), expanding both the time periods and geographic areas covered, and adding compensable diseases, thus allowing more individuals to be eligible to qualify." &lt;ref name=GAO&gt;United States Government Accountability Office. "United States Government Accountability Office." September 7, 2007. www.gao.gov/new.items/d071037r.pdf - (accessed October 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 17, 2009, the government has paid claims of 21,810 people, denied 8,789, and paid $1,455,257,096 in reparations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/civil/omp/omi/Tre_SysClaimsToDateSum.pdf Department of Justice Civil Division, "Radiation Exposure Compensation System"], Radiation Exposure Compensation Program, 17 November 2009 (accessed November 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abandoned Mine Land program===
The ''Navajo Nation Abandoned Mine Land''(s) (NN AML) are numerous [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]-designated "AML sites" on lands of the [[Navajo people]] which were used for [[uranium mining|mining (e.g., uranium)]]. Sites include:

====History====
This specific Superfund site for the AUMs on Navajo land has been in existence since 1994. This is following many years of research on the health effects of uranium mining which eventually led to the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] in 1990. Since its acceptance as a Superfund site, many federal, tribal, and grassroots organizations have come together to assess and remediate contamination sites on the Navajo Nation. Due to the fact that there are hundreds of contaminated sites, there have been a few big successes and many communities stuck in limbo. The following is a history of this Superfund site, the organizations that have collaborated on this environmental remediation, and recent criticisms of the handling of this large and complicated problem.

The Abandoned Uranium Mines on the Navajo Nation were established as a Superfund site in 1994 in response to a Congressional hearing brought by the Navajo Nation on November 4, 1993. This hearing included the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE), and the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA). Superfund status stems from the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] of 1980 (CERCLA) which allows the United States federal government to assign funds for environmental remediation of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superfund|url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navajo Nation is located in Region 9 (Pacific Southwest) of the Superfund which serves [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], the [[Pacific Islands]], and Tribal Nations. The site's official EPA # is NNN000906087 and it is located in Congressional District 4. According to the EPA's Superfund site overview, other names for the AUMs may include "Navajo Abandoned Uranium Mines" or "Northeast Church Rock Mine." Church Rock Mine is one of the EPA's most successful clean-up sites among over 500 sites spanning the 27,000 square mile Navajo Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Addressing Uranium Contamination in the Navajo Nation|url=http://epa.gov/region9/superfund/navajo-nation/index.html|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly four years after the initial Congressional hearing, the EPA announced their first helicopter survey for the AUMs in September 1997. Located in the Oljato area in Southeastern [[Utah]] near the Utah-Arizona border, this was first of several helicopter surveys that aimed to measure "naturally occurring radiation ([[gamma radiation]]) coming from abandoned uranium mining areas." The stated purpose of these surveys was to "determine if these sites pose a risk to the people in the area and if so, what measures should be taken to minimize that risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. EPA to Perform Helicopter Survey of Abandoned Uranium Mines in the Oljato Area|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/76cacdcfe20f9547882576cd007e059f/$FILE/1997%20Oljato%20Helicopter%20Survey.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over ten years later, on June 9, 2008, the EPA announced its five-year plan for the clean-up of uranium contamination on the Navajo Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/bf9a1608e7578ba388257405000499f8/$FILE/NN%205-Year%20Plan-June%2012-final.pdf|title=Health and Environmental Impacts of Uranium Contamination in the Navajo Nation Five-Year Plan|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This five-year plan contained nine specific objectives for 2008-2012: assess up to 500 contaminated structures and remediate those that pose a health risk; assess up to 70 potentially contaminated water sources and assist those affected by it; assess and require cleanup of AUMs via a tiered ranking system of high priority mines; clean Church Rock Mine, the highest-priority mine; remediate groundwater of abandoned uranium milling sites; assess the Highway 160 site; assess and clean Tuba City Dump; assess and treat health conditions for populations near AUMs; and lastly to summarize the action of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) in its assistance to the Navajo Nation's cleanup efforts. Since the introduction of the five-year plan, the EPA has released a progress report (available online) each consecutive year. As of August 2011, the EPA lists its accomplishments as: screening 683 structures, sampling 250 unregulated water sources and shutting down 3 such contaminated sources, provision of public outreach and educational programs for safe water practices, instituting a 2.6 million dollar water hauling feasibility project, and providing up to 386 homes with clean drinking water through a 20 million dollar project with Indian Health Services. For 2012, the EPA has listed its next steps as replacing 6 contaminated structures, demolishing other contaminated structures, and continuing screening of these structures for referral to the EPA's Response Program. The 2011 progress report also lists Church Rock, the Oljato Mesa, and the Mariano Lake Mine as sites of current or proposed remediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/c0c617e006c655c28825791400795ae3/$FILE/Navajo%208_11%20911kb.pdf|title=Health and Environmental Impacts of Uranium Contamination in the Navajo NationEPA Progress in Implementing a 5-Year Cleanup Plan|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EPA's website, the AUM Superfund site is not on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL) and has no proposals to be put on this list. The NPL is the list of hazardous Superfund sites that are deemed eligible for long-term environmental remediation. The EPA suggests that although NPL listing is a possibility it is "not likely" for the abandoned uranium mines on the Navajo nation. NPL status guides the EPA in its decisions on sites to further investigate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/National_Priorities_List|title=National Priorities List|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a process that has been criticized for the handling of these mines. With over 500 uranium sites and only a few sites slated for full-scale remediation plans, the prioritization process has recently been called into question by [[The New York Times]] (see Recent Press).

====Partnership agencies====
Superfund works with many agencies from both the federal government and the Navajo Nation in order to properly assess and direct funding to mining sites. These agencies include: the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency (NNEPA), the [[Indian Health Services]] (IHS), the Diné Network for Environmental Health (DiNEH), the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources (NNDWR), the Department of Energy (DOE), and US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
The NNEPA was established in 1972 and officially recognized through legislation as a separate regulatory branch of the Navajo Nation in 1995. With the official acceptance of the NNEPA also came the adoption of the Navajo Nation Environmental Policy Act. According to the NNEPA website, their mission is: "With respect to Diné values, to protect human health, land, air and water by developing, implementing and enforcing environmental laws and regulations with a commitment to public participation, sustainability, partnership, and restoration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navajonationepa.org/index.html |title=NNEPA |publisher=Navajonationepa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Diné is the word for Navajo in the traditional [[Navajo language]]) NNEPA consults with the US EPA on site assessments (the US EPA is the lead agency for the Site Assessment Project). NNEPA helps the EPA in assessing and deciding which contaminated structures should be demolished and which water sources should be deemed a human health risk. The two also collaborate to perform community outreach for the Navajo people whose lives are affected by the uranium mining.
The [[Center for Disease Control]] and the DiNEH Project are also integral players in the assessment of water quality and community outreach. The Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources, with funding from the EPA, assist Navajo residents by hauling water for residents near 4 contaminated water sources, a 2.6 million dollar project. Indian Health Services helped fund the 20 million dollar drinking water project started in 2011. This project serves 386 homes near 10 contaminated water sources. The NNEPA, IHS, NNDWR, and DiNEH project have been the main partners with the US EPA in water hauling projects.

====Community involvement and response====
Forgotten People&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forgottennavajopeople.org/blog/ |title=Forgotten People &amp;#124; News, Events, and Activism concerning the former Bennett Freeze |publisher=Forgottennavajopeople.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (FP) is a grassroots organization incorporated on the Navajo Nation which represents the health and well-being of the residents of the Navajo Nation in Arizona. The full name of this organization is Forgotten People Diné Bé Iina' na' hil naa, meaning Diné Rebuilding Communities. Forgotten People began as a political organization dedicated to advocacy for the Navajo people against forced relocation plans which spanned 1974 to 2007. When forced relocation programs were ended in 2007, the organization shifted focus to a broader variety of issues with a focus in environmental remediation. In 2009, Forgotten People received the Environmental Excellence Award from the NNEPA. Forgotten People was an integral aspect of the Black Falls water project, which involved collaboration with the US EPA to provide clean drinking water and educational outreach for the Black Falls community which was affected by uranium mining. FP attributes the success of Black Falls with the evolution "from a needs-based or dependency approach to the agencies into an assumption of full responsibility for their own development." The Black Falls community was able to decide upon their own solutions for their water problems. Their efforts were coordinated by FP and funded by the US EPA. Forgotten People represents an evolving grassroots community which is moving simply from organizing to actually empowering residents to take their development into their own hands.

Forgotten People also gathers and displays pertinent public records for a variety of issues facing the Navajo on their website. For their campaigns against uranium mining, their website displays all official responses US attempts at relaxing uranium restrictions on Navajo territory. FP also preserves the response of the President of the Navajo Nation in response to proposals for uranium mining near the [[Grand Canyon]]. In 2005, the President of the Navajo Nation, [[Joe Shirley, Jr.]], signed the Diné Natural Resources Protection Act which banned uranium mining and processing on Navajo land. After signing the law, President Shirley stated, "As long as there are no answers to cancer, we shouldn't have uranium mining on the Navajo Nation. I believe the powers that be committed [[genocide]] on Navajo land by allowing uranium mining. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forgottennavajopeople.org/projects/advocacy/4%2030%2009%20Navajo%20Nation%20issues%20ban%20on%20uranium%20mining.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism and press====
Despite the EPA's claims of a "strong partnership with the Navajo Nation," recent articles have been published that call into question the equitability and efficiency of the EPA's action on the abandoned uranium mines. On March 31, 2012, The New York Times published an article entitled "Uranium Mines Dot Navajo Land, Neglected and Still Perilous"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leslie Macmillan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/us/uranium-mines-dot-navajo-land-neglected-and-still-perilous.html?pagewanted=all|title=Uranium Mines Dot Navajo Land, Neglected and Still Perilous|publisher=New York Times|date=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Leslie MacMillan. The article suggests that politics and money are influencing the prioritization of mine clean-up efforts. David Shafer, an environmental manager at the United States Department of Energy, has said that questions of whether current uranium problems are due to past mining or to the naturally occurring mineral are delaying the process of cleaning up. Similar concerns are common in environmental remediation projects for victims of industrial pollution.

While the EPA does prioritize mines that are nearest to people's homes, MacMillan highlights some remote locations where people do live and yet have been neglected by the EPA. [[Cameron, Arizona]] is one such site which has a population of nearly 1000. Rancher Larry Gordy stumbled across an abandoned uranium mine on his grazing land for his cattle near Cameron in the summer of 2010. There are still no warning signs in the town of Cameron to alert people of potential contamination.
On December 30, 2010 Scientific American published an article entitled "Abandoned Uranium Mines: An 'Overwhelming Problem' in the Navajo Nation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Francie Diep|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=abandoned-uranium-mines-a|title= Abandoned Uranium Mines: An "Overwhelming Problem" in the Navajo Nation|publisher=Scientific American|date=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Francie Diep. Diep told Gordy's story and reported that the EPA assessed his site on November 9, 2010. Diep suggested that this date was moved up due to publicity of Gordy's story; originally the EPA had promised to visit within six months of his original discovery of the uranium mine.

Similar allegations of prioritization due to negative publicity for the EPA were made of the Skyline Mine in the Oljato Mesa. Elsie Begay, a 71-year-old Navajo woman from the Oljato region was the topic of a series of articles in [[The Los Angeles Times]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-navajo19nov19,0,5351917.story |title=A peril that dwelt among the Navajos |publisher=latimes.com |date=2006-11-19 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These articles were written by Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed (2010) author Judy Pasternak, whose work on these articles led to her book. One EPA representative, Jason Musante, stated this publicity "might have bumped the site up the priority list."

Over a year after Gordy stumbled across the mine in his cattle's grazing land, MacMillan reports that the site at Cameron has yet to be given a priority by the EPA. When EPA officials were asked to accompany a reporter to the Cameron site, the officials declined and instead offered to visit the newly cleaned site in Oljato. MacMillan spoke with a Navajo hotel manager near the Skyline Mine who expressed hesitation about the EPAs remediation, stating, "That's what they want you to see: something that's all nice and cleaned up." MacMillan drew attention to the fact that cows are grazing on contaminated land and people are eating these cattle. Taylor McKinnon, a director at the [[Center for Biological Diversity]], went so far as to say the site was the "worst he had seen in the Southwest." Although the locally grown beef is tested, standard tests for meat do not include checking for radioactive substances like uranium. The EPA has put an emphasis on health effects throughout its five-year plan, so the lack of any sort of attention in this matter has raised eyebrows.

In addition to the questioning of political bias in the prioritization of mining sites, there is criticism of the EPA's decision to revisit a 1989 permit proposing to mine for uranium near Church Rock. [[New Mexico]]'s [[KUNM]] radio station reported on May 9, 2012 that Uranium Resources Incorporated has expressed interest in starting production near Church Rock by the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://kunm.org/post/epa-revisits-permit-what-could-be-first-new-wave-uranium-mines |title=EPA Revisits Permit for What Could Be First in New Wave of Uranium Mines |publisher=KUNM |date=2012-05-09 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition has already gained nearly 10,000 signatures against this new mining initiative.

==Navajo treatment, impact and response==
Beginning in the 1960s, uranium miners were beginning to become ill with cancer at increasing rates.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; The state of Utah did not recognize radiation exposure at the time as a category of illness, making workers compensation unattainable for many of the sick Navajo (Dawson and Madsen 2007). Private industry's treatment of the Navajo workers was poor, according to recent standards: companies failed to educate workers on precautionary measures, did not install sufficient [[engineering]] controls, such as adequate ventilation; and did not provide sufficient safety equipment to protect workers to the known dangers related to the mines.&lt;ref name=Dawson2&gt;Dawson, Susan E. "Navajo Uranium Workers and the Effects of Occupational Illnesses: A Case Study," ''Human Organization'' Vol. 51, number 4, 1992: 389-397.&lt;/ref&gt; The Navajo were never told of the radiation effects, and did not have a word for it in their [[language]]. Many Navajo did not speak [[English language|English]] and trusted the uranium companies to have their interests in mind.&lt;ref name=Dawson2/&gt; Navajo workers and residents have felt betrayed as the results of the studies became known, as well as the long delays by companies and the US government to try to prevent the damage, and to pay compensation.&lt;ref name=Dawson2/&gt; Lung cancer became so prevalent among the Navajo people that working in uranium mines was banned on Navajo lands in 2005.&lt;ref name="Fettus"/&gt;

===Allegations of racism===
White workers also faced different conditions: Navajo workers were forced to enter the mine directly after a detonation, while it was filled with dust and smoke. However, the white workers were able to stay behind.&lt;ref name = Dawson2/&gt; Navajo miners were paid less than miners from off-reservation, well below minimum wage.{{sfn|Eichstaedt|1994|p=38}}&lt;ref name=Kuletz&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuletz|first=Valerie|title=The Tainted Desert|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=1998|page=25|ref=Kuletz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until radon exposure safety standards were imposed by the [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] [[W. Willard Wirtz|Willard Wirtz]] over the objections of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and the uranium mining industry in June, 1967,&lt;ref name=Pasternak3&gt;{{cite book|last=Pasternak |first=Judy |year=2010 |title=Yellow Dirt: A Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed|publisher=Free Press |isbn= 1416594825 |ref=pasternak|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eichstaedt|first=Peter|title=If You Poison Us: Uranium and Native Americans|publisher=Red Crane Books|location=Santa Fe, NM|year=1994|ref=Eichstaedt|pages=71, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; mines lacked ventilation, exposing workers to [[radon]].

Widows of mine workers met to discuss their grief; they started a grassroots movement that eventually reached the Congressional floor.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

The [[Uranium mining and the Navajo people#Church Rock uranium mill spill|Church Rock uranium mill spill]] raised claims that race was a factor in the federal government's paying little attention to the disaster:

{{Quote|text=When there was a relatively minor problem at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the entire attention of the Nation was focused on this location and the Federal and State assistance brought to bear to deal with it was extraordinary. When the largest release of radioactive material in the history of the United States occurs in Navajo country, however, the attention paid to it by the Federal and State authorities is minimal at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=US Congress, House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment|title=''Mill Tailings Dam Break at Church Rock, New Mexico''|date=October 22, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|sign=[[Peter MacDonald (Navajo leader)|Peter MacDonald, Chairman of the Navajo Nation]]}}

===Enduring impact===
Many residents of the Navajo Nation have anxiety and concerns about the future because of large amounts of radioactive waste remaining. One Navajo Elder explains: "We, the elderlies, that resides around here don't know what was good and worst about the uranium. There were several deaths in this area that was affected by radiation or cancers. We need help. I lost my wife last year [to cancer] and now I am 87 years. My wife would have been 70 years old which made a lot of difference. I am lonely and can't get anywhere without her help. I was hurted and miserable."&lt;ref name=Dawson2/&gt; The number of cancer cases has continued to rise because of these conditions, as water, air and ground generally have been affected. In areas near uranium mills, residents suffer [[stomach cancer]] at rates 15 times those of the national level. In some areas, the frequency gets as high as 200 times the national average.&lt;ref name=Pasternak/&gt; Hundreds of abandoned uranium mines with exposed tailings remain unremediated in the Navajo Nation area posing a contamination hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diep|first=Francie|date=December 30, 2010|title=Abandoned Uranium Mines: An "Overwhelming Problem" in the Navajo Nation|journal=Scientific American|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=abandoned-uranium-mines-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the former uranium mills, [[water contamination]] and contamination of rocks which many residents used to build their houses, continue to be problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/us/27navajo.html "Uranium contamination at Navajo Reservation"], ''New York Times,'' 27 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 report published by [[American Public Health Association]] found: "excess mortality rates for lung cancer, pneumoconioses and other respiratory diseases, and tuberculosis for Navajo uranium miners. Increasing duration of exposure to underground uranium mining was associated with increased mortality risk for all three diseases… The most important long-term mortality risks for the Navajo uranium miners continue to be lung cancer and pneumoconioses and other nonmalignant respiratory diseases." That is to say, not stomach cancer, which the Navajo people naturally have a higher rate of experiencing than the national US average.&lt;ref name="Roscoe"/&gt;

===Clean-up efforts===
Since 1994, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), along with the [[Navajo Nation]] Environmental Protection Agency, has been mapping areas affected with radioactivity. In 2007, they compiled an [[atlas]] of the abandoned uranium mills in order to rid the area of [[nuclear waste]].&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. Addressing Uranium Contamination in Navajo Nation. October 7, 2009. http://www.epa.gov/region09/superfund/navajo-nation/index.html (accessed November 17, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the EPA implemented a five-year cleanup plan, focusing on the most pressing issues: contaminated water and structures. The EPA estimates that 30% of all Navajo people lack access to uncontaminated drinking water.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;

The EPA is targeting 500 abandoned uranium mills as another part of their five-year cleanup plan, with the goal of ridding the area of nuclear waste.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt; Its priority was identification of contaminated water sources and structures; many of the latter have been destroyed and removed. In 2011, it completed a multi-year project of removing 20,000 cubic yards of contaminated earth out of the reservation, near the Skyline Mine, to controlled storage on the plateau.&lt;ref name="Fonseca"&gt;[http://www.chron.com/news/article/Navajo-woman-helps-prompt-uranium-mine-cleanup-2155858.php Felicia Fonseca, "Navajo woman helps prompt uranium mine cleanup"], Associated Press, carried in ''Houston Chronicle'', 5 September 2011, accessed 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a $600 million settlement attempts to clean up 94 abandoned uranium mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://azdailysun.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/feds-agreement-reached-to-clean-up-abandoned-uranium-mines-on/article_9fb42856-0e34-585d-b25d-a7e5d1fec692.html |title=Feds: Agreement reached to clean up abandoned uranium mines on Navajo Nation|date=18 January 2017|work=[[Arizona Daily Sun]]|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ventura County Air Pollution Control District''' ('''VCAPCD'''), formed in 1968, is the [[Air pollution#Air quality agencies|air pollution agency]] responsible mainly for regulating [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stationary sources]] of [[air pollution]] for [[Ventura County]]. The District was formed  by the [[Board of Supervisors]] in response to the county's first air pollution study which identified Ventura County as having a severe air quality problem.  

Currently, Ventura County does not meet the federal air quality standard for [[ozone]] and exceeds the state standard for ozone and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Ventura County Air Quality.
|url=http://www.vcapcd.org/air_quality.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==VCAPCD organizational structure==
The VCAPCD is governed by the ''Air Pollution Control Board''. This 10-member board consists of the County Board of Supervisors and five elected officials representing Ventura County cities. The APC Board establishes policy and approves new rules. They also appoint the Air Pollution Control Officer, the District Hearing Board, Advisory Committee, and Clean Air Fund Advisory Committee.  The ''Air Pollution Control Officer (APCO)'' of the VCAPCD reports to the APC Board and the following divisions report to the APCO:

===VCAPCD Divisions===
The VCAPCD has a staff of about fifty employees including inspectors, engineers, planners, technicians, and support staff. The District is divided into the following divisions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=VCAPD Organizational Chart.
|url=http://www.vcapcd.org/pubs/Fiscal/Budget/0809/OrganizationalChart.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Administrative Services
*Information Systems
*Public Information
*Planning and Evaluation
*Rules and Incentives
*Pass-Through Grants
*Compliance
*Engineering
*Monitoring

===Hearing Board===
The ''APCD Hearing Board'' is a  quasi-judicial body established by state law to grant variances and uphold or overturn APCD decisions regarding permit denials and operating conditions on permits. The Hearing Board may also revoke permits to operate, issue orders of abatement, allow citizen appeals, and settle disputes between the District and permittees. 

The Hearing Board consists of five members appointed by the Air Pollution Control Board for three-year terms.

Current members are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Main District Goals==
The VCAPCD works with business and industry to reduce emissions from new and existing sources to protect public health and agriculture from the advserse effects of air pollution for over 800,000 county residents.

The District has stated the following goals for 2010-2011:

* Attainment of federal and state ambient air quality standards.
* Implement the requirements of the California Clean Air Act and 1990 Amendments to the federal [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].
* Continue public awareness program and education program.
* Develop attainment plans for a new [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) ambient air quality standards.

{{distinguish|text=[[John DeFrancis|Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems]]}}

'''Visible Speech''' is  a system of phonetic symbols developed by [[Alexander Melville Bell]] in 1867 to represent the position of the speech organs in articulating sounds. Bell was known internationally as a teacher of speech and proper [[elocution]] and an author of books on the subject.  The system is composed of symbols that show the position and movement of the throat, tongue, and lips as they produce the sounds of language, and it is a type of [[phonetic transcription|phonetic notation]].  The system was used to aid the deaf in learning to speak.

In 1864 Melville promoted his first works on Visible Speech, in order to help the deaf both learn and improve upon their speech (since the profoundly deaf could not hear their own pronunciation).&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.192&lt;/ref&gt; To help promote the language, Bell created two written short forms using his system of 29 modifiers and tones, 52 [[consonant]]s, 36 [[vowel]]s and a dozen [[diphthong]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.193&lt;/ref&gt; they were named [[International English|World English]], which was similar to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], and also Line Writing, used as a shorthand form for [[stenographer]]s.&lt;ref name="Winzer 1993, pg.194"&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.194&lt;/ref&gt;

Melville's works on Visible Speech became highly notable, and were described by [[Édouard Séguin]] as being "...a greater invention than [[invention of the telephone|the telephone]] by his son, [[Alexander Graham Bell]]".&lt;ref name="Winzer 1993, pg.194"/&gt; Melville saw numerous applications for his invention, including its worldwide use as a [[universal language]].  However, although heavily promoted at the [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf]] in Milan, Italy in 1880, after a period of a dozen years or so in which it was applied to the education of the deaf, Visible Speech was found to be more cumbersome, and thus a hindrance, to the teaching of speech to the deaf, compared to other methods,&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.195–203&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually faded from use.

Bell's son [[Alexander Graham Bell]] learned the symbols, assisted his father in giving public demonstrations of the system and mastered it to the point that he later improved upon his father's work.  Eventually, Alexander Graham Bell became a powerful advocate of visible speech and [[oralism]] in the United States.  The money he earned from his patent of the [[telephone]] and the sale of his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] [[Volta_Laboratory_and_Bureau#Laboratory_patents|patents]] helped him to pursue this mission.

== The early years ==

In 1867, Alexander Melville Bell published the book ''Visible Speech: The Science of Universal Alphabetics''. This book contains information about the system of symbols he created that, when used to write words, indicated pronunciation so accurately, that it could even reflect regional accents.&lt;ref name="PKK"&gt;Potter, Kopp, and Kopp, 1966. ''Visible Speech''.&lt;/ref&gt; A person reading a piece of text handwritten in Melville Bell's system of characters could accurately reproduce a sentence the way it would be spoken by someone with a foreign or regional accent. In his demonstrations, Melville Bell employed his son, Alexander Graham Bell to read from the visible speech transcript of the volunteer's spoken words and would astound the audience by saying it back exactly as the volunteer had spoken it.

A few samples of the writing system invented by Melville Bell may be seen in the images on this page. These images depict Melville Bell's intention of creating a script in which the characters actually look like the position of the mouth when speaking them out loud. The system is useful not only because its visual representation mimicks the physical act of speaking, but because it does so, these symbols may be used to write words in any language, hence the name "Universal Alphabetics".&lt;ref name="M"&gt;Melville Bell, 1867. ''Visible Speech: The Science of Universal Alphabetics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melville Bell's system was effective at helping deaf people improve their pronunciation, but his son Graham Bell decided to improve upon his father's invention by creating a system of writing that was even more accurate and employed the most advanced technology of the time.

== A fresh take on pronunciation for the deaf ==

Alexander Graham Bell later devised another system of visual cues that also came to be known as visible speech, yet this system did not use symbols written on paper to teach deaf people how to pronounce words. Instead, Graham Bell's system, developed at his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] in Washington, D.C., involved the use of a [[spectrogram]], a device that makes "visible records of the frequency, intensity, and time analysis of short samples of speech".&lt;ref name="PKK"/&gt; The spectrogram translated sounds into readable patterns via a photographic process. This system was based on the idea that the eye should be able to read patterns of vocalizations in much the same way that the ear translates these vocalizations into meaning. [[Spectrogram|Modern implementations]] of Bell's idea display sound spectra in real time and are used in [[phonology]],&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Crowhurst, Phonology case studies, University of Texas at Austin 2006 [http://www.laits.utexas.edu/phonology/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[speech therapy]] and [[computer speech recognition]].

== Method ==

The idea of the use of a [[spectrograph]] to translate speech into a visual representation was created in the hopes of enabling the deaf to use a telephone.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;Kopp, 1967. ''Visible Speech Manual''.&lt;/ref&gt; If the sounds could be translated into something readable, then a deaf person at the receiving end could then read out the pattern of speech to determine its meaning without having to hear what was said. The spectrograph readings could also be used to teach pronunciation by having a person speak into the spectrograph and watch a small television-like screen to monitor the precision of their utterances.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

Women were professionally active in the academic discipline of [[art history]] already in the nineteenth century and participated in the important shift early in the century that began involving an "emphatically corporeal visual subject", with [[Vernon Lee]] as a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Hilary|date=1998–1999|title=Women and the Ends of Art History: Vision and Corporeality in Nineteenth-Century Critical Discourse|journal=[[Victorian Studies]]|volume=42|issue=1|pages=77–100|jstor=3829127|doi=10.2979/vic.1998.42.1.77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that in the twentieth century women art historians (and curators), by choosing to study women artists, "dramatically" "increased their visibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tannenbaum|first=Judith|authorlink=Judith Tannenbaum|year=1994|title=East Coast- C Is for Contemporary Art Curator: Curiosity, Contradiction, Collaboration, Challenge|journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]|volume=53|issue=3|pages=47, 49, 51, 53 55, 57, 59|jstor=777431|doi=10.2307/777431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, women art historians are one of two groups (besides authors of high-school texbooks) "who say there have been great women artists" in the first place, according to the authors of a study of the representations of women artists in US textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Roger|author2=Ashley Folgo |year=2006|title=Who Says There Have Been Great Women Artists? Some Afterthoughts|journal=[[Art Education (journal)|Art Education]]|volume=59|issue=2|pages=47–52|jstor=27696136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and employment==
&lt;!--Obviously this needs to be a historical narrative, not just a single note--but hey, that's all I got right now--&gt;In the United States professional, academic employment for women art historians was, by the early 1970s, not commensurate with the number of female PhDs in art history. Between 1960 and 1969, 30.1% of PhDs were awarded to women but those numbers increased significantly during that period: between 1960 and 1965 it was 27%, but between 1966 and 1967 it had gone up to 43.5%. But in 1970-1971, women art historians in art departments in the US made up 23.1% of instructors, 21.6% of assistant professors, 17.5% of associate professors, and only 11.1% of full professors. Comparison with the numbers for the same years for women in the languages, from a study done by the [[Modern Language Association]], showed that "women in C.A.A. [College Art Association] professions face[d] rather more severe discrimination than women in M.L.A. fields". Similar tendencies were reported for salary and employment in studio teaching ("preliminary statistics...indicate that women artists receive a disproportionately small share of full-time studio jobs") and in museums ("particularly significant was a tendency to hire women with BAs to be secretaries and men with BAs for trainee programs which rapidly advanced them to more challenging positions).&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

The history of women in the profession also suggests that art education itself has benefited from the increased presence of professional women art historians, since women students sometimes found it necessary to "redo" an education in which only a male point of view had been provided given. [[Paula Harper]], "one of the first art historians to bring a feminist perspective to the study of painting and sculpture",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/arts/design/paula-hays-harper-feminist-art-historian-dies-at-81.html?_r=0|title=Paula Hays Harper, Art Historian, Is Dead at 81|last=Grady|first=Denise|date=25 June 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moira Roth shared the same experience of a "one-sided training", of feeling left out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Paula|year=1985|title=The First Feminist Art Program: A View from the 1980s|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=10|issue=4|pages=762–81|jstor=3174313|doi=10.1086/494182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination against "women in college and university art departments and art museums" was, in the early 1970s, the immediate cause for the foundation of the [[Women's Caucus for Art]] (see below).&lt;ref name=harris&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Ann Sutherland|year=1973|title=Women in College Art Departments and Museums|journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]|volume=32|issue=4|pages=417–19|jstor=775692|doi=10.2307/775692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statistical study of US employment among art faculties published in 1977, Sandra Packard notes that "in art departments women have been decreasing in number since the 1930's", and that the number of women in art faculties at institutes of higher education "decreas[ed] from 22% in 1963 to a low of 19.5% in 1974", and cites statistics suggesting that "although women are concentrated at the lower ranks in art faculties, they have more Ph.D. degrees than their male colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Analysis of Current Statistics and Trends as They Influence the Status and Future for Women in the Art Academe|first=Sandra|last=Packard|journal=[[Studies in Art Education]]|volume=18|issue=2|year=1977|pages=38–48|jstor=1319477|doi=10.2307/1319477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==
The [[Women's Caucus for Art]] (WCA), a caucus for woman art historians, artists, and curators was founded at the 1972 meeting of the [[College Art Association]] (CAA), but re-established itself as an independent organization in 1974 after the CAA told them they could not use the CAA name anymore. According to Judith Brodsky, the CAA was, at the time, very much a male-dominated organization; she notes, though, in a 1977 article that the Caucus is given space and time at the annual CAA conference and in the CAA's journal, ''Art Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brodsky|first=Judith K.|year=1977|title=The Women's Caucus for Art|journal=[[Women's Studies Newsletter]]|volume=5|issue=1/2|pages=13–15|jstor=40042430}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] was installed in 1979. The organization's objectives include "providing women with leadership opportunities and professional development" and "expanding networking and exhibition opportunities for women", and to that purpose publishes a newsletter, organizes sessions at conferences, and runs databases for "art and activism". In 2012 the WCA celebrated its 40th anniversary, and published a pamphlet for the annual awards ceremony that also includes a number of historical essays and reflections from the past presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalwca.org/LTA/LTA2012.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2014|publisher=Women's Caucus for Art|title=Women's Caucus for Art: 40th Anniversary Celebration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women art historians and feminist art theory==
Feminist scholars have argued that the role of women art historians is connected to the study of women (as artists and as subjects) by art historians.&lt;ref name=schleif/&gt; In 1974, Lise Vogel noted that there were few feminist art historians, and that women art historians in general seemed unwilling to ask "the more radical critiques" a feminist scholar should engage in.&lt;ref name="vogel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Lise|editor1-first=Arlene|editor1-last=Raven|editor2-first=Cassandra L.|editor2-last=Langer|editor3-first=Joanna|editor3-last=Frueh|title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GT9-qWARitsC&amp;pg=PA24|year=1991|publisher=IconEditions|isbn=9780064302166|pages=21–58|chapter=Fine Arts and Feminism: The Awakening Consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1998 essay, [[Corine Schleif]] argued that women and feminist scholars need to challenge the "Great Master" canon, and that they need to focus less on "style as evidence of authorship", seen as a traditionally masculine way of viewing the history of art, but rather on style as "one of many sites on the production of meaning". The topic of women scholars in art history is thus intricately connected with what scholars have called [[feminist art theory]];&lt;ref name=schleif&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUQF7T5nXBkC|title=Attending to Early Modern Women|editor1-first=Susan Dwyer|editor1-last=Amussen|editor2-first=Adele F.|editor2-last=Seeff|first=Corine |last=Schleif|chapter=The Role of Women in Challenging the Canon of 'Great Master' Art History|year=1998|publisher=U of Delaware P|isbn=9780874136500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry Freedman, for example, claims that "women art historians often interpret art that is about and by women differently than their male colleagues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Kerry|year=1994|title=About This Issue: The Social Reconstruction of Art Education|journal=[[Studies in Art Education]]|volume=35|issue=3|pages=131–34|jstor=1320214|doi=10.2307/1320214}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Carol Armstrong]] and [[Catherine de Zegher]], in ''Women artists at the millennium'' (2006), argue that by the 1980s many "women art history scholars" had begun to think of feminism as irrelevant to the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History|chapter=Art and Architecture: Art History|pages=142–43|last=Mathews|first=Patricia|editor1-first=Bonnie G.|editor1-last=Smith|year=2008|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780195148909}}&lt;/ref&gt;
