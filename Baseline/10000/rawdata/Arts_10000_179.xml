[[File:Human billboards Stockholm 2008-07-16 cropped.jpg|thumb|Advertising refers to any paid form of communication designed to create interest in or stimulate sales of products or services. Companies are constantly searching for novel media, such as these human billboards, to get their message out to potential consumers]]

'''Advertising management''' is a planned managerial process designed to oversee and control the various advertising activities involved in a program to communicate with a firm's target market and which is ultimately designed to influence the consumer's purchase decisions. Advertising is just one element in a company's [[promotional mix]] and as such, must be integrated with the overall marketing communications program. Advertising is, however, the most expensive of all the promotional elements and therefore must be managed with care and accountability.

[[Marketing|Marketers]] use different types of advertising. Brand advertising is defined as a non-personal communication message placed in a paid, mass medium designed to persuade target consumers of a product or service benefits in an effort to induce them to make a purchase. Corporate advertising refers to paid messages designed to that communicate the corporation's values in an effort to influence public opinion. Yet other types of  advertising such as not-for-profit advertising and political advertising present special challenges that require different strategies and approaches.
   
Advertising management is a complex process that involves making many layered decisions including the developing advertising strategies, setting an advertising budget, setting advertising objectives, determining the [[target market]], [[media strategy]] (which involves [[media planning]]), developing the message strategy and evaluating the overall effectiveness of the advertising effort.) Advertising management may also involve [[media buying]].

Advertising management is a complex process. However, at its simplest level, advertising management can be reduced to four key decision areas:

::'''Target audience definition''': Who do we want to talk to?

::'''Message (or creative) strategy''': What do we want to say to them?

::'''Media strategy''': How will we reach them?

::'''Measuring advertising effectiveness''': How do we know our messages were received in the form intended and with the desired outcomes?

== Advertising and advertising management: definitions==

Consumers tend to think that all forms of commercial promotion constitute advertising. However, in marketing and advertising, the term "advertising" has a very special meaning that reflects its status as a distinct type of promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Richards,J.I. and Curran, C.M., "Oracles on 'Advertising': Searching for a Definition," ''Journal of Advertising'', vol. 31. no. 2, 2002, pp 63-77, Online:http://120.114.52.240/~T093000279/repository/fetch/advertisig%20English%20-%20class%20material%201.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2009 newsstand Boston Massachusetts USA 3776403818.jpg|thumb|A key characteristic of advertising is that it utilises mass media channels such as newspapers, magazines, radio or TV to reach potential customers]]

The marketing and advertising literature has many different definitions of advertising, but it is possible to identify common elements or themes within most of these definitions. The [[American Marketing Association]] (AMA) defines advertising as "the placement of announcements and persuasive messages in time or space purchased in any of the mass media by business firms, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and individuals who seek to inform and/ or persuade members of a particular target market or audience about their products, services, organizations, or ideas".&lt;ref&gt;American Marketing Association (AMA), Online: https://www.ama.org/resources/Pages/Dictionary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' defines advertising as "the activity of attracting public attention to a product or business, as by paid announcements in the print, broadcast, or electronic media".&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary, 5th ed., 2015, Online: https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=advertising&lt;/ref&gt; Selected marketing scholars have defined advertising in the following terms: "any non-personal communication that is paid for by an identified sponsor, and involves either mass communication viz newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and other media (e.g., billboards, bus stop signage) or direct to-consumer communication via direct mail".&lt;ref&gt;Czinkota, M.R. et al. (2000), ''Marketing: Best Practices'', Orlando, FL: The Dryden Press&lt;/ref&gt; and "the element of the marketing communications mix that is non-personal, paid for by an identified sponsor, and disseminated through mass channels of communication to promote the adoption of goods, services, persons, or ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Bearden, W. O., Ingram, T.N. and LaForge, R.W., ''Marketing: Principles &amp; Perspectives'', 2d ed. New York: Irwin McGraw-Hill, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; One of the shortest definitions is that advertising is "a paid, mass-mediated attempt to persuade".&lt;ref&gt;O'Guinn, T. C., Allen, C.T. and Semenik, R.J., ''Advertising'', 2d ed., Cincinnati, Ohio, South-Western College Publishing, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Several common themes emerge in the various definitions of advertising:&lt;ref&gt;Tyagi,C.L. and Kumar, A.M, ''Advertising Management'', New Delhi, Atlantic Publishers, 2004, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 
:: * Firstly, advertising is a  ''paid '' form of communication and is therefore commercial in nature. 
:: * Secondly, advertising employs  ''non-personal channels '' (i.e. commercial mass media) which implies that it is directed at a mass audience rather than at an individual consumer and is a one-way communication mode where the sponsor sends messages, but recipients cannot respond or ask questions about the message content. 
:: * Thirdly, advertising has an  ''identified sponsor ''. 
In summary, given that advertising is paid, it is one of the many controllable elements in the marketing program. Advertising  is qualitatively different from publicity where the message sponsor is either not identified or ambiguously defined, and different to personal selling which occurs in real-time and involves some face-to-face contact between message sponsor and recipient allowing for two-way dialogue.
 
While [[advertising]] refers to the advertising message, per se, advertising management refers to the process of planning and executing an advertising campaign or campaigns; that is, it is a series of planned decisions that begins with [[market research]] continues through to setting advertising budgets, developing advertising objectives, executing the creative messages and follows up with efforts to measure the extent to which objectives were achieved and evaluate the cost-benefit of the overall advertising effort.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Definitions, http://marketinginformationcentre.ca/marketing_definitions_%28a-b%29.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising and organisational responsibilities==

[[File:CalvinKleinFairviewMall.JPG|thumb|Calvin Klein is one of a growing number of companies that uses an in-house agency for its advertising and promotion]]

In commercial organisations, advertising, along with other marketing communications activities, is the ultimate responsibility of the marketing department. Some companies outsource part or all of the work to specialists such as advertising agencies, creative design teams, web designers, media buyers, events management specialists or other relevant service providers. Another option is for a company to carry out most or all of the advertising functions within the marketing department in what is known as an ''in-house agency''.  By definition, an in-house agency is a "an advertising organization that is owned and operated by the corporation it serves".&lt;ref&gt;Silk, A.J. and Stiglin, M.M., "Build It, Buy It Or Both? Rethinking the Sourcing of Advertising Services," Working Paper no. 15-093, Harvard Business School&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to provide advertising services in support of its parent company’s business and marketing objectives. Well-known brands that currently use in-house agencies include Google,&lt;ref&gt;Burns, W., "In-House Agencies Have An In," ''Forbes'', 30 March 2013, Online: https://www.forbes.com/sites/willburns/2013/03/30/in-house-agencies-have-an-in/#7379e02267eb&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin Klein,&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, S., "The Media Business: Advertising-Leaving Calvin Klein For a Job at Limited," ''New York Times'',29 July 1998, Online: https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/29/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-leaving-calvin-klein-for-a-job-at-limited.html&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe, Dell, IBM, Kraft, Marriott and Wendy's.&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, B., "In-House Agencies Grow in Importance',  30 August, Association of National Advertisers, 2013 Online: https://www.ana.net/blogs/show/id/26944&lt;/ref&gt;

Both in-house agencies and outsourcing models have their own advantages and disadvantages. Outsourcing to an external agency allows marketers to obtain highly specialised strategic, research and planning skills, access to top creative talent and provides an independent perspective on marketing or advertising problems.&lt;ref&gt;Parekh, R., "Thinking of Pulling a CareerBuilder? Pros and Cons of Bringing an Account In-house", ''AdAge'', 18 May 2009.http://adage.com/article/agency-news/pros-cons-house-careerbuilder/136701/&lt;/ref&gt; In-house agencies deliver cost advantages, time efficiencies and afford marketers greater control over the advertising effort.&lt;ref&gt;Gianatasioh, D., "What house agency boom means to SMOs and Outside Shops," ''AdWeek,'' 3 December 2015, Online:  http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/what-house-agency-boom-means-cmos-and-outside-shops-168593&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, personnel who work within an in-house agency gain considerable creative experience which stays within the company. Recent trends suggest that the number of in-house agencies is rising.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson-Taylor, A., "The Rise Of The In-House Agency", ''CMO'', 17 April 2015, Online: http://www.cmo.com/features/articles/2015/4/17/the-rise-of-the-inhouse-agency.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The BOSS Group, Cella Consulting, In-House Creative Services Industry Report,LLC and InSource, April 2015, Online: http://www.creativeindustryreport.com/2015-IHCSIR-Report-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a company chooses to outsource advertising functions to an external agency or carry them out within the marketing department, marketers need a rich understanding of advertising principles in order to prepare effective advertising plans,  brief relevant agencies about their needs and expectations or develop their own creative solutions to marketing problems.

==Advertising's role in the promotional mix==
[[File:Customer journey with touchpoints English.png|thumb|Customers rely on different types of marketing communications at different stages of their purchase decision]]
The [[promotional mix]] refers to the specific combination of promotional methods used for a brand, product or family of products.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, Online: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/promotion-mix.html&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is best treated as a ''multiplier'' that can leverage other elements of the promotional mix and marketing program.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J.P., ''How Advertising Works: The Role of Research, Thousand Oaks, CA,1998, pp 25-30&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, advertising must be considered as part of a broader marketing and promotional program.

The promotional mix includes a variety of tools such as:

[[File:Sales promotion 3x1 Tigros.JPG|thumb|Sales promotion includes a variety of activities such as special price offers designed to stimulate sales]]

:: '''[[Advertising]]''': messages paid for by those who send them and intended to inform or influence people who receive them&lt;ref&gt;Advertising Association of United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;
:: '''[[Branded content|Branded entertainment]]''': the dedicated production of content designed to display corporate or branded messages in an entertaining format&lt;ref&gt;Lehu, J-M, ''Branded Entertainment: Product Placement &amp; Brand Strategy in the Entertainment Business,'' Kogan Page, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
:: '''[[Public relations]] (PR)''': the practice of maintaining goodwill between an organisation and its publics&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, Online: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/public-relations.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:: '''[[Personal selling]]''': face-to-face selling in which a seller attempts to persuade a buyer to make a purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/personal-selling.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
:: '''[[Direct marketing]]''': contacting and influencing carefully chosen prospects with means such as telemarketing and direct mail&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/direct-marketing.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
::'''[[Sponsorship]]''': the act of providing money for a television or radio program, website, sports event, or other activity usually in exchange for advertising or other form of promotion&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Dictionary, http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/sponsorship&lt;/ref&gt;
::'''[[Product placement]]''':  the practice of supplying a product or service for display in feature films or television programs&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, Online:http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product-placement.html&lt;/ref&gt;
::'''[[Sales promotion]]''' / merchandising: activities designed to stimulate sales normally at the point-of-sale; includes retail displays, product sampling, special price offers, shelf talkers, contests, give-aways, promotional items, competitions and other methods&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/merchandising.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:: '''[[Event-driven marketing|Event marketing]]''': a planned activity of designing or developing a themed activity, occasion, display, or exhibit (such as a sporting event, music festival, fair, or concert) to promote a product, cause, or organization.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary,http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/event-marketing.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:: '''[[Exhibition]]s/trade shows''': events or shows (e.g. fashion shows, agricultural shows) where companies can display their wares or services&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, Online: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/trade-fair.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VogueThomso02.jpg|thumb|The Vogue Fashion Show is a special event designed to promote top designers' seasonal collections]]

Advertising is just one of many elements that comprise the promotional mix. When marketers communicate with target markets across a broad range of different promotional types and media, the potential for contradictory or mixed messages is very real.  Accordingly, it is important that advertising is treated as part of a total marketing communications program and that steps are taken to ensure that it is integrated with all other marketing communications, so that all communications messages speak with a 'single voice'. The process of ensuring message consistency across the entire marketing communications program is known as ''[[integrated marketing communications]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated Marketing communications perspective,'' 6th ed., New York, McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2004. Note that Belch and Belch's definition is based on that provided by the Association of National Advertisers.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2007 HKTDC Food Expo.jpg|thumb|Mounting a display at a trade-fair or exhibition, such as the Hong Kong Food Show, is part of a company's total promotional mix]]

Marketers need to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the elements in the promotional mix in order to select the right blend for a given situation. For instance, public relations allows for high credibility message delivery with relatively low costs, while advertising permits message repetition. Advertising is especially useful for creating awareness, but personal channels come into play for the actual purchase. The "right" promotional mix should consider both message impact and message consistency.&lt;ref&gt;Thorson,E. and Moore, J., ''Integrated Communication: Synergy of Persuasive Voices,'' New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, decision-makers need to recognise that consumers rely on different information sources at different stages of the purchase decision process. Therefore, advertising and other elements of the promotional campaign must be integrated to ensure that consumers receive the right messages via the right channels at the right time, depending on the consumer's readiness to buy.

In terms of integrated communications, the literature identifies different types of integration: (1) ''Image integration'' refers to messages that have a consistent look and feel, regardless of the medium; (2) ''Functional integration'' refers to capacity of different promotional tools to complement each other and deliver a unified, coherent message; (3) ''Coordinated integration'' refers to the ways that different internal and external agencies (e.g. web designers, advertising agencies, PR consultants) coordinate to provide a consistent message; (4) ''Stakeholder integration'' refers to the way that all stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, customers and others cooperate to communicate a shared understanding of the company's key messages and values and (5) ''Relationship integration'' refers to the way that communications professionals contribute to the company's overall corporate goals and quality management.&lt;ref&gt;Mudzanani, T., "A review and analysis of the role of integrated marketing communication message typology in the development of communication strategies," African Journal of Marketing Management, Vol. 7, no 8, 2015, pp. 90-97&lt;/ref&gt;

On the surface, integrated marketing communications appear to be simple common sense. Yet, a survey of brand advertisers carried out by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) revealed that while 67 per cent of marketers engage in integrated marketing communications, just one third are satisfied with their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Association of National Advertisers (US), "ANA Survey Reveals Most Integrated Marketing Communications Programs Need Improvement,"  14 June 2006 Online: http://www.ana.net/content/show/id/402&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, integrating communications messages across a broad range of promotional formats and media channels is very difficult to achieve.

== Theories of advertising effects==

[[File:Piccadilly Circus, London - at night - Lyca Mobile and Hyundai (6438384381).jpg|thumb|Advertising messages are all around us, yet the mechanism which leads from exposure to brand advertising through to sales is not entirely clear]]

Studies have repeatedly demonstrated a clear association between advertising and sales response.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J.P., ''The Ultimate Secrets of Advertising'', Sage, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the exact process that leads from the consumer of being exposed to an advertising message through to a purchase or behavioral response is not entirely clear. Noting the difficulties in explaining how advertising works, one theorist wrote, "Only the brave or ignorant...can say exactly what advertising does in the market place."&lt;ref&gt;Corkindale, D., "Setting objectives for advertising ", ''European Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 10, No. 3, 1976 pp.109–126&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising and marketing literature suggests a variety of different models to explain how advertising works. These models are not competing theories, but rather explanations of how advertising persuades or influences different types of consumers in different purchase contexts. In a seminal paper, Vankratsas and Ambler surveyed more than 250 papers to develop a typology of advertising models. They identified four broad classes of model: ''cognitive information models'', ''pure affect models'', ''hierarchy of effect models'', ''integrative models'' and ''hierarchy-free models''.&lt;ref&gt;Vakratsas, D. and Ambler, T., "How advertising works: What do we really know?" ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 63 no. 1; 1999, pp 26 -47 Online: http://fabriken.akestamholst.se/akestamholst/files/how_advertising_works&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive information models ===

[[File:Auckland Yellow pages.jpg|thumb|A directory such as ''Yellow Pages'' can eliminate the need for extensive store visits and the need to recall brand names]]
Advertising researchers have a long-standing interest in understanding both the degree and type of cognitive elaboration that occurs when consumers are exposed to persuasive messages.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, K.S. and Punj, G.N., "Understanding the Role of Idiosyncratic Thinking in Brand Attitude Formation: The Dual Interference Model," ''Journal of Advertising,''Vol. 36, No. 1 (Spring, 2007), pp 7-20, Stable URL: 
https://www.jstor.org/stable/20460766&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive information models assume that consumers are rational decision-makers and that advertising provides consumers with information [[utility]] by reducing the need to search for other information about a brand.  For example, an advertisement in the ''Yellow Pages'' or an online directory means that the consumer does not have to travel from store to store in search of a product or service. Consumers process this information at a cognitive level before forming an attitude to the brand and purchase intent. A cognition is any thought that surfaces during the elaboration of the information. Cognitive information models are also known as the ''central route to persuasion''.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T. and Petty, R.E., "The Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion", in ''Advances in Consumer Research'', Volume 11, eds. Thomas C. Kinnear (ed), Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research, pp 673-675, http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/6329/volumes/v11/NA-11&lt;/ref&gt;

A common theme in cognitive information models is that the net favourability of cognitive responses has a direct influence on attitude strength.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, K.S. and Punj, G.N., "Understanding the Role of Idiosyncratic Thinking in Brand Attitude Formation: The Dual Interference Model," ''Journal of Advertising,''Vol. 36, No. 1 (Spring, 2007), p. 7, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20460766&lt;/ref&gt; In the cognitive information models, the general path to persuasion is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, S.B. and Lutz, R.J., "An Empirical Examination of the Structural Antecedents of Attitude toward the Ad in an Advertising Pretesting Context," ''Journal of Marketing'' Vol. 53, No. 2, 1989, pp. 48-65&lt;/ref&gt;

:: Ad cognition→ [[Attitude-toward-the-ad models|Attitude to ad]] (A&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) → Brand cognition → Attitude to brand(A&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) →Purchase Intention (PI)

Theoretical works, combined with empirical studies, suggest that advertising information is more useful for experience goods (experiential services) than for search goods (tangible products).&lt;ref&gt;Bharadwaj, S.G., Varadarajan, P.R. and Fahy,J., "Sustainable competitive advantage in service industries: a conceptual model and research propositions," ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 57, no. 3, 1993, pp 83-94&lt;/ref&gt; Research studies also suggest that consumers who are involved in the purchase decision are more likely to actively seek out product information and actively process advertising messages while low-involvement consumers are more likely to respond at an emotional level.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R. E, Cacioppo, J. T., and Schumann, D., "Central and Peripheral Routes to Advertising Effectiveness: The Moderating Role of Involvement," ''Journal of Consumer Research'', vol 10, 1983, 135-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pure affect models ===

Pure affect models suggest that consumers shape their preferences to a brand based on the feelings and attitudes elicited by exposure to an advertising message. When consumers view an advertisement, they not only develop attitudes towards the advertisement and the advertiser, but also develop feelings and beliefs about the brand being advertised.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, C.E., ''The Handbook of Communication and Corporate Reputation'', Chichester, Sussex, Wiley, 2013, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure affect models help to explain the consumer's emotional responses to advertising and brands. These models suggest that simple exposure is to a brand is sufficient to generate purchase intention. Exposure in the form of advertising messages leads to an attitude to the advertisement (A&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) which transfers to the attitude to the brand (A&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;)without any further cognitive processing. Exposure it not restricted to physical contact; rather it can refer to any brand-related contact such as advertising, promotion or virtual brands on websites.&lt;ref&gt;Walser, M., ''Brand Strength: Building and Testing Models Based on Experiential Information,'' Springer, 2004, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

In pure affect models, the path to communication effectiveness is represented by the following:

::::Attitude to Ad (A&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) →   Attitude to Brand (A&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) → Purchase Intention (PI).&lt;ref&gt;Morris, J.F., Woo, C.M., Geason, J.A. and Kim, J.Y., "The Power of Affect: Predicting Intention," ''Journal of Advertising'', May–June, 2002, pp 7-17&lt;/ref&gt;

This path is also known as the ''peripheral route to persuasion''.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., Chuan-Feng, K. and Rodriguez, R. "Central and peripheral routes to persuasion: An individual difference perspective," ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', Vol 51, No. 5, 1986, pp 1032-1043. https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.51.5.1032&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research in the pure affect sphere suggests that advertising messages do not need to be informative to be effective, however consumers must like the advertising execution for the message to be effective. In addition, ad liking and advertiser credibility, may be especially important for corporate image advertising (compared to product-related advertising).&lt;ref&gt;I. López, S. Ruiz, "Explaining website effectiveness: The hedonic–utilitarian dual-mediation hypothesis," ''Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,'' vol. 10, 2011, pp 49–58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hierarchy of effects models===

{{see also|DAGMAR marketing|l1=DAGMAR|AIDA (marketing)|l2=AIDA}}
[[File:Generalised hierarcy of effects sequence.jpg|thumb|Generalised hierarchy of effects sequence (after Lavidge)]]
Hierarchical models are linear sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive and affective stages culminating in the purchase decision. The common theme among these models is that advertising operates as a stimulus and the purchase decision is a response. A number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including Lavidge's hierarchy of effects, [[DAGMAR marketing|DAGMAR]] and [[AIDA (marketing)|AIDA]] and other variants. Some authors have argued that, for advertising purposes, the hierarchical models have dominated advertising theory,&lt;ref&gt;O’Shaughnessy, J.,  ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and that, of these models, the AIDA model is one of the most widely applied.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, D. and Terlutter, R., "The Role of Lifestyle and Personality in Explaining Attitude to the Ad," in ''Branding and Advertising'', Flemming Hansen, Lars Bech Christensen (eds), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIDA model proposes that advertising messages need to accomplish a number of tasks designed to move the consumer through a series of sequential steps from [[brand awareness]] through to action (purchase and consumption).
 
:: '''Awareness''' –  The consumer becomes aware of a category, product or brand (usually through advertising)
:::::::::::↓
:: '''Interest'''  –  The consumer becomes interested by considering the brand's fit with the consumer's lifestyle
:::::::::::↓
:: '''Desire'''     –  The consumer develops a favorable (or unfavorable) disposition towards the brand
:::::::::::↓
:: '''Action''' –  The consumer forms a purchase intention or actually makes a purchase
                                                                                                        
As consumers move through the hierarchy of effects they pass through both a cognitive processing stage and an affective processing stage before any action occurs. Thus the hierarchy of effects models all include Cognition (C)- Affect (A)- Behaviour (B) as the core steps in the underlying behavioral sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J.A. ''Marketing Management,'' Homewood, Ill. 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying behavioral sequence for all hierarchy models is as follows:

: Cognition (Awareness/learning) → Affect (Feeling/ interest/ desire)→ Behavior (Action e.g. purchase/ consumption/ usage/ sharing information)&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J. A. in: P. E. Earl and S. Kemp (eds.), ''The Elgar Companion to Consumer Research and Economic Psychology,'' Cheltenham 1999, pp 310-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

The literature offers numerous variations on the basic path to persuasion. The basic AIDA model is one of the longest serving models. Contemporary hierarchical models often modify or expand the basic AIDA model, resulting in additional steps, however, all follow the basic sequence which includes Cognition- Affect- Behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, T.E., "The Development of the Hierarchy of Effects: An Historical Perspective," '' Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising'' vol. 10, no. 2, 1987, pp. 251–295&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these newer models have been adapted to accommodate consumer's digital media habits.

[[File:The Purchase Funnel.jpg|thumb|The Purchase Funnel indicates that awareness is a necessary precondition for purchase]]

All hierarchical models indicate that brand awareness is a necessary precondition to brand attitude, brand preference or brand purchase intention. The process of moving consumers from purchase intention to actual sales is known as ''conversion.'' While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness, brand attitude and purchase intent, it usually requires support from other elements in the promotion mix and the marketing program to convert purchase intent into an actual sale.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M., Hughes, A., Chitty, B., Marshall, G. and Stuart, E., ''Marketing: Real People, Real Choices,''pp 363-364&lt;/ref&gt; Many different techniques can be used to convert interest into sales including special price offers, special promotional offers, attractive trade-in terms, guarantees or a strong call-to-action as part of the advertising message.

In order to penetrate markets, it is essential that high levels of awareness are created as early as possible in a [[Product life-cycle management (marketing)|product or brand life-cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Chitty, W., Baker, N. and Shimp, T.A., ''Integrated Marketing Communications'', Pacific Rim ed., Thomson, 2005, pp 13-17&lt;/ref&gt; Hierarchical models provide marketers and advertisers with basic insights about the nature of the target audience, the optimal message and media strategy indicated at different junctures throughout a product's life cycle. For new products, the main advertising objective should be to create awareness with a broad cross-section of the potential market as quickly as practical. When the desired levels of awareness have been attained, the promotional effort should shift to stimulating interest, desire or conviction. The number of potential purchasers decreases as the product moves through the natural sales cycle in an effect likened to a [[Purchase funnel|funnel]]. Early in the campaign, the marketers should attempt to reach as many potential buyers as possible with high impact messages. Later in the cycle, and as the number of prospects becomes smaller, the marketer can employ more tightly targeted promotional activities such as personal selling, direct mail and email directed at those individuals or sub-segments more likely to exhibit a genuine interest in the product or brand.

===Integrative models===

Integrative models assume that consumers process advertising information via two paths – both cognitive (thinking) and affective (feeling) simultaneously. These models seek to combine the type of purchase with the consumer's dominant mode of processing.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon,K., Laczniak, R.N., Muehling, D.D. and Reece, B.B., "A Revised Model of Advertising Processing: Extending the Dual Mediation Hypothesis," ''Journal of Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising,'' Vol. 17, no. 2, 1995, pp 53-67&lt;/ref&gt; Integrative models are based on research findings indicating that congruence between personality and the way a persuasive message is framed. That is, aligning the message framing with the recipient's personality profile may play an important role in ensuring the success of that message. In a recent experiment, five advertisements (each designed to target one of the five personality traits) were constructed for a single product. Findings suggest that advertisements were evaluated more positively when they aligned with participants' motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirsh | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Kang | first2 = S. K. | last3 = Bodenhausen | first3 = G. V. | year = 2012 | title = Personalized persuasion: Tailoring persuasive appeals to recipient personality traits | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 578–581 | doi=10.1177/0956797611436349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tailoring persuasive messages to the personality traits of the targeted audience can be an effective way of enhancing the message's impact.

There are many integrative frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;Maclnnis, D.J. and Jaworski, B.J. "Information Processing from Advertisements: Toward an integrative framework," ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 53, October, 1989 pp 1 -23&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the more widely used models are the grids developed by Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB) (see below) and another devised by Rossiter and Percy, and which is an extension of the FCB approach.&lt;ref&gt;Ambler, T. and Vakratsas, D., "The Pursuit of Advertising Theory," ''Business Strategy Review'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J.R., Percy, L. and Donovan, R.J.,  "A Better Advertising Planning Grid," ''Journal of Advertising Research'', Vol. 31 (October/November), 1991, pp 11-21&lt;/ref&gt; These planning grids are very popular with advertising practitioners because of their ease of application.&lt;ref&gt;Clow, K. E.; Roy, D. P.; and L. B. Hershey (2002), "A Comparison of the Incidence of Advertising Strategies in Business-related Magazines: Service Versus Goods," ''Service Marketing Quarterly,'' Vol. 23, No. 4, 65-80; Wang L. and Praet C., "Message Strategy Typologies: A Review, Integration, and Empirical Validation in China," In: Verlegh P., Voorveld H., Eisend M. (eds), ''Advances in Advertising Research,'' Vol. VI, European Advertising Academy. Springer Gabler, Wiesbaden, 2016,, pp 201-213&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB) planning grid====

The FCB planning grid was developed by Richard Vaughan, who was the Senior Vice President at advertising agency, Foote, Cone and Belding, in the 1980s. The planning grid has two dimensions, involvement and information processing. Each dimension has two values, representing extremes of a continuum, specifically involvement (high/low) and information processing (thinking/feeling). These form a 2 X 2 matrix with four cells representing the different types of advertising effects.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, R., "How Advertising Works: a Planning Model," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 20 no. 5, pp 27-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCB planning grid gives rise to a number of implications for advertising and media strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, R., "How Advertising Works: A Planning Model Revisited," ''Journal of Advertising Research'', 26 (January/February), 1986, pp 27-30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coupé Jaguar XKR (X150) ventral.jpg|thumb|An expensive car is a high-involvement/ rational purchase (i.e., FCB Quadarant 1)]]

''Quadrant 1: ''High-involvement/ rational purchases: In the first quadrant consumers learn about a product through advertising after which they develop a favourable (or unfavourable) disposition to the product which may or may not culminate in a purchase. This approach is considered optimal for advertising high ticket items such as cars and household furniture. When this is the dominant approach to purchasing, advertising messages should be information-rich and media strategy should be weighted towards media such as magazines and newspapers capable of delivering long-copy advertising.

''Quadrant 2'': High-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the second quadrant, audiences exhibit an emotional response to advertisements which transfers to products. This approach is used for products such as jewellery, expensive perfumes and designer fashion where consumers are emotionally involved in the purchase. When this mode of purchasing is evident, advertising should be designed to create a strong brand image and media should be selected to support the relevant image. For example, magazines such as ''Vogue'' can help to create an up-market image.

[[File:Butterfly on cupcake at the 2009 Yelp Cupcake Crawl.jpg|thumb|Impulse purchases are low-involvement/ emotional purchase items that make consumers feel good (i.e., FCB Quadrant 4)]]

''Quadrant 3'': Low-involvement/ rational purchases: The third quadrant represents routine low-involvement purchases evident for many packaged goods such as detergents, tissues and other consumable household items. Consumers make habitual purchases, and after consumption the benefit of using the brand is reinforced which ideally results in long-term brand loyalty (re-purchase). Given that this is a rational purchase, consumers need to be informed or reminded of the product's benefits. Advertising messages should encourage repeat purchasing and brand loyalty while media strategy should be weighted towards media that can deliver high frequency required for reminder campaigns such as TV, radio and sales promotion.

''Quadrant 4'': Low-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the final quadrant, consumers make low-involvement, relatively inexpensive purchases that make them feel good. Impulse purchases and convenience goods fall into this category. The purchase leads to feelings of satisfaction which, in turn, reinforces the purchase behavior. When this approach is the dominant purchase mode, advertising messages should "congratulate" customers on their purchase choice and the media strategy should be weighted towards options that reach customers when they are close to the point-of-purchase such as billboards, sales promotion and point-of-sale displays. Examples of this approach include "McDonald's – You Deserve a Break Today" and "L'Oreal- Because You're Worth It".

===Hierarchy-free models===

Many authors have treated reason (rational processes) and emotion (affective processes) as entirely independent.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, A., ''Emotion and Reason in Consumer Behavior,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2011, pp 26-38&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, other researchers have argued that both reason and emotion can be employed simultaneously, to process advertising information. Hierarchy-free models draw on evidence from psychology and [[consumer neuroscience]] which suggest that consumers process information via different pathways rather than in any linear/ sequential manner. Thus, hierarchy-free models do not employ any fixed processing sequence. These models treat advertising as part of the brand totality.  Some hierarchy-free models treat brands as 'myth' and advertising as 'myth-making' while other models seek to tap into the consumer's memories of pleasant consumption experiences (e.g. the MAC- Memory-Affect-Cognition model).&lt;ref&gt;Ambler, T., ''Intermediate Advertising Effects: The MAC Model'', Working Paper No 96-906, Centre for Marketing, London Business School, May 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Hierarchy-free models are of increasing interest to academics and practitioners because they are more customer-centric and allow for the possibility of consumer co-creation of value.&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C., "What Can A Service Logic Offer Marketing Theory?" in Lusch, R.F. and Vargo, S.L., ''The Service-Dominant Logic of Marketing: Dialogue, Debate and Directions'', New York, M E Sharpe, 2006, pp 354-364&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising planning ==

Advertising planning does not occur in a vacuum. Advertising objectives are derived from marketing objectives.  Therefore, the first step in any advertising planning is to review to the objectives as set out in the marketing plan. This is designed to ensure that all promotional efforts, including advertising, are working towards achieving both short-term and long-term corporate  and marketing goals and align with the company's values and vision.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., Elliott, R.H. and Rosenbaum-Elliott, R., ''Strategic Advertising Management'', 5th ed., Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Review the marketing plan ===

A review of the marketing plan can be a relatively simple process or it can involve a formal review, known as an ''audit''. The review or audit might consider such issues as prior marketing communications activity, an evaluation of what has been effective in the past, whether new market research studies are warranted, an outline of competitive advertising activity and a review of budgetary considerations.

The marketing plan can be expected to provide information about the company's long and short-term goals, competitive rivalry, a description of the target market, product(s) offered, positioning strategy, pricing strategy, distribution strategy and other promotional programs.  All of this information has potential implications for developing the advertising program. The advertiser must study the marketing plan carefully and determine how to translate the marketing objectives into an advertising program. Each [[advertising campaign]] is unique, so that the review requires a great deal of analysis as well as judgement.

====Overall communications objectives ====

Communications objectives are derived from marketing objectives. However, communications objectives must be framed in terms of communications effects. For example, a company's short-term marketing objective might be to increase sales response for a given brand. However, this objective would require that a large number of consumers are aware of the brand and are favourably disposed towards it. Furthermore, consumers' purchase intentions may be dependent on other marketing activities such as access, price, the ability to  trial the brand prior to final purchase and other marketing activities. It is unfair to hold marketing communications accountable for all sales when it is only one element in the total marketing effort.&lt;ref&gt;O'Guinn, T., Allen,C., and Semenik, R.J., ''Advertising and Integrated Brand Promotion,'' Mason, Ohio, South-Western Cengage, 2009, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness and interest in a brand, it is less effective at turning that awareness and interest into actual sales. To convert interest into sales, different promotional tools such as personal selling or sales promotion may be more useful. Many authors caution against using sales or market share objectives for marketing communications or advertising purposes.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Shanklin, John K. Ryans ''Essentials of Marketing High Technology,'' Lexington Books, 1987 p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Communications objectives might include such things as to:
* increase purchase
* encourage trial
* encourage loyalty 
* position or re-position a brand 
* educate customers

These will need to be translated into advertising objectives.

==== Target market and target audience ====

[[File:Target Audience and Target market.jpg|thumb|Relationship between target market and target audience]]

The review should take note of the overall target market. However, this does not necessarily mean that the advertising campaign will be directed at the total target market. Marketers and advertisers make a distinction between the ''target audience'' for an advertising message and the ''target market'' for a product or brand.&lt;ref&gt;Copulsky, J.R. and  Wolf,M.J. "Relationship Marketing: Positioning for the Future", ''Journal of Business Strategy'', Vol. 11 no. 4, 1990, pp 16 – 20&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, the target audience is  the intended audience for a given advertisement or message in a publication or broadcast medium, while the target market consists of all existing and potential consumers of a product, service or brand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing: An Introduction|last=Kotler|first=Philip|last2=Armstrong|first2=Gary|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2005|isbn=|location=New Jersey|pages=-}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies often develop different advertising messages and media strategies to reach different target audiences. For example, McDonald's Restaurants uses the anthropomorphic brand characters, Ronald McDonald and Hamburgler, in its advertising directed at children who are important brand-choice influencers. However, for adult target audience members, McDonald's uses messages that emphasise convenience and quality. Thus the target audience for a given advertising message may comprise only a subset of the total market as defined in the marketing plan. Careful perusal of the marketing plan will assist marketers in the process of defining the optimal target audiences for specific advertising objectives.

====Push vs pull strategy ====

The communications objectives will, at least in part, depend on whether the marketer is using a push or pull strategy. In a ''push strategy'', the marketer advertises intensively with retailers and wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a ''pull strategy'', the marketer advertises directly to consumers hoping that they will put pressure on retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, T.P., Lee, H.L. and Neale., J. J., ''The Practice of Supply Chain Management,'' Springer, 2003, {{ISBN|0-387-24099-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a push strategy the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use consumer-oriented advertising and sales promotions while the media mix would be weighted towards mass-market media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;Varey,E., ''Marketing Communication: A Critical Introduction,''Routledge, 2002, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

===Devising advertising objectives ===
{{See also|DAGMAR marketing|l1=DAGMAR|SMART criteria}}

Setting advertising objectives provides the framework for the entire advertising plan.  Therefore, it is important to specify precisely what is to be achieved and outline how advertising will be evaluated. Advertising objectives should be '''S'''pecific, '''M'''easurable, '''A'''chievable and '''T'''ime-dependent (SMART).&lt;ref&gt;Koekemoer,L. and Bird, S.,''Marketing Communications,'' Lansdowne, South Africa, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  Any statement of advertising objectives must include measurement benchmarks – that is the norms against which advertising effectiveness will be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, M., ''Advertising Management: Concepts and Cases'', New Delhi, McGraw-Hill, 2008, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first approaches to setting communications-oriented objectives was the DAGMAR approach ('''D'''efining '''A'''dvertising '''G'''oals for '''M'''easured '''A'''dvertising '''R'''esults) developed in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Colley, R.H., ''Defining Advertising Goals,'' New York, American Association of National Advertisers (AANA), 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J., ''Marketing Communications,'' London, Thomson Learning, pp 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; While memorable, the DAGMAR approach fails to provide concrete guidance on how to link advertising objectives with communications effects.&lt;ref&gt;Batra, R., Myers, J.G and Aaker, D.A., ''Advertising Management,'' 5th ed., India, Kindersley, pp 144-146&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to set realistic and achievable advertising objectives, most advertisers try to link advertising or communications objectives with the communications effects. Rossiter and Bellman have argued that, for advertising purposes, five communications effects should be considered, namely:&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J and Bellman, S., ''Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications'', Pearson Australia, 2005, pp 103-120&lt;/ref&gt;
: '''1. Category Need:''' The consumer's acceptance that the category (the product or service) is necessary to satisfy some need
: '''2. Brand awareness (brand recognition and brand recall):'''  The consumer's ability to recognise a brand or to recall a brand name from memory
: '''3. Brand preference (or brand attitude):'''  The extent to which a consumer will choose one brand over other competing brands in the category
: '''4. Brand action intention (purchase intent):'''  The consumer's self instruction to purchase a given brand
: '''5. Purchase facilitation:'''  The extent to which the consumer knows how and where to purchase the brand

|}

For many purchases, category need and purchase facilitation will be present in the customer's mind and can be omitted from the advertising objectives. However, for some purchases, the customer may not be aware of the product category or may not know how to access it, in which case these objectives will need to be addressed in the communications objectives. Brand awareness, brand preference and purchase intention are almost always included as advertising objectives.

===Setting advertising budgets ===

A firm's advertising budget is a sub-set of its overall budget. For many firms, the cost of advertising is one of the largest expenses, second only to wages and salaries.  Advertising expenditure varies enormously according to firm size, market coverage, managerial expectations and even managerial style. Procter and Gamble, the top US advertiser, spent US$4.3 billion in 2015 on national media&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B., "How Nation's Top 200 Marketers Are Honing Digital Strategies," Adage, 27 June 2016, &lt;Online:http://adage.com/article/advertising/top-200-u-s-advertisers-spend-smarter/304625&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (exclusive of agency fees and production costs) while a small local advertiser might spend just a few thousand dollars in the same period.

The size of the budget has implications for the promotional mix, the media mix and market coverage. As a generalisation, very large budgets are required to sustain national television campaigns. Advertisers with tight budgets may forced to use less effective media alternatives. However, even advertisers with small budgets may be able to incorporate expensive main media, by focusing on narrow geographic markets, buying spots in non-peak time periods and carefully managing advertising schedules.&lt;ref&gt;George, L. J., ''The Blessings of Paid Advertising: DISCOVER The Industry Expert Tips For Maximizing ROI On A Tight Advertising Budget,'' Lasgeorges Books, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of different methods are used to develop the advertising (and/or marketing communications) budget. The most commonly used methods are: percentage-of-sales, objective and task, competitive parity method, market share method, unit sales method, all available funds method and the affordable method.&lt;ref&gt;Shim, J.K. and Siegel, J.G. ''Marketing: Budgeting for Sales, Advertising, and Distribution,'' Wiley, 2015, DOI: 10.1002/9781118106754.ch1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Percentage-of-sales method====

Using the percentage-of-sales method, the advertiser allocates a fixed percentage (say 5% or 10%) of forecast sales value to  the advertising budget. This method is predicated on the assumption that advertising causes future sales volume.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary Online, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/percentage-of-sales-method.html&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of sales method is the easiest method to use and for this reason remains one of the most widely used methods for setting budgets.

A major problem with the %-of-sales method is that there is no consensus about the percentage value to apply. Some companies use industry averages as a guide to set their marcomms budget. The following table, based on industry averages, shows that the % value can vary from around 20% of sales to less than 1 percent.

====Objective and task method====

The objective and task method is the most rational and defensible of all budgeting methods. In this method, the advertiser determines the advertising objectives and then defines specific, measurable communication tasks that will need to be undertaken to achieve the desired objectives. Cost estimates are developed for each communication task in order to arrive at a total budget estimate.&lt;ref&gt;Shimp, T., ''Advertising, Promotion, and Other Aspects of Integrated Marketing Communications'', 7th ed., Mason, OH, Thomson South-Western, 2007 pp 160-161&lt;/ref&gt; This method is time-consuming and complex, and as a consequence has  been less widely used in practice, however, recent research suggests that more marketers are taking up this approach.&lt;ref&gt;West, D. and Prendergast, G.P., "Advertising and promotions budgeting and the role of risk", ''European Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 43, no. 11/12, 2009, pp.1457 – 1476&lt;/ref&gt;

====Competitive parity method====

The competitive parity method allocates the advertising or promotional budget based on competitive spending for comparable activities. This approach is a defensive strategy used to protect a brand market position.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Dictionary'', Online: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/competitive-parity.html&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes that rival firms have similar objectives and is widely used in highly competitive markets.  The main criticism of this method is that it assumes competitors know what they are doing in relation to advertising expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;Parente, D. and Strausbaugh-Hutchinson, K., ''Advertising Campaign Strategy: A Guide to Marketing Communication Plans,'' 5th ed., Boston, MA, Cengage, 2015
p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several approaches to using the competitive parity method:&lt;ref&gt;C.L. Tyagi, Arun Kumar ''Advertising Management'' New Delhi, Atlantic Publishers, 2004, pp 219-220&lt;/ref&gt;

: a) Allocate the same budget on advertising as a key rival;
: b) Allocate the budget based on the industry average expenditure levels;
: c) Allocate a similar percentage-of-sales as a key competitor;
: d) Allocate the same percentage-of-sales on advertising as the industry average;
: e) Use competitive activity as a benchmark to which sums are added or subtracted based on managerial judgement.

Competitive parity requires a detailed understanding of competitor's expenditure in key areas. Market intelligence used to inform this approach can be obtained by consulting company annual reports and also from commercial research service providers such as Nielsen's AdEx.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Advertising Expenditure, Online: http://www.nielsen.com/my/en/solutions/measurement/advertising-expenditure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods used to set advertising and promotional budgets include the ''market share method'', ''unit sales method'', ''all available funds method'', ''affordable method'', ''marginal analysis'' and others. Contemporary budgeting rarely relies on a single method, but instead uses a combination of methods to guide the marketer in determining the optimal expenditure levels.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, P.W. and West, D.C., "A Fresh View of the Advertising Budget Process," Chapter 20 in ''The SAGE Handbook of Advertising,'' Gerard J. Tellis and Tim Ambler (eds), Sage, 2007, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781848607897.n20&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Devising the creative strategy===

The creative strategy is also known as the ''message strategy.'' The creative strategy explains how the advertising campaign will address the advertising objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/creative-strategy.html&lt;/ref&gt; Developing the creative strategy typically begins by identifying the big idea (also known as the ''creative concept'' that will establish the intended product position in the minds of the customer. Another way of thinking about the creative concept is that it refers to the one thing that will make consumers respond. The creative concept should show how the product benefit meets the customer's needs or expectations in a unique way.&lt;ref&gt;du Plessis, D.F., ''Introduction to Public Relations and Advertising,'' p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

Laskey et al. developed a typology of nine creative strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, K.S., "From Producers to Consumers: Engagement through User-generated Advertising Contests", ''Handbook of Research on Digital Media and Advertising: User Generated Consumption,'' Easton, M. S., Daugherty, T. and Burns, N.M., (eds), IGI Global, Information Science Reference, pp 631- 649&lt;/ref&gt; Initially  devised for television, this typology has been widely adopted for other media including print media&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, A., "Creative Strategy and Magazine Advertising Readership: A Pilot Study, " in ''Developments in Marketing Science,'' 2014, pp 236-237 Date: 08 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and social media.&lt;ref&gt;Coursaris, C, van Osch, and Brooks, B., "Social Media Marketing on Twitter: An Investigation of the Involvement-Messaging Engagement Link," in ''HCI in Business: First International Conference'', Fui-Hoon Nah, F. (ed), Springer, 2014, pp 155-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Laskey, Day and Crask's typology first identifies two broad classes of creative strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Laskey, H. A., Day, E. and Crask, M.R., "Typology of Main Message Strategies," ''Journal of Advertising,'' vol. 18, no. 1, 1989, pp 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

: * Informational: rational appeals that typically provide information about the brand's benefits
: * Transformational: emotional appeals that assist consumers to imagine an aspirational lifestyle

Informational appeals typically involve factual claims that list the product's benefits in a straightforward manner and are more likely to be used with high involvement goods. Transformational appeals play on emotions and are designed to transform the consumer's perceptions of themselves or of the product. Transformational appeals are more likely to be indicated for low-involvement goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;Chernev, A., ''Strategic Brand Management,'' USA, Cerebellum Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional appeals are often known as a ''soft-sell'' approach. Because they bypass rational cognitive processing, transformational appeals are less likely to result in counter-arguing in the consumer's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Copley, P. ''Marketing Communications Management: Analysis, Planning, Implementation,'' Sage, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to determining the overall creative strategy, the advertiser also needs to consider the creative execution – which refers to the way that the message is presented.  Examples of creative execution include: problem-solution formats, fear appeals, sex appeals, humour, parody, slogans or jingles, mnemonics, slice-of-life, guarantee, celebrity endorsement, testimonial, news style, scientific appeals, dramatisation and product demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Masterson, R, and Pickton, D,. ''Marketing: An Introduction'' Thousand Oaks, California, McGraw-Hill, 2010 pp 288-289&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media planning===
{{see also|Mass media|New media}}

[[File:Imaginative advertising on Brockenhurst Station - geograph.org.uk - 170785.jpg|thumb|Integrating the creative and the media can result in imaginative and powerful messages that grab attention and are noticed]]

Strategic media planning consists of four key decision areas:&lt;ref&gt;Dutka, S., ''Defining Advertising Goals for Measured Advertising Results,'' 2nd ed, NTC Business Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

: 1) Setting media objectives (with reference to both marketing and advertising objectives);

: 2) Developing a media channel strategy for implementing media objectives – the broad vision of when and how to reach target audiences;

: 3) Designing media tactics – specific instructions about media vehicles, placement, preferred position;

: 4) Devising procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of the media plan.

The traditional approach to media strategy was primarily concerned with setting objectives for message reach, weight and frequency. The contemporary approach, however, often treats the media strategy as an extension of the creative strategy.&lt;ref&gt;O’Guinn, T.C., ''Advertising and Integrated Brand Management,'' 4th ed., 2006, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, L'Oreal Men's Expert promoted its skincare range on dry-cleaner hangers. When customers picked up their shirt, they found a $2 coupon and a message, "Your shirt doesn't come with wrinkles, why should your face?" This novel execution shows how media and creative can be integrated to generate powerful advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Drewniany, B.L. and Jewler, A.J., ''Creative Strategy in Advertising'' 10th ed., Boston, MA, Cengage, 2011, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Setting media objectives ====

{{see also|Reach (advertising)|Media planning|Effective frequency}}

In terms of setting media objectives, the planner needs to address several key decisions:

* Who do we want to talk to? [Target market/ audience definition]
* How often does an audience member need to hear our message before it is noticed or achieves the desired consumer response? [Effective frequency]
* When do audiences cease to notice the ad, or become tired of seeing the ad? [Advertising wear-out]

A number of key definitions are essential for media planning purposes:&lt;ref&gt;Robert William Hall, ''Media Math,'' NTC Business Books, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''Reach'' is defined as the number of households (or people) exposed to an advertising message in a given time period. 
: ''Frequency'' is defined as the average number of times a household (or person) is exposed to an advertising message in a given time period.
: ''Effective frequency'' refers to the minimum number of media exposures in order to achieve a specified communication goal
: ''Effective reach'' refers to the reach (% of households or people) at the effective frequency level.
: ''Gross Ratings Points (GRPs)''  is defined as reach multiplied by frequency and is a measure of overall campaign weight or intensity

With respect to reach objectives, planners must decide what proportion of the target market need to be exposed to the advertising message. It is not always be necessary to reach 100% of the target market. For new brands or brands with very low levels of awareness, it may be desirable to reach every member of the target market. However, for reminder type campaigns lower levels of reach may be all that is required.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, B., "The Expanded ARF Model: Bridge to the Advertising Accountability Future," ''Journal of Advertising Research'', March/April, 1997, 11-20&lt;/ref&gt;  Reach objectives are normally framed in terms of a percentage of market. For example, a reach objective might read; ''To reach 50% of women aged 18-25 years.''

With respect to frequency objectives, the planner must determine the optimal level of frequency in order to achieve the desired communications objective.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. P., "What Does Effective Frequency Mean in 1997?" (Part 1 of 2), ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 37, no. 4, 1997, pp 14-17&lt;/ref&gt; Media planners often work with rules of thumb for setting frequency objectives that are based on an extensive body of evidence drawn from research findings. For example, empirical evidence suggests that the average consumer needs to be exposed to a message at least three times before they become aware of the brand information.&lt;ref&gt;Naples, M.J., ''Effective Frequency: The relationship between Frequency and Advertising Awareness,'' Association of National Advertisers, New York, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes known as the ''3+ Rule''. To this basic benchmark of three exposures, media planners recognise that to achieve higher-level communication goals, such as persuasion and lead generation, higher levels of frequency are required. To achieve simple brand awareness, three exposures may be sufficient, but for consumers to act on that awareness, higher levels of exposure may be required. Some theorists have developed sophisticated decision models to assist with planning optimal frequency levels.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrow, J.W., "Setting Frequency Levels: An Art or a Science?" ''Journal of Advertising Research'', Vol. 24, no. 4, 1984, I-9 to I-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Planners also need to consider the combined effects of reach and frequency (GRPs).  In an intensive campaign, the schedule will utilise both broad reach (expose more people to the message) and high frequency (expose people multiple times to the message). The overall campaign weight has implications for budgets and for media selection. In an intensive campaign (heavy weight campaign), the media strategy is normally skewed towards main media, which remains the most cost efficient means of reaching large audiences with the relatively high frequency needed to create stable brand awareness levels.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, M. and Sylvester, A.K., ''Advertising and the Mind of the Consumer: What Works, What Doesn't and Why,'' Great Britain, Kogan Page, 2000 p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Media channel strategy====

{{see also|Advertising media selection|Media buying}}

The first channel decision that needs to be made is whether to use a ''concentrated'' channel strategy or a ''dispersion'' channel strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J.P., ''What's in a Brand?: Building Brand Equity Through Advertising,'' McGraw-Hill, 2008, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

; Concentrated channel strategy
: In a concentrated approach the planner invests most of the media expenditure in a single medium or a narrow range or media. 
; Dispersion channel strategy
: In a dispersion approach, the planner spends across a broad range of [[advertising media]].  The main advantage of a concentrated channel strategy is that the advertiser has the opportunity to achieve a high share-of- voice and can become the dominant advertiser in the selected channels. A dispersion approach allows the advertiser to reach a broader cross-section of the defined target market.

With reach and frequency objectives firmly in place, the planner turns to determining the media mix and selecting appropriate media vehicles to carry the message.  The media planner must determine the way that the advertising budget is to be allocated across the relevant media options (e.g. 50% TV; 30% Mags; 15% Digital and 5% Out-of-home).  To make these decisions, the planner requires a detailed understanding of the target market and its media usage habits. Accordingly, the design of the media channel strategy requires a rich understanding of the media options and what each type of media can accomplish in terms of audience reach and engagement.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Media audience research====

{{See also|Audience measurement|List of magazines by circulation|l2=Magazine circulation|Newspaper circulation|Nielsen Ratings|Nielsen Audio|National Readership Survey}}

Media audience research is a central feature of media planning. The  main purpose  of media research  is  "to  eliminate  waste  in  advertising by objectively  analysing the  media available for  promoting products  and  services".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Identifying and profiling the audience for print media, broadcast media, cinema and online media magazine or newspaper is a specialized form of market research, often conducted on behalf of media owners. In most nations, the advertising industry, via its peak industry associations, endorses a single media research company as the official provider of audience measurement for main media. The methodology used by the official provider then becomes known as the ''industry currency'' in audience measurement. Industry members fund the audience research and share the findings.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, pp 119-120&lt;/ref&gt; In a few countries, where the industry is more fragmented or where there is no clear peak industry association, two or more competing organisations may provide audience measurement services. In such countries, there is said to be no industry currency.

Research companies employ different methodologies depending on where  and  when  media is  used  and  the cost of data collection. All these methods involve [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] – that is taking a representative sample of the population and recording their media usage which is then extrapolated to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Media owners typically share research findings with prospective advertisers, while selected findings are available to the general public via the media research company or an entity, such as a broadcast commission, established to administer the audience research process.

Media research acts as form of industry regulation and the legitimacy of research methodologies and provision of audience metrics.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Media owners rely on metrics of both audience size and audience quality to set advertising rates.

Measures of media audience that are of especial interest to advertisers include:&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen Media Research, &lt;Online: www.nielsenmedia.co.nz/en/pdf/mri/28/mediaterms.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Print Media'''
:* ''Circulation:'' the number of copies of an issue sold (independently assessed via a circulation audit)

:* ''Readership:'' the total number of people who have seen or looked into a current edition of the a publication (independently measured via survey)
 
:* ''Readership profiles:'' Demographic/ psychographic and behavioural analysis of readership (sourced from Readership surveys)

'''Broadcast Media'''
: * ''Average audience:'' The average number of people who tuned into the given time or given program, expressed in thousands or as a percentage. Also known as a ''Rating'' or T.A.R.P  (Total Audience Rating Point).

: * ''Audience share:'' The number of listeners (or viewers) for a given channel over a given time period, expressed as a percentage of the total audience potential for the total market. (The audience share is normally calculated by dividing a given channel’s average audience by the average audience of all channels).

: * '' Audience potential:'' The total number of people in a given geographical area who conform to a specific definition, such as the number of people with a television (or radio) set or the total number of people aged 6–12 years. Population potentials are normally derived from the census figures and are used to estimate the potential market reach.

: * ''Audience movement by session:'' The number of listeners (or viewers) who switch channels during a given time period.

: * ''Audience profile:'' Analysis of audience by selected demographic, psychographic or behavioural variables.

: * ''Cumulative audience (CUME):'' The number of ''different'' listeners (or viewers) in a given time period; also known as ''reach''.

: * ''People Using Television (PUT)'': The number of people (or households) tuned to any channel during a given time period.

'''Out-of-home media'''

: * ''Opportunities to see (OTS)'' – a crude measure of the number of people who were exposed to the medium, For example, the number of cars that drive past an outdoor billboard in a given time period

'''Internet and digital media'''&lt;ref&gt;Bermejo, F., ''The Internet Audience: Constitution &amp; Measurement,'' New York, Peter Lang, 2007, pp 75-101&lt;/ref&gt;

: * ''Site traffic'':  The number of visitors to a website within a given time period (e.g. a month)

: * ''Unique visitors'': The number of ''different'' visitors to a website within a given time period

: * ''Site stickiness'': The average length of time a person remains on a page (a measure of audience engagement)

: * ''Average page views per visit'': The number of different pages generated by a visitor to a site (a measure of engagement)

: * ''Click through rate (CTR)'': The number of people who clicked on an advertisement or advertising link

: * ''Cost per click'' (CPS):  The average cost of generating one click through

: * ''Rate of return visitors'': The number of unique visitors who return to a site

: * ''Bounce rate'': Number of site visitors who leave the site within a predetermined time (seconds)

Although much of the audience research data is only available to subscribers and prospective advertisers, basic information is published for the general public, often as topline survey findings. The type and depth of freely available information varies across geographic markets.

==== Media buying====
{{main article|Media buying}}

While it is certainly possible for advertisers to purchase advertising spots by dealing directly with media owners (e.g. newspapers, magazines or broadcast networks), in practice most media buying is purchased as part of broader negotiations. Prices depend on the advertiser's prior relationship with the network, the volume of inventory being purchased, the timing of the booking and whether the advertiser is using cross-media promotions such as product placements. Advertising spots purchased closer to air-time tend to be more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, B., "Sunday Night Football' Remains Costliest TV Show: Prices Overall See Decline," ''AdAge,'' 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advertisers opt to centralise their media buying through large media agencies such as Zenith or Optimedia. These large media agencies are able to exert market power through volume purchasing by buying up space for an entire year. Media agencies benefit advertisers by providing advertising units at lower rates and also through the provision of added value services such as media planning services.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Buying advertising spots on national TV is very expensive. Given that most media outlets use dynamic pricing, rates vary from day to day, creating difficulties locating indicative rates. However, from time to time, trade magazines publish adrates which may be used as a general guide. The following table provides indicative advertising rates for selected popular programs on American national television networks, broadcast during prime time viewing hours.

====Pulling it all together: Media tactics and the media schedule====

[[File:Sample Media Schedule.jpg|thumb|The media schedule includes specific detail such as dates, media, position, placement]]

A media schedule is a program or plan that "identifies the media channels used in an advertising campaign, and specifies insertion or broadcast dates, positions, and duration of the messages".&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary,http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/media-schedule.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, there are four basic approaches to scheduling:&lt;ref&gt;Pickton, D. and Broderick, A., ''Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Prentice-Hall,2001. p. 671&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Broad Approaches to Scheduling-1.jpg|thumb|Blitzing,continuity, flighting and pulsing are the main schedule patterns]]

: ''Blitzing'': one concentrated burst of intense levels of advertising, normally during the initial period of the planning horizon
: ''Continuity'': a pattern of relatively constant levels throughout a given time period or campaign (i.e. a relatively expensive spending pattern)
: ''Flighting'': an intermittent pattern of bursts of advertising followed by no advertising (i.e. a moderate spending pattern)
: ''Pulsing'':  a combination of both continuity and pulsing; low levels of continuous advertising followed by bursts of more intense levels of advertising; (i.e. alternates between a high spending pattern and a low spending pattern)

Empirical support for the effectiveness of pulsing is relatively weak. However, research suggests that continuous schedules and flighted schedules generally result in strong levels of consumer recall.&lt;ref&gt;Vakratas, D. and Naik, P. "Essentials of Media Planning Schedules", in ''The SAGE Handbook of Advertising,'' Gerard J Tellis and Tim Ambler (eds), London, Sage, 2007, pp 333-348&lt;/ref&gt; With flighted schedules, the second and subsequent flights tend to build on the first flight, resulting in awareness levels similar to a continuous schedule, but often with reduced costs.&lt;ref&gt;Longman, K. A. "If not effective frequency, then what?" ''Journal of Advertising Research'', July-Aug. 1997, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

A major consideration in constructing media schedules is timing. The advertiser's main is to place the advertisement as close as practical to the point where consumers make their purchase decision.&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J.R and Danaher, P.J., ''Advanced Media Planning'', Volume 1, Kluwer Academic, 1998, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an advertiser who knows that a grocery buyer does a main shop on Saturday afternoons and a top-up shop on Wednesday nights, may consider TV to achieve general brand awareness, supplemented with radio spots to reach the shopper while he or she is driving to the supermarket or regular place of purchase on the days when the majority of consumers carry out their shopping.

==Measuring advertising effectiveness==

{{see also|Advertising research}}

Advertising is a major expense for most firms. Improved advertising effectiveness can deliver strategic and tactical advantages as well as helping to manage costs. Advertising managers are expected to be accountable for advertising budgets. Hence, most campaigns invest in a number of measures to evaluate whether advertising budgets are being well-spent and to assess whether the campaign requires improvement and, if necessary, to fine-tune campaigns in order to achieve the desired advertising effects.  The main aim of effectiveness testing is to improve consumer response rates.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, G. R., ''Marketing Calculator: Measuring and Managing Return on Marketing Investment,'' Hoboken, NJ, Wiley, 2008, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, there are two classes of effectiveness testing:&lt;ref&gt;Australian Graduate School of Management, ''Measuring Advertising Effectiveness: Copy Testing (pre-testing) Ads and Tracking (post-testing) the Campaign,'' [Working Paper Series], Vol. 92, Issue 20, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, M.A., Haley, E.E., Sheehan, K.B. and Taylor, R.E., ''Using Qualitative Research in Advertising: Strategies, Techniques, and Applications,'' 2nd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking refers to a combination of both pre-testing and post-testing in order to provide continuous monitoring of advertising effects.

:* ''Pre-testing'': qualitative and quantitative measures taken prior to running an advertisement with a view to gauging audience response and eliminating potential weaknesses

:* ''Post-testing'': qualitative and quantitative measures taken during or after the target audience has been exposed to the message or advertising campaign and used to track the extent to which advertising is achieving the desired communications objectives.

=== Pre-testing ===
Sound pre-testing exhibits the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Pechmann, C. and Andrews, C., "Copy Test Methods to Pretest Advertisements," in ''Wiley International Encyclopedia of Marketing'', Jagdish N. Sheth and Naresh K. Malhotra, (eds), Part 4, Advertising and Integrated Communication, Chichester, West Sussex, UK: Wiley, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

:(i) relevant to the communications objectives;
: (ii) agree on how results are to be used;
: (iii) use multiple measures;
: (iv) be theoretically grounded – i.e. based on a model of human response (e.g. hierarchy of effects); 
: (v) consider multiple exposures;
: (vi) test comparably finished executions;
: (vii) control the exposure context; 
: (viii) define the relevant sample; 
: (ix) demonstrate reliability and validity; 
: (x) take baseline (i.e., pre-exposure) measurements and/or use control groups

Specific types of pre-testing include copy tests, projective techniques and increasingly, a diverse range of physiological and/or biometric testing methods.

====Copy testing====

[[Copy testing]] is testing that evaluates advertising copy and creative executions.&lt;ref&gt;Ipsos, Encyclopedia,https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-encyclopedia-copy-testing&lt;/ref&gt; In this section, the principal methods of copy testing are briefly discussed.

=====Mock-ups=====
{{see also|Storyboard}}

[[File:Storyboard template example.svg|thumb|right|upright|A template used for storyboards]]

Researchers often use mock-ups of the final creative with varying degrees of finished artwork. Some mock-ups are only intended to be seen by the advertising agency and client during the advertising concept development stage. However, mock-ups are useful for gauging audience response to the proposed advertising copy. Mock-ups can be used in face-to-face interviews, small focus groups or theatre tests. A sample of respondents is invited to look at the mock-ups and subsequently asked a series of questions designed to capture advertising effects that are of interest for the given campaign. 

Types of advertising mock-ups that are used in copy testing, both print and broadcast advertising, include:&lt;ref&gt;Shah,K. and D'Souza, A.,''Advertising and Promotion: An IMC Perspective,'' New Delhi, McGraw-Hill, 2009, p. 873&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auditorio Fundacion.JPG|thumb|To pre-test advertisements, researchers might use face-to-face interviews, small focus groups or theatre tests for larger audiences]]

: ''Rough art'':  very rough drawings of the creative concept

: ''Comps'': (abbreviation of "composition art") refers to rough art included along with copy, slogans and campaign strategy

: ''Rip-o-matics'': very rough versions of a TV commercial that include stock images and film footage designed to emulate the look and feel of the final creative execution; ripomatics are often called "mood" or "concept" videos.&lt;ref&gt;Siltanenm R., "The Real Story Behind Apple's 'Think Different' Campaign," ''Forbes,'' 14 December 2011, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2011/12/14/the-real-story-behind-apples-think-different-campaign/4/#52c1daf57eac Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Photo-matics'': include photographs along with the intended audio

: ''Storyboards'': a sequence of drawings or photographs accompanied by relevant copy and designed to resemble the final creative execution of a film or digital TV commercial.

: ''Animatics'': a more elaborate version of a storyboard that includes dialogue, sound tracks and voice overs that are intended to represent a more polished version of the final creative execution.&lt;ref&gt;Ipsos, ''Encyclopedia'', https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-encyclopedia-storyboard&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Projective techniques=====
{{see also|Projective test|l1=Projective techniques}}

In projective techniques, the respondent is invited to project themselves into the advertisement. There are many projective techniques including word association, sentence completion and story completion. These techniques assume that when exposed to incomplete stimuli,  respondents use underlying attitudes or motivations to complete the storyline, thereby revealing their fears and aspirations that may not surface under more direct questioning.&lt;ref&gt;Soley, L., "Projective Techniques for Advertising and Consumer Research," ''American Academy of Advertising Newsletter,'' Vol, 6, No. 2, 2010, pp 1, 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;
Projective techniques have been found to be very useful for evaluating concepts and generating new concepts.

====Physiological measures====

For decades, researchers have been using physiological measures to study such responses to advertising. These measures include such things as pupil response, electrode mal response (GSR) and heart rate. These measures have been shown to be effective measures of attention and the strength of emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;Belch, M. A., Holgerson, B.E., Belch, G.E&gt; and Koppman, J., "Psychophysiological and Cognitive Responses to Sex in Advertising", in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Volume 09, Andrew Mitchell (ed.), Ann Abor, MI: Association for Consumer Research, pp 424-427.&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of consumer neuroscience, researchers have begun to use a much wider range of measures to investigate cognitive responses as well as emotional responses.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M.R., Cornell, L.D. and Nizan, A., ''Launch! Advertising and Promotion in Real Time,'' NY, Flat World Knowledge, n.d., p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the techniques used to measure consumer responses to advertising stimuli include:

=====Pupil dilation=====
The amount of pupil dilation (also known as ''pupillometry'') is believed to provide a relatively precise measure of the amount of mental effort associated with a task. Pupil dilation tests became a staple of advertising copy testing during the 1970s as a way to test consumers' responses to television commercials.&lt;ref&gt;Fong, J., "The Meaning of Pupil Dilation," ''The Scientist,'' 6 December 2012 &lt;Online: http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33563/title/The-Meaning-of-Pupil-Dilation/&lt;/ref&gt; Pupil dilation suggests a stronger interest in the stimuli and can be associated with arousal and action. Pupil dilation is not only used to study advertising, but also used to investigate product and package design.&lt;ref&gt;Wedel,M. and Pieters, R., ''Eye Tracking for Visual Marketing,'' [Foundations and Trends in Marketing Series], Hanover, MA, Now Publishers, 2010,  p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Eye tracking=====

{{see also|Eye tracking|AttentionTracking}}

While viewing an advertisement, a sensor aims a beam of infrared light at the eye and follows the movement to show the spot on which the viewer is focusing. This shows the length of time the viewer focuses on each element of the image and the general sequence used to interpret the image. Eye tracking is often used to fine tune advertising executions.  Research studies suggest that eye tracking is associated with brand recognition, but less useful for brand recall.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, W.D., ''Measuring Advertising Effectiveness,'' Psychology Press, 2014, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Galvanic skin response (GSR)=====
{{see also|Electrodermal activity|l1=Galvanic skin response}}

Galvanic skin response uses a device, called a galvanometer, which is very similar to a lie detector, designed to measure minute amounts of skin perspiration and electrical activity in the skin. Changes in skin response are associated with arousal and are an indicator of the advertisement's ability to capture attention.&lt;ref&gt;Govoni, N.A., ''Dictionary of Marketing Communications,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage,
p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Electroencephelograph (EEG)=====

[[File:EEG recording.jpg|thumb|EEG testing is more invasive]]

An [[Electroencephalography|electroencephelograph]] (EEG) is a device that measures changes in brain-wave activity. EEG testing can detect emotional arousal which is difficult to detect using alternative testing methods. Arousal is an indicator of the advertisement's ability to grab attention and engage the consumer in the message. EEG testing is a cumbersome and invasive testing method which militates against routine use in advertising testing.&lt;ref&gt;Wawrzyniak,A and Wąsikowska, B., "The Study of Advertising Content with Application of EEG," [Chapter 21] in ''Selected Issues in Experimental Economics'' [Springer Proceedings in Business and Economics], Kesra Nermend, Małgorzata Łatuszyńska (eds), 2016, pp 333-353, {{ISBN|978-3-319-28419-4}} (Online)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FmRI)=====
{{see also|Functional magnetic resonance imaging}}

FmRI is a technique that enables researchers to monitor activity in specific areas of the brain. This technique has been used to identify specific brain networks associated with pleasure and arousal associated with advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Bolls, P.D., Wise, K. and Bradley, S.D., "Embodied Motivation Cognition: A Theoretical Framework for Understanding Cognitive Processes Underlying Advertising Exposure," in ''Advertising Theory,'' Shelly Rodgers and Esther Thorson (eds), NY, Routledge, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-testing===

The aim of post-testing is to provide indicators of how well a given campaign is achieving the desired communications objectives, so that corrective action and fine-tuning can occur during the campaign as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising expenditure in order to provide benchmarks for future advertising programs.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, J., ''Developing Advertising with Qualitative Market Research,'' London, Sage, 2002, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques used in post-testing depend on the media employed, and may include such tests as Starch scores, day-after recall tests (DAR), campaign tracking, advertising ROI and other measures.

====Starch scores====

Starch scores were developed by [[Daniel Starch]] in the 1920s to evaluate the copy effectiveness of print advertisements, and are still in use today. A consumer is shown a magazine page by page and subsequently asked whether they had noticed any part an advertisement. If they answer, 'Yes', the interviewer asks the respondent to indicate which parts of the ad were noticed. For each advertisement, three scores are calculated:&lt;ref&gt;''AdAge'', Encyclopedia, http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/testing-methods/98903/&lt;/ref&gt;
: (1) ''Noted'' – the percentage of readers who recognize the advertisement as one they previously saw in the magazine issue (designed to capture the advertisement's ability to grab attention)
: (2) ''Associated'' – the percentage of readers who saw or read any part of the advertisement that clearly indicated the brand advertised (designed to indicate the level of brand processing)
: (3) ''Read most'' – the percentage of readers who read half or more of the ad's written material (an indicator of reader involvement or engagement)

====Day-after-recall tests (DARs)====

Day-after-recall (DAR) tests were developed by George Gallup in the 1940s and are still used. DAR tests provide a measure of the percentage of the people who recall something specific about an ad (e.g., sales message or a visual) the day following exposure. Interviewers ask questions designed to elicit:&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, S.J. and Bird, R., "The Day-after Recall Test of Advertising Effectiveness: A Discussion of the Issues",  ''Current Issues and Research in Advertising,'' volume 5, no. 1, 1982, pp 59-68 Published online: 18 May 2012, http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01633392.1982.10505321&lt;/ref&gt;

: (a) ''Unaided recall'' – when respondents remember any commercials for the product category in question
: (b) ''Aided recall'' – when respondents remember seeing a commercial for Brand X 
: (c) ''Copy points'' – when respondents can recall what the brand showed, looked like and the main points of the commercial

====Tracking====
{{see also|Ad tracking}}

Ad tracking or campaign tracking refers to techniques used to monitor the "in-market performance" of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Ipsos, Encyclopedia,https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-encyclopedia-advertising-tracking-research&lt;/ref&gt; Ad tracking uses a combination of pre-testing and post-testing. Pre-testing is used to establish benchmarks against which the actual performance of a campaign can be measured during and after the campaign has run. A particular area of concern during an advertising campaign is the problem of advertising ''wear-out''. When audiences are repeatedly exposed to the same message, the level of attention begins to plateau and eventually decays. Any further repetitions may cease to be noticed or may alienate target audiences. When wear-out occurs, additional advertising expenditure is simply wasted. One way that advertisers avoid wear-out is to use ''repetition with variation'' – that is, the use of different executions of the same message. Campaign tracking can assist advertisers to determine when to introduce a new execution of the same advertising message or to fine-tune the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Bushman, B., ''Social Psychology and Human Nature'', Belmont, CA, Thomson, 2008, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising return on investment (ROI)====

Advertising return on investment (advertising ROI) is designed to ensure that the right advertising tactics were employed. Good measures of advertising ROI should consider both short term and long term measures. Online campaigns and co-operative advertising are useful for building sales, while television and PR are essential to long-term brand building and customer loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, "Maximize the Return on your Advertising Spend," 1 December 2009, &lt;Online: http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2009/maximize-the-return-on-your-advertising-spend.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Careers ==

Advertising management is a career path in the [[advertising]] or marketing industries. Advertising and promotions managers may work for an agency, a [[public relations]] firm, a media outlet, or may be hired directly by a company to work in their in-house agency where they would take responsibility for communications designed to develop the company's brands or group of brands. In the agency environment, advertising managers are often known as ''account managers'' and their role involves working closely with client firms.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty,S., Mitchell, N.D., Wells, W.D., Crawford, R., Brennan,l. and Spence-Stone, R., ''Advertising: Principles and Practice,'' Melbourne, Australia, Pearson, 2012. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; In a marketing department, the advertising manager's position can include supervising employees, acting as a liaison between multiple agencies working on a project, or creating and implementing promotional campaigns.

"'''Clever Hans'''" (German "Der gescheite Hans") is a fairy tale collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] about a boy who ruins his engagement with a girl through a variety of comedic events. The title is claimed by most people to be ironic.

==Plot summary==

A boy named Hans has a conversation with his mother every morning (in the morning conversations he simply is telling her he is going to meet his fiancee Gretel) and evening (in which his mother reprimands him for mishandling a gift from his fiancee). Every morning when Hans meets Gretel he asks her for a gift. In order, she gives him:

*a [[Sewing needle|needle]]
*a [[knife]]
*a young [[goat]]
*a [[ham]]
*a [[calf]]
*herself

In each instance, Hans mishandles the gifts. He sticks the needle in some hay but his mother tells him he should have stuck it through his sleeve. So he puts the knife in his sleeve but is told he should have put it in his pocket. He puts the goat in his pocket, thus smothering it, and is told he should have led it by a rope. He tries to lead the ham by a rope, and dogs steal it, his mother telling him he should have carried it on his head (or, in some versions, under his arm). He carries the calf this way but it kicks him until he drops it and it runs away. He is told he should have tied it in the stable. He ties Gretel in the stable and the story ends when he misunderstands his mother's advice ("Cast your adoring eyes at her") and gouges out the eyes of the livestock he owns to throw at Gretel.

The result is a disengagement, portrayed in the final sentence: "And that's how Hans lost his bride."

==Plot==

The book [[Frame story|details a bedtime story narrated]] by a grandfather to his grandchildren, chronicling the daily lives of the citizens of an unordinary town called Chewandswallow characterized by its strange daily meteorological pattern. Before the party is over, the town of Chewandswallow provides the townsfolk with all of their required daily meals by raining food. 

But then, even though the residents of the town enjoy a lifestyle devoid of any grocery shopping or cookery, after many, many centuries, the weather unexpectedly and inexplicably takes a turn for the worse. Things start to go worse in Chewandswallow rather than better. The food in the weather devastates the local community with destructive and uncontrollable storms of either unpleasant or dangerously oversized foods, resulting in unstoppable catastrophes for the townspeople. Their lives endangered by the threats of the storms, they relocate to a different community of normal non-edible meteorological patterns (after deciding to permanently abandon Chewandswallow), safe from the hazards that once were presented by raining meals. However, they are now forced to adjust to a new land where it rains rain and snows snow and food can only be gotten in typical fashion. The place to get food from in the new land is from malls and grocery stores.

The following morning, the man's grandchildren awaken to discover snowfall. After bundling up and hurrying outside to play, the granddaughter, in first-person narration, describes how the sun looks like a pat of butter and the snow like mashed potatoes, so much so that she and Henry could almost smell them.

==Sequels==
The follow up to the story, ''Pickles to Pittsburgh'', tells of the kids receiving a postcard from their grandfather, who claims to be visiting the ruins of what was once the fabled town of Chewandswallow. The kids then go to sleep and dream that they are there with him, helping to rebuild the post-apocalyptic landscape and restore it to where it is livable again, as well as giving the massive amounts of food away to poverty-stricken developing nations and homeless shelters around the world. This proves to be difficult, as there could be more food storms on the way.

A third book in the series, ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 3: Planet of the Pies'', was released on August 27, 2013. It details a dream Grandpa had about the first manned expedition to Mars, where Martian society is being overrun by daily storms of pies.

==Film adaptations==
{{Main article|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (franchise)}}
On September 18, 2009, [[Sony Pictures Animation]] released an animated [[Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs (film)|film adaptation]] of the book, and the DVD was released on January 5, 2010. A new cast of characters were created for plot development, while the synopsis was changed from food falling from skies from meterology to being made from a machine. [[Bill Hader]] and [[Anna Faris]] provided the voices of the two lead characters. Hader voices Flint Lockwood, "a young inventor who dreams of creating something that will improve everyone's life." Faris provides the voice for Samantha "Sam" Sparks, "a weathergirl covering the caution who hides her intelligence behind a perky exterior." [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]], [[Bruce Campbell]], [[Mr. T]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Bobb'e J. Thompson]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Al Roker]], [[Lauren Graham]], and [[Will Forte]] are also on the voice cast.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Tatiana.

September 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Co-writers and co-directors Philip Lord and Chris Miller said that it would be a homage to, and a parody of, disaster movies such as ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'', ''[[The Core]]'', and ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=37514 |title=Meatballs Spoofs Disaster Flicks |accessdate=2008-12-05 |last=Lee |first=Patrick |coauthors= |date=2006-08-16 |work= |publisher=SCI FI Wire | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060821120206/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=37514| archivedate = August 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the book where a grandfather tells his two grandchildren a bedtime story about Chewandswallow, an inventor named Flint Lockwood, who lives in Swallow Falls (Chewandswallow’s original name before the food weather), invents a machine that turns the water vapor in the atmosphere into food. Originally the phenomenon was limited to Swallow Falls, but overuse of the machine causes it to malfunction and the food weather taking a turn for the worse, as well as spreading it across the world. A sequel to the film, titled ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2]]'', was released on September 27, 2013, however, it is based on an original idea, and not ''Pickles to Pittsburgh''.

[[File:Cuco, Enguera.jpg|thumb|Cuco. Built with dry-masonry technique, Enguera (Valencia · España).]]
The  '''cuco''' is a type of construction made with the [[dry stone]] technique, in &lt;!-- the --&gt; [[Valencian Community|Valencia]].

At the Valencian autonomous community (''Comunidad Valenciana'') they are located geographically in the regions of the valley of Ayora-Cofrentes, La Costera and La Canal de Navarrés. The latter being the one that concentrates the greatest number of these constructions, highlighting quantitatively the entire municipality of Enguera.&lt;ref&gt;(es:) ''En Enguera se construyen en fincas agrícolas, alejadas del casco urbano. La amplitud de su término municipal favoreció su proliferación'' (In Enguera, they are built on agricultural farms, far from the urban center. The amplitude of its municipal district favored its proliferation). (Castellano Castillo, 2001, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

They use the raw materials found in their environment, rarely used manufactured materials. Two types of stone are used, the limestone that is used in the body of the construction, the one that holds the cover and the cover stone (tap:&lt;ref&gt;
(es:) ''Margas muy calcáreas, de color claro, que en este ámbito geográfico se conocen con el nombre de "tap"'' (Very calcareous margas, of a light color, which in this geographical area are known as "tap") · (Darder, 1929, 603).&lt;/ref&gt; white marls), lighter, on the deck.[[File:Cubierta de un cuco.jpg|thumb|Cuco. Detail of the wall on which the roof rests. Enguera (Valencia).]]

== Tipology ==
The typology of the constructions is very varied. The constructions of round plant predominate, although also those of quadrangular plant are frequent. In occasion the ''cuco'' adapts to the relief of the land and adopts an irregular plant.

The covering systems are all the same. A false dome is built by approaching courses.

The covering of the access spans is made with large slabs as a lintel. testimonially other typologies are documented as two slabs supported on both sides of the span, the approach of courses or the ''adovelado'' (with ''dovelas'') arch (built with irregular slabs arranged radially.

Inside the ''cucos'' you can find complementary structures: fireplace, cupboard, manger, etc.

They are usually free buildings, although sometimes they are attached to the roadways (terraces); or they can have a quadrangular annex space.

Detail of the outer area of the roof, in which the different layers that compose it are appreciated.&lt;!-- Detalle de la zona exterior de la cubierta, en el que se aprecian las distintas capas que lo componen. --&gt; Enguera (Valencia).]]

== Functionality ==
They are constructions destined to the refuge and temporary stays of the agriculturists. Its occupation used to be seasonal, coinciding with the moments of greater work in the agricultural parcels. Its use is different from that in other areas of the Valencian Community where it is linked to livestock.

'''Decorative folding''' is an artistic type of folding similar to [[origami]] but applied to fabrics instead of paper. Some types of objects that can be folded are [[napkin]]s, [[towel]]s, and [[handkerchief]]s.

Folding can be done as a hobby or an art but is most commonly encountered as a decoration in luxury hotels (towels) or fancy restaurants (napkins).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuhn |first=Doris |title=Napkin Folding for Every Occasion |year=2005 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |location=New York |isbn=9781402728020 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RPmoCv4kLPgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Little%20Book%20of%20Decorative%20Napkin%20Folding&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 9] |quote=It is no accident that fine restaurants have long preserved the art of napkin folding as an important element of presentation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napkin folding]] has a centuries-old history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hetzer |first=Linda |others=Robert Penny |title=The Simple Art of Napkin Folding: 94 Fancy Folds for Every Tabletop Occasion |year=2001 |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=9780060934897 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lQ3xaui3OCoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 7] |url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/The-Simple-Art-of-Napkin-Folding-Linda-Hetzer?isbn=9780060934897&amp;HCHP=TB_The+Simple+Art+of+Napkin+Folding |edition=1st William Morrow pbk. |accessdate=26 February 2013 |quote=More than three centuries ago, napkin folding was developed into an art, ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and dates back to the times of [[Louis XIV of France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuhn |first=Doris |title=Napkin Folding for Every Occasion |year=2005 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |location=New York |isbn=9781402728020 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RPmoCv4kLPgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Little%20Book%20of%20Decorative%20Napkin%20Folding&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 9–10]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Seven Books of the Diana''''' (Spanish: ''Los siete libros de la Diana'') is a [[pastoral]] romance written in Spanish by the Portuguese author [[Jorge de Montemayor]].  The romance was first published in 1559, though later editions expanded upon the original text.  A sixteenth-century bestseller, the ''Diana'' helped launch a vogue for stories about shepherds, shepherdesses, and their experiences in love.  One of its most famous readers was [[William Shakespeare]], who seems to have borrowed the Proteus-Julia-Sylvia plot of ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' from Felismena's tale in the ''Diana''.

==Plot==
The ''Diana'' begins with a summary of previous events, telling us that the shepherd Sireno is in love with the shepherdess Diana.  She once returned his love, but when Sireno was called away from their village, she was married to another shepherd named Delio.  The story begins with Sireno's return after a year's absence, having already learned of Diana's marriage.

Over the course of the first three books, Sireno encounters other shepherds and shepherdesses who sing songs and tell stories of their own experiences with frustrated love.  Among these is a warrior maiden named Felismena (not truly a shepherd, but dressed as one for the time being), who rescues Sireno and his friends from an attack by wild men. The group of shepherds is persuaded to seek out the enchantress Felicia, who may have the power to solve their romantic dilemmas.  In the fourth book they are welcomed by Felicia at her castle, and proceed to tour the wonders within (including the halls of Venus and Mars, and a performance by the legendary Orpheus). After they have rested, Felicia administers her magic potion, causing some of the shepherds to either forget or reroute their old desires.  Sireno is cured of his love for Diana. In the final three books the initial love stories are resolved, with the shepherds either finding new love partners or recovering ones they believed they had lost. Felismena finds her lover, Don Felis (or "Felix" in the English translation), and rescues him from an attack by enemy knights. With a little help from Felicia's magic, Felis remembers his love for Felismena and the two are married.  The Sireno-Diana situation, however, remains unresolved. Sireno can now greet Diana with calm indifference, but Diana is clearly pained by his transformation and laments her forced marriage to another man. The book ends by promising a sequel, though Montemayor never lived to complete one.

==Expansions and sequels==
The 1561 edition of Valladolid introduced certain changes into the text which were often reproduced in later editions and translations.  The most significant of these changes is the insertion of a new interpolated tale, the "Abencerraje," told to entertain the shepherds in Felismena's palace at the end of book 4.  Scholars now believe the new material to be Montemayor's own work, though the decision to add them to his pastoral romance may have been made by an enterprising publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Montero, "Prólogo," in ''La Diana'', by Jorge de Montemayor (Barcelona: Crítica, 1996), lxxx-lxxxi, and p. 213 note 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montemayor's text prompted two separate sequels in Spanish, both published in 1564: Alonso Pérez's ''La Segunda Parte de la Diana'' (The Second Part of the Diana), and [[Gaspar Gil Polo]]'s ''Diana Enamorada'' (Enamoured Diana).  Bartholomew Yong's English translation of the ''Diana'' (completed ca. 1582 and published in 1598) included both sequels alongside Montemayor's original.&lt;ref&gt;''Diana of George of Montemayor'', trans. Bartholomew Yong (London: Edm. Bollifant, 1598).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circulation and Influence in the Renaissance==
While inspired by Jacobo Sannazaro's [[Arcadia (poem)|''Arcadia'']], Montemayor's ''Diana'' is arguably the first major work of pastoral prose fiction in the Renaissance, placing just as much emphasis on its ongoing plot and interwoven stories as on the poems sung by its shepherd protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Alpers, ''What is Pastoral?'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 348-360.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Diana'' is significant for being one of the most popular works of early modern fiction not merely in Spain, but abroad as well.  By Julián Arribas' count, there were at least thirty-one Spanish editions of the text printed in the sixteenth century alone. That same period also witnessed twelve French translated editions, and one English translation by [[Bartholomew Yong]].&lt;ref&gt;Julián Arribas, “Estudio Bibliográfico: Catalogo de Ejemplares,” in ''Los Siete Libros De La Diana'', by Jorge de Montemayor (London: Tamesis, 1996), 19-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Felismena's back-story in the ''Diana'', wherein Felismena cross-dresses as a page in order to pursue her faithless lover, was probably Shakespeare's source for his [[Two Gentlemen of Verona]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bullough, ''Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare'' (London : New York: Routledge and Paul; Columbia University Press, 1957), volume 1, p. 205-206.&lt;/ref&gt;  Montemayor's ending differs from Shakespeare's play, however, since Montemayor's heroine saves her lover's life; the rekindling of their love is also helped along by Felicia's magic. Speaking more broadly, Geoffrey Bullough, Judith Kennedy, and Stuart Gillespie have all noted that Montemayor's pastoral romance seems to have been foundational for the development of Shakespeare's comedies: they point particularly to Montemayor's influential exploration of love, his emphasis on strong female heroines and their perspectives, and his treatment of amorous intrigue and entanglements.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough 205; Judith M. Kennedy, "Introduction," in ''A Critical Edition of Yong’s Translation of George of Montemayor’s Diana and Gil Polo’s Enamoured Diana'', (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1968), p. lii - liii; and Stuart Gillespie, "Shakespeare's Reading of Modern European Literature," in ''Shakespeare and Renaissance Europe'', ed. Andrew Hadfield and Paul Hammond (London: Arden Shakespeare, 2005), p. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Montemayor's ''Diana'' was also a major inspiration for [[Philip Sidney]] in writing the [[New Arcadia#The New Arcadia|''New Arcadia'']].  Montemayor's influence was noticed early on by Sidney's contemporaries: as John Hoskins stated in 1599, "For the web, as it were, of [Sidney's] story, he followed three: Heliodorus in Greek, Sannazarius' ''Arcadia'' in Italian, and ''Diana'' by Montemayor in Spanish."&lt;ref&gt;John Hoskins, ''Directions for Speech and Style'' [1599] (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1935), 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sidney in particular seems to have modeled his opening scene between the shepherds Strephon and Klaius on Montemayor's Sireno and Sylvano.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Skretkowicz, "General Introduction," in Philip Sidney, ''The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia'' (The New Arcadia), ed. Victor Skretkowicz (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miguel de Cervantes]] mentions the ''Diana'' with both approval and criticism in the book-burning episode of his ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (part I, chapter 6), where Quixote's friend the priest declares the book too good to be thrown in the fire like the rest:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;  And opening one, [the priest] saw that it was ''Diana'', by Jorge de Montemayor, and he said, believing that all the others were of the same genre:
  "These do not deserve to be burned like the rest, because they do not and will not cause the harm that books of chivalry have, for they are books of the understanding and do no injury to anyone.  [...]  To begin with Montemayor's ''Diana'', I am of the opinion that it should not be burned, but that everything having to do with the wise Felicia and the enchanted water, and almost all the long verses, should be excised, and let it happily keep all the prose and the honor of being the first of such books."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, ''Don Quixote'', trans. Edith Grossman (New York: Ecco, 2003), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Translations==

Although '''fashion design in United States copyright law''' is an [[intellectual property]] concept dating back to the 1750s, copyright protection has never been extended to fashion designs. As of late 2015, fashion designs were not subject to copyright laws in the United States, and could not be copyrighted.&lt;ref&gt;"Protection for Fashion Design", Statement of the United States Copyright Office  before the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, United States House of Representatives, 109th Congress, 2nd Session, July 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion Design and Copyright in the US and EU", Michele Woods and Miyuki Monroig, Copyright Law Division, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Geneva, November 17, 2015. Web 25 Sep 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

{{further information|Copyright law of the United States}}

=== Domestic ===

The beginnings of copyright law began with editorial copyrights in the 1750s.&lt;ref&gt;"Copy Right Law." Niles' Weekly Register (1814-1837) Jul 02 1831: 319-. American Periodicals. Web. 10 Feb. 2013 .&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, we have had extensive advancements within society that have called for legislative additions to the initial idea of what should and should not be copyrighted. In 1932 the [[Fashion Originators Guild of America]] unified in order to prevent further knock offs by requiring designers to submit their designs for cataloguing, and by “red carding” those stores and businesses that were found to reproduce previously submitted designs under their own name and for their own profit. By red carding these retailers, they essentially blacklisted stores to institute boycotts and dissolve the offending business. However, in 1941 their actions were ruled illegal through violating antitrust laws and monopolizing the competition and so the guild disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Surowiecki, James. "The Piracy Paradox." The New Yorker 83.28 (2007): 90. MasterFILE Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The issue continued to be under debate as designers through the years consistently felt blows in revenue as cheaper versions of their designs flew off the mass marketed racks. Attempts at creating a bill to combat these knock offs rose and fell, until various supporters grabbed hold of ideas to form a tangible and arguable legislation.

=== International ===

[[Fashion design copyright]] laws in Europe have been known as early as in the 15th century. French king [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] &lt;ref&gt;Salmon, J.H.M."Francis I (France)." Encyclopedia. Issues &amp; Controversies. Facts On File News Services, n.d. Web. 4 Mar. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; gave out specific privileges related to the production of textiles. By 1711, in Lyon, illegalities were already being defined in regards to fashion materials, and in 1787, in England and Scotland fashion designers had fruitfully pushed their needs for protection into basic legislation. In 1876 Germany began protecting fashion patterns as well as models, and in 2002 European regulation on designs that were new and provided an aspect of fresh character or aesthetic were brought under protection.&lt;ref&gt;(Fischer Par. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; From 2004 to 2006 the “total production volume for clothing decreased by about 5% each year… [and by] 2006 the European union trade deficit for clothing was at 33.7 billion.”&lt;ref&gt;(Fischer Par. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics show that while there are benefits of their advanced design legislation, the economic and external factors still hindered their industry growth in ways the U.S. can empathize with. As 2007 came to a close, WIPO, or the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], had registered twenty-nine international designs.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Fridolin. “Design Law in the European Fashion Sector” WIPO February 2008. Web. 10 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==

{{see also|Design Piracy Prohibition Act}}

In 1998, Representative [[Howard Coble]] of North Carolina was the one to use the example of boat hulls in his argument for fashion design protection. A statute had been added to the copyright legislation describing boat hull designs to be included in the protective act, and Coble expressed how the same types of ideas applied to hull designs could be used for fashion designs.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Eric. "Senate Joins Knock off Battle." The New York Times Magazine 09 Aug. 2007: G4. MasterFILE Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 201&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the 109th congress found themselves facing the first supported bill asking for protection of fashion designs. This attempt, however, was stalled in congress. A second attempt was made in 2010, and now yet another attempt stands before the congress of 2013, hoping to be pushed through this final time.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Cong .House. “Protection for Fashion Design”. U.S. 109th Congress. H.R. 5055. Thamas Lib. Of Congress, 30 March 2006. Web. 10 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The original proposed legislation regarding fashion design copyrights put before congress in 2006 were as follows.
“A fashion design is subject to protection under this chapter… A ‘fashion design’ is the appearance as a whole of an article of apparel, including its ornamentation. The term ‘apparel’ means- an article of men’s, women’s, or children’s clothing, including undergarments, outerwear, gloves, footwear, and headgear; handbags, purses, and tote bags; belts’ and eyeglass frames. In the case of a fashion design, embodied in a useful article that was made public by the designer or owner in the United States or a foreign country more than 3 months before the date of the application for registration under this chapter. A fashion design shall continue for a term of 3 years beginning on the date of the commencement… [Infringement can be claimed on] reasonable grounds to know that protection for the design is claimed”.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Cong .House. “Protection for Fashion Design”. U.S. 109th Congress. H.R. 5055. Thamas Lib. Of Congress, 30 March 2006. Web. 10 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Act, as expressed above, outlined what constitutes as a protectable fashion design, something that had been under heavy debate.

== Affected designers and manufacturers ==

Designers included in the list of those with stolen designs and who are part of the campaign for protection include but are not limited to: [[Diane Von Furstenberg]], [[Narciso Rodriquez]], [[Zac Posen]], and [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Eric. "O.K., Knockoffs, This Is War." The New York Times Magazine 30 Mar. 2006: G1+. Academic Search Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The fight is said to be not against lower priced merchants selling clothes that follow the seasonal fashion trends, but against blatant copying of runway looks, such as dresses or jackets that use the exact color, detail, and structure as pieces that had already debuted under previous designers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Eric. "O.K., Knockoffs, This Is War." The New York Times Magazine 30 Mar. 2006: G1+. Academic Search Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These less expensive replicates of previous designs are impacting the luxury business in ways that cause decline in the revenue for luxury designers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Eric. "O.K., Knockoffs, This Is War." The New York Times Magazine 30 Mar. 2006: G1+. Academic Search Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of spending the money on a higher priced garment, they buy a cheaper duplicate from a mass producer. In this sense, the Council of Fashion Designers of American argues that their members customers are being stolen by the cheaper knock offs producers.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Irene. "Knock It Off, Forever 21! The Fashion Industry's Battle Against Design Piracy." Journal of Law &amp; Policy 18.2 (2010): 893-924. Academic Search Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

When original designers are confronted about the issue of price, they justify their expensiveness by means of the creative effort that goes into both the design and production process.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Eric. "O.K., Knockoffs, This Is War." The New York Times Magazine 30 Mar. 2006: G1+. Academic Search Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This clearly includes the materials and methods used to produce top quality pieces to sell to consumers. Fashion is in all senses a distinct form of art. There are bad pieces and good pieces, but even a bad or plain painting would still be labeled as artwork. Designer pieces are expensive not only because of the brand name, but also the innovation and creativity of the product.

European designers at home have rights to their designs through the European Union, and they want those same protections for their designs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Eric. "O.K., Knockoffs, This Is War." The New York Times Magazine 30 Mar. 2006: G1+. Academic Search Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, fashion designers receive twenty-five years of protection for a just revealed design in contrast to the current American proposed cap of three years.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrel, Elizabeth and Tina Tanhehco. “Protecting the Material World: the Role of Design Patents in the Fashion Industry”. HeinOnline (2010-2011):253. Web. 25 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, they receive a generous amount of protection in one market and get absolutely nothing in the other.

== Court cases ==

=== Yves Saint Laurent v. Ralph Lauren ===

In 1994, [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves St Laurent]] and [[Ralph Lauren]] went to court over a specific tuxedo dress that the accused had theoretically designed after a YSL version.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Eric. "O.K., Knockoffs, This Is War." The New York Times Magazine 30 Mar. 	2006: G1+. Academic Search Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate outcome was the payment of several hundred thousand dollars from Ralph Lauren to the House of YSL. While the court in question was in Paris, this shows the beginnings of public courts taking serious interest and incentive to protect designers from copying one another. A second example from 1994 took place in Chicago, where the company I.B Diffusion L.P. accused [[Montgomery Ward]] L.P. of knocking off a specific sweater design and mass-producing it to sell for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Veverka, Mark. "Apparel Maker to Ward's: Hey, Big Guy, Knock it Off." Crain's Chicago Business May 02 1994: 4-. ABI/INFORM Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This case provides an additional example of American designers facing the challenge of competitors knocking off their designs.

The argument here describes the economic idea of competition. Without competition there leaves no room for businesses to strive for better, newer products in order to outsell each other  (Fischer par. 2). When arguing against legislation, many lump copycat retailers and mass producers into this category of necessary competition. Through imitation of the original products, it “makes it available to a greater number of consumers.”&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Fridolin. “Design Law in the European Fashion Sector” WIPO February 2008. Web. 10 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that larger quantities of people have access not only to the product but also to knowledge of the product increases the original designers successful market base. In a roundabout method, imitation is type of advertising for the real design.

An argument put forth for this case is that few to zero customers are actually stolen through knock off retailing. Knockoffs are targeted at a market of consumers who would not be buying the original pieces anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Surowiecki, James. "The Piracy Paradox." The New Yorker 83.28 (2007): 90. MasterFILE Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of difference in price points from the original to the knock off means that the lower priced market consumers cannot afford the higher priced market products to begin with. In other words, designers and mass retailers cater to entirely different market segments that barely overlap. Not to mention, there is a certain amount of “piracy paradox”. When designs become mass-produced and so mass marketed, it causes market saturation to occur even sooner than it would otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Surowiecki, James. "The Piracy Paradox." The New Yorker 83.28 (2007): 90. MasterFILE Complete. Web. 10 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the consumers become familiar with the designs faster and faster, and so cause fashion cycles to also speed up. The time between introduction of a style and decline of a style is decreasing. This allows designers to sell different styles more often, and so increase their overall profit.

In [[filmmaking]], '''found footage''' is the use of [[footage]] as a [[found object]], appropriated for use in [[collage film]]s, [[documentary film]]s, [[mockumentary film]]s and other works.

==Use in commercial film==
Historical found footage is often used in documentary films as a source of primary information, giving the viewer a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.  Director and cinematographer [[Ken Burns]] used archival footage in his films. ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' (1994), his documentary television series for PBS, incorporates historical footage accompanied by original music or actors reading relevant written documents.

Often fictional films imitate this style in order to increase their authenticity, especially the mockumentary genre. In the dramatized and embellished pseudo-documentary film ''[[F For Fake]]'' &lt;!-- Year of release in Europe. --&gt;(1973), director [[Orson Welles]] borrows all shots of main subject [[Elmyr de Hory]] from a BBC documentary,&lt;ref name="f for fake"&gt;{{cite web |last=Null |first=Christopher |title=F for Fake |publisher=filmcritic.com |date=12 February 2005 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1976/f-for-fake/?OpenDocument }}&lt;/ref&gt;  rather than fabricating the footage himself.

Stuart Cooper's ''[[Overlord (1975 film)|Overlord]]'' uses stock footage of the landing on Normandy during [[World War II]] to increase realism. The footage was obtained from the [[Imperial War Museum]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=382 The Criterion Collection: Overlord by Stuart Cooper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of the film were shot by Cooper, but using old World War II-era film stock with World War II-era [[camera lens|lens]]es.

==Music video and VJing==
A certain style of [[music video]] makes extensive use of found footage, mostly found on TV, like news, documentaries, old (and odd) films etc. Prominent examples are videos of bands such as [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] and [[Coldcut]]. The latter also project video material during their stage show, which includes live mixing of video footage. Artists such as Vicki Bennett, also known as [[People Like Us (musician)|People Like Us]], or the video artist Kasumi with the film Shockwaves, use [[Creative Commons]] archives such as the [[Prelinger Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Shiels, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/2062364.stm ''Unlocking the copyright culture''], BBC News website, June 24, 2002.

'''Centre for Theatre Practices "Gardzienice"''' was founded in 1977 by [[Włodzimierz Staniewski]], and formally registered in 1978. The name comes from the village where the theatre is located. The group gained international critical acclaim, and is classified as an [[alternative theatre|experimental]] anthropological theater.  In 1997 the association established the Academy for Theatre Practices. This carries out numerous projects: research, arts, music, and cultural investigation into the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodge|first=Alison|title=Twentieth Century Actor Training|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-19452-5|pages=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8TcVOG-pWYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Włodzimierz Staniewski was a former collaborator of [[Jerzy Grotowski]], and in his choice of just such an isolated environment, Staniewski may have been inspired by his work with Grotwoski in Brzezinka,&lt;ref name="Hodge2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodge|first=Alison|title=Hidden Territories|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;   but with an important difference: rather than emphasising an isolating escape from urban existence, Gardzienice represented for him a pursuit of integrative existence within a community, albeit of a different sort.  From the outset, Gardzienice sought to work with the local people, taking interaction with them as both inspiration for a way of life, and for a way of developing performance.  It was in this environment that the whole basis for the group's early work, the 'expedition', was born.  Staniewski describes the expedition as  having "the character of a permanent journey through a chosen territory, with the possibility of not only touching on the culture of people, but also the "culture of the earth" .  This may not constitute a strict anthropological exercise in the purely academic sense, and Staniewski may insist on a less clinical term, but at its heart is arguably an interest in the study of people.  According to [[Richard Schechner]], Gardzienice constitutes "the very heart and essence of Polish experimental and anthropological performance."&lt;ref name="Hodge2004" /&gt;

== Constellation ==
Staniewski uses the term "constellation" to describe a particular arrangement of actors/collaborators who come together to create a performance.[48] This is to emphasize the individuality of each actor, who personality contributes to the creation of a work. Each performance is matched to the predisposition of the actor, rather than the other way around. The director builds a constellation for each performance from scratch, inviting actors to cooperate with the Centre. Despite this practice, many artists remain in "Gardzienice" for many years. Staniewski does not look for professional theatre actors (he himself studied Polish language), but what matters is the personality of the candidate. Since the founding of the Academy for Theatre Practices, new actors are recruited mainly from among its graduates. The first constellation in 1977 was created by Staniewski with Henryk Andruszka, Jan Bernad, Tomasz Rodowicz, Waldemar Sidor, Jan Tabaka oraz Wanda Wróbel. Since then, "Gardzienice" has included of over 50 actors, with none but Staniewski remaining from the original group. The longest-standing collaborator is Mariusz Gołaj, who joined the team in 1979.

[[File:Ojo de dios anaroza.jpg|thumb|360px|God's eye or Ojo de Dios on Quemado Mountain, [[San Luis Potosi]], [[Mexico]]]]
A '''God's eye''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], '''''Ojo de Dios''''') is a spiritual and votive object made by weaving a design out of yarn upon a wooden cross. Often several colors are used. They are commonly found in [[Mexican people|Mexican]] and [[Mexican Americans|Mexican American]] communities, among both Indigenous and Catholic peoples.

''Ojos de Dios'' are common in the [[Pueblos]] of [[New Mexico]]. Often they reflect a confidence in all-seeing Providence. The spiritual eye of the ''Ojos de Dios'' is thought by some believers to have the power to see and understand things unknown to the physical eye.  During Spanish colonial times in New Mexico, from the 16th to the 19th centuries, ''Ojos de Dios'' (God's Eye) were placed where people worked, or where they walked along a trail (Major, 2012).

In other parts of the Americas, artisans weave complicated or variegated versions of the traditional ''Ojos de Dios'', selling them as decorations or religious objects. There has also been a huge increase in the use of Ojos de Dios as an easy and fun craft for children.

The Ojo de Dios or God's eye is a ritual tool that was believed to protect those while they pray, magical object, and an ancient cultural symbol evoking the weaving motif and its spiritual associations for the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] and [[Tepehuan]] Indians of western [[Mexico]]. The Huichol call their God's Eyes '''Sikuli''', which means "the power to see and understand things unknown."{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} When a child is born, the central eye is woven by the father, then one eye is added for every year of the child's life until the child reaches the age of five.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Original Tepehuan Crosses are extremely rare to come by. There are many that are being made for the tourist market, but they do not carry the same traditional and spiritual significance.

==Nierika, Nieli’ka==
[[File:God's eyes.jpg|thumb|''Ojo de dios'' made from [[chopstick]]s and yarn]]

In the traditional Huichol ranchos, the ''nieli'ka'' or ''nierika'' is an important ritual artifact. Negrín states that one of the principal meanings of "''nierika''" is that of "a metaphysical vision, an aspect of a god or a collective ancestor,"&lt;ref name=n3&gt;Negrín 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and is the same term the [[Tepehuán people]] use to refer to deities. Negrín quotes Lumholtz as stating that for the Huichol and Tepehuan "a ''nierika'' means a picture, an appearance, or a sacred representation."&lt;ref name=n3/&gt; The term ''nierika'' is etymologically rooted in the verb ''nieriya'', "to see".  ''Nierika'' are found in Huichol and Tepehuans' most sacred places: house shrines (''xiriki''), springs, caves and temples. Some Natives of northwest Mexico and throughout the southwest U.S. have had visions during [[peyote]] ceremonies in which they received guidance from Gods who appeared before them in many shapes, though the eyes of the God were so intense and overwhelming that many Natives could only see the eye of the God. To show others the vision they had, they made the ''God's eye'' - woven on sticks with handspun yarn, colored with various types of berries, flowers, and other materials to capture the essence of their vision.

Negrín states that: "The [[votive]] ''nierika'' is generally a round offering, symbolizing an ancestor and prayer offerings sanctified by the blood of a sacrificed animal."&lt;ref name=n3/&gt; ''Nierika'' as a ritual object may be attached to votive arrows with bamboo and yarn, or wood-and-wax-embedded objects.  Similarly, Lumholtz states that the ''nierika'' "evokes an [[ancestor]], thanks it with blood offerings, and invokes its favors."  The ''nierika'' may take different forms and fabrication may differ greatly:  a small round or square tablet with a hole in the center covered on one or both sides with a mixture of [[beeswax]] and pine resin into which threads of yarn are pressed; when the image is not round, it may be considered a resting mat for the ancestors, or a prayer mat or itari.

Negrín states the elaborate interwoven ''nierika'' that Lumholtz called ''namma'' (which is close to the pronunciation of [[Namkha]]) from which originated the detailed and now prized yarn paintings of the commercial art world, are now rarely if ever seen.&lt;ref name="n3"/&gt;  ''Namma'' were generally rectangular or square in shape, with yarn woven onto a grid of bamboo sticks.  These God’s Eyes are also called by the Spanish term ''ojo de dios''. One understanding of the ''ojo de dios'' according to Harvey is of a: "wand" (the eye) through which the eye of god will see the supplicant. Harvey states that: "The cross of the ''ojo de dios'' is that of the legendary four directions: earth, fire, water, and air."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 1973:  9-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Head of a Warrior''' is a recurring [[Theme (arts)|theme]] in art.  The heads vary a great deal across time and artistic style, but all present an intriguing look into both the soldier and the artist of the day.

There are two notable '''Ipswich Hoards'''. The first was a hoard of [[Anglo-Saxon]] coins discovered in 1863. The second was a hoard of six [[Iron Age]] [[gold]] [[torc]]s that was discovered in 1968 and 1969. The latter hoard has been described as second only to the [[Snettisham Hoard]] in importance as a hoard from the Iron Age, and is held at the [[British Museum]].

==First hoard (1863)==
The first hoard was found in an earthenware pot buried about {{convert|10|ft|m}} beneath the doorstep of the house at the corner of [[Old Buttermarket]] and St. Lawrence Lane in [[Ipswich]], which had previously belonged to numismatist [[James Conder]] (1763–1823), when it was demolished during road widening in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/features/coins_offer_up_clues_to_the_past_1_537702 Coins offer up clues to the past] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304064207/http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/features/coins_offer_up_clues_to_the_past_1_537702 |date=2012-03-04 }}, East Anglia Daily Times, 15 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported as consisting of 150 coins, although only 75 are known now. The coins were all silver pennies of the reign of [[Æthelred the Unready]], minted in London and Ipswich. It is tempting to associate this find with the ravaging of Ipswich which took place in 991. However clues in the coins indicate that the hoard may have been deposited between 979 and 985.&lt;ref name=metcalf&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RL8LMU_5tzcC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=%22ipswich+hoard%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dhpK1Gj1-S&amp;sig=p9ETBBpen8ZOxnLwPMIgRPiKKgE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6qZqTOXaLdSRjAf3lKWCAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ipswich%20hoard%22&amp;f=false An atlas of Anglo-Saxon and Norman coin finds, c.973-1086], David Michael Metcalf, p. 109, accessed August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second hoard (1968-9)==
[[File:5 Torcs from the Ipswich Hoard.jpg|thumb|5 Torcs from the Ipswich Hoard on display at the British Museum.]]

===Discovery===
Five neck ornaments called [[torc]]s were discovered in 1968 by the operator of a mechanical digger preparing ground for the construction of new housing in [[Belstead]], near Ipswich, for which the driver received £45,000;&lt;ref name=IpswichHoardDiscovery&gt;{{cite book|title=Treasure hoards of East Anglia and their discovery|page=14|publisher=Countryside Books|isbn=978-1-84674-147-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sixth torc of a slightly different design was discovered a year later by the owner of one of the newly completed houses when sorting though a pile of earth left by the building in his garden, for which he received £9,000.&lt;ref name=IpswichHoardDiscovery/&gt;

===Appearance===
The torcs were manufactured by twisting two strands of large diameter wire around each other and fashioning them into a near circle. The ends of the twisted wire are finished with terminal decorations. They are made from [[green gold]] as they have a lower proportion of silver in them than later finds, leading British Museum experts to date their manufacture to about 75 B.C. However the torcs may have been used by many generations before they were hoarded away.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; The museum estimates that the maximum neck diameter of the people who wore these torcs was {{convert|18.7|cm|in}}.

These would have been created in wax around the ends of the wire. The wax is then coated, at least once, with a ceramic slurry and left to harden. The ceramic is then heated which allows the wax to leave and gold is poured into the cavity. This [[lost wax]] process allows the terminals to include a level of detail that was initially created on the wax. The terminals created for these torcs were hollow. Each of the torcs has a slightly different design for the left and right terminal.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/g/ipswich_hoard_gold_torcs.aspx Gold torcs from the Ipswich Hoard], British Museum, accessed 18 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
The 1968 finds are in room 50 of the British Museum, but there are also copies of these torcs in the [[Ipswich Museum]].&lt;ref name=shesh&gt;[http://www.sheshen-eceni.co.uk/icenian_gallery.html The Celtic Coin Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618053119/http://sheshen-eceni.co.uk/icenian_gallery.html |date=2006-06-18 }}, Sheshen Eceni, accessed 20 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Letters of Ayn Rand''''' is a book derived from the letters of novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]], and published in 1995, 13 years after her death. It was edited by Michael Berliner with the approval of Rand's estate.

==Background==
When Rand died in 1982, the materials in her estate included copies of over 2000 letters written by her between 1926 and 1981. Berliner selected "approximately 35 to 40 percent of the total" for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the letters to remove "less interesting material", such as opening and closing statements or apologies by Rand for not writing someone sooner after they had written her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|pp=xvi–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the letters in the context of a later controversy over the editing of Rand's published [[Journals of Ayn Rand|journals]], historian Jennifer Burns affirmed that Berliner had only omitted material rather than changed the content.&lt;ref name="burns"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right]] |last=Burns |first=Jennifer |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-532487-7 |oclc=313665028 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hardcover edition of ''Letters of Ayn Rand'' was published by [[E. P. Dutton|Dutton]] in 1995. A paperback edition was published by [[Plume (publishing)|Plume]] in 1997.

==Contents==
The organization of the letters is largely chronological, but specific sections are dedicated to Rand's correspondence with [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Isabel Paterson]] and [[John Hospers]]. An appendix provides a form letter that Rand sent to many fans of ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' who had written her. Rand's heir, [[Leonard Peikoff]], provides an introduction.

==Reception==
At the time of its release, about a dozen publications reviewed ''Letters of Ayn Rand'', according to the [[Ayn Rand Institute]]. The reviews were mixed.&lt;ref name="annual"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |title=Ayn Rand in Review |work=Archives Annual |volume=3 |year=2000 |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/DocServer/volume3.pdf |page=23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622052015/http://www.aynrand.org/site/DocServer/volume3.pdf |archivedate=June 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', [[Christopher Cox]], then a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], gave the book a positive review. He said Rand's letters were "an important part of Ayn Rand's intellectual contribution" that are "filled with flashes of emotional insight, surprising facts and unintended humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cox |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Cox |title=Behind The Fountainhead |work=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |date=August 6, 1995 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first positive review of one of Rand's books in ''The New York Times Book Review'' since 1943.&lt;ref name="annual"/&gt;

Another positive review came from Rand scholar [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]]. Writing in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, he predicted that Rand's letters would "delight and sometimes shock readers", and said "what is most startling about the collection is how well it humanizes Ayn Rand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sciabarra |first=Chris Matthew |authorlink=Chris Matthew Sciabarra |url=http://reason.com/archives/1995/11/01/rand-the-living |title=Rand the Living |work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |volume=27 |issue=6 |date=November 1995 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' magazine editor [[R.W. Bradford]] found the book interesting and said it "allows the reader to see glimpses of the real woman and her development as a thinker and writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|1995|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he described Berliner's editing as "inept"&lt;ref name="bradford54"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|1995|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peikoff's introduction as "uninformative".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|1995|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said Rand wrote relatively few letters for a significant literary figure, and suggested Berliner held back potentially interesting letters for fear of upsetting Rand's "self-made myth," which Bradford considered "inexcusable".&lt;ref name="bradford54"/&gt;

In ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Jeffrey Frank]] described the book as "ultimately tedious". He said her earlier letters are "considerably more interesting than the later ones", which include "an endless amount of whining about various publishers, her detailed responses to editors' suggestions, her hectoring assertions of her beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeffrey A. |last=Frank |authorlink=Jeffrey Frank |title=The Virtues of Selfishness |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 9, 1995 |page=WBK4 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/6855809.html?FMT=ABS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[National Review]]'', [[Florence King]] said the "book reeks of the sycophancy that Miss Rand always inspired" and noted several letters attacking the ''National Review'' itself, "the magazine she loved to hate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Florence |last=King |authorlink=Florence King |title=Scud Missives |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/king/king200405280928.asp |work=[[National Review]] |date=October 9, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] magazines praised the book, with one saying, "in her letters we learn more of the style of her soul",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donald |last=Heath |title=Correspondence to Reality |url=http://www.objectivistcenter.org/showcontent.aspx?ct=36 |work=IOS Journal |date=September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another called the book "the next best thing" to knowing Rand personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garmong |first=Dina |title=An Intimate View of a Titan |journal=[[The Intellectual Activist]] |date=September 1995 |volume=9 |issue=5 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', Scott Holleran called the book "a treasure chest" in which "Rand emerges as a passionate thinker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Holleran |title=Rand's Letters Offer Glimpse of Greatness |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=December 17, 1995 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25030258.html}}{{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews included a review by [[Claudia Roth Pierpont]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Claudia Roth |last=Pierpont |authorlink=Claudia Roth Pierpont |title=Twilight of the Goddess |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=July 24, 1995 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1995/07/24/1995_07_24_070_TNY_CARDS_000370859}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reviews in ''[[Booklist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Winters |first=Dennis |title=Review |work=Booklist |volume=91 |date=June 1, 1995 |page=1720 |url=http://booklistonline.com/ProductInfo.aspx?pid=982841}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Overmyer |first=J. |title=Review |work=[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]] |volume=33 |date=February 1996 |page=952}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jere |last=Real |title=Ayn Rand Stood by Principles |work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=August 6, 1995 |page=F4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand scholars writing about the book some years later also expressed mixed opinions. [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] complimented the "uncommon variety of letters" included, saying it "allows the reader access to the many facets of Rand's private and public personae."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she noted a mistake regarding Rand's birthday at the beginning of the book, and included it among several posthumous books approved by Rand's estate that "have not always exhibited a confidence-inspiring level of academic rigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Burns said scholars can use the material in the book, but indicated the material omitted by Berliner includes items "of high interest to the historian" so that "important insights can be gleaned only from the originals."&lt;ref name="burns"/&gt;

'''''Life Goes On''''' is a 2009 film by Sangeeta Datta. It shows how a Hindu family in Britain copes with the death of the wife and mother. The story recalls Shakespeare’s ''[[King Lear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Life Goes On – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/13/life-goes-on-review|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 March 2011|author=[[Philip French]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film is set in modern London. The central character is Sanjay, a Hindu doctor, respected in his community. After the sudden death of his wife Manju, he struggles to relate to his three daughters. The drama follows the week from Manju's death to her funeral.

As well as dealing with grief and family ties, the film addresses inter-faith issues as Sanjay discovers that the youngest daughter Dia has a Muslim boyfriend, Imtiaz.

Wandering the streets of London the night before the funeral, Sanjay recalls his own childhood, when he left home with his parents during the [[partition of India]].

* [[Girish Karnad]] as Sanjay
* [[Sharmila Tagore]] as Manju

* Tom Reed as Tom
* Sue Parker-Nutley as Mrs Goldsmith

==Reception==

Xan Brooks in the ''Guardian'' considered the acting "stiff and self-conscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Life Goes On – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/10/life-goes-on-review|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 March 2011|author=Xan Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7611">'''Margrét Þóra (Thora) Hallgrímsson''' (born 28 January 1930) is the wife of the businessman [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]] and like him was a prominent figure in the cultural and business life of Iceland from around 2002–2008. She is also the former wife of [[American Nazi Party]] founder [[George Lincoln Rockwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1967: 'American Hitler' shot dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/25/newsid_3031000/3031928.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and surname==

Þóra was born in [[Reykjavík]], the eldest daughter of [[Hallgrímur Fr. Hallgrímsson]], chairman of Shell in Iceland and consul in Canada, and his wife [[Margrét Þorbjörg Thors Hallgrímsson]], daughter of the businessman [[Thor Philip Axel Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/37260/; http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/286017/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ethnically Icelandic, Þóra's father Hallgrímur was born Canadian. His surname Hallgrímsson is in fact his father's [[patronym]], which his father had taken as a [[surname]] when moving to Canada. In turn, Þóra also inherited the surname, giving rise to the unusual situation of a female Icelander with a last name ending in -''son''.

At 14, Þóra was sent to boarding school in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages==

While studying in England, Þóra received a marriage proposal from [[David Tomlinson]], whereupon her father had her return to Iceland, via a spell studying in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014)., p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in Iceland, Þóra met [[Haukur Clausen]],&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014)., p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; an Olympic athlete and later dentist, and married him on 6 January 1951.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Together they had Örn Friðrik (born 13 July 1951),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Cf. 'Haukur Clausen', ''Morgunblaðið'', 13 May 2003, http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/730658/.&lt;/ref&gt; but they separated just a year later due to Clausen having an affair with Þóra's best friend.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 1953 Þóra married [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], an officer in the American Navy and later founder of the [[American Nazi Party]], moving with him to America. With him she had three further children: Hallgrímur, Margrét, and Bentína.&lt;ref&gt;http://atlas.verslo.is/1962?s=nemendur_meira&amp;sid=6168{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/286017/.&lt;/ref&gt; In Roger Boyes's account,

::[[Olafur Thors]]’s niece Thora Hallgrimsdottir was in trouble. Thora was a free spirit. At a ball in Reykjavik she had fallen for a handsome American naval Officer, George Lincoln Rockwell—a war hero to boot—and abandoned her marriage to a well-connected Icelandic dentist to wed him. All harmless enough, except that Rockwell became a founder of the American Nazi Party and one of the most active racists in the United States. One of his missions was to take the Ku Klux Klan into the modern age; he coined the phrase White Power, organized rallies, operated a Hate Bus to stir up sentiment against African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts of Þóra's divorce from Rockwell, which include Rockwell's own autobiography, and her return to Iceland vary.  Her father Hallgrímur travelled to the United States in 1958 to bring his daughter home;&lt;ref&gt;George Lincoln Rockwell, ''This Time the World'' (Parliament House 1961; Reprinted by White Power Publications, 1979; and later Liberty Bell Publications, 2004, {{ISBN|1-59364-014-5}}), https://archive.org/details/ThisTimeTheWorld_37; Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64; Ingi Freyr Vilhjálmsson, ''Hamskiptin: Þegar allt varð falt á Íslandi'' (Reykjavík: Veröld, 2014), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; according to Boyes, the family asked [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]] to help convince Þóra to return to Iceland, &lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to her son Björgólfur Thor, Þóra met Björgólfur Guðmundsson back in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, Þóra moved back with her four children,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/286017/&lt;/ref&gt; divorced Rockwell, and in 1963 married Björgólfur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americannaziparty.com/rockwell/materials/books/pdf/ThisTimeTheWorld.pdf ''This Time The World'', the autobiography of George Lincoln Rockwell]; Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; She had one son by Björgólfur, [[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]], but Björgólfur Guðmundsson also adopted Þóra's children by Rockwell.

Þóra's grandson, by her daughter Evelyn Bentína Björgólfsdóttir, is the footballer [[Björgólfur Hideaki Takefusa]].

==Controversy over biography==

In 2005, Guðmundur Magnússon published the book ''Thorsararnir'', on the history of the descendants of Thor Jensen. In the first version of the book was a chapter on Þóra's marriage with Rockwell. The book was published by the press Edda, but Björgólfur, who owned the publisher, had the author change the text. Moreover, he tried to buy the newspaper ''Dagblaðið-Vísir'', which had discussed the matter, in order to close it down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20091125043306/http%3A//www.dv.is/brennidepill/2008/11/1/ritskodari%2Deinokar%2Ddagbladamarkad/ Ritskoðari einokar dagblaðamarkað.] DV, 1. nóvember 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearances in popular culture ==

Þóra was the model for the character Lilja Jónsdóttir in the novel ''Sakleysingjarnir'' by [[Ólafur Jóhann Ólafsson|Ólaf Jóhann Ólafsson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3613442 Aldarspegill sakleysingjanna.] Morgunblaðið, 31.

A '''mechane''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|k|ə|n|iː}}; {{lang-el|μηχανή}}, ''mēkhanḗ'') or '''machine''' was a [[crane (machine)|crane]] used in [[History of theatre#Ancient Greek Theater|Greek theatre]], especially in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Made of wooden beams and pulley systems, the device was used to lift an actor into the air, usually representing flight. This stage machine was particularly used to bring gods onto the stage from above,&lt;ref name="Greek mechane sources"&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Crat]].'' 425d; ''[[Clitophon (dialogue)|Clit]]''. 407a&lt;/ref&gt; hence the Latin term ''[[deus ex machina]]'' ("god from the [[machine]]"). [[Euripides]]' use of the mechane in ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'' (431 BC) is a notable use of the machine for a non-divine character. It was also often used by [[Aeschylus]]. It was used to allow actors playing gods to fly through the air.

==Use in Ancient Rome==
Stage machines were also used in ancient [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], e.g. during the sometimes highly dramatic performances at [[Roman funerals and burial|funerals]]. For [[Julius Caesar]]'s funeral service, [[Appian]] reports a mechane that was used to present a blood-stained wax [[effigy]] of the deceased [[Roman dictator|dictator]] to the funeral crowd. The mechane was used to turn the body in all directions.&lt;ref name="Mechane at Caesar's funeral"&gt;App. ''B.C.'' 2.147. ''τὸ μὲν γὰρ σῶμα, ὡς ὕπτιον ἐπὶ λέχους, οὐχ ἑωρᾶτο. τὸ δὲ ἀνδρείκελον ἐκ μηχανῆς ἐπεστρέφετο πάντῃ''. [[Suetonius]] only reports a [[Tropaion|''tropaeum'']] to which the effigy (''simulacrum'') was affixed. (''Jul.'' 84)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey S. Sumi|Geoffrey Sumi]] proposes that the use of the mechane "hinted at Caesar's [[divinity]]".&lt;ref name="Sumi source"&gt;Geoffrey S. Sumi: ''Ceremony and Power — Performing Politics in Rome between Republic and Empire'' (Ann Arbor 2005. 107–109, chapter ''Caesar ex machina''). {{ISBN|978-0-472-11517-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is highly unlikely because Appian doesn't describe the mechane as a genuine ''deus-ex-machina'' device. Furthermore Caesar's [[apotheosis]] wasn't legally conducted until 42&amp;nbsp;BC and Caesar had only been worshipped unofficially as ''[[divus]]'' during his lifetime. First and foremost, [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] attempted to arouse the masses as a means to strengthen Caesar's esteem as well as his own political power.&lt;ref name="Consequences"&gt;That Caesar's [[Resurrection|''resurrectio'']] as god happened later during the funeral as he was [[Cremation|cremated]], and that it spawned the early Caesarian cult by the [[Gaius Marius (Pseudo-Marius)|Pseudo-Marius]], can't explain Antonius' intentions for using a mechane during the funeral.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
In [[Christian]] [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] the mechane has also been identified with the [[Christian cross|cross]]. [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]] calls the cross the "theatre mechane" of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]].&lt;ref name="Ignatius source"&gt;Ignatius of Antioch: ''Letter to the Ephesians'' IX, I. ''ἀναφερόμενοι εἰς τὰ ὕψη διὰ τῆς μηχανῆς Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ὅς ἐστιν σταυρός''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Monarch''''' is a British [[costume drama]] involving [[Henry VIII]]. It was written and directed by [[John Walsh (filmmaker)|John Walsh]] and released in 2000 at the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]]. It was re-released in 2014 after the film negative, thought lost, was rediscovered.

==Plot==
''Monarch'' is part fact, part fiction and unfolds around one night in the life of a hated king susceptible to assassination, and paranoid with the thought of his own mortality. The film is set in just one night when the injured Henry VIII arrives at a manor house closed for the season. Henry is without the power of his throne. He is vulnerable to those around him and to his own mental issues. He had left England financially and morally bankrupt; his collection of enemies became his only constant.

In an ''Irish Post'' interview, Walsh said “Often you can find out more about someone in a small time frame rather than you can if the two-hour film spans their whole life. Most bio-pics become little more than a montage of facts. If you confine a character to that time frame you can find out more about them.”&lt;ref name="Balasundaram"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Balasundaram |first1=Nemesha |title=Rare TP McKenna film to be screened after original tapes recovered |url=https://www.irishpost.com/entertainment/london-irish-director-reveals-archive-henry-viii-film-tapes-almost-lost-32166#comment-364005 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Irish Post |date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cast ==
[[T. P. McKenna]] plays Henry VIII, while [[Jean Marsh]] plays an amalgamation of his ex-wives. [[Peter Miles (English actor)|Peter Miles]] played a courtier to King Henry. [[James Coombes (actor)|James Coombes]] (known for his [[James Bond]] style role in the [[Cadbury]] chocolate [[Milk Tray]] advertisements popular on UK television)&lt;ref name="MilkTray"&gt;{{cite news |title=Milk Tray Man is back, and all because the lady loves it |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/shopping-and-consumer-news/11920070/Milk-Tray-Man-is-back-and-all-because-the-lady-loves....html |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Telegraph |date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; played the King's personal protection guard.

==Production==
It was shot on [[35 mm film|35mm]] [[Kodak]] 5287 stock using [[Arriflex]] cameras. Principal photography commenced in October 1996 at [[Charlton House]] in south London, making it the only film about Henry VIII entirely shot in the borough where he was born: [[Greenwich]].&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bishop |first1=Rachel |title="Tudor Whodunnit" filmed in Greenwich brought back to life |url=https://archive.fo/20141117163213/http://www.wharf.co.uk/2014/06/tudor-whodunnit-filmed-in-gree.html#selection-127.0-127.58 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=The Wharf (archived copy) |date=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weekender-2017"&gt;{{cite news |title=Monarch back at Charlton House – film re-mastered for DVD and iTunes |url=https://www.weekender.co.uk/articles/uncategorised/monarch-back-charlton-house-film-re-mastered-dvd-itunes/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Weekender |date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] building served as the main location, with filming taking place inside and outside the house. The gardens were the backdrop for the opening title sequence. The Grand Salon and the Long Gallery featured heavily for the film’s dramatic scenes with Henry VIII. The house's clock tower was also utilised as the hiding place for Will, the ground-keeper's son, who hid from men who break into the house. Although set at night much of the filming took place during the day; black drapes were hung outside of the building to create a night effect.

In an interview with newspaper ''The Greenwich Visitor'' (page 5), Walsh discussed how he wanted his depiction of Henry VIII to be more grounded and less like those portrayals from Hollywood. He also discussed the difficulty of filming on a location and how the film benefited from using 35mm Kodak film stock.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/greenwichvisitor/docs/gv42.whole&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-release==
In 2014 a remastered version of ''Monarch'' was released following discovery of the original film negative, previously thought lost.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mackenzie |first1=Steven |title=Lost joys: Directors reveal searches for missing movies |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26420152 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bishop"/&gt; The remastered version premiered on 14 September 2014 at London's [[Tricycle Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Palmer-29Aug2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Palmer |first1=Jim |title=Critically acclaimed movie Monarch shot in Charlton by Greenwich-based John Walsh set for high definition re-release |url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/11441818.display/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=News Shopper |date=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balasundaram"/&gt; Walsh discussed the issues around finding the lost negatives for ''Monarch'' and other lost projects with [[BBC Radio 2]]'s [[Janice Long]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Walsh - Spoken word session (18 April 2014) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01xn3p1 |website=BBC Radio 2 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
Restoration was completed at Premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.premiercomms.com/work/2014/Monarch.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422225752/http://www.premiercomms.com/work/2014/Monarch.php# |archive-date=22 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film scanning and restoration team worked closely with director John Walsh, re-mastering from the original 35mm colour camera negative after it was discovered in a vault almost 20 years after it was originally filmed. In an interview about the project for the [[BBC]], John Walsh explained:

:"When we located the project we found more than we bargained for with over 52 cans of various footage from film trims, cutting copies and work prints. We didn't know if the original camera negative would be amongst all of this haul. After a close examination we were delighted to find all of the original camera negative was there and in good shape for its age."&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt;

Every frame of film was scanned in high definition at Premier and had more than 10,000 particles removed by hand by the restoration team. A new sound mix was also created from the original elements in Premier’s in-house audio department. In an article with ''The Weekender'' in November 2017 John discussed the importance restoration and preservation of older films to future-protect film such as ''Monarch'':

: "It will give today’s audiences the chance to see the wonderful performance of [[Jean Marsh]] and the towering presence of [[T. P. McKenna]], regarded as one of the great of his generation and rightly so in one of his most outstanding performances. ...
:Some films are lost for all time. From [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films to TV episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and [[Tony Hancock]]. The Holy Grail of lost films for collectors is [[London After Midnight (film)|''London After Midnight'']]. The 1927 silent horror- mystery film starring [[Lon Chaney]] and produced by [[MGM]] has not been seen for almost 50 years.”&lt;ref name="Weekender-2017"/&gt;

== Reception ==
The film received strong reviews on its re-release in 2014 which were in contrast with the poor reviews in 2000. In 2000 Dennis Harvey wrote in [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] that "''Monarch'' plays out an OK premise to results at once turgid and ridiculous." and describes McKenna's performance as "hammy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/reviews/monarch-1200464656/|title=Monarch|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|date=2000-10-23|work=Variety|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 the ''[[Radio Times]]'' film critic Jeremy Aspinall called it "a fascinating, haunting little gem, with a richly nuanced performance from McKenna".&lt;ref name="Aspinall"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Aspinall |first1=Jeremy |title=Monarch |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/cvvst7/monarch/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film's realistic approach was noted by the [[BBFC]] who certified it a 15 on the basis that it "contains strong bloody violence".&lt;ref name="BBFC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Monarch |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/monarch-video |website=BBFC |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''Monarch'' was released for the first time on [[DVD]] on 7 April 2014 by [[FremantleMedia]]. It included extras on the making of the film and the restoration process. A high definition version is also available to view on [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/monarch-2000/id849697291&lt;/ref&gt;

''DVD Compare'' said "The film features an extraordinary British cast, is well written, and is perfectly paced."&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Samuel |title=Monarch |url=http://www.dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3294 |website=DVD Compare |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Movie Waffler'' gave the film four stars for the main feature and four stars for the DVD extras, saying “McKenna is the beating heart of ''Monarch'', part wounded bear, part Augustus Gloop petulance.” It adds “This menacingly pessimistic view of British history and government is an immensely entertaining gothic melodrama, the creepy details that Walsh weaves into the film.”&lt;ref name="Poole"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Poole |first1=Benjamin |title=Monarch |url=http://www.themoviewaffler.com/2017/11/dvd-review-monarch-2000.html |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=The Movie Waffler |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11775">The '''Mudra Afrique''' (or, '''Centre Africain de Perfectionnement et de Recherche des Interprètes du Spectacle Mudra Afrique''') was a contemporary dance school founded in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] in 1977 by [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] and [[Maurice Béjart]], based on a [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] philosophy of uniting Africans through the commonalities in the different ways of artistic self-expression throughout the continent, thus creating a universal artistic culture that challenges the dominance of European dance and artistry. The school closed in 1983 but a significant number of its students went on to successful international careers.,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kringelbach|first=Hélène Neveu|date=2014-02-01|title=CHOREOGRAPHIC PERFORMANCE, GENERATIONS AND THE ART OF LIFE IN POST-COLONIAL DAKAR|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/africa/article/choreographic-performance-generations-and-the-art-of-life-in-post-colonial-dakar/0DEA6C822D5F6218AF5689E17ADAF164|journal=Africa|volume=84|issue=1|pages=36–54|doi=10.1017/S000197201300065X|issn=0001-9720}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Burkinabe choreographer, dancer, actor and artist [[Irene Tassembedo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourdié|first=Annie|year=2013|title=Art chorégraphique contemporain d’Afrique, enjeux d’une reconnaissance|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-marges-2013-1-page-73.htm|journal=Marges - Revues|volume=16|pages=73–86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mudra Afrique played a crucial role in preparing the basis for contemporary African dance by training the first generation of “modern” African dancers according to international artistic standards.

== History of the School ==
The name of the school comes from the Sanskrit term “mudra” meaning “gesture” or “sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Mudra|date=1980-01-01|url=http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/?s=films_details&amp;pg=33&amp;id=117|language=fr|accessdate=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school, once located where the [[Court of Cassation (Senegal)|Court of Cassation]] in Dakar is currently housed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://keurvision.net/public/newsletter/nl20130131/DPM_JACQUES_H_SY.pdf|title=Le domaine public maritime de Dakar: élites, pouvoir et impunité, Une enquête de terrain d’Aide Transparence, UNE ONG regionale d’analyse de poliques économiques et sociales, au service des peuples africains,|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Jacques Habib Sy, Mamadou Aliou Diallo, Papa Samba Kane|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1977 by Leopolod Sédar Senghor and Maurice Béjart&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maurice-b-jart-influential-choreographer-who-attracted-huge-audiences-to-ballet-760253.html|title=Maurice Béjart: Influential choreographer who attracted huge|date=2007-11-24|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and funded by Senegal and [[Belgium]], with support from [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sieveking|first=Nadine|date=2014-02-01|title=‘CREATE YOUR SPACE!’ LOCATING CONTEMPORARY DANCE IN OUAGADOUGOU|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/africa/article/create-your-space-locating-contemporary-dance-in-ouagadougou/C00929698A57E2092DC7E9913BE35B77|journal=Africa|volume=84|issue=1|pages=55–77|doi=10.1017/S0001972013000661|issn=0001-9720}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germaine Acogny]], a Senegalese dancer and choreographer originally from [[Benin]], who is probably the best-known and most influential forerunner of contemporary dance in the West-African region,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was appointed director of the school from its opening. Mudra Afrique, with an international student body, emphasized the Senghorian concepts of both ''enracinement'' and ''ouverture,'' rootedness and openness. The school was based on the premise that dance could be used to connect distinctly different African cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnsWhJGkXo8C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=in+1977+maurice+bejart,+choreographer+and+artistic+director&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzrJiw_pHQAhVEKCYKHTEHAG4Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=in%201977%20maurice%20bejart,%20choreographer%20and%20artistic%20director&amp;f=false|title=African Dance: An Artistic, Historical, and Philosophical Inquiry|last=Welsh-Asante|first=Kariamu|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Africa World Press|year=|isbn=9780865431973|location=|pages=69|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students received training in African, contemporary, and classical dance, as well as in African drumming.

== Influence on Other Dance Schools ==
Many non-Senegalese African dancers, who went on to found their own schools, attended Mudra Afrique, and so its multidisciplinary training greatly influenced dance across West Africa.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubois|first=Olivier|year=2016|title=Le rayonnement de Mudra-Afrique, Entretien avec Germaine Acogny, "la fille noire de Béjart"|url=http://www.contredanse.org/pdf/nddinfo/ndd_66.pdf|journal=Nouvelles de Danse, CONTREDANSE|volume=|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This includes Germaine Acogny, the former director of Mudra Afrique, who established her own African contemporary dance school, École des Sables, in Senegal in 2004, based on the same Pan-African principles which inspired Mudra Afrique. The school is now a platform for choreographers from all over the world and for African dancers aspiring to an international career.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She explains her conception of contemporary African dance saying “the artistic movement into which I insert my own work, even though it is deeply rooted in popular traditions, is not at all a return to roots. On the contrary, we pursue a way that is altogether different and ''resolutely'' urban, reflecting the modern context within which so many of us, Africans of our time, must live and move and have our being. The Africa of sky-scrapers, the Africa of international alliances”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Danse africaine - Afrikanischer Tanz - African dance|last=Acogny|first=Germaine|publisher=Fricke|year=1980|isbn=|location=Frankfurt|pages=74|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast with Mudra Afrique, however, funding for this school did not come from African states but from French and European agencies, private charities in Europe and North America, and from fee-paying students from outside Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other examples include Irène Tassembedo from [[Burkina Faso]], who founded her own dance school, École Danse Irène Tassembedo (EDIT), in 2009 in [[Ouagadougou]] and developed an international career popularizing African contemporary dance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Laurent Longafo from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) also introduced Germaine Acogny’s dance techniques to a wider university student population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Maurice Béjart established another dance school called École Mudra in Belgium in 1970, which closed in 1988.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; So the influence of Mudra Afrique extends beyond Senegal.

== Critiques of the School ==
The school served as a showcase for Senegal’s advanced artistic initiatives, which were elaborated and complicated by the dancers it trained. Since the foundation of Mudra Afrique in 1977, however, [[France]] and other European countries have been financing the choreographic arts in Africa via training, workshops, and space, using cultural agencies attached to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. This necessitates that performers respond to the artistic demands of these institutions, which raises concerns over creative agency and drives choreographic standardization towards European and away from African.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bushidi|first=Cécile Feza|date=2015-05-01|title=HÉLÈNE NEVEU KRINGELBACH , Dance Circles: movement, morality and self-fashioning in urban Senegal. New York NY and Oxford: Berghahn Books (hb $95/£60 – 978 1 78238 147 1). 2013, 252 pp.|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/africa/article/helene-neveu-kringelbach-dance-circles-movement-morality-and-self-fashioning-in-urban-senegal-new-york-ny-and-oxford-berghahn-books-hb-9560-978-1-78238-147-1-2013-252-pp/850A486B46982CF270875A13C505AF8C|journal=Africa|volume=85|issue=2|pages=369–371|doi=10.1017/S0001972015000091|issn=0001-9720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, efforts for self-determination by African performing artists deliberately opposing ongoing French [[cultural hegemony]] are coupled with a search for alternative frameworks of artistic development, following a strategy of diversification in a dual sense: broadening the range of potential donors and gaining access to new politico-economic resources by promoting “cultural diversity”. An example of this are both EDIT (École Danse Irène Tassembedo) and École des Sable, which show the trend of combining profit-making with a “cultural exchange” and a political and social development agenda.

The new “choreographic movement” born out of transnational African collaboration has become more and more male-dominated with regards to international visibility, which is contrasted against the important role played by women such as Germaine Acogny and Irène Tassembedo, who are considered to be among the ''avant garde'' of contemporary dance in Africa. Given the family backgrounds of these dancing pioneers, who were part of the social, political and economic elite during the first decades of national independence and enjoyed state patronage, the current underrepresentation of female choreographers might be explained by the professionalization and opening of the dancing field towards less-privileged social spheres and groups, with the unfortunate effect of decreasing the representation of women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Nalayira Divya Prabandham'''  ({{lang-ta|நாலாயிரத் திவ்வியப் பிரபந்தம்|translit=nālāyira divya prabandham}}) is a collection of 4,000 [[Tamil language|Tamil]] verses (Naalayiram in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] means 'four thousand') composed &lt;ref name="srivaishnavam"&gt;{{cite news|

accessdate= 2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the 12 [[Alvars]], and was compiled in its present form by Nathamuni during the 9th – 10th centuries. The work, an important liturgical compilation of the Tamil [[Alvars]], marks the beginning of the canonization of 12 ''[[Vaishnava]]'' poet saints, and these hymns are still sung extensively today. The works were lost before they were collected and organized in the form of an anthology by [[Nathamuni]].

The ''Divya Prabandham'' sings the praise of [[Narayana]] (or [[Vishnu]]) and his many forms. The [[Alvars]] sang these songs at various sacred shrines known as the [[Divya Desams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajarajan|first=R.K.K.|year=2013|title=Historical sequence of the Vaiṣṇava Divyadeśas.

Prominent among its 4,000 verses are the over 1,100 verses known as the ''Tiruvaymoli'' or ''Thiruvaaymozhi'' ("words of the sacred mouth"), composed by [[Nammalvar]] (Kaari Maaran, Sadagopan of [[Alwarthirunagari Temple]]) and which forms the third portion of the overall ''Divya Prabandham''. [[Nammalvar]] self-identifies as  a lovelorn ''[[gopi]]'' pining for [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name="tveda" /&gt;

==Compilation==
The collection, once thought to have been lost, was organized in the form of an anthology by [[Nathamuni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Hinduism|page=217|author=Bruce M. Sullivan|publisher=Scarecrow Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nathamuni]] was born in Veera Naarayanapuram (Veeranam) or present-day Kaattu Mannaar Koil. There is a long time gap between [[Thirumangai Alvar]] (the last alvar) and Nathamuni. In this dark period, nobody knew what happened to the 4,000 verses of the text.

Legend has it that once [[Nathamuni]] heard some people reciting the decad of ''Aaraavamude'' of Nammaazhvaar at [[Kumbakonam]]. Captivated by these ''pasurams'' (hymns), he wanted to know more about them. One of the verses also mentioned ''Aayiraththul Ippaththu'' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: these 10 out of the 1000). When Nathamuni enquired about the remaining 990, the people who sang the 10 did not know anything about the other verses. But as the song mentioned the name and place of the ''azhwar'' (Kurugoor Satakopan), [[Nathamuni]] proceeded to [[Alwarthirunagari Temple|Thirukurugoor]] and asked the people there about Swami [[Nammazhwar]]'s 1,000 verses.&lt;ref name="Ramanuja1"&gt;{{cite news|

accessdate= 2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people did not know the 1,000 verses that [[Nathamuni]] wanted, but they told him about 11 ''pasurams'' (hymns) of [[Madhurakavi Alvar]], a disciple of [[Nammazhwar]] ''Kanninun Siruthaambu''. They asked him to go to Thiruppuliaazhwar, the place where [[Nammazhwar]] lived, and recite these 11 ''pasurams'' 12,000 times. [[Nathamuni]] did as advised, and pleased with his penance, [[Nammazhwar]] granted him not only his 1,000 ''pasurams'', but the entire 4,000-''pasuram'' collection of all the Alvars.&lt;ref name="Ramanuja2"&gt;{{cite news|

'''National Indigenous Television''' ('''NITV''') is an Australian television channel that broadcasts programming produced largly by [[Indigenous Australians]].

NITV was initially only carried by cable and satellite providers, along with some limited over-the-air transmissions in certain remote areas. However, in 2010, the Australian Government commissioned a wide-ranging review of its investment in the Indigenous broadcasting and media sector. The review was headed up by retired senior public servant [[Neville Stevens]] with the assistance of Expert Panel members [[Laurie Patton (Internet executive)|Laurie Patton]] and Kerrynne Liddle. The review recommended that NITV continue to receive government funding only on the basis that it was re-structured.

Subsequently, Communications Minister [[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[Stephen Conroy]] invited NITV to enter in negotiations with the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] to access one of that network's unused digital terrestrial channels. SBS took over the management and operation of NITV on 1 July 2012, and the network was re-launched as a free-to-air channel on [[Freeview (Australia)|Freeview]] channel 34 on 12 December 2012.

==History==

=== Predecessors of NITV ===
Indigenous groups and individuals lobbied the [[Australian Government]] to fund a nationwide Indigenous television service in the 1980s and 1990s, however no major political party championed this cause.

In the late 1990s the Imparja Info Channel (also known as "Channel 31") was launched free-to-view on the satellite [[Optus Aurora]] service, providing largely Aboriginal programming direct to homes and via network of BRACS transmitters to remote Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal programming on this channel later became known as [[Indigenous Community Television]].

In 2004, Imparja stated a desire to run a better funded service, at least within its license area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a voluntary NITV Committee was formed and a summit was held in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]], Sydney. The summit involved a group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander media professionals and community members committed to the establishment of a national Indigenous broadcasting service.

In 2005 the [[Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Australia)|Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts]] considered funding an indigenous public broadcaster, and subsequently conducted a review process. Following the conclusion of the report, the [[Government of Australia]] announced $48.5 million in funding for NITV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Establishment of NITV ===
In 2007, NITV established a head office in [[Alice Springs]] and a television arm in Sydney. On 13 July 2007 NITV launched, replacing Imparja Info Channel on Optus Aurora and in the remote Aboriginal communities it previously reached. It soon after also became available free-to-air on Optus D1 to Australia and eastern Papua New Guinea [http://www.lyngsat-maps.com/maps/optusd1_aus.html].

NITV announced in September 2007 that it would also launch on Australian subscription television services, and has commenced on 1 November 2007 on [[Foxtel]] and [[Austar]]'s satellite service on channel 180, with it becoming available on its cable service soon after. It shows Australian programs and sports like ''[[The Marngrook Footy Show]]'', and the annual ''[[NSW Koori Knockout|NSW Aboriginal Rugby League Knockout]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nitv.org.au/media/#foxtel NITV – Media Room&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NITV 2015 logo.png|140px|thumb|NITV logo (2012–2016)]]
On 30 April 2010, NITV ceased broadcasting on Sydney's [[Digital 44|digital television Datacasting service]] along with Teachers TV, [[Australian Christian Channel]], the [[home shopping]] channel [[Expo Channel|EXPO]] and other services. However, it remained available on subscription services Foxtel, Austar and Optus TV.

=== NITV as part of SBS ===
On 8 May 2012, [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] received $158m in government funding, of which $15m a year would be dedicated to a new free to air Indigenous Australian channel which would replace NITV in July 2012, with 90% of staff transferring to this new channel. NITV was re-launched on 12 December 2012 by SBS as a free-to-air channel on [[Freeview (Australia)|Freeview]] channel 34. Among its launch day programmes were two live broadcasts from [[Uluru]], including ''From the Heart of Our Nation'', a two-hour event to mark the channel's launch at Noon, and a concert in primetime simulcast by [[SBS One]].&lt;ref name="NITV Replaces SBS4"&gt;

This civilization resulted from numerous exchanges in the cultural and scientific fields, based on the tolerance showed by the Normans towards the [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking populations and the [[Muslim]] settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White, Jr.: "The Byzantinization of Sicily", ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 42, No. 1 (1936), pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Sicily]] under the Normans became a crossroad for the interaction between the Norman and Latin [[Catholicism|Catholic]], Byzantine-[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and Arab-[[Islam]]ic cultures.

==Norman conquest of Southern Italy==
{{main|Norman conquest of southern Italy}}

==Norman conquest of Sicily==
[[File:Christ Pantokrator, Cathedral of Cefalù, Sicily.jpg|thumb|Byzantine-style mosaic of [[Christ Pantokrator]] in the [[Cefalù Cathedral]], erected by Roger II in 1131]]
In 965 [[Muslim]]s completed their [[History of Islam in southern Italy | conquest of Sicily]] from the [[Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire]]  following the fall of the final significant Greek citadel of [[Taormina]] in 962.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Seventy three years later, in 1038, Byzantine forces began a reconquest of Sicily under the Greek general [[George Maniakes]]. This invasion relied on a number of [[Norsemen|Norse]] mercenaries, the [[Varangian Guard|Varangian]]s, including the future king of Norway [[Harald Hardrada]], as well as on several contingents of [[italo-Normans|Normans]]. Although Maniakes' death in a Byzantine civil war in 1043 cut the invasion short, the Normans followed up on the advances made by the Byzantines and completed the conquest of the island from the [[Saracens]]. The Normans had been expanding south, as mercenaries and adventurers, driven by the myth of a happy and sunny island in the Southern Seas.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norman [[Robert Guiscard]], son of [[Tancred of Hauteville|Tancred]], [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|invaded Sicily]] in 1060. The island was split politically between three [[Arabs|Arab]] [[emirate|emir]]s, and the sizable [[Eastern Orthodox|Byzantine Christian]] population rebelled against the ruling Muslims. One year later [[Messina]] fell to troops under the leadership of Roger Bosso (the brother of Robert Guiscard and the future Count [[Roger I of Sicily]]), and in 1071 the Normans took [[Palermo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art139.htm |title= Saracen Door and Battle of Palermo |publisher= Bestofsicily.com |date= 2004 |accessdate= 28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the cities, each with a splendid harbor, dealt a severe blow to Muslim power on the island. Eventually Normans took all of Sicily. In 1091, [[Noto]] in the southern tip of Sicily and the island of [[Malta]], the last Arab strongholds, fell to the Christians.

By the 11th century Muslim power in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] had begun to wane.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Charles William Previté-Orton|Previté-Orton]] (1971), pp. 507-511.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Under Norman rule, Palermo confirmed its role as one of the great capitals of Europe and the Mediterranean.

==Norman conquest of Africa==
{{Main article|Kingdom of Africa}}
[[File:Regnonormanno1160.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The "Kingdom of Africa" (''Regno d'Africa'') pinpointed in red]]
The Kingdom of Africa was an extension of the frontier zone of the [[Siculo-Norman]] state in the former [[Roman province of Africa]]{{efn|Before it was finally conquered by the Muslims, this province was reorganised as the [[Exarchate of Africa|Byzantine exarchate of Africa]].}} (''[[Ifrīqiya]]'' in [[Tunisian Arabic]]), corresponding to [[Tunisia]] and parts of [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]] today.  The main primary sources for the kingdom are Arabic (Muslim);&lt;ref&gt;All the Arabic sources can be found in Michele Amari, ''Biblioteca arabo-sicula'' (Rome and Turin: 1880).&lt;/ref&gt; the Latin (Christian) sources are scanter. According to Hubert Houben, since "Africa" was never mentioned in the royal title of the kings of Sicily, "one ought not to speak of a ‘Norman kingdom of Africa’."&lt;ref&gt;Houben, ''Roger II'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "[Norman Africa] really amounted to a constellation of Norman-held towns along coastal Ifrīqiya."&lt;ref name=dalli79&gt;Dalli, "Bridging Europe and Africa", 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian conquest of Africa began under [[Roger II]] in 1146–48. Sicilian rule consisted of military garrisons in the major towns, exactions on the local Muslim population, protection of Christians and the minting of coin. The local aristocracy was largely left in place, and Muslim princes controlled the civil government under Sicilian oversight. Economic connections between Sicily and Africa, which were strong before the conquest, were strengthened, while ties between Africa and northern Italy were expanded.  Early in the reign of [[William I of Sicily|William I]], the "kingdom" of Africa fell to the [[Almohads]] (1158–60). Its most enduring legacy was the realignment of Mediterranean powers brought about by its demise and the Siculo-Almohad peace finalised in 1180.

An intense Norman-Arab-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] culture developed, exemplified by rulers such as [[Roger II of Sicily]], who had [[Islam]]ic soldiers, poets and scientists at his court,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p.147&lt;/ref&gt; and had [[Byzantine Greeks]], [[Christodulus|Christodoulos]], the famous [[George of Antioch]], and finally [[Philip of Mahdia]], serve successively as his ''ammiratus ammiratorum'' ("emir of emirs").&lt;ref&gt;Abulafia, David (2011) ''The Great Sea: A Human History of the Mediterranean''. (London: Allen Lane). {{ISBN|978-0-7139-9934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger II himself spoke [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] and was fond of [[Arab culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.177&lt;/ref&gt; He used Arab and Byzantine Greek troops and siege engines in his campaigns in southern Italy, and mobilized Arab and Byzantine architects to help his Normans build monuments in the Norman-Arab-Byzantine style. The various agricultural and industrial techniques which had been introduced by the Arabs in Sicily during the preceding two centuries were kept and further developed, allowing for the remarkable prosperity of the Island.&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[Transmission of the Greek Classics|Classical Greek works]], long lost to the Latin speaking West, were translated from Byzantine Greek manuscripts found in Sicily directly into Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David C. (ed.).  ''Science in the Middle Ages''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978. p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; For the following two hundred years, Sicily under Norman rule became a model which was widely admired throughout Europe and Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

The English historian John Julius Norwich remarked of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Norman Sicily stood forth in Europe --and indeed in the whole bigoted medieval world-- as an example of tolerance and enlightenment, a lesson in the respect that every man should feel for those whose blood and beliefs happen to differ from his own."&lt;br /&gt;[[John Julius Norwich]]&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in History Edition of Best of Sicily Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During Roger II's reign, the Kingdom of Sicily became increasingly characterized by its multi-ethnic composition and unusual religious tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art171.htm |title=Normans in Sicilian History |publisher=Bestofsicily.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic Normans, Langobards and native Sicilians, Muslim Arabs, and Orthodox Byzantine Greeks existed in a relative harmony for this time period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |title=Roger II&amp;nbsp;— Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523045823/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |archivedate=2007-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D61331F935A15757C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |title=Tracing The Norman Rulers of Sicily |publisher=New York Times |date=1987-04-26 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | first=Louis | last=Inturrisi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roger II was known to have planned for the establishment of an Empire that would have encompassed [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]] and the [[Crusader states]] in the [[Levant]] up until his death in 1154.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest geographical treatises of the Middle Ages was written for Roger II by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] scholar [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], and entitled [[Tabula Rogeriana|Kitab Rudjdjar]] ("The book of Roger").&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"&gt;Lewis, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 12th century, the population of Sicily is estimated to have been up to one-third [[Byzantine Greek]] speaking, with the remainder speaking [[Latin]] or [[Vulgar Latin]] dialects brought from mainland Italy ([[Gallo-Italic languages]] and [[Neapolitan language]]), [[Norman language|Norman]] and [[Sicilian Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Loud, G. A. |title=The Latin Church in Norman Italy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |page=494 |isbn=978-0-521-25551-6 |quote={{ISBN|0-521-25551-1}}" "At the end of the twelfth century&amp;nbsp;... While in Apulia Greeks were in a majority – and indeed present in any numbers at all – only in the Salento peninsula in the extreme south, at the time of the conquest they had an overwhelming preponderance in Lucaina and central and southern Calabria, as well as comprising anything up to a third of the population of Sicily, concentrated especially in the north-east of the island, the Val Demone. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the language of the court was [[Old Norman]] or [[Old French]] ([[Langues d'oïl|Langue d'oïl]]), all royal edicts were written in the language of the people they were addressed to: [[Latin]], Byzantine Greek, Arabic, or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;Aube, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; Roger's royal mantel, used for his coronation (and also used for the coronation of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]), bore an inscription in Arabic with the [[Hijri year|Hijri]] date of 528 (1133–1134).

Islamic authors marvelled at the forbearance of the Norman kings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"They [the Muslims] were treated kindly, and they were protected, even against the [[Franks]]. Because of that, they had great love for king Roger."&lt;br /&gt;[[Ibn al-Athir]]&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Aubé, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interactions continued with the succeeding Norman kings, for example under [[William II of Sicily]], as attested by the Spanish-Arab geographer [[Ibn Jubair]] who landed in the island after returning from a [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] in 1184. To his surprise, Ibn Jubair enjoyed a very warm reception by the Norman Christians. He was further surprised to find that even some Christians spoke Arabic and that several government officials were Muslim:&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The attitude of the king is really extraordinary. His attitude towards the Muslims is perfect: he gives them employment, he choses his officers among them, and all, or almost all, keep their faith secret and can remain faithful to the faith of Islam. The king has full confidence in the Muslims and relies on them to handle many of his affairs, including the most important ones, to the point that the Great Intendant for cooking is a Muslim (...) His [[vizier]]s and [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]]s are [[eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]], of which there are many, who are the members of his government and on whom he relies for his private affairs."&lt;br /&gt;Ibn Jubair, ''Rihla''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lewis, p. 148, also Aube, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ibn Jubair mentioned that some Christians in Palermo wore the Muslim dress and spoke Arabic. The Norman kings continued to strike coins in Arabic with [[Hegira]] dates. The registers at the Royal court were written in Arabic.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"/&gt; At one point, William II of Sicily is recorded to have said: "Every one of you should invoke the one he adores and of whom he follows the faith".&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norman-Arab-Byzantine art===
{{Further|Byzantine art}}
[[File:Arabo-NormanArchitecture.JPG|thumb|Arab-Norman art and architecture combined Occidental features (such as the Classical pillars and friezes) with typical Islamic decorations such as [[muqarnas]] and [[Arabic calligraphy|calligraphy]]&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Numerous artistic techniques from the Byzantine and Islamic world were also incorporated to form the basis of Arab-Norman art: inlays in mosaics or metals, sculpture of [[ivory]] or [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], sculpture of hard stones, bronze foundries, manufacture of silk (for which Roger II established a ''regium ergasterium'', a state enterprise which would give Sicily the monopoly of silk manufacture for all Western Europe).&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, pp. 164-165&lt;/ref&gt; During a raid on the Byzantine Empire, Roger II's admiral George of Antioch had transported the silk weavers from [[Thebes, Greece]], where they had formed a part of the, until then, closely guarded monopoly that was the [[Byzantine silk industry]].

===Norman-Arab-Byzantine architecture===
{{Further|Byzantine architecture}}
{{Further|Norman architecture}}
[[File:Monreale-bjs-3.jpg|thumb|left|The outsides of the principal doorways and their pointed arches of the [[Monreale]] cathedral are magnificently enriched with carving and colored [[inlay]], a curious combination of three styles—Norman-French, Byzantine and Arab]]

The new Norman rulers started to build various constructions in what is called the Arab-Norman style. They incorporated the best practices of Arab and Byzantine architecture into their own art.&lt;ref&gt;"Le genie architectural des Normands a su s’adapter aux lieux en prenant ce qu’il y a de meilleur dans le savoir-faire des batisseurs arabes et byzantins", ''Les Normands en Sicile'', p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of [[Saint-John of the Hermits]], was built in Palermo by Roger II around 1143–1148 in such a style. The church is notable for its brilliant red domes, which show clearly the persistence of Arab influences in Sicily at the time of its reconstruction in the 12th century. In her ''Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily'', [[Frances Minto Elliot|Frances Elliot]] described it as "... totally oriental... it would fit well in [[Baghdad]] or [[Damascus]]". The bell tower, with four orders of arcaded loggias, is instead a typical example of [[Gothic architecture]].

[[File:Chapelle Palatine.jpg|thumb|"The [[Cappella Palatina]], at Palermo, the most wonderful of Roger's churches, with Norman doors, Saracenic arches, Byzantine dome, and roof adorned with Arabic scripts, is perhaps the most striking product of the brilliant and mixed civilization over which the grandson of the Norman Trancred ruled" ([[EB1911]])]]

The [[Cappella Palatina]], also in Palermo, combines harmoniously a variety of styles: the [[Norman architecture]] and door decor, the Arabic arches and scripts adorning the roof, the Byzantine dome and mosaics. For instance, clusters of four eight-pointed stars, typical for Muslim design, are arranged on the ceiling so as to form a Christian [[cross]].

The [[Monreale]] cathedral is generally described as "Norman-Arab-Byzantine". The outsides of the principal doorways and their pointed arches are magnificently enriched with carving and colored inlay, a curious combination of three styles—Norman-French, Byzantine and Arab.

The [[Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio]] built in 1143 by Roger II's "emir of emirs" [[George of Antioch]] was originally consecrated as a [[Greek Orthodox]] church, according to its Greek-Arab bilingual foundation charter, and was built in the Byzantine [[Cross-in-square|Greek cross]] style with some Arab influences. Another unusual church from this period is the country church of [[Santi Pietro e Paolo d’Agrò]] in [[Casalvecchio Siculo]]; it has been described "one of the most sophisticated and coherent works of architecture to emerge from the Norman rule of the island".&lt;ref name=agro&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/22630|title=The architecture of the church of SS. Pietro e Paolo d'Agro, Sicily |last=Nicklies|first=Charles Edward|date=1992|website=Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship|publisher=University of Illinois|access-date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of Arab-Norman architecture include the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]], or [[Castelbuono]]. This style of construction persisted until the 14th and the 15th century, exemplified by the use of the [[cupola]].&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', pp. 53–57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission to Europe==
{{main|Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe}}

The points of contact between Europe and Islamic lands were multiple during the Middle Ages, with Sicily playing a key role in the transmission of knowledge to Europe, although less important than that of Spain.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.149"&gt;Lewis, p.149&lt;/ref&gt; The main points of transmission of Islamic knowledge to Europe were in Sicily, and in Islamic Spain, particularly in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] (with [[Gerard of Cremone]], 1114–1187, following the conquest of the city by the Spanish Christians in 1085). Many exchanges also occurred in the Levant due to the presence of the [[Crusaders]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Lebedel, p.110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Arabic and Greek art and science continued to be influential in Sicily during the two centuries following the Norman conquest. Norman rule formally ended in 1198 with the reign of [[Constance of Sicily]], and was replaced by that of the [[Swabia]]n [[Hohenstaufen Dynasty]].

In 1224 however, Frederick II, responding to religious uprisings in Sicily, expelled all Muslims from the island, transferring many to [[Lucera]] over the next two decades. In this controlled environment, they couldn't challenge royal authority and they benefited the crown in taxes and military service. Their numbers eventually reached between 15,000 and 20,000, leading Lucera to be called ''Lucaera Saracenorum'' because it represented the last stronghold of Islamic presence in Italy. The colony thrived for 75 years until it was sacked in 1300 by Christian forces under the command of [[Charles II of Naples]]. The city's Muslim inhabitants were exiled or sold into slavery,&lt;ref&gt;Julie Taylor.

Maria della Vittoria.

Even under [[Manfred of Sicily|Manfred]] (died in 1266) Islamic influence in Sicily persisted, but it had almost disappeared by the beginning of the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.149"/&gt; Latin progressively replaced Arabic and Greek, the last Sicilian document in the Arabic language is dated to 1245.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"/&gt;

{{Greek myth}}
The '''''Odyssey''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|d|ə|s|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Odyssey |title=Odyssey|work=[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Ὀδύσσεια}} ''Odýsseia'', {{IPA-el|o.dýs.sej.ja|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]) is one of two major ancient [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]] [[epic poetry|epic poem]]s attributed to [[Homer]]. It is, in part, a sequel to the ''[[Iliad]]'', the other work ascribed to Homer. The ''Odyssey'' is fundamental to the modern [[Western canon]]; it is the second-oldest extant work of Western literature, while the ''Iliad'' is the oldest. Scholars believe the ''Odyssey'' was composed near the end of the 8th century BC, somewhere in [[Ionia]], the Greek coastal region of [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref name="The Odyssey 2003"&gt;[[D.C.H. Rieu]]'s introduction to ''The Odyssey'' (Penguin, 2003), p. ''xi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem mainly focuses on the Greek hero [[Odysseus]] (known as [[wikt:Ulysses|Ulysses]] in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] myths), king of [[Ithaca]], and his journey home after the fall of [[Troy]]. It takes Odysseus ten years to reach [[Ithaca]] after the ten-year [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;The dog Argos dies ''autik' idont' Odusea eeikosto eniauto'' ("seeing Odysseus again in the twentieth year"), [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Od.+17.290 ''Odyssey'' 17.327]; cf. also [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Od.+2.129 2.174-6], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Od.+23.85 23.102], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Od.+23.129 23.170].&lt;/ref&gt; In his absence, it is assumed Odysseus has died, and his wife [[Penelope]] and son [[Telemachus]] must deal with a group of unruly suitors, the ''Mnesteres'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Μνηστῆρες}}) or [[Proci]], who compete for Penelope's hand in marriage.

The ''Odyssey'' continues to be read in the [[Homeric Greek]] and translated into modern languages around the world. Many scholars believe the original poem was composed in an [[oral tradition]] by an ''[[aoidos]]'' (epic poet/singer), perhaps a [[rhapsode]] (professional performer), and was more likely intended to be heard than read.&lt;ref name="The Odyssey 2003"/&gt;  The details of the ancient oral performance and the story's conversion to a written work inspire continual debate among scholars. The ''Odyssey'' was written in a poetic dialect of Greek—a literary amalgam of [[Aeolic Greek]], [[Ionic Greek]], and other [[Ancient Greek dialects]]—and comprises 12,110 lines of [[dactylic hexameter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Homer |authorlink=Homer |translator=Robert Fagles |others=Introduction by Bernard Knox |title=The Odyssey |year=1996 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=United States of America |isbn=978-0-14-026886-7 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Robin Lane |authorlink=Robin Lane Fox |title=The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian |year=2006 |publisher=Basic Books |location=United States of America |isbn=978-0-465-02496-4 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- some sources give a different number of lines, but 12,110 is the most often cited --&gt; Among the most noteworthy elements of the text are its [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear]] plot, and the influence on events of choices made by women and slaves, besides the actions of fighting men. In the [[English language]] as well as many others, the word [[wikt:odyssey|''odyssey'']] has come to refer to an epic voyage.

The ''Odyssey'' has a lost sequel, the ''[[Telegony]]'', which was not written by Homer. It was usually attributed in antiquity to [[Cinaethon of Sparta]]. In one source,{{which|date=October 2016}} the ''Telegony'' was said to have been stolen from [[Musaeus of Athens]] by either Eugamon or [[Eugammon of Cyrene]] (see [[Cyclic poets]]).

==Synopsis==

===Exposition===

[[File:Villa Romana de La Olmeda Mosaicos romanos 001 Ulises.jpg|thumb|A [[mosaic]] depicting [[Odysseus]], from the villa of [[La Olmeda]], [[Pedrosa de la Vega]], Spain, late 4th-5th centuries AD]]

The ''Odyssey'' begins after the end of the ten-year [[Trojan War]] (the subject of the ''[[Iliad]]''), and Odysseus has still not returned home from the war because he angered the god, [[Poseidon]]. Odysseus' son [[Telemachus]] is about 20 years old and is sharing his absent father's house on the island of [[Ithaca]] with his mother [[Penelope]] and a crowd of 108 boisterous young men, "the Suitors", whose aim is to persuade Penelope to marry one of them, all the while reveling in Odysseus' palace and eating up his wealth.

Odysseus' protectress, the goddess [[Athena]], requests to [[Zeus]], king of the [[Odyssean gods|gods]], to finally allow Odysseus to return home when Odysseus' enemy, the god of the sea [[Poseidon]], is absent from [[Mount Olympus]] to accept a sacrifice in [[Ethiopia]]. Then, disguised as a [[Taphians|Taphian]] chieftain named [[Mentes (King of the Taphians)|Mentes]], she visits Telemachus to urge him to search for news of his father. He offers her hospitality; they observe the suitors dining rowdily while the bard [[Phemius]] performs a narrative poem for them. Penelope objects to Phemius' theme, the "Return from Troy",&lt;ref&gt;This theme once existed in the form of another epic, ''[[Nostoi]]'', of which only fragments remain.&lt;/ref&gt; because it reminds her of her missing husband, but Telemachus rebuts her objections, asserting his role as head of the household.

That night Athena, disguised as Telemachus, finds a ship and crew for the true prince. The next morning, Telemachus calls an assembly of citizens of Ithaca to discuss what should be done with the suitors. Telemachus is scoffed by the insolent suitors, particularly by their leaders [[Antinous son of Eupeithes|Antinous]], [[Eurymachus]], and [[Leiocritus]].  Accompanied by Athena (now disguised as [[Mentor (Odyssey)|Mentor]]), he departs for the Greek mainland and the household of [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], most venerable of the Greek warriors at Troy, who resided in [[Pylos]] after the war.

From there, Telemachus rides overland, accompanied by Nestor's son [[Peisistratus (Odyssey)|Peisistratus]], to [[Sparta]], where he finds [[Menelaus]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who are now reconciled. While Helen laments the fit of lust brought on by Aphrodite that sent her to Troy with Paris, Menelaus recounts how she betrayed the Greeks by attempting to imitate the voices of the soldiers' wives while they were inside the [[Trojan Horse]]. Telemachus also hears from Helen, who is the first to recognize him, that she pities him because Odysseus was not there for him in his childhood because he went to Troy to fight for her and also about his exploit of stealing the Palladium, or the Luck of Troy, where she was the only one to recognize him. Menelaus, meanwhile, also praises Odysseus as an irreproachable comrade and friend, lamenting the fact that they were not only unable to return together from Troy but that Odysseus is yet to return.

Both Helen and Menelaus also say that they returned to [[Sparta]] after a long voyage by way of [[Egypt]]. There, on the island of [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]], Menelaus encountered the old sea-god [[Proteus]], who told him that Odysseus was a captive of the nymph [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]. Incidentally, Telemachus learns the fate of Menelaus' brother [[Agamemnon]], king of [[Mycenae]] and leader of the Greeks at Troy: he was murdered on his return home by his wife [[Clytemnestra]] and her lover [[Aegisthus]]. The story briefly shifts to the suitors, who have only just now realized that Telemachus is gone. Angry, they formulate a plan to ambush his ship and kill him as he sails back home. Penelope overhears their plot and worries for her son's safety.

===Escape to the Phaeacians===

[[File:Odysseus And Nausicaä - Project Gutenberg eText 13725.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Charles Gleyre]], ''[[Odysseus]] and [[Nausicaä]]'']]

The second part recounts the story of Odysseus. In the course of his seven years in captivity on [[Ogygia]], the island of [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], she has fallen deeply in love with him, even though he has consistently spurned her offer of immortality as her husband and still mourns for home. She is ordered to release him by the messenger god [[Hermes]], who has been sent by Zeus in response to Athena's plea. Odysseus builds a raft and is given clothing, food, and drink by Calypso. When Poseidon learns that Odysseus has escaped, he wrecks the raft but, helped by a veil given by the sea nymph [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], Odysseus swims ashore on [[Scheria|Scherie]], the island of the Phaeacians. Naked and exhausted, he hides in a pile of leaves and falls asleep. The next morning, awakened by the laughter of girls, he sees the young [[Nausicaä]], who has gone to the seashore with her maids to wash clothes after Athena told her in a dream to do so. He appeals to her for help. She encourages him to seek the hospitality of her parents, [[Arete (mythology)|Arete]] and [[Alcinous]] (or Alkinous). Odysseus is welcomed and is not at first asked for his name, but Alcinous promises to provide him a ship to return him to his home country. He remains for several days, and is goaded into taking part in a [[discus throw]] by the taunts of [[Euryalus (Phaeacian)|Euryalus]], impressing the Phaeacians with his incredible athletic ability. Afterwards, he hears the blind singer [[Demodocus (Odyssey character)|Demodocus]] perform two narrative poems. The first is an otherwise obscure incident of the Trojan War, the "Quarrel of Odysseus and [[Achilles]]"; the second is the amusing tale of a love affair between two Olympian gods, [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]]. Finally, Odysseus asks Demodocus to return to the Trojan War theme and tell of the [[Trojan Horse]], a stratagem in which Odysseus had played a leading role. Unable to hide his emotion as he relives this episode, Odysseus at last reveals his identity. He then begins to tell the story of his return from Troy.

===Odysseus' account of his adventures===

[[File:Francesco Hayez 028.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''Odysseus Overcome by [[Demodocus (Odyssey character)|Demodocus]]' Song'', by [[Francesco Hayez]], 1813–15]]

Odysseus goes back in time and recounts his story to the Phaeacians. After a failed piratical raid on [[Ismara|Ismaros]] in the land of the [[Cicones]], Odysseus and his twelve ships were driven off course by storms. Odysseus visited the lethargic [[Lotus-Eaters]] who gave his men their fruit that would have caused them to forget their homecoming had Odysseus not dragged them back to the ship by force. Afterwards, Odysseus and his men landed on a lush, uninhabited island near the land of the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]]. The men then landed on shore and entered the cave of [[Polyphemus]], where they found all the cheeses and meat they desired. Upon returning home, Polyphemus sealed the entrance with a massive boulder and proceeded to eat Odysseus' men. Odysseus devised an escape plan in which he, identifying himself as "Nobody", plied Polyphemus with wine and blinded him with a wooden stake. When Polyphemus cried out, his neighbors left after Polyphemus claimed that "Nobody" had attacked him. Odysseus and his men finally left the cave by hiding on the underbellies of the sheep as they were let out of the cave. While they were escaping, however, Odysseus foolishly taunted Polyphemus and revealed his true identity. Recalling that had been prophesied by appeals to his father Poseidon. Poseidon then cursed Odysseus to wander the sea for ten years, during which he would lose all his crew and return home through the aid of others. After the escape, Odysseus and his crew stayed with [[Aeolus (son of Hippotes)|Aeolus]], a king endowed by the gods with the winds. He gave Odysseus a leather bag containing all the winds, except the west wind, a gift that should have ensured a safe return home. Just as Ithaca came into sight, the greedy sailors naively opened the bag while Odysseus slept, thinking it contained gold. All of the winds flew out and the resulting storm drove the ships back the way they had come. Aeolus, recognizing that Odysseus has drawn the ire of the gods, refused to further assist him.

The men then re-embarked and encountered the cannibalistic [[Laestrygonians]]. All of Odysseus' ships except his own entered the harbor of the Laestrygonians' Island and were immediately destroyed. He sailed on and reached the island of [[Aeaea]] where he visited the witch-goddess [[Circe]], daughter of the sun-god [[Helios]]. She turned half of his men into swine after feeding them drugged cheese and wine. Hermes warned Odysseus about Circe and gave Odysseus an herb called ''[[moly (herb)|moly]]'' which gave him resistance to Circe's magic. Odysseus forced the now-powerless Circe to change his men back to their human form, and was subsequently seduced by her. They remained with her on the island for one year, while they feasted and drank. Finally, guided by Circe's instructions, Odysseus and his crew crossed the ocean and reached a harbor at the western edge of the world, where Odysseus sacrificed to the dead. He first encountered the spirit of [[Elpenor]], a crewman who had gotten drunk and fallen from a roof to his death on Aeaea. Elpenor's ghost told Odysseus to bury his body, which Odysseus promised to do. Odysseus then summoned the spirit of the prophet [[Tiresias]] for advice on how to appease Poseidon upon his return home, and was told that he may return home if he is able to stay himself and his crew from eating the sacred livestock of [[Helios]] on the island of [[Thrinacia]] and that failure to do so would result in the loss of his ship and his entire crew. Next Odysseus met the spirit of his own mother, [[Anticlea]], who had died of grief during his long absence. From her, he got his first news of his own household, threatened by the greed of the Suitors. Finally, he met the spirits of famous men and women. Notably, he encountered the spirit of Agamemnon, of whose murder he now learned, and Achilles, who lamented the woes of the land of the dead but was comforted in hearing of the success of his son [[Neoptolemus]] (for Odysseus' encounter with the dead, see also ''[[Nekuia]]'').

[[File:Odysseus Sirens BM E440 n2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Odysseus and the Sirens, eponymous vase of the [[Siren Painter]], c. 480-470 BC ([[British Museum]])]]

Returning to Aeaea, they buried Elpenor and were advised by Circe on the remaining stages of the journey. They skirted the land of the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, who sang an enchanting song that normally caused passing sailors to steer toward the rocks, only to hit them and sink. All of the sailors had their ears plugged up with beeswax, except for Odysseus, who was tied to the mast as he wanted to hear the song. He told his sailors not to untie him as it would only make him want to drown himself. They then passed between the six-headed monster [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]], narrowly avoiding death, even though Scylla snatched up six men. Next, they landed on the island of [[Thrinacia]], with the crew overriding Odysseus's wishes to remain away from the island. Zeus caused a storm which prevented them leaving, causing them to deplete the food given to them by Circe. While Odysseus was away praying, his men ignored the warnings of Tiresias and Circe and hunted the sacred cattle of Helios. The Sun God insisted that Zeus punish the men for this sacrilege. They suffered a shipwreck as they were driven towards Charybdis. All but Odysseus were drowned. Odysseus clung to a fig tree above Charybdis. Washed ashore on the island of [[Ogygia]], he was compelled to remain there as Calypso's lover, bored, homesick and trapped on her small island, until she was ordered by Zeus, via Hermes, to release Odysseus.
Odysseus did not realise how long it would take to get home to his family.

===Return to Ithaca===

[[File:Giuseppe Bottani - Athena revealing Ithaca to Ulysses.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|''[[Athena]] Revealing Ithaca to Ulysses'' by [[Giuseppe Bottani]] (18th century)]]

Having listened with rapt attention to his story, the [[Phaeacians]] agree to provide Odysseus with more treasure than he would have received from the spoils of Troy. They deliver him at night, while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbour on Ithaca. Poseidon, offended that the Phaeacians have returned Odysseus home, destroys the Phaeacian ship on its return voyage, and the city sacrifices to Poseidon and agrees to stop giving escorts to strangers to appease him. Odysseus awakens and believes that he has been dropped on a distant land before Athena appears to him and reveals that he is indeed on Ithaca. She then hides his treasure in a nearby cave and disguises him as an elderly beggar so he can see how things stand in his household. He finds his way to the hut of one of his own slaves, the swineherd [[Eumaeus]], who treats him hospitably and speaks favorably of Odysseus. After dinner, the disguised Odysseus tells the farm laborers a fictitious tale of himself: he was born in [[Crete]], had led a party of Cretans to fight alongside other Greeks in the Trojan War, and had then spent seven years at the court of the king of Egypt, finally shipwrecking in [[Thesprotia]] and crossing from there to Ithaca. He further promises the men of the return of Odysseus, but his promises are wearily discounted by the men.

Meanwhile, Telemachus sails home from Sparta, evading an ambush set by the Suitors. He disembarks on the coast of Ithaca and makes for Eumaeus's hut. Father and son meet; Odysseus identifies himself to Telemachus (but still not to Eumaeus), and they decide that the Suitors must be killed. Telemachus goes home first. Accompanied by Eumaeus, Odysseus returns to his own house, still pretending to be a beggar. When Odysseus' dog (who was a puppy before he left) saw him, he becomes so excited that he dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homer|title=The Odyssey|page=Scroll 17 Line 8–8|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0218:book=17:card=8|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is ridiculed by the Suitors in his own home, especially by one extremely impertinent man named [[Antinous son of Eupeithes|Antinous]]. Odysseus meets Penelope and tests her intentions by saying he once met Odysseus in Crete. Closely questioned, he adds that he had recently been in Thesprotia and had learned something there of Odysseus's recent wanderings.

Odysseus's identity is discovered by the housekeeper, [[Eurycleia]], when she recognizes an old scar as she is washing his feet. Eurycleia tries to tell Penelope about the beggar's true identity, but Athena makes sure that Penelope cannot hear her. Odysseus then swears Eurycleia to secrecy.

===Slaying of the Suitors===

[[File:Thomas Degeorge Ulysse.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Ulysse et Télémaque Massacrent les Prétendants de Pénélope'' by [[Thomas Degeorge]] (1812)]]

The next day, at Athena's prompting, Penelope maneuvers the Suitors into competing for her hand with an archery competition using Odysseus' bow. The man who can string the bow and shoot it through a dozen axe heads would win. Odysseus takes part in the competition himself: he alone is strong enough to string the bow and shoot it through the dozen axe heads, making him the winner. He then throws off his rags and kills Antinous with his next arrow. Then, with the help of Athena, Odysseus, Telemachus, Eumaeus, and [[Philoetius]] the cowherd he kills the other Suitors, first using the rest of the arrows and then by swords and spears once both sides armed themselves. Once the battle is won, Odysseus and Telemachus also hang twelve of their household maids whom Eurycleia identifies as guilty of betraying Penelope or having sex with the Suitors. They mutilate and kill the goatherd [[Melanthius (Odyssey)|Melanthius]], who had mocked and abused Odysseus and brought weapons and armor to the suitors. Now, at last, Odysseus identifies himself to Penelope. She is hesitant but recognizes him when he mentions that he made their bed from an olive tree still rooted to the ground. Many modern and ancient scholars take this to be the original ending of the ''Odyssey'', and the rest to be an interpolation.

The next day he and Telemachus visit the country farm of his old father [[Laertes]], who likewise accepts his identity only when Odysseus correctly describes the orchard that Laertes had previously given him.

The citizens of Ithaca have followed Odysseus on the road, planning to avenge the killing of the Suitors, their sons. Their leader points out that Odysseus has now caused the deaths of two generations of the men of Ithaca: his sailors, not one of whom survived; and the Suitors, whom he has now executed (albeit rightly). Athena intervenes in a ''[[Deus ex machina|dea ex machina]]'' and persuades both sides to give up the [[feud|vendetta]]. After this, Ithaca is at peace once more, concluding the ''Odyssey''.

==Character of Odysseus==

{{Main|Odysseus}}

[[File:Mosaïque d'Ulysse et les sirènes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|A Roman [[mosaic]] depicting a maritime scene with [[Odysseus]] (Latin: Ulysses) and [[Siren (mythology)|the Sirens]], from [[Carthage]], 2nd century AD, now in the [[Bardo Museum]], [[Tunisia]]]]

Odysseus' name means "trouble" in Greek, referring to both the giving and receiving of trouble—as is often the case in his wanderings. An early example of this is the boar hunt that gave Odysseus the scar by which Eurycleia recognizes him; Odysseus is injured by the boar and responds by killing it. Odysseus' heroic trait is his ''mētis'', or "cunning intelligence". He is often described as the "Peer of [[Zeus]] in Counsel".  This intelligence is most often manifested by his use of disguise and deceptive speech. His disguises take forms both physical (altering his appearance) and verbal, such as telling the [[Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] that his name is {{lang|grc|[[Outis|Οὖτις]]}}, "Nobody", then escaping after blinding Polyphemus. When asked by other Cyclopes why he is screaming, Polyphemus replies that "Nobody" is hurting him, so the others assume that "If alone as you are [Polyphemus] none uses violence on you, why, there is no avoiding the sickness sent by great Zeus; so you had better pray to your father, the lord Poseidon".&lt;ref&gt;From the Odyssey of Homer translated by [[Richmond Lattimore]] [Book 9, page 147/8, lines 410 - 412].&lt;/ref&gt; The most evident flaw that Odysseus sports is that of his arrogance and his pride, or ''[[hubris]].'' As he sails away from the island of the Cyclopes, he shouts his name and boasts that nobody can defeat the "Great Odysseus". The Cyclops then throws the top half of a mountain at him and prays to his father, Poseidon, saying that Odysseus has blinded him. This enrages Poseidon, causing the god to thwart Odysseus' homecoming for a very long time.

==Structure==
The ''Odyssey'' is written in [[dactylic hexameter]]. It opens ''[[in medias res]]'', in the middle of the overall story, with prior events described through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] or storytelling. This device is also used by later authors of literary epics, such as [[Virgil]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Luís de Camões]] in ''[[Os Lusíadas]]''&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11198/ |title = The Lusiads |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1800–1882 |accessdate = 2013-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Pope]] in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.

The first four books of the poem trace [[Telemachus]]' efforts to assert control of the household, and then, at Athena's advice, his efforts to search for news of his long-lost father. Then the scene shifts: Odysseus has been a captive of the beautiful nymph [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], with whom he has spent seven of his ten lost years. Released by the intercession of his patroness [[Athena]], through the aid of [[Hermes]], he departs, but his raft is destroyed by his divine enemy [[Poseidon]], who is angry because Odysseus blinded his son, [[Polyphemus]].  When Odysseus washes up on [[Scheria|Scherie]], home to the [[Phaeacians]], he is assisted by the young [[Nausicaä]] and is treated hospitably. In return, he satisfies the Phaeacians' curiosity, telling them, and the reader, of all his adventures since departing from Troy. The shipbuilding Phaeacians then loan him a ship to return to [[Ithaca]], where he is aided by the swineherd [[Eumaeus]], meets Telemachus, regains his household by killing the Suitors, and is reunited with his faithful wife, [[Penelope]].

All ancient and nearly all modern editions and translations of the ''Odyssey'' are divided into 24 books. This division is convenient, but it may not be original. Many scholars{{who|date=June 2017}} believe it was developed by [[Alexandrian scholarship|Alexandrian]] editors of the 3rd century BC. In the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], moreover, several of the books (individually and in groups) were given their own titles: the first four books, focusing on Telemachus, are commonly known as the ''[[Telemachy]]''. Odysseus' narrative, Book 9, featuring his encounter with the cyclops Polyphemus, is traditionally called the ''Cyclopeia''. Book 11, the section describing his meeting with the spirits of the dead is known as the ''[[Nekuia]]''. Books 9 through 12, wherein Odysseus recalls his adventures for his Phaeacian hosts, are collectively referred to as the ''Apologoi'': Odysseus' "stories". Book 22, wherein Odysseus kills all the Suitors, has been given the title ''Mnesterophonia'': "slaughter of the Suitors". This concludes the Greek [[Epic Cycle]], though fragments remain of the "alternative ending" of sorts known as the ''[[Telegony]]''.

''Telegony'' aside, the last 548 lines of the ''Odyssey'', corresponding to Book 24, are believed by many scholars to have been added by a slightly later poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carne-Ross|first1=D. S.|article=The Poem of Odysseus|title=The Odyssey, translated by Robert Fitzgerald|date=1998|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0-374-52574-3|page=lxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several passages in earlier books seem to be setting up the events of Book 24, so if it were indeed a later addition, the offending editor would seem to have changed earlier text as well. For more about varying views on the origin, authorship and unity of the poem see [[Homeric scholarship]].

==Geography of the ''Odyssey''==
{{Main|Homer's Ithaca|Geography of the Odyssey}}
The events in the main sequence of the ''Odyssey'' (excluding Odysseus' embedded narrative of his wanderings) take place in the [[Peloponnese]] and in what are now called the [[Ionian Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 1.2.15, quoted by [[Moses I. Finley]], ''The World of Odysseus'', rev. ed. 1976:33.&lt;/ref&gt; There are difficulties in the apparently simple identification of [[Ithaca]], the homeland of Odysseus, which may or may not be the same island that is now called Ithakē (Ιθάκη). The wanderings of Odysseus as told to the Phaeacians, and the location of the Phaeacians' own island of [[Scheria]], pose more fundamental problems, if geography is to be applied: scholars, both ancient and modern, are divided as to whether or not any of the places visited by Odysseus (after [[Ismara|Ismaros]] and before his return to [[Ithaca]]) are real.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2008, ch. "Finding Neverland"; Lane summarizes the literature in notes and bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on the ''Odyssey''==
[[File:Humbaba deamon-AO 9034-IMG 0655-black.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Terracotta plaque of the Mesopotamian ogre [[Humbaba]], believed to be a possible inspiration for the figure of [[Polyphemus]]]]

Scholars have seen strong influences from Near Eastern mythology and literature in the ''Odyssey''. [[Martin Litchfield West|Martin West]] has noted substantial parallels between the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' and the ''Odyssey''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Litchfield West|West, Martin.]] ''The East Face of Helicon: West Asiatic Elements in Greek Poetry and Myth''. (Oxford 1997) 402-417.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Odysseus and [[Gilgamesh]] are known for traveling to the ends of the earth, and on their journeys go to the land of the dead. On his voyage to the underworld, Odysseus follows instructions given to him by [[Circe]]. Her island, [[Aeaea]], is located at the edges of the world and seems to have close associations with the sun. Like Odysseus, Gilgamesh gets directions on how to reach the land of the dead from a divine helper: in this case, the goddess [[Siduri]], who, like Circe, dwells by the sea at the ends of the earth. Her home is also associated with the sun: Gilgamesh reaches Siduri's house by passing through a tunnel underneath Mt. [[Mashu]], the high mountain from which the sun comes into the sky. West argues that the similarity of Odysseus' and Gilgamesh's journeys to the edges of the earth are the result of the influence of the Gilgamesh epic upon the ''Odyssey''.

In 1914, paleontologist [[Othenio Abel]] surmised the origins of the cyclops to be the result of ancient Greeks finding an elephant skull. The enormous nasal passage in the middle of the forehead could have looked like the eye socket of a giant, to those who had never seen a living elephant.&lt;ref&gt;Abel's surmise is noted by [[Adrienne Mayor]], ''The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times'' (Princeton University Press) 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Classical scholars, on the other hand, have long realized that the story of the cyclops was originally a Greek [[fairy tale|folk tale]], which existed independently of the ''Odyssey'' and which only became embedded in it at a later date. Similar stories are found in cultures across Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2000 127–131"&gt;{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages= 127–131|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Fairytale_in_the_Ancient_World.html?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this explanation, the cyclops was originally simply a giant or ogre, much like [[Humbaba]] in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh''.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2000 127–131"/&gt; The detail about it having one eye was simply invented in order to explain how the creature was so easily blinded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages= 124–125|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Fairytale_in_the_Ancient_World.html?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Homecoming ===
[[File:Homerus - Odissea, 1794 - 3939651 F.jpg|thumb|''Odissea'' (1794)]]
An important factor to consider about Odysseus' homecoming is the hint at potential endings to the epic by using other characters as parallels for his journey.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Homecomings"&gt;Thornton, Agathe. "The Homecomings of the Achaeans." ''People and Themes in Homer's Odyssey''. Dunedin: U of Otago in Association with Methuen, London, 1970. 1-15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, one example is that of [[Agamemnon]]'s homecoming versus Odysseus' homecoming. Upon Agamemnon's return, his wife [[Clytemnestra]] and her lover, [[Aegisthus]] kill Agamemnon. Agamemnon's son, [[Orestes]], out of vengeance for his father's death, kills Aegisthus. This parallel compares the death of the suitors to the death of Aegisthus and sets Orestes up as an example for [[Telemachus]].&lt;ref name="Thornton on Homecomings" /&gt; Also, because Odysseus knows about Clytemnestra's betrayal, Odysseus returns home in disguise in order to test the loyalty of his own wife, [[Penelope]].&lt;ref name="Thornton on Homecomings" /&gt;  Later, Agamemnon praises Penelope for not killing Odysseus. It is because of Penelope that Odysseus has fame and a successful homecoming. This successful homecoming is unlike [[Achilles]], who has fame but is dead, and Agamemnon, who had an unsuccessful homecoming resulting in his death.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Homecomings" /&gt;

=== Wandering ===

Only two of Odysseus's adventures are described by the poet. The rest of Odysseus' adventures are recounted by Odysseus himself. The two scenes that the poet describes are Odysseus on [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]'s island and Odysseus' encounter with the Phaeacians. These scenes are told by the poet to represent an important transition in Odysseus' journey: being concealed to returning home.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings"&gt;Thornton, Agathe. "The Wanderings of Odysseus." ''People and Themes in Homer's Odyssey''. Dunedin: U of Otago in Association with Methuen, London, 1970. 16-37. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Calypso's name means "concealer" or "one who conceals," and that is exactly what she does with Odysseus.&lt;ref&gt;Calypso and Odysseus. (n.d.). Retrieved April 28, 2016, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/calypso-odysseus-greek-myth/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Calypso keeps Odysseus concealed from the world and unable to return home. After leaving Calypso's island, the poet describes Odysseus' encounters with the Phaeacians—those who "convoy without hurt to all men"&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 8.566. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Translated by Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975.)&lt;/ref&gt;—which represents his transition from not returning home to returning home.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt; Also, during Odysseus' journey, he encounters many beings that are close to the gods. These encounters are useful in understanding that Odysseus is in a world beyond man and that influences the fact he cannot return home.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt; These beings that are close to the gods include the Phaeacians who lived near Cyclopes,&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 6.4-5. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Translated by Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975.)&lt;/ref&gt; whose king, [[Alcinous]], is the great-grandson of the king of the giants, [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Eurymedon]], and the grandson of Poseidon.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt; Some of the other characters that Odysseus encounters are [[Polyphemus]] who is the cyclops son of Poseidon, God of Oceans,  [[Circe]] who is the sorceress daughter of the Sun that turns men into animals, Calypso who is a goddess, and the [[Laestrygonians]] who are cannibalistic giants.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt;

=== Guest-friendship ===

Throughout the course of the epic, Odysseus encounters several examples of ''[[xenia (Greek)|xenia]]'' ("guest-friendship"), which provide models of how hosts should and should not act.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Guest-Friendship"&gt;Thornton, Agathe. "Guest-Friendship". ''People and Themes in Homer's Odyssey''. Dunedin: U of Otago in Association with Methuen, London, 1970. 38-46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Phaeacians demonstrate exemplary guest-friendship by feeding Odysseus, giving him a place to sleep, and granting him a safe voyage home, which are all things a good host should do. Polyphemus demonstrates poor guest-friendship. His only "gift" to Odysseus is that he will eat him last.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Guest-Friendship" /&gt; Calypso also exemplifies poor guest-friendship because she does not allow Odysseus to leave her island.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Guest-Friendship" /&gt; Another important factor to guest-friendship is that kingship implies generosity. It is assumed that a king has the means to be a generous host and is more generous with his own property.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Guest-Friendship" /&gt; This is best seen when Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, begs Antinous, one of the suitors, for food and Antinous denies his request. Odysseus essentially says that while Antinous may look like a king, he is far from a king since he is not generous.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 17.415-44. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testing ===
[[File:Odysseus und Penelope (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Penelope questions Odysseus to prove his identity.]]

Another theme throughout the ''Odyssey'' is testing.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Themes" /&gt; This occurs in two distinct ways. Odysseus tests the loyalty of others and others test Odysseus' identity. An example of Odysseus testing the loyalties of others is when he returns home.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Themes" /&gt; Instead of immediately revealing his identity, he arrives disguised as a beggar and then proceeds to determine who in his house has remained loyal to him and who has helped the suitors. After Odysseus reveals his true identity, the characters test Odysseus' identity to see if he really is who he says he is.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Themes" /&gt; For instance, Penelope tests Odysseus' identity by saying that she will move the bed into the other room for him. This is a difficult task since it is made out of a living tree that would require being cut down, a fact that only the real Odysseus would know, thus proving his identity. For more information on the progression of testing type scenes, read more below.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Themes"&gt;Thornton, Agathe. "Testing." ''People and Themes in Homer's Odyssey''. Dunedin: U of Otago in Association with Methuen, London, 1970. 47-51. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Omens ===

Omens occur frequently throughout the ''Odyssey,'' as well as in many other epics. Within the Odyssey, omens frequently involve birds.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt; It is important to note who receives the omens and what these omens mean to the characters and to the epic as a whole. For instance, bird omens are shown to Telemachus, Penelope, Odysseus, and the suitors.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt; Telemachus and Penelope receive their omens as well in the form of words, sneezes, and dreams.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt; However, Odysseus is the only character who receives thunder or lightning as an omen.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 20.103-4. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 21.414. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; This is important to note because the thunder came from Zeus, the king of the gods. This direct relationship between Zeus and Odysseus represents the kingship of Odysseus.&lt;ref name="Lattimore"&gt;Thornton, Agathe. "Omens." ''People and Themes in Homer's Odyssey''. Dunedin: U of Otago in Association with Methuen, London, 1970. 52-57. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scenes ==
{{further|Type scene}}
[[File:Odysseus and Euryclea by Christian Gottlob Heyne - Project Gutenberg eText 13725.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|''Odysseus and Eurycleia'' by [[Christian Gottlob Heyne]]]]

=== Finding scenes ===

Finding scenes occur in the ''Odyssey'' when a character discovers another character within the epic. Finding scenes proceed as followed:&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt;
# The character encounters or finds another character.
# The encountered character is identified and described.
# The character approaches and then converses with the found character.
These finding scenes can be identified several times throughout the epic including when Telemachus and [[Peisistratos|Pisistratus]] find [[Menelaus]] when Calypso finds Odysseus on the beach, and when the suitor [[Amphimedon]] finds Agamemnon in Hades.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt;

=== Guest-friendship ===

Guest-friendship is also a theme in the ''Odyssey'', but it too follows a very specific pattern. This pattern is:
# The arrival and the reception of the guest.
# Bathing or providing fresh clothes to the guest.
# Providing food and drink to the guest.
# Questions may be asked of the guest and entertainment should be provided by the host.
# The guest should be given a place to sleep and both the guest and host retire for the night.
# The guest and host exchange gifts, the guest is granted a safe journey home and departs.
Another important factor of guest-friendship is not keeping the guest longer than they wish and also promising their safety while they are a guest within the host's home.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Guest-Friendship" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt;

=== Testing ===

While testing is a theme with the epic, it also has a very specific type scene that accompanies it as well. Throughout the epic, the testing of others follows a typical pattern. This pattern is:
# Odysseus is hesitant to question the loyalties of others.
# Odysseus tests the loyalties of others by questioning them.
# The characters reply to Odysseus' questions.
# Odysseus proceeds to reveal his identity.
# The characters test Odysseus' identity.
# There is a rise of emotions associated with Odysseus' recognition, usually lament or joy.
# Finally, the reconciled characters work together.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Themes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt;

=== Omens ===

Omens are another example of a type scene in the ''Odyssey.'' Two important parts of an omen type scene are the recognition of the omen and then the interpretation.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt; In the ''Odyssey'' specifically, there are several omens involving birds. All of the bird omens—with the exception of the first one in the epic—show large birds attacking smaller birds.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; Accompanying each omen is a wish which can be either explicitly stated or only implied.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt; For example, Telemachus wishes for vengeance&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 2.143-5. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; and for Odysseus to be home,&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 15.155-9. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; Penelope wishes for Odysseus' return,&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 19.136. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; and the suitors wish for the death of Telemachus.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 20.240-243. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; The omens seen in the ''Odyssey'' are also a recurring theme throughout the epic.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;Edwards, Mark W. "Homer and the Oral Tradition." ''Oral Tradition'' 7.2 (1992): 284-330. Web. 06 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==

[[File:Annibale Carracci, The Cyclops Polyphemus.jpg|thumb|''The Cyclops Polyphemus'' by [[Annibale Carracci]] (between 1595 and 1605), showing a scene shared between the ''Odyssey'' and [[Euripides]]'s ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'' (1922)]]

The ''Odyssey'' is regarded as one of the most important foundational works of [[western literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahr|first1=Arthur|title=Foundation of Western Literature|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/literature/21l-001-foundations-of-western-culture-homer-to-dante-fall-2008/|website=MIT Open Courseware|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded by western literary critics as a timeless classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cartwright|first1=Mark|title=Odyssey|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Odyssey/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straightforward retellings of the ''Odyssey'' have flourished ever since the [[Middle Ages]]. ''Merugud Uilix maicc Leirtis'' ("On the Wandering of Ulysses, son of Laertes") is an eccentric [[Old Irish]] version of the material; the work exists in a 12th-century AD manuscript, which linguists believe is based on an 8th-century original.&lt;ref&gt;Merugud Uilix maicc Leirtis. Kuno Meyer (ed), First edition [v + 36 pp.; v–xii Introduction; 1–15 Critical edition of Text; 16–29 Translation; 30–36 Index Verborum.] David Nutt270 Strand, London (1886)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/meruguduilixmai00homegoog ''Merugud Uilix maicc Leirtis: the Irish Odyssey''], ed. Kuno Meyer, London: 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'', first performed in 1640, is an opera by [[Claudio Monteverdi]] based on the second half of Homer's ''Odyssey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2007/03/23/9078832/monteverdis-the-return-of-ulysses|title=Monteverdi's 'The Return of Ulysses'|last=|first=|date=|website=NPR.org|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first canto of [[Ezra Pound]]'s ''[[The Cantos]]'' (1917) is both a translation and a retelling of Odysseus' [[katabasis|journey to the underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Approaches to Ezra Pound|last=Hesse|first=Eva|publisher=University of California Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=126|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem "[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson is narrated by an aged Ulysses who is determined to continue to live life to the fullest. ''[[The Odyssey (TV miniseries)|The Odyssey]]'' (1997), a made-for-TV movie directed by [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], is a slightly abbreviated version of the epic.

Other authors have composed more creative reworkings of the poem, often updated to address contemporary themes and concerns. ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'' by [[Euripides]], the only [[extant literature|fully extant]] [[satyr play]],&lt;ref&gt;Euripides. McHugh, Heather, trans. ''Cyclops; Greek Tragedy in New Translations''. Oxford Univ.

[[File:JoyceUlysses2.jpg|thumb|left|Front cover of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'']]

[[James Joyce]]'s [[modernist literature|modernist]] novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) is a retelling of the ''Odyssey'' set in modern-day [[Dublin]]. Each chapter in the book has an assigned theme, technique, and correspondences between its characters and those of Homer's ''Odyssey''.&lt;ref name="The Classical Tradition"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|last2=Most|first2=Glenn W.|last3=Settis|first3=Salvatore|title=The Classical Tradition|date=2010|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|page=653}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Homer's Daughter]]'' by [[Robert Graves]] is a novel imagining how the version we have might have been invented out of older tales. The Japanese-French anime ''[[Ulysses 31]]'' (1981) updates the ancient setting into a 31st-century [[space opera]]. ''[[Omeros]]'' (1991), an epic poem by [[Derek Walcott]], is in part a retelling of the ''Odyssey'', set on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[St. Lucia]]. The film ''[[Ulysses' Gaze]]'' (1995) directed by Theo Angelopoulos has many of the elements of the ''Odyssey'' set against the backdrop of the most recent and previous Balkan Wars.&lt;ref name="The Classical Tradition"/&gt;

[[Daniel Wallace (author)|Daniel Wallace]]'s ''[[Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions]]'' (1998) adapts the epic to the [[American South]], while also incorporating [[tall tales]] into its first-person narrative much as Odysseus does in the ''Apologoi'' (Books 9-12). The [[Coen Brothers]]' 2000 film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' is loosely based on Homer's poem. [[Margaret Atwood]]'s 2005 novella ''[[The Penelopiad]]'' is an ironic rewriting of the ''Odyssey'' from [[Penelope]]'s perspective. [[Zachary Mason]]'s ''[[The Lost Books of the Odyssey]]'' (2007) is a series of short stories that rework Homer's original plot in a contemporary style reminiscent of [[Italo Calvino]]. ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' (2010–2014) by [[Rick Riordan]] is based entirely on Greek mythology and includes many aspects and characters from the ''Odyssey''.&lt;ref name="enotes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = When was Homer's Odyssey written? – Homework Help – eNotes.com|url = http://www.enotes.com/homework-help/when-was-odyssey-written-1699|website = eNotes|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors have sought to imagine new endings for the ''Odyssey''. In canto XXVI of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Dante Alighieri]] meets Odysseus in the [[eighth circle of hell]], where Odysseus himself appends a new ending to the ''Odyssey'' in which he never returns to [[Ithaca]] and instead continues his restless adventuring.&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XXVI, lines 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|last2=Most|first2=Glenn W.|last3=Settis|first3=Salvatore|title=The Classical Tradition|date=2010|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] aspires to continue the poem and explore more modern concerns in his epic poem ''[[The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel]]'', which was first published in 1938 in modern Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|last2=Most|first2=Glenn W.|last3=Settis|first3=Salvatore|title=The Classical Tradition|date=2010|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|pages=652–653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ordos Museum''' ({{zh|c=鄂尔多斯博物馆}}) is a [[museum]] in [[Kangbashi District|Kangbashi]], [[Ordos City|Ordos]], [[Inner Mongolia]], [[China]].

The museum, which houses collections relating to the local history of Ordos and the surrounding area, was designed by Chinese design company MAD at the request of the local government and built by Huhehaote Construction.&lt;ref name="archdaily"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordos Art &amp; City Museum / MAD Architects|url=http://www.archdaily.com/211597/ordos-art-city-museum-mad-architects|publisher=Arch Daily|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a large, open-plan space of around 41,000 square feet; the design was influenced by both the [[Gobi desert]] and the work of [[Buckminster Fuller]].&lt;ref name="inexhibit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bianncini|first1=Riccardo|title=China: Ordos Museum by MAD Architects|url=https://www.inexhibit.com/case-studies/china-ordos-museum-mad-architects/|publisher=InExhibit|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArcSpace"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordos Museum|url=http://www.arcspace.com/features/mad-/ordos-museum/|publisher=ArcSpace|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has six levels of exhibition space.&lt;ref name="newatlas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borgobello|first1=Bridget|title=MAD's Ordos Museum is finally complete|url=http://newatlas.com/mad-ordos-museum-complete/20459/|publisher=New Atlas|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''outline''', also called a '''hierarchical outline''', is a list arranged to show [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] relationships and is a type of [[tree structure]]. An outline is used&lt;ref name="Chicago 2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=Chicago Manual of Style |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |edition=16th |pages=&lt;!--The online version is not paginaged.--&gt; |chapter=Lists and Outlines (6.121&amp;ndash;126) |publisher=U. of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2010 |isbn= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to present the main points (in sentences) or topics (terms) of a given subject.  Each item in an outline may be divided into additional sub-items.

It is not to be confused with the general context of the term "outline", which a summary or overview of a subject, presented verbally or written in prose&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]: "outline ''n.''3.a. In ''pl.'' The main features or general principles of a subject, proposal, etc. 3.b. A brief verbal or written description of something, giving a general idea of the whole but leaving details to be filled in; a draft, a summary. Also: a précis of a proposed article, novel, scenario, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, ''[[The Outline of History]]'' is not an outline of the type presented below). The outlines described in this article are lists, and come in several varieties.

A sentence outline is a tool for composing a document, such as an essay, a paper, a book, or even an encyclopedia. It is a list used to organize the facts or points to be covered, and their order of presentation, by section. Topic outlines list the subtopics of a subject, arranged in levels, and while they can be used to plan a composition, they are most often used as a summary, such as in the form of a table of contents or the topic list in a college course's syllabus.

Outlines are further differentiated by the index prefixing used, or lack thereof.  Many outlines include a numerical or alphanumerical prefix preceding each entry in the outline, to provide a specific path for each item, to aid in referring to and discussing the entries listed. An alphanumerical outline uses alternating letters and numbers to identify entries. A decimal outline uses only numbers as prefixes. An outline without prefixes is called a "bare outline".

Specialized applications of outlines also exist. A reverse outline is a list of sentences or topics that is created from an existing work, as a revision tool; it may show the gaps in the document's coverage so that they may be filled, and may help in rearranging sentences or topics to improve the structure and flow of the work. An integrated outline is a composition tool for writing scholastic works, in which the sources, and the writer's notes from the sources, are integrated into the outline for ease of reference during the writing process.

A software program designed for processing outlines is called an [[outliner]].

== Types of outlines ==

Outlines are differentiated by style, the inclusion of prefixes, and specialized purpose. There are also hand-written outlines (which are highly limited in utility), and digitized outlines, such as those contained within an [[outliner]] (which are much more useful).

=== By style ===

There are two main styles of outline: sentence outlines and topic outlines.

==== A sample topic outline application: An outline of human knowledge ====

 
[[Propædia]] is the historical attempt of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] to present a hierarchical "Outline of Knowledge" in a separate volume in the 15th edition of 1974. The ''[[Outline of Knowledge]]'' was a project by [[Mortimer Adler]]. Propædia had three levels, 10 "Parts" at the top level, 41 "Divisions" at the middle level and 167 "Sections" at the bottom level, numbered, for example, "1. Matter and Energy", "1.1 Atoms", "1.1.1. Structure and Properties of Atoms".

=== By prefixing used ===

A feature included in many outlines is prefixing. Similar to [[section numbers]], an outline prefix is a label (usually alphanumeric or numeric) placed at the beginning of an outline entry to assist in referring to it.

==== Bare outlines ====

Bare outlines include no prefixes.

==== Alphanumeric outline ====

An ''alphanumeric outline'' includes a prefix at the beginning of each topic as a reference aid. The prefix is in the form of [[Roman numerals]] for the top level, [[Letter case|upper-case]] letters (in the alphabet of the language being used) for the next level, [[Arabic numerals]] for the next level, and then lowercase letters for the next level.  For further levels, the order is started over again.  Each numeral or letter is followed by a period, and each item is capitalized, as in the following sample:

{{Quotation|
'''Thesis statement''': E-mail and [[Internet surveillance|internet monitoring]], as currently practiced, is an invasion of employees' rights in the workplace.

:I. The situation: Over 80% of today's companies monitor their employees.
::A. To prevent fraudulent activities, theft, and other workplace related violations.
::B. To more efficiently monitor employee productivity.
::C. To prevent any legal liabilities due to harassing or offensive communications.
:II. What are employees' privacy rights when it comes to electronic monitoring and surveillance in the workplace?
::A. American employees have basically no legal protection from mean and snooping bosses.
:::1. There are no federal or State laws protecting employees.
:::2. Employees may assert privacy protection for their own personal effects.
::B. Most managers believe that there is no right to privacy in the workplace.
:::1. Workplace communications should be about work; anything else is a misuse of company equipment and company time
:::2. Employers have a right to prevent misuse by monitoring employee communications
}}

Some call the Roman numerals "A-heads" (for "A-level headings"), the upper-case letters, "B-heads", and so on. Some writers also prefer to insert a blank line between the A-heads and B-heads, while often keeping the B-heads and C-heads together.

If more levels of outline are needed, lower-case Roman numerals and numbers and lower-case letters, sometimes with single and double parenthesis can be used, although the exact order is not well defined, and usage varies widely.

The scheme recommended by the ''[[MLA Handbook]]'',&lt;ref name="MLA 2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers |year=2009 |publisher=Modern Language Association of America |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1-60329-024-1 |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |edition=Seventh |page=45 |chapter=1.8.3: Final Outline }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Purdue Online Writing Lab]]'',&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/544/03/ |title=Developing an Outline |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=[[Purdue Online Writing Lab]] |year=2011 |publisher=[[Purdue University]] |location= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, uses the usual five levels, as described above, then repeats the Arabic numerals and lower-case letter surrounded by parentheses (round brackets)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; I. A. 1. a. i. (1) (a)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and does not specify any lower levels,&lt;ref name="MLA 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Purdue" /&gt; though "(i)" is usually next.  In common practice, lower levels yet are usually Arabic numerals and lowercase letters again, and sometimes lower-case Roman again, with single parentheses &amp;ndash; 1) a) i)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; but usage varies. MLA style is sometimes incorrectly referred to as APA style,&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite web |url= http://examples.yourdictionary.com/apa-outline-format-examples.html |title=APA Outline Format Examples |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=YourDictionary.com |year=2011 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''[[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association|APA Publication Manual]]'' does not address outline formatting at all.

A very different style recommended by ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'',&lt;ref name="Chicago 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago 2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=Chicago Manual of Style |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |edition=15th |pages=270&amp;ndash;275 |chapter=Lists and Outline Style (6.124&amp;ndash;130) |publisher=U. of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |year=2003 |isbn=0-226-10403-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the practice of the [[United States Congress]] in drafting legislation, suggests the following sequence, from the top to the seventh level (the only ones specified):  I. A. 1. ''a'') (1) (''a'') ''i'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; capital Roman numerals with a period, capital letters with a period, Arabic numerals with a period, italic lowercase letters with a single parenthesis, Arabic numerals with a double parenthesis, italic lowercase letters with a double parenthesis, and italic lowercase Roman numerals with a single parentheses, though the italics are not required).  Because of its use in the [[United States Code|US Code]] and other US law books, Many American [[lawyers]] consequently use this outline format.

Another alternative scheme repeats all five levels with a single parenthesis for the second five &amp;ndash; I) A) 1) a) i)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and then again with a double parenthesis for the third five&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; (I) (A) (1) (a) (i).{{citation needed|date=October 2011|reason=Not used in any source cited so far.}}

Many oft-cited style guides besides the ''APA Publication Manual'', including the ''[[Associated Press Stylebook|AP Stylebook]]'', the ''[[New York Times Manual|NYT Manual]]'', [[Fowler's Modern English Usage|Fowler]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' Style Guide, and [[The Elements of Style|Strunk &amp; White]], are curiously silent on the topic.

One side effect of the use of both Roman numerals and uppercase letters in all of these styles of outlining is that in most alphabets, "I." may be an item at both the top (A-head) and second (B-head) levels. This is usually not problematic because lower level items are usually referred to hierarchically. For example, the third sub-sub-item of the fourth sub-item of the second item is item II. D. 3.  So, the ninth sub-item (letter-I) of the first item (Roman-I) is item I. I., and only the top level one is item I.

==== Decimal outline ====

The ''decimal outline'' format has the advantage of showing how every item at every level relates to the whole, as shown in the following sample outline:

=== By specialized purpose ===

Special types of outlines include reverse outlines and integrated outlines.

==== Reverse outline ====

A ''reverse outline'' is an outline made from an existing work. Reverse outlining is like reverse engineering a document. The points or topics are extracted from the work, and are arranged in their order of presentation, by section, in the outline. Once completed, the outline can be filled in and rearranged as a plan for a new improved version of the document.

==== Integrated outline ====

An ''integrated outline'' is a helpful step in the process of organizing and writing a scholarly paper ([[literature review]], [[research]] paper, [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]]). When completed the integrated outline contains the relevant scholarly sources (author's last name, publication year, page number if quote) for each section in the outline. An integrated outline is generally prepared after the scholar has collected, read and mastered the literature that will be used in the research paper. Shields and Rangarajan (2013) recommend that new scholars develop a system to do this. Part of the system should contain a systematic way to take notes on the scholarly sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields|Shields, Patricia]] and Rangarjan, N. 2013. ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. See Chapter 8 for a detailed discussion of an integrated outline with examples.&lt;/ref&gt; These notes can then be tied to the paper through the integrated outline. This way the scholar reviews all of the literature before the writing begins.

An integrated outline can be a helpful tool for people with [[writer's block]] because the content of the paper is organized and identified prior to writing. The structure and content is combined and the author can write a small section at a time. The process is less overwhelming because it can be separated into manageable chunks. The first draft can be written using smaller blocks of time.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. 2014. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263861162_Tools_for_Writing_Excellent_Papers_2014_ASPA_Student_Summit Tools for Excellent Papers]: 2014 ASPA Student Summit. Presentation at the [[American Society for Public Administration]] annual conference, Washington DC March 15, This powerpoint describes a system for writing paper that contains an integrated outline. Slides 37 - 46 examine the components of an integrated outline with an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hand-written vs computerized ===

For a comparison, see [[#Outliners|Outliners]], below.

== Applications ==

Outlines are used for composition, summarization, and as a development and storage medium.

=== Composition ===

''Merriam-Webster's manual for writers and editors'' (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;290) recommends that the section headings of an article should when read in isolation, combine to form an outline of the article content. Garson (2002) distinguishes a 'standard outline', presented as a regular [[table of contents]] from a refined tree-like 'hierarchical outline', stating that "such an outline might be appropriate, for instance, when the purpose is taxonomic (placing observed phenomena into an exhaustive set of categories). ... hierarchical outlines are rare in quantitative writing, and the researcher is well advised to stick to the standard outline unless there are compelling reasons not to."&lt;ref&gt;G. David Garson, ''Guide to writing empirical papers, theses, and dissertations''. CRC Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-8247-0605-0}}, chapter "Typical Outlines", pp. 23-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers of [[fiction]] and [[creative nonfiction]], such as Jon Franklin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Writing for Story|date = 1994|last = Franklin|first = Jonathan|publisher = Plume|isbn = 9780452272958}}&lt;/ref&gt; may use outlines to establish plot sequence, character development and dramatic flow of a story, sometimes in conjunction with [[free writing]].

Preparation of an outline is an intermediate step in the process of writing a scholarly [[research]] paper, [[literature review]], [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]]. A special kind of outline (integrated outline) incorporates scholarly sources into the outline before the writing begins.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia M. 2004.[http://store.newforums.com/STEP-by-STEP-Building-a-Research-Paper-SWB01.htm ''Step by Step: Building a Research Paper.''] Stillwater OK: New Forums Press. {{ISBN|1-58107-117-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summarization ===

In addition to being used as a composition tool during the drafting process, outlines can also be used as a publishing format. Outlines can presented as work's table of contents, but they can also be used as the body of a work.  The ''[[Outline of Knowledge]]'' from the 15th edition of the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' is an example of this. Wikipedia includes outlines that summarize subjects (for example, see [[Outline of chess]], [[Outline of Mars]], and [[Outline of knowledge]]).

Professors often hand out to their students at the beginning of a term, a summary of the subjects to be covered throughout the course in the form of a topic outline. It may also be included as part of a larger course synopsis.

Outlines are also used to summarize talking points for a speech or lecture.

=== Personal information management ===

Outlines, especially those used within an [[outliner]], can be used for planning, scheduling, and recording.

== Outliners ==
{{Main|Outliner}}

An [[outliner]] (or "outline processor") is a specialized type of [[word processor]] used to view, create, build, modify, and maintain outlines. It is a computer program, or part of one, used for displaying, organizing, and editing [[hierarchy|hierarchically]] arranged text in an outline's [[tree structure]]. Textual information is contained in discrete sections called "nodes", which are arranged according to their topic-subtopic (parent-child) relationships, sort of like the members of a [[family tree]]. When loaded into an outliner, an outline may be [[text folding|collapsed or expanded]] to display as few or as many levels as desired.

Outliners are used for storing and retrieving textual information, with terms, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs attached to a tree.  So rather than being arranged by document, information is arranged by topic or content. An outline in an outliner may contain as many topics as desired.  This eliminates the need to have separate documents, as outlines easily include other outlines just by adding to the tree.

The main difference between a hand-written outline and a digital one, is that the former is usually limited to a summary or blueprint of a planned document, while the latter may easily include all of the content of the entire document and many more.  In other words, as a hand-written work an outline is a writing tool, but on a computer, it is a general purpose format supported by a robust development and display medium capable of handling knowledge from its creation to its end use.

Outliners may be used in [[content creation]] instead of general word processors for capturing, organizing, editing, and displaying knowledge or general textual information. Outliners are ideal for managing lists, organizing facts and ideas, and for [[computer programming|writing computer programs]].  They are also used for goal and task management (including [[personal information management]] and [[project management]]), and for writing books and movie scripts.

The graphical counterpart to outliners are [[mind mapper]]s.

The '''Oxborough Dirk''' is a large ceremonial weapon or [[dirk]] from the early [[bronze age]]. One of only six such objects across [[Europe]], it was found in a rural part of the county of [[Norfolk]], England in the 1980s and is now part of the [[British Museum]]'s prehistoric collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=808195&amp;partId=1&amp;place=26449&amp;plaA=26449-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
It was found by chance in 1988 protruding from a [[peat]] bog near [[Oxborough]], [[Norfolk]], where it had been deposited point down. A walker had discovered it in woods near the village by accidentally tripping up on the [[hilt]] of the [[sword]]. Six years after its discovery, the sword was purchased by the British Museum with the support of the [[National Art Collections Fund]].

==Rare find==
The Oxborough find is one of only six large [[dirk]]s known in north-west Europe, though excessively large versions of other types of objects from this era are also recorded. The six are so similar that they may have been made in the same [[workshop]], in which case this one could have been imported in to [[Great Britain|Britain]] from the continent. The six almost identical swords have been found across three countries in western Europe: two in France, two in the Netherlands and two in England. All six of these very rare swords are labelled the [[Plougrescant]]-[[Ommerschans]] type, after two of the sites from where they were found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regiocanons.nl/overijssel/salland/ommen/bronsschat-ommerschans Dutch article on Ommerschans weapon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The others were discovered in [[Beaune]] and [[Jutphaas]] and a second from [[Norfolk]].  The [[Beaune]] example is also in the British Museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=808153&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=beaune&amp;images=true&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;.  The second [[Norfolk]] example is in the collection of [[Norwich Castle Museum]].

==Description==
The Oxborough Dirk is dated to between 1450–1300 BC and measures {{convert|70.9|cm}} long with a mass of {{convert|2.37|kg}}, making it "ridiculously large and unwieldy" and clearly never intended for practical use, which the lack of holes on the hilt for fitting a handle also demonstrates.  It was probably either a [[votive offering]] or a [[store of value]] that could be retrieved at a later time.  It is currently on display in Room 50 at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''''Portrait of Suzanne Bloch''''' is a painting executed by the [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Pablo Picasso]] in Paris in 1904, towards the end of his [[Picasso's blue period|blue period]]. The subject, Suzanne Bloch, was a singer known for her [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] interpretations, and the sister of the violinist Henri Bloch.&lt;ref name="MARQUES"&gt;Marques, 1998, pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suzanne Bloch==
A luminary in the Parisian sets frequented by [[Picasso]] at the beginning of the 20th century, Suzanne Bloch was a [[Wagnerian]] singer and the sister of the violinist Henri Bloch. She was introduced to the Spanish artist by the French poet [[Max Jacob]], in 1904, and she sat for a [[portrait]] by Picasso in his [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] studio at 13 rue Ravignan in [[Paris]], between the late spring and early summer of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://picasso.csdl.tamu.edu/picasso/WorksIndex?Year=1904&amp;CurrentItem=31&amp;ViewStyle=detail on-line Picasso project]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[pen and ink]] [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]] heightened with [[gouache]], and signed and dated by Picasso, preceded the oil painting; it is now conserved at the Neubury Coray collection, in [[Ascona]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="CAMESASCA"&gt;Camesasca, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Picasso's portrait==
The portrait in [[Oil painting|oils]] has been described by Luiz Marques, professor of art history at [[Unicamp]], as exemplary of "the blue period, to which it fully belongs."&lt;ref name="MARQUES" /&gt; It has been called the last important work of the blue period,&lt;ref name="YAHOO NEWS"/&gt; although Palau i Fabre says that it is "difficult to date and determine the stage of transition from one period to the other—which in any case was not a sudden shift but a gently nuanced, though intermittent, progress".&lt;ref&gt;Palau i Fabre &amp; Picasso, 1981, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Denys Chevalier has written: "Any attempt ... to date the blue period too precisely can only lead to errors".&lt;ref&gt;Chevalier, 1991, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting, fully imbued with a somber, melancholy aura, is rendered in [[Monochromatic color|monochromatic]] shades, varying from [[blue]] to [[blue-green]], with the sporadic presence of warmer tones. Nevertheless, it is possible to notice that the painting already announces some characteristics of a future transition in the Spanish painter’s pictorial style, foreshadowing [[cubism]]. In the words of Camesasca, quoted by Marques: “[…] ''this portrait is marked by the emergence of a reflection about the plastic-chromatic structure of Cézanne’s works, in the scope of a 'post-impressionism, already absorbed in the problems which will make the art explode.'''”&lt;ref name="MARQUES" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAMESASCA" /&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting belonged to Suzanne Bloch, and was sold by her heirs after her death. The [[Thannhauser Galleries|Thannhauser Gallery]], Munich, sold the painting {{circa|1916}} to Sally Falk, Mannheim, but his collection was already dispersed in 1919, under the supervision of the Paul Cassirer Gallery, Berlin, and Picasso's ''Lady without hat, blue portrait'' was acquired by [[Mechthild Lichnowsky|Mechthild Princess Lichnowsky]],&lt;ref&gt;''Stiftung und Sammlung Sally Falk'', Städtische Kunsthalle Mannheim, 1994, p. 185: no. 295, ill. p. 131 {{ISBN|3-89165-045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; who kept it at her private collection in [[London]]. From the English capital, the painting went to [[Lugano]], in [[Switzerland]], where it was held in the private collection of the Biber family. The painting remained on deposit at the [[National Gallery of Art]], in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] between 1942 and 1946. In the following year, it was acquired by the [[São Paulo Museum of Art]] (MASP), with financial resources donated by [[Walter Moreira Salles]], founder of [[Unibanco]].&lt;ref name="MARQUES" /&gt;

===Theft===
On December 20, 2007 the painting was stolen from the [[São Paulo Museum of Art]]. Around five o’clock in the morning, three men invaded the museum and took away Picasso's ''Portrait of Suzanne Bloch'' and [[Candido Portinari|Portinari's]] ''O lavrador de café'' from the museum [[Collection (museum)|collection]]. The whole action took about three minutes. The estimated value of the works was US$55 million, with the portrait alone valued at US$50 million.&lt;ref name="YAHOO NEWS" /&gt;

The paintings, which are listed as Brazilian National Heritage by IPHAN,&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} * IPHAN – Official Note {{cite web |url=http://www.cultura.gov.br/site/?p=9488 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019024220/http://www2.cultura.gov.br/site/?p=9488 |archivedate=2015-10-19 |df= }} – ''The paintings "O lavrador de Café", "Retrato de Suzanne Bloch" as well as the entire collection of MASP are considered Brazilian National Heritage since 1969 due to its importance to the culture of the country.&lt;/ref&gt; remained missing until January 8, 2008, when they  were recovered in [[Ferraz de Vasconcelos]] by the [[Polícia Militar do Estado de São Paulo|Police of São Paulo]]. The paintings were returned, undamaged, to the São Paulo Museum of Art.&lt;ref name="YAHOO NEWS"&gt;{{cite news |author=MacSwan, Angus |title=Security questioned in Picasso theft in Brazil |url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/rtrs/20071221/ten-uk-brazil-picasso-d3877cb_1.html |date=2007-12-21 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230164038/http://uk.news.yahoo.com/rtrs/20071221/ten-uk-brazil-picasso-d3877cb_1.html |archivedate=2007-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USA TODAY"&gt;{{cite news|author=Winter, Michael|title=Stolen Picasso, Portinari recovered in Brazil|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/01/stolen-picasso.html|date=2008-01-08|work=[[USA Today]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412061344/http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/01/stolen-picasso.html|archivedate=2008-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibitions===
The painting was exhibited at the [[Thannhauser Galleries|Thannhauser Gallery]] in [[Berlin]] (1913); at the [[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Argentina)|Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes]] in [[Buenos Aires]] (1939); at the [[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] (1940); at the famous exhibition ''From Cézanne to Picasso'', in [[Los Angeles]] (1941); at the exhibition ''A Nova Pintura Francesa'', in [[Rio de Janeiro]] (1949); at the [[Museu Picasso]] in [[Barcelona]] and at the Kunstmuseum in [[Berne]], both in 1992; and at the Picasso retrospective, at the [[Musée Picasso]], in [[Paris]], carried out in 1994.&lt;ref name="MARQUES" /&gt;

'''Pua Kumbu''' is a traditional patterned multicolored ceremonial cotton cloth used by the [[Iban people]] in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]].

==Legends on the origins of Iban weaving==

There are many legends about the origin of Pua Kumbu, all revolving around the characters of Menggin and Dara Tinchin. The story starts with Menggin, an Iban hunter who shot a beautiful bird with his blowpipe. As he ran to retrieve his game, what he found was a woven skirt instead of a bird. He kept the woven skirt as he had never seen one before. However, he did not know that it belonged to Dara Tinchin Temaga, eldest daughter of a petara known as Singalang Burong. She was looking for her kain everywhere. When she met Menggin, he returned the skirt. In return, Dara married Menggin, although she was already married. She brought him to her home, the other world, the land of the Gods. They also had a son, Sera Gunting. After a year, Dara’s first husband returned home. She asked Menggin and Sera to return to the Iban world and for their journey to wear a jacket known as baju burong and her kain that she had woven. From that day onwards, the jacket and kain have been passed down to many Iban women so they can weave the same designs and remain close to the Gods. And that is how the weaving of pua kumbu began.&lt;ref name=bind&gt;http://rhgareh.com, adapted from Margaret Linggi “The ties that bind” (2001)  &amp; story told by Bangie ak Embol&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kumbu&gt;Textile tales of Pua Kumbu – Polysensory Intermedia Exhibition, published by University of Malaya&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dyeing and weaving process==

The process starts with preparing the yarn for the weaving, which consists of the following:
* '''Nabu’''' - winding the thread into balls
* '''Muai''' - to sort out
* '''Ngirit''' - the process of stretching and pulling a skin of thread horizontally, one thead at a time, to form the base or warp
* '''Ngarap''' - the selection of alternate warp
* '''Ngebat''' - tying
* '''Mampul''' - to cover
* '''Muka’ tanchang''' - untying
* '''Ngerembai''' - unfolding
* '''Anak''' and '''Ara''' – adding side designs

===Weaving===
In order to prepare for the weaving process, the yarns are unfolded and carefully arranged on a wooden frame. Before the actual weaving begins, the side sections of the unfolded yarn known as anak or ara are carefully arranged. Nenun or Weaving is done using a backstrap loom placed in a convenient spot within the longhouse. The final stage involves finishing of the top and bottom edges with a crowfeet pattern.

===Dyeing=== 
All of the raw materials for the natural dyes are harvested from the rainforest. The Iban have traditionally made use of a large number of plants to produce a range of rich beautiful dyes. The rengat plant produces an ‘indigo’ colour in many different tones. The akar penawar landak is used to obtain yellow color dye. For the Engkudu dye, if kapok or quicklime is added the colour will turn brown. The yarn is dipped into the combination, turned until it is well saturated and left to soak before it is dried under the sun. after the dye process yarns are further prepared by tying sections to build up the design.&lt;ref name=bind/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kumbu/&gt;

'''''Public Sale''''' is a 1943 painting by the American artist [[Andrew Wyeth]]. It shows two men by a car and in the distance a crowd of people outside a farm building. The event depicted is the forced auction of a farm after the farmer's wife had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/exhibitions/2006/93.html?page=2|title=Andrew Wyeth: Memory and Magic|publisher=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting belongs to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] since 2000. As of 2016, it is currently not on view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/93576.html|title=Public Sale|publisher=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Ken Johnson (art critic)|Ken Johnson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' singled the painting out as unusual in Wyeth's oeuvre because it "evinces social consciousness", something that otherwise is absent from the artist's works and makes him different from his contemporary [[Norman Rockwell]]. Johnson, reviewing a Wyeth exhibition in 2006, likened ''Public Sale'' to "an understated [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ken|date=April 18, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/18/arts/design/18wyet.html|title='Andrew Wyeth: Memory and Magic' at the Philadelphia Museum of Art|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt Peale - Rubens Peale with a Geranium - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Rembrandt Peale]], ''Rubens Peale with a Geranium'' (1801). Oil on canvas. {{convert|71.4|x|61|cm|abbr=on}}. [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.]]

'''''Rubens Peale with a Geranium''''' is an 1801 oil painting by American artist [[Rembrandt Peale]]. It is a portrait of Peale's younger brother, [[Rubens Peale|Rubens]], who helped run the family museums and raised plants and animals. It is an early painting by Rembrandt Peale, painted when he was 23 and Rubens was 17. It is signed "Rem Peale 1801". The [[National Gallery of Art]] describes it as "among the finest portraits in the history of American art".&lt;ref name="torchia"&gt;Torchia, 48, 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The portrait is informal and reveals Rubens' sensitive nature. He has an unstudied posture, and he is accompanied by a [[geranium]] (possibly ''[[Pelargonium inquinans]]'')&lt;ref name="torchia"/&gt; in a [[terracotta]] pot, which takes up so much space in the composition as to compete for attention with the ostensible subject, Rubens. This is a departure from traditional European portraiture, and valued for its "embodiment of an ideal in American art that favors candor over pretension, clarity over complexity, and the natural over the conventional".&lt;ref&gt;Soltis, 5&lt;/ref&gt; 

The National Gallery suggests that the work is almost a double portrait of Rubens and the geranium, which may be the first specimen of the plant grown in the US.&lt;ref name="nga"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.66250.html |title=Rubens Peale with a Geranium |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistic aspects of the plant can be seen in the young man's posture and clothing. The "V" shape of Rubens' lapels and shirt is echoed in the rising stalks of the geranium, and similarly the locks of hair on his forehead are echoed by the curves of the leftmost stalks. As two of his fingers rest on the lip of the pot, the two pointed fronds at the top of the plant are close to his hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Body of Raphaelle Peale: Still Life and Selfhood, 1812–1824 |last=Nemerov |first=Alexander |date=2001 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520224988 |pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens is both wearing and holding glasses. In this era, portraits subjects rarely wore glasses. The historian Billie Follensbee suggests that Peale sat for the portrait holding his glasses in his hand, with Rembrandt Peale returning to the canvas later and overpainting another pair of glasses on his face. This would account for the impossible combination of the strong lens refractions seen on his cheeks with the lack of visual distortion seen through the lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Follensbee BJ|year=1997|title=Rubens Peale's spectacles: an optical illusion?|url=|journal=Survey of Ophthalmology|volume=41|issue=5|pages=417–24|doi=10.1016/S0039-6257(97)00008-8|pmid=9163840|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no physical evidence that the glasses were added later, but Rubens' daughter, who received the painting in 1854, wrote that they were a later addition.&lt;ref&gt;Torchia, 54, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was acquired by his relative James Claypoole Copper, who later gave it to Rubens' daughter Mary Jane Peale (1827–1902), and the painting descended through the Peale family. It was sold to the art collector [[Lawrence A. Fleischman]], and then before 1963 to Pauline E. Woolworth, wife of [[Norman Bailey Woolworth]].&lt;ref name="torchia"/&gt; In 1985 it was sold at Sotheby's to the National Gallery of Art, which paid $3.7&amp;nbsp;million (before buyer's premium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=Philadelphia Inquirer | date=December 6, 1985 | page=D01| title=Peale painting sets record for U.S. art| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB29A3269D2005F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM }}&lt;/ref&gt; This set a record for an American work of art sold at auction, replacing [[Frederic Edwin Church]]'s ''[[The Icebergs]]'' ($2.5&amp;nbsp;million).

{{Sound change}}
'''Sandhi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʌ|n|d|i|,_|ˈ|s|æ|n|-|,_|ˈ|s|ɑː|n|-}}; {{lang-sa|[[wikt:संधि#Sanskrit|संधि]]}} ''{{IAST|saṃdhí}}'' {{IPA-sa|sən̪d̪ʱi|}}, "joining") is a cover term for a wide variety of [[phonology|sound]] changes that occur at [[morpheme]] or word boundaries. Examples include fusion of sounds across word boundaries and the alteration of one sound depending on nearby sounds or the grammatical function of the adjacent words. Sandhi belongs to [[morphophonology]].

Sandhi occurs in many languages, including particularly prominently in the phonology of [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] (especially [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Hindi]], [[Pali]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]), as well as in some [[North Germanic languages]].

==Types==

=== Internal and external sandhi ===
Sandhi can be either
* '''internal''', at [[morpheme]] boundaries within words, such as ''syn- + pathy'': ''sympathy'', or
* '''external''', at word boundaries, such as the pronunciation "''tem books''" for ''ten books'' in some dialects of [[English language|English]]. The [[Linking and intrusive R|linking {{IPA|/r/}}]] process of some dialects of English ("''I saw-r-a film''" in [[British English]]) is a kind of external sandhi, as are [[French language|French]] ''[[liaison (French)|liaison]]'' (pronunciation of usually silent final consonants of words before words beginning with vowels) and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''[[syntactic gemination|raddoppiamento fonosintattico]]'' (lengthening of initial consonants of words after certain words ending in vowels).
It may be extremely common in speech, but sandhi (especially external) is typically ignored in spelling, as is the case in English, except for the distinction between ''a'' and ''an''. Sandhi is, however, reflected in the orthography of [[Sanskrit]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Pali]] and some other Indian languages, as with in Italian in the case of compound words with lexicalised syntactic gemination.

In [[Japanese phonology]], sandhi is primarily exhibited in [[rendaku]] ([[consonant mutation]] from unvoiced to voiced when not word-initial, in some contexts) and conversion of {{lang|ja|つ}} or {{lang|ja|く}} (''tsu'', ''ku'') to a [[geminate consonant]] (orthographically, the [[sokuon]] {{lang|ja|っ}}), both of which are reflected in spelling – indeed, {{lang|ja|っ}} symbol for gemination is morphosyntactically derived from {{lang|ja|つ}}, and voicing is indicated by adding two dots as in {{lang|ja|か／が}} ''ka'', ''ga'', making the relation clear. It also occurs much less often in {{Nihongo|''[[renjō]]''|連声}}, where, most commonly, a terminal {{IPA|/n/}} on one morpheme results in an {{IPA|/n/}} (or {{IPA|/m/}}) being added to the start of the next morpheme, as in {{lang|ja|天皇: てん ＋ おう → てんのう}} (''ten'' + ''ō'' = ''tennō''); that is also shown in the spelling (the kanji do not change, but the kana, which specify pronunciation, change).

External sandhi effects can sometimes become morphologised (apply only in certain [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[syntax|syntactic]] environments) like in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Harold F.|last=Schiffman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oqe-QsaZnnQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=sandhi&amp;f=false|title=A Reference Grammar of Spoken Tamil|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1999|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gemination of stops in Tamil: implications for the phonology-syntax interface |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychlangsci/research/linguistics/publications/wpl/95papers/NAGARAJA |author=Hemalatha Nagarajan |format=PDF |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, over time, turn into [[consonant mutation]]s.

=== Tone sandhi ===
Most [[tone (linguistics)|tonal language]]s have '''[[tone sandhi]]''' in which the tones of words alter according to certain rules. An example is the behavior of [[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones|tone 3]] in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. When in isolation, tone 3 is often pronounced as a falling-rising tone. When a tone 3 occurs before another tone 3, however, it changes into tone 2 (a rising tone), and when it occurs before any of the other tones, it is pronounced as a low falling tone, with no rise at the end. A simple example occurs in the common greeting {{lang|zh|你好}} ''nǐ hǎo'' (with two words containing underlying tone 3), normally pronounced ''ní hǎo''.

'''Sensoaesthetics''' is the application of scientific methods to the study of the aesthetic, sensual and emotional aspects of materials.

==Overview==

The purpose of Sensoaesthetics is to understand how people interact with materials, and use that understanding to improve design and incorporate [[multisensory integration]] into the process. Another priority of Sensoaesthetics is to connect the Materials Science community with other disciplines such as Art and the design world, and reverse a perceived eradication of interest in the sensual and aesthetic properties of materials.&lt;ref name="Institute of Making, Research, Sensoaesthetic Materials"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sensoaesthetic Materials|url=http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/research/sensoaesthetic-materials|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 79, No. 10, pp. 1635–1641, 2007."&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Miodownik|title=Towards designing new sensoaesthetic materials|url=http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/2007/pdf/7910x1635.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The field has been developed by Materials Science academics, Professor [[Mark Miodownik]] and Dr [[Zoe Laughlin]] at [[King's College London]] and [[University College London|UCL]], and through the work of the Materials Library at King's College, and the [[Institute of Making]].

==Spoon Experiment==

The event was held in May, 2012 at Quilon, a Michelin starred Indian restaurant in London, by Zoe Laughlin and Mark Miodownik. 
The purpose was to study the taste of solid metals, and involved inviting a group of people including chef [[Heston Blumenthal]] and food science writer [[Harold McGee]] to eat Indian food using seven different freshly polished spoons in copper, gold, silver, tin, zinc, chrome and stainless steel.

The tastes of copper and zinc were found to be "bold and assertive, with bitter, metallic tastes". The silver spoon "tasted dull", while the stainless steel had a "faintly metallic flavour". Miodownik observed that the guests were not just tasting the spoons, but eating them, as with every lick they consumed "perhaps a hundred billion atoms".&lt;ref name="Sensoaesthetic Spoons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ediblegeography.com/sensoaesthetic-spoons/|accessdate=21 March 2014|title=Sensoaesthetic Spoons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial Times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spoon fed: how cutlery affects your food|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/776ba1d4-93ee-11e1-baf0-00144feab49a.html#axzz1twPxXo4i|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a set of the spoons Laughlin designed were included in the new permanent collection of London's [[Design Museum]] and are on display in the Designer Maker User gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/designer-maker-user|title=Designer Maker User|website=Design Museum|language=en-GB|others=Fabrique &amp; Q42|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some [[crucifix]]es feature a skull and crossbones beneath the corpus (the depiction of [[Jesus|Jesus']]  body), in reference to a legend that the place of the crucifixion was also the burial place of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] or, more likely, in reference to the [[New Testament]] statement (King James Version: Matthew 27:33, Mark 15:22, and John 19:17) that the place of his crucifixion was called "[[Golgotha]]" (tr. "the Place of a Skull").

Today, an example of a real skull and crossbones may be seen in the 1732 [[Our Lady of the Pillar|Nuestra Señora del Pilar]] church overlooking the famous [[La Recoleta Cemetery|Recoleta Cemetery]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. It contains several altars rescued from other early Spanish churches in South America. One of these has twenty rectangular window boxes arrayed behind and above the altar, five wide by four tall. The size of these glass window boxes is such that the femurs of the priests thus interred are a bit too long to lie flat and so must be leaned up in an "X" formation. The other bones fill in the spaces around the femurs with the skull sitting prominently on top of the bone pile centered above the "X".

==Other countries==
The [[Jolly Roger]], and the similar [[Totenkopf]] was a popular symbol of mortality across at this time across Europe and has its origins in the mediaeval [[Danse Macabre]].

Tombstones from the 18th century in Southern Scotland fairly frequently feature skull and crossbones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edinphoto.org.uk/0_a_l/0_around_edinburgh_-_leith_north_leith_cemetery_01777+01778_no_name.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of St Nicholas in [[Deptford]] features two [[Totenkopf | Deaths Head]]s on its gateposts dating to the early 18th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7067">{{Culture_of_Somalia}}
'''[[Somalia|Somali]] [[art]]''' is the artistic culture of the [[Somali people]], both historic and contemporary. These include artistic traditions in [[pottery]], [[music]], [[architecture]], [[woodcarving]] and other genres. Somali art is characterized by its [[aniconism]], partly as a result of the vestigial influence of the pre-Islamic [[Somali Mythology|mythology]] of the Somalis coupled with their ubiquitous [[Muslim]] beliefs. However, there have been cases in the past of artistic depictions representing living creatures such as the [[gold]]en [[bird]]s on the [[Mogadishu|Mogadishan]] [[Canopy (building)|canopies]], the ancient [[rock painting]]s in northern [[Somalia]], and the [[plant|plant decoration]]s on religious [[tomb]]s in southern Somalia, but these are considered rare. Instead, intricate patterns and geometric designs, bold colors and monumental architecture was the norm.

==History==
[[File:LaasGeel.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Ancient [[rock art]] depicting a [[camel]].]]
The oldest evidence of art in the [[Somali peninsula]] are [[pre-historic]] rock paintings. The rock art of [[Laas Geel]] are thought to be some of the best preserved in [[Africa]], representing cows in ceremonial robes accompanied by humans. The necks of the cows are embellished with a kind of ''[[plastron]]'', some of the cows are depicted as wearing decorative robes. The paintings not only show cows, but also a domesticated dogs, several paintings of [[canidae]] and a [[giraffe]].&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of African Archeology Volume 1.2 (2003) Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of ancient Somali styles of architecture and art can be seen in the various Somali civilizations that flourished under [[Islam]], particularly during the [[Mogadishu|Mogadishan]] [[Golden Age (metaphor)|Golden Age]] and the [[Ajuran Sultanate|Empire of Ajuran]] period (especially in the domain of architecture). In the early modern and contemporary era, [[poetry]] and [[theater|theatrical]] ventures shaped much of today's Somali artistic culture.

===Carving===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Somali art.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Old carved window frame from medieval [[Mogadishu]] is a good example of Somali woodcarving.]] --&gt;
Carving, known in [[Somali language|Somali]] as ''qoris'', is a much respected profession in Somalia both in historic and modern times. Many wealthy urbanites in the medieval period regularly employed the finest wood and marble carvers in Somalia to work on their interiors and houses. The carvings on the [[mihrab]]s and [[Column|pillar]]s of ancient Somali [[mosque]]s are some of the oldest on the continent. Artistic carving was considered the province of men similar to how the Somali textile industry was mainly a women's business. Amongst the [[nomad]]s, carving, especially [[woodwork]], was widespread and could be found on the most basic objects such as [[spoon]]s, [[comb]]s and [[bowl (vessel)|bowls]], but it also included more complex structures such as the portable nomadic house, the ''aqal''. In the last several decades, traditional carving of windows, doors and furniture has taken a backseat to the introduction of workshops employing electrical [[machine]]ry which deliver the same results in a far shorter time period.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and customs of Somalia By Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi pg 97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textile===
The textile culture of Somalia is an ancient one, and the Somali textile center in [[Mogadishu]] was, from at least the 13th century to the late 19th century, considered to be one of the main textile hubs in the [[Indian Ocean]]. It competed with those of the [[Demographics of India|Indian]]s and later the [[United States|American]]s in domestic and foreign markets such as [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi(2001) pg 100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metalwork===
The [[goldsmith]]s and [[blacksmith]]s of the urban cities, though often shunned by the dominant [[nomad]]ic culture for their occupation, fashioned the city-dwellers' traditional display of wealth and power through ornaments such as [[jewelry]] in the case of women, or the intricately designed Somali [[dagger]] (''toraay'') in the case of men.

===Architecture===
{{main|Architecture of Somalia}}
[[File:Ancient-Almnara.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Almnara Tower]] in [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]].]]
[[Architecture of Somalia|Somali architecture]] is a rich and diverse tradition of [[engineering]] and [[designing]] multiple different [[construction]] types such as [[masonry|stone cities]], [[castles]], [[citadel]]s, [[fortresses]], [[mosques]], [[temples]], [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], [[lighthouses]], towers and [[tombs]] during the ancient, [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] periods in Somalia, as well as the fusion of Somalo-Islamic architecture with Occidental designs in [[contemporary architecture|contemporary]] times.

In ancient Somalia, [[pyramid]]ical structures known in [[Somali language|Somali]] as ''taalo'' were a popular burial style, with hundreds of these [[drystone]] monuments scattered around the country today. Houses were built of [[Stonemasonry|dressed stone]] similar to the ones in [[Ancient Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;Man, God and Civilization pg 216&lt;/ref&gt; and there are examples of [[courtyard]]s and large stone walls such as the [[Wargaade Wall]] enclosing settlements.

The adoption of Islam in the early medieval era of Somalia's history brought [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectural influences]] from [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]], which stimulated a shift from [[drystone]] and other related materials in construction to [[Masonry|coral stone]], [[mud-brick|sundried bricks]], and the widespread use of [[limestone]] in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as [[mosques]] were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Diriye, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual Art is not new to the Somali communities. Visual art namely paintings focus on rural landscapes, and colorful paintings of the cultural life. Some of the known visual artists display their skills through their presence on Somali web sites. Visual Art is emerging as a new chapter  in the history of Somali culture. When we talk about art, our attention is immediately drawn into performing art. Indeed, for some people, visual art is interpreted as anti religion, since it involves a corporal creation of a human being. There are very few Somali Visual Artists. They are under represented in the world of Modern African Art. Some of the known Somali Visual artists had created  their own web sites such as www.osmanart.net/ This webpage is run by a Somali Physician Artist and writer - Mohamed Buwe Osman. There are many Somali visual artists like the well known to most of the Somals Mr. Amin Amir and Abdul Arts. There are as well visual with college degree in Art like Mr. Ali Kulmiye Halane and Mr. Aziz.

'''''Summer Evening on Skagen's Southern Beach''''' ({{lang-da|'''Sommeraften på Skagen Sønderstrand'''}}) is a painting by [[Peder Severin Krøyer]] (1851–1909), from 1893, and is counted as one of his masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/samlingen/vaerkerne/ps-kroeyer/sommeraften-paa-skagen/|title=P.S. Krøyer: Sommeraften på Skagen Sønderstrand - 1893|publisher=www.skagensmuseum.dk|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sotheby/&gt; Krøyer was one of the most notable members of the Danish artistic community known as the [[Skagen Painters]]. The works of Krøyer often emphasise the special effects of the Skagen light, with several memorable works depicting beach scenes.&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/summer-evening-on-skagen-s-beach-anna-ancher-and-marie-kr%C3%B8yer-walking-together/_gEOHIMEsC_EQg|title=Summer Evening on Skagen's Beach|publisher=www.google.com|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Peder Severin Krøyer  was born in [[Stavanger]], Norway, but spent his childhood with his aunt in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.&lt;ref name=Denstore /&gt; The [[Skagen Painters]] were a group of  Danish artists who formed an [[artists' colony]] in the little Danish  village of [[Skagen]], where they made a habit of  returning to paint every summer, and  Krøyer was part of this artistic community. Krøyer started painting in Skagen in the summer of 1882 and settled there permanently in 1889, after marrying [[Marie Krøyer|Marie Triepcke]]. He became the central member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/ps-kroeyer/|title=P.S. Krøyer (1851–1909)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirschsprung.dk/Image.aspx?id=69&amp;col=7|title=Hirschsprung collection, Sommeraften på Skagen|publisher=hirschsprung.dk|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
[[File:Anna Ancher og Marie Krøyer på Skagens Sønderstrand Foto af P.S. Krøyer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|One of Krøyer's photographs of Anna and Marie on the beach]] 
The painting itself was inspired by a walk along the beach by [[Anna Ancher]] and [[Marie Krøyer]] after a dinner party at the Krøyers' home in the summer of 1892 when the guests had gone down to the shore to enjoy the pleasant evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-art-works/ps-kroeyer/summer-evening/|title=P.S. Krøyer: Summer evening on Skagen's Southern Beach - 1893|publisher=Skagen Museum|accessdate=11 May 2015 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, an exhibition by the [[Hirschsprung Collection]] revealed that the painting had in fact been based on photographs of the two ladies taken by Krøyer. Until then, no one had imagined it was related to the artist's interest in photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunstnyt.dk/krosprin.htm|title=P.S. Krøyer 1851-1909 "Sommeraften ved Skagen Sønderstrand. Anna Ancher, t.v. og Marie Krøyer". 1893|publisher=Kunstnyt.dk|accessdate=11 May 2015 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After painting four preparatory works, Krøyer completed the full-size work in September 1893. In a letter to the writer [[Sophus Schandorph]] and his wife, who had been guests at the dinner party, he explained: "After I had painted studies of various kinds for it for about a month, one beautiful morning I started to paint up on the canvas and on the evening of the fourth day the picture was as it stands."&lt;ref name=sotheby&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/c19th-european-paintings-inc-greek-l12102/lot.22.html|title=Peder Severin Krøyer 1851 - 1909 Danish, Anna Ancher and Marie Krøyer on the Beach at Skagen|publisher=Sotheby's|accessdate=11 May 2015 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painter Anna Ancher and the artist's wife were strolling on [[Skagen]]'s Southern Beach during the [[blue hour]], when the horizon is almost dissolved in the evening mist and dispersed blue light, reflected in the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/samlingen/vaerkerne/ps-kroeyer/sommeraften-paa-skagen/ |title=Sommeraften på Skagen|publisher=www.skagensmuseum.dk|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krøyer described the time of the evening when the two sources of natural light could be captured together as a particular favourite.&lt;ref name=Mednick&gt;{{citation |journal=Nineteenth Century Art Worldwide |last=Mednick |first=Thor J. |title=Danish Internationalism: Peder Severin Krøyer in Copenhagen and Paris |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=Spring 2011 |url=http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/spring11/danish-internationalism-peder-severin-kroyer-in-copenhagen-and-paris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krøyer's style was influenced by the [[Impressionism|Impressionist movement]] during his travels to [[France]], although he developed a style of his own. In Denmark he gained a reputation  particularly for his beach scenes, for his paintings of the fishermen, and lively gatherings of the artists.&lt;ref name=Denstore&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Peder_Severin_Kr%C3%B8yer?highlight=p.s.%20kr%C3%B8yer|title=P.S.

==Provenance==
[[File:Skilt ved maleriet Sommeraften ved Skagen Sønderstrand på Skagens Museum.jpg|thumb|Summer Evening on Skagen's Southern Beach, Skagens Museum]]
The painting was owned by the opera singer [[Lilli Lehmann]], and in 1978 was sold to the German newspaper magnate [[Axel Springer]] for [[Danish krone|DKK]] 520,000. In 1986 Springer's [[Friede Springer|widow]], not herself Jewish, donated the painting to the Danish people in remembrance of the 1943 [[rescue of the Danish Jews]] from the Nazis. At that time Danish civilians together with the [[Danish resistance movement]] risked their own lives to evacuate 7,220 of Denmark's 7,800 Jews by sea to nearby neutral [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=Rescue&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m2dJ26rfqvYC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20total%20of%207%2C220%20of%20these%22&amp;f=false Leo Goldberger: ''The Rescue of the Danish Jews: Moral Courage Under Stress'', NYU Press, 1987, preface pages XX-XXI] Linked 2014-04-29&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is held by [[Skagens Museum]].&lt;ref name=Google /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Krøyer i international lys'', side 302-304, {{ISBN|9788790597160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, one of the preparatory paintings for the main work measuring only 45 by 47&amp;nbsp;cm was sold by [[Sotheby's]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]493,250, more than twice the estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/departments/scandinavian-paintings.html|title=Scandinavian Paintings|publisher=Sotheby's|accessdate=11 May 2015 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once owned by Queen Margherita of Italy, the work was rediscovered when her granddaughter [[Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy]] auctioned it at [[Christie's]] in April 2012.&lt;ref name=sotheby/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Andre_sprog/English/2012/11/21/121846.htm|title=Krøyer painting sold for DKK 4.5m|publisher=DR.dk|date=21 November 2012|accessdate=11 May 2015 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand Persian|کتاب کوچه|date=January 2010}}
'''''The Book of Alley''''' ({{lang-fa|کتاب کوچه}} ''Ketâb-e Kucheh'') is a series of books about [[Persian language|Persian]] idioms and proverbs by [[Ahmad Shamlou]] coauthored with his wife [[Aida Sarkisian]].

==History==

[[Ahmad Shamlou|Shamlou]] devoted four decades of his life to collecting and organizing [[Iranian folklore]]. Folklore from his perspective is a body of traditional beliefs, customs, and expressions. The language in general, and oral languages in particular, address it through different uses such as proverbs, laments, cries and so on. Therefore the language could be used as an index to folklore as a body of tradition. The research work entitled ''Ketab Kuche ''(Translation: ''The Book of Alley'') indexes the Iranian folklore through the Persian language. The book is a multi-volume, multi-disciplinary work designed as a major source of information, providing a detailed and accurate picture of an important world civilization over a span of several thousand years. ''Ketab Kuche'' is one of the third Iranian national projects on Persian heritage and language beside the [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], a multi-disciplinary reference work and research tool designed to record the facts of Iranian history and civilization and the [[Dehkhoda dictionary]], the largest comprehensive Persian dictionary ever published, comprising 15 volumes. 14 volumes of this book were printed during his lifetime.

After Shamlou's death, his wife [[Aida Sarkisian]] took responsibility for the book.

The collection has been passed down through five generations of the Ephrussi family, providing a common thread for the story of its fortunes from 1871 to 2009.

[[File:The Hook illustration.jpg|thumb|205px|right|Ink drawing depicting ''The Hook'' legend.]]
'''The Hook''' or '''The Hookman'''{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|p=49}} is an [[urban legend]] about a killer with a [[Prosthesis#Hooks|hook for a hand]] attacking a couple in a parked car. The story is thought to date from at least the mid-1950s, and gained significant attention when it was reprinted in the advice column ''[[Dear Abby]]'' in 1960. It has since become a morality [[archetype]] in popular culture, and has been referenced in various horror films. 

==Legend==
{{unsourced section|date=August 2017}}
The basic premise involves a young couple parking at a [[lovers' lane]]. The radio plays while they’re making out. Suddenly, a news bulletin reports that a serial killer has just escaped from a nearby institution.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2004|p=15}} The killer has a hook for one of his hands. For varying reasons, they decide to leave quickly. In the end, the killer's hook is either found hanging from the door handle or embedded into the door itself. Different variations include a scraping sound on the car door. Some versions start the same way, but have the couple spotting the killer, warning others, and then narrowly escaping with the killer holding onto the car's roof.

In an alternate version, the couple drive through an unknown part of the [[rural area|country]] late at night and stop in the middle of the [[forest|woods]], because either the male has to relieve himself, or the car breaks down and the man leaves for help. While waiting for him to return, the female turns on the radio and hears the report of an escaped [[mental patient]]. She is then disturbed many times by a thumping on the roof of the car. She eventually exits and sees the escaped patient sitting on the roof, banging the male's severed head on it. Another variation has the female seeing the male's butchered body suspended upside down from a tree with his fingers scraping the roof. In other versions the man does return to the car only to see his date brutally murdered with a hook embedded in her. In other versions, the woman gets out of the car when her date doesn't come back. Only to see his mutilated body (either on the car's roof, nailed on a tree, or just a few short steps way). But as she starts to panic, she runs into the maniac and she too gets killed.

There is also another legend that is similar. In the legend, the young couple are heading back from a great date but their car breaks down (either from running out of fuel or a malfunction). The man then decides to head off on foot to find someone or somewhere to help with the problem while the woman stays behind in the car. She then falls asleep while waiting and wakes up to see a hideous person looking at her through the window. Luckily the car is locked so the person can't get inside. But to the woman's horror, the person raises both of his arms to reveal that they are holding her date's severed head in one hand and the car keys in the other. The fate of the woman is never revealed.

==Origin==
The origins of the Hook legend are not entirely known, though, according to folklorist and historian [[Jan Harold Brunvand]], the story began to circulate some time in the 1950s in the United States.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|p=49}} According to Brunvand in ''The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings'', the story had become widespread amongst American teenagers by 1959, and continued to expand into the 1960s.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|pages=49–50}}

The first known publication of the story occurred on November 8, 1960, when a reader letter telling the story was reprinted in ''[[Dear Abby]]'', a popular advice column:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Abby: If you are interested in teenagers, you will print this story. I don't know whether it's true or not, but it doesn't matter because it served its purpose for me: A fellow and his date pulled into their favorite "lovers lane" to listen to the radio and do a little [[kissing|necking]]. The music was interrupted by an announcer who said there was an escaped convict in the area who had served time for rape and robbery. He was described as having a hook instead of a right hand. The couple become frightened and drove away. When the boy took his girl home, he went around to open the  car door for her. Then he saw—a hook on the door handle! I will never park to make out as long as I live. I hope this does the same for other kids. —Jeanette{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|pages=48–49}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Literary scholar Christopher Pittard traces the plot dynamics of the legend to [[Victorian literature]], particularly the 1913 horror novel ''[[The Lodger (novel)|The Lodger]]'' by [[Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes]].{{Sfn|Pittard|2011|pages=188–189}} Though the two narratives have little in common, he notes that both are built upon a "threefold relationship of crime, dirt, and chance... Such a reading also implies a reconsideration of the historical trajectory of the urban legend, usually read as a product of postmodernist consumer culture."{{Sfn|Pittard|2011|p=188}}

== Interpretations ==
Folklorists have interpreted the long history of this legend in many ways. [[Alan Dundes|Alan Dundes's]] Freudian interpretation explains the hook as a phallic symbol and its amputation as a symbolic castration.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|pages=50–51}}

Swedish folklorist [[Bengt af Klintberg]] describes the story as an example of "a conflict between representatives of normal people who follow the rules of society and those who are not normal, who deviate and threaten the normal group."{{Sfn|Brunvand|2001|pages=200–201}}

American folklorist Bill Ellis interpreted the maniac in ''The Hook'' as a moral custodian who interrupts the sexual experimentation of the young couple. He sees the Hookman's handicap as "his own lack of sexuality" and "the threat of the Hookman is not the normal sex drive of teenagers, but the abnormal drive of some adults to keep them apart."{{Sfn|Ellis|1987|pages=31–60}} 

==Influence on film==

The Hook legend has most often been depicted and referenced in [[horror film]]s.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|pages=112–114}} Its prevalence, according to film scholar [[Mark Kermode]], is most reflected in the [[slasher film]], functioning as a morality [[archetype]] on youth sexuality.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=113}} 

In ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' (1979), [[Bill Murray]]'s character retells the Hook legend to campers around a campfire.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=101}} ''[[He Knows You're Alone]]'' (1980) opens with a [[Story within a story#Film within a film|film within a film]] scene in which a young couple are attacked by a killer while in a parked car.{{Sfn|Everman|2003|p=122}} The slasher film ''[[Final Exam (film)|Final Exam]]'' opens with a scene in which a couple are attacked in a parked car, and later, a student is murdered in a university locker room with a hook.{{Sfn|Armstrong|2003|p=113}} ''[[Campfire Tales (1997 film)|Campfire Tales]]'' (1997), an anthology horror film, opens with a segment retelling the Hook legend, set in the 1950s.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=192}} ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997) features a killer stalking teenagers with a hook; at the beginning of the film, the central characters recount the Hook legend around a campfire.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=104}} "[[The Pest House]]" (1998), the fourteenth episode of season 2 of the TV series ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', opens with a murder similar to that of the urban legend. ''[[Lovers Lane (1999 film)|Lovers Lane]]'' (1999), is a slasher film featuring a killer who murders teenagers at a lovers' lane with a hook.{{Sfn|Harper|2004|p=123}} Season one, episode seven of the TV show ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' features a hookman as the villain.

[[File:WALLPAPER.jpg|thumb|250px|An example of Italian modern wallpaper]]
[[File:G. Bruno - Le Tour de la France par deux enfants p052.jpg|thumb|The traditional hand-blocking technique, here in France in 1877]]
'''Wallpaper''' is a material used in [[interior decoration]] to decorate the interior walls of domestic and public [[building]]s. It is usually sold in rolls and is applied onto a wall using [[wallpaper paste]]. Wallpapers can come plain as "lining paper" (so that it can be painted or used to help cover uneven surfaces and minor wall defects thus giving a better surface), textured (such as [[Anaglypta]]), with a regular repeating pattern design, or, much less commonly today, with a single non-repeating large design carried over a set of sheets. The smallest rectangle that can be tiled to form the whole pattern is known as the pattern '''repeat'''.

Wallpaper printing techniques include [[surface printing]], [[rotogravure|gravure printing]], silk [[screen-printing]], [[Rotary printing press|rotary printing]], and [[digital printing]]. Wallpaper is made in long rolls, which are hung vertically on a wall. Patterned wallpapers are designed so that the pattern "repeats", and thus pieces cut from the same roll can be hung next to each other so as to continue the pattern without it being easy to see where the join between two pieces occurs. In the case of large complex patterns of images this is normally achieved by starting the second piece halfway into the length of the repeat, so that if the pattern going down the roll repeats after 24 inches, the next piece sideways is cut from the roll to begin 12 inches down the pattern from the first. The number of times the pattern repeats horizontally across a roll does not matter for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Mathematically speaking, there are seventeen basic patterns, described as [[wallpaper group]]s, that can be used to tile an infinite plane. All manufactured wallpaper patterns are based on these groups. Wallpapers with a large figurative pattern are likely to be in group "p1".&lt;/ref&gt; A single pattern can be issued in several different colorways.

==History==
The main historical techniques are: hand-painting, [[woodblock printing]] (overall the most common), [[stencil]]ling, and various types of machine-printing. The first three all date back to before 1700.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Wallpaper, using the [[printmaking]] technique of [[woodcut]], gained popularity in [[Renaissance]] Europe amongst the emerging [[gentry]]. The social elite continued to hang large [[tapestries]] on the walls of their homes, as they had in the [[Middle Ages]]. These tapestries added color to the room as well as providing an insulating layer between the stone walls and the room, thus retaining heat in the room. However, tapestries were extremely expensive and so only the very rich could afford them. Less well-off members of the elite, unable to buy tapestries due either to prices or wars preventing international trade, turned to wallpaper to brighten up their rooms.

Early wallpaper featured scenes similar to those depicted on tapestries, and large sheets of the paper were sometimes hung loosely on the walls, in the style of tapestries, and sometimes pasted as today. [[Old master prints|Prints]] were very often pasted to walls, instead of being framed and hung, and the largest sizes of prints, which came in several sheets, were probably mainly intended to be pasted to walls. Some important artists made such pieces - notably [[Albrecht Dürer]], who worked on both large picture prints and also ornament prints - intended for wall-hanging. The largest picture print was ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'' commissioned by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and completed in 1515. This measured a colossal 3.57 by 2.95 metres, made up of 192 sheets, and was printed in a first edition of 700 copies, intended to be hung in palaces and, in particular, town halls, after hand-coloring.

Very few samples of the earliest repeating pattern wallpapers survive, but there are a large number of [[old master print]]s, often in [[engraving]] of repeating or repeatable decorative patterns. These are called ornament prints and were intended as models for wallpaper makers, among other uses.

England and France were leaders in European wallpaper manufacturing. Among the earliest known samples is one found on a wall from England and is printed on the back of a London proclamation of 1509. It became very popular in [[England]] following [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s excommunication from the Catholic Church - English aristocrats had always imported tapestries from [[Flanders]] and [[Arras]], but Henry VIII's split with the Catholic Church had resulted in a fall in trade with Europe. Without any tapestry manufacturers in England, English gentry and aristocracy alike turned to wallpaper.

During [[the Protectorate]] under [[Oliver Cromwell]], the manufacture of wallpaper, seen as a frivolous item by the [[Puritan]] government, was halted. Following the Restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], wealthy people across England began demanding wallpaper again - Cromwell's regime had imposed a boring culture on people, and following his death, wealthy people began purchasing comfortable domestic items which had been banned under the Puritan state.

===18th century===
[[File:KA-Tapete-Beerdigung05.JPG|thumb|Hand-painted Chinese wallpaper showing a funeral procession, made for the European market, c. 1780]]
In 1712, during the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], a [[wallpaper tax]] was introduced which was not abolished until 1836. By the mid-eighteenth century, Britain was the leading wallpaper manufacturer in Europe, exporting vast quantities to Europe in addition to selling on the middle-class British market. However this trade was seriously disrupted in 1755 by the [[Seven Years' War]] and later the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and by a heavy level of duty on imports to France.

In 1748 the British Ambassador to Paris decorated his salon with blue [[flock wallpaper]], which then became very fashionable there. In the 1760s the French manufacturer [[Jean-Baptiste Réveillon]] hired designers working in silk and tapestry to produce some of the most subtle and luxurious wallpaper ever made. His sky blue wallpaper with [[fleurs-de-lys]] was used in 1783 on the first balloons by the [[Montgolfier brothers]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;{{citation |title = Grove Art Online "Wallpaper"|publisher = Oxford Art Online |accessdate=October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape painter [[Jean-Baptiste Pillement]] discovered in 1763 a method to use fast colours.

Hand-blocked wallpapers like these use [[Woodblock printing|hand-carved blocks]] and by the 18th century designs include panoramic views of antique architecture, exotic landscapes and pastoral subjects, as well as repeating patterns of stylized flowers, people and animals.

In 1785 [[Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf]] had invented the first machine for printing coloured tints on sheets of wallpaper. In 1799 [[Louis-Nicolas Robert]] patented a machine to produce continuous lengths of paper, the forerunner of the [[Fourdrinier machine]]. This ability to produce continuous lengths of wallpaper now offered the prospect of novel designs and nice tints being widely displayed in drawing rooms across Europe.{{r|Britannica 1}}

Wallpaper manufacturers active in England in the 18th century included John Baptist Jackson&lt;ref name=grove /&gt; and John Sherringham.&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis, Vol. 15, No. 2, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Among the firms established in 18th-century America: J. F. Bumstead &amp; Co. (Boston), William Poyntell (Philadelphia), John Rugar (New York).&lt;ref name=grove /&gt;

High-quality wallpaper made in China became available from the later part of the 17th century; this was entirely handpainted and very expensive. It can still be seen in rooms in palaces and grand houses including [[Nymphenburg Palace]], [[Łazienki Palace]], [[Chatsworth House]], [[Temple Newsam]], [[Broughton Castle]], [[Lissan House]], and [[Erddig]].  It was made up to 1.2 metres wide. English, French and German manufacturers imitated it, usually beginning with a printed outline which was coloured in by hand, a technique sometimes also used in later Chinese papers.

===19th century===

==France and America==
Towards the end of the 18th century the fashion for scenic wallpaper revived in both America and France, leading to some enormous [[panorama]]s, like the 1804 20 strip wide panorama, ''Sauvages de la Mer du Pacifique'' (Savages of the Pacific), designed by the artist [[Jean-Gabriel Charvet]] for the French manufacturer [[Joseph Dufour et Cie]] showing the Voyages of [[Captain Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = De l'Imprimerie de Moiroux, rue franche |isbn = 0665141149 |publication-place = A Macon [France?] |title = Les sauvages de la mer Pacifique, tableau pour décoration en papier peint |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL23705116M/Les_sauvages_de_la_mer_Pacifique_tableau_pour_décoration_en_papier_peint |author = Joseph Dufour |publication-date = 1804 |id = 0665141149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This famous so-called "papier peint" wallpaper is still in situ in Ham House, Peabody, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Horace H. F. Jayne. Captain Cook Wallpaper. Bulletin of the Pennsylvania Museum, Vol. 17, No. 69 (Oct., 1921)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest panoramic wallpaper of its time, and marked the burgeoning of a French industry in panoramic wallpapers. Dufour realized almost immediate success from the sale of these papers and enjoyed a lively trade with America. The [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style currently in favour worked well in houses of the [[Federal architecture|Federal period]] with Charvet's elegant designs. Like most 18th-century wallpapers, the panorama was designed to be hung above a [[dado (architecture)|dado]].

Beside [[Joseph Dufour et Cie]] (1797 - c. 1830) other French manufacturers of panoramic scenic and [[trompe l'œil]] wallpapers, [[Zuber et Cie]] (1797–present) and [[Arthur et Robert]] exported their product across Europe and North America. Zuber et Cie's c. 1834 design ''Views of North America''&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Emlen: ‘Imagining America in 1834: Zuber's Scenic Wallpaper "Vues d'Amérique du Nord"’, Winterthur Port., xxxii (Summer–Aug 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; hangs in the [[Diplomatic Reception Room]] of the [[White House]].

While Joseph Dufour et Cie was shut down in the 1830s, Zuber et Cie still exists and, with [[Cole &amp; Son]] of England and the Atelier d'Offard (1999–present) equally situated in France, is one of the last Western producers of woodblock printed wallpapers. For its production Zuber uses woodblocks out of an archive of more than 100,000 cut in the 19th century which are classified as a "Historical Monument". It offers panoramic sceneries such as "Vue de l'Amérique Nord", "Eldorado Hindoustan" or "Isola Bella" and also wallpapers, friezes and ceilings as well as hand-printed furnishing fabrics.

Among the firms begun in France in the 19th century: Desfossé &amp; Karth.&lt;ref name=grove /&gt; In the United States: John Bellrose, Blanchard &amp; Curry, Howell Brothers, Longstreth &amp; Sons, Isaac Pugh in Philadelphia; Bigelow, Hayden &amp; Co. in Massachusetts; Christy &amp; Constant, A. Harwood, R. Prince in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Decorator and Furnisher, Vol. 16, No. 6 (Sep., 1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], trade between Europe and Britain evaporated, resulting in the gradual decline of the wallpaper industry in Britain. However, the end of the war saw a massive demand in Europe for British goods which had been inaccessible during the wars, including cheap, colourful wallpaper. The development of steam-powered printing presses in Britain in 1813 allowed manufacturers to mass-produce wallpaper, reducing its price and so making it affordable to working-class people. Wallpaper enjoyed a huge boom in popularity in the nineteenth century, seen as a cheap and very effective way of brightening up cramped and dark rooms in working-class areas. It became almost the norm in most areas of middle-class homes, but remained relatively little used in public buildings and offices, with patterns generally being avoided in such locations. In the latter half of the century [[Lincrusta]] and [[Anaglypta]], not strictly wallpapers, became popular competitors, especially below a [[dado rail]]. They could be painted and washed, and were a good deal tougher, though also more expensive.

Wallpaper manufacturing firms established in England in the 19th century included Jeffrey &amp; Co.; Shand Kydd Ltd.;&lt;ref name=grove /&gt; [[Lightbown Aspinall|Lightbown, Aspinall &amp; Co.]];&lt;ref name=grove /&gt; John Line &amp; Sons;&lt;ref name=grove /&gt; Potter &amp; Co.;&lt;ref&gt;Sugden, A.V, Potters of Darwen 1839–1939 a century of wallpaper printing by machinery. 1939&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Sanderson &amp; Sons]]; Townshend &amp; Parker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Spicer Brothers |publication-place = London |title = Official descriptive and illustrated catalogue, Great exhibition of the works of industry of all nations |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL6962338M/Official_descriptive_and_illustrated_catalogue |publication-date = 1851 |oclc = 1044640 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Designers included [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], [[William Morris]], and [[Charles Voysey (architect)|Charles Voysey]]. In particular, many 19th century designs by [[Morris &amp; Co]] and other [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] designers remain in production.

===20th century===
By the early twentieth century, wallpaper had established itself as one of the most popular household items across the Western world. Manufacturers in the USA included Sears;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Sears, Roebuck and Co. |publication-place = Chicago [Ill.] |title = Wall paper |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL25126572M/Wall_paper |publication-date = 1900 |oclc = 17573461 }}&lt;/ref&gt; designers included Andy Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;Hapgood. Wallpaper and the artist: from Durer to Warhol. London: Abbeville Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Wallpaper has gone in and out of fashion since about 1930, but the overall trend has been for wallpaper-type patterned wallcoverings to lose ground to plain painted walls.

===21st century===
In the early 21st century, wallpaper evolved into a lighting feature, enhancing the mood and the ambience through lights and crystals. [[Meystyle]], a London-based company, invented LED incorporated wallpaper.&lt;ref&gt;Surya, Shirley (2008). "Patterns: Design, Architecture, Interiors", page 204.

===Historical collections===
Historical examples of wallpaper are preserved by cultural institutions such as the Deutsches Tapetenmuseum (Kassel) in Germany;&lt;ref&gt;E. W. Mick. Hauptwerke des Deutschen Tapetenmuseum in Kassel (Tokyo, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; the Musée des Arts Décoratifs (Paris) and Musée du Papier Peint (Rixheim) in France;&lt;ref name=grove /&gt; the Victoria &amp; Albert in the UK;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/w/wallpaper/ |title=Wallpaper |publisher=V&amp;A |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cooperhewitt.org/search/wallpaper? |title=Cooper-Hewitt |location=USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historic New England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicnewengland.org/collections-archives-exhibitions/collections-access/wallpaper |title=Wallpaper |author=Historic New England |location=USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan Museum of Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/search-results?ft=wallpaper&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. National Park Service,&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Hamm and James Hamm.

==Types and sizes==
In terms of methods of creation, wallpaper types include painted wallpaper, hand-printed blockwood wallpaper, hand-printed stencil wallpaper, machine-printed wallpaper, and flock wallpaper.&lt;ref name=grove /&gt;

Modern wallcoverings are diverse, and what is described as wallpaper may no longer actually be made from paper. Two of the most common factory trimmed sizes of wallpaper are referred to as "American" and "European" rolled goods. American rolled goods are {{convert|27|in|cm}} by {{convert|27|ft|m}} in length. European rolled goods are {{convert|52|cm|in}} wide by {{convert|10|m|ft}} in length,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.johnlewis.com/buying-guides/wallpaper-buying-guide|title=Paint &amp; Wallpaper: How to decorate your home|author=|date=|website=www.johnlewis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately {{convert|5.2|m2|sqft}}. Most wallpaper borders are sold by length and with a wide range of widths therefore surface area is not applicable, although some may require trimming.

The most common wall covering for residential use and generally the most economical is prepasted vinyl [[coated paper]], commonly called "strippable" which can be misleading. Cloth backed vinyl is fairly common and durable. Lighter vinyls are easier to handle and hang. Paper backed vinyls are generally more expensive, significantly more difficult to hang, and can be found in wider untrimmed widths. Foil wallpaper generally has paper backing and can (exceptionally) be up to {{convert|36|in|cm}} wide, and be very difficult to handle and hang. Textile wallpapers include silks, linens, grass cloths, strings, rattan, and actual impressed leaves. There are acoustical wall carpets to reduce sound. Customized wallcoverings are available at high prices and most often have minimum roll orders.

Solid vinyl with a cloth backing is the most common commercial wallcovering {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and comes from the factory as untrimmed at {{convert|54|in|cm}} approximately, to be overlapped and double cut by the installer. This same type can be pre-trimmed at the factory to {{convert|27|in|cm}} approximately.

Wallpaper also comes as 'borders', typically hung horizontally at the tops of walls, and above wainscotting. Bordering wallpaper comes in an array of colours and patterns, straight or shaped edges, and widths (sometimes called 'heights' due to its orientation), and is used to provide a finished look to walls already hung with printed wallpaper, or as an accent for painted or plain-papered walls. Some bordering wallpapers are decorated with pictures and even writing, which, when hung, can tell a simple story or a well-known theme, such as fairytales, poems, pictographs of alphabets or numerals, or religious works. In modern western homes, these are referred-to as 'friezes' and commonly adorn nurseries and children's bedrooms. They can also be found in classrooms and libraries.

''Non-woven wallpaper:'' Non-woven wallpaper is made from a mixture of chemical pulp and textile fibres, and is used on its own or as a backing for other types of wallpaper. When hanging this wallpaper, the paste is applied directly to the wall, after which the wallpaper will hang on without booking time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thebestwallpaperplace.com/how-to-hang-glitter-wallpaper|title=How to hang fabric backed, non-woven wallpaper|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Paper wallpaper:'' Made of recyclable paper''.'' Is also used as backing material for other wallpapers. When using paper as wallpaper the booking time has to be considered.

''Photo and metal wallpaper:'' These Wallpapers are applied on a backing material like non-waven or paper wallpaper. When producing photo wallpaper, the picture will be printed on a paper backing. To create a metallic optic wallpaper, the coating of the backing material consist of metal foil like aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wallcover.com/diy/an-overview-of-the-different-types-of-wallpaper/|title=An overview of the different types of wallpaper|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern developments==
===Custom wallpaper printing===
New digital [[Inkjet printer|inkjet printing technologies]] using ultraviolet (UV) cured inks are being used for custom wallpaper production. Very small runs can be made, even a single wall. Photographs or digital art are output onto blank wallpaper material. Typical installations are corporate lobbies, restaurants, athletic facilities, and home interiors. This gives a designer the ability to give a space the exact look and feel desired.

===High-tech wallpaper===
New types of wallpaper under development or entering the market in the early 21st century include wallpaper that blocks certain mobile phone and [[WiFi]] signals, in the interest of privacy. The wallpaper is coated with a silver ink which forms crystals that block outgoing signals.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/562009c2-7b90-11e2-95b9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2LwJF7T00 |title=The new role of wallpaper |author=Peter Leggatt and Nathan Brooker |date=February 22, 2013 |work=Financial Times |accessdate=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish firm Think Big Factory has announced that they are developing a wallpaper which also serves as a computer interface, using projectors, webcams, and motion sensors for control. As of 2013, The hardware was complete but only 20 per cent of the software was finished, according to Think Big Factory.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

===Seismic wallpaper===
In 2012, Scientists at the Institute of Solid Construction and Construction Material Technology at the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] announced that they had developed a wallpaper that can help keep a masonry wall from failing in an earthquake. The wallpaper uses glass fibre reinforcement in several directions and a special adhesive which forms a strong bond with the masonry when dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2012/04/04/High-tech-wallpaper-resists-earthquakes/UPI-11931333589780/ |title=High-tech wallpaper resists earthquakes |author= |date=April 4, 2012 |work=UPI |accessdate=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wallpaper design as a means of artistic expression===

==Installation==
Like [[paint]], wallpaper requires proper surface preparation before application. Additionally wallpaper is not suitable for all areas. For example, [[bathroom]] wallpaper may deteriorate rapidly due to excessive [[steam]]. Proper preparation includes the repair of any defects in the drywall or plaster and the removal of loose material or old adhesives. For a better finish with thinner papers and poorer quality walls the wall can be cross-lined (horizontally) with lining paper first. Accurate room measurements (length, width, and height) along with number of window and door openings is essential for ordering wallpaper. Large drops, or repeats, in a pattern can be cut and hung more economically by working from alternating rolls of paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primetimepaint.ca/2013/how-to-hang-wallpaper|title=How To Hang Wallpaper|date=8 February 2013|publisher=Primetime Paint &amp; Paper|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After pre-pasted wallpaper is moistened, or dry wallpaper is coated with wet paste, the wet surface is folded onto itself and left for a few minutes to activate the glue, which is called "booking wallpaper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/how-to/step/0,,214188_146572,00.html|title=How to Hang Wallpaper|author=|date=4 March 2002|website=thisoldhouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides conventional installation on interior walls and ceilings, wallpapers have been deployed as decorative covering for hatboxes, bandboxes, books, shelves, and window-shades.&lt;ref&gt;C. Lynn: Wallpaper in America from the Seventeenth Century to World War I (New York, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wallpaper adhesives===
{{main|Wallpaper adhesive}}
Most wallpaper adhesive are [[starch]] or [[methylcellulose]] based.

==Removal==
===Water===
The simplest removal option is to brush the paper with water. Water soaks through the paper and saturates the glue, allowing the paper to be peeled off.

This does not work well with non-peelable vinyls, as vinyl is not porous. Nevertheless, it is still effective on many modern papers.

A mixture of 3:1 or 1:1 water and white vinegar is effective at dissolving glues. If the wallpaper is scored or sanded with a 20 grit floor sanding pad to scratch the surface solution, uptake will be more effective.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Chemical wallpaper stripper===
Chemical wallpaper stripper can be purchased at most paint or home improvement stores. It is mixed with warm water or a mixture of warm water and vinegar, then sprayed onto wall surfaces. Several applications may be required to saturate the existing wallpaper. Perforation can aid in the absorption of the mixture and lead to faster removal. After the mixture has dissolved the wallpaper paste, the wallpaper can be removed easily by pulling at the edges and with the aid of a putty or drywall knife.

===Steam===
Another method of removal is to apply steam to wallpaper in order to dissolve the wallpaper paste.
A [[wallpaper steamer]] consists of a reservoir of water, an electric heating element, and a hose to direct the steam at the wallpaper. The steam dissolves the wallpaper paste, allowing the wallpaper to be peeled off. However, care must be taken to prevent damage to the [[drywall]] underneath. Sometimes steaming can lead to the crumbling of underlying drywall or plaster, leaving an uneven surface to be repaired.

[[Image:Oinoche Camiros fantastic Louvre A318.jpg|thumb|right|An ''[[oinochoe]]'' of the Wild Goat Style. Camiros, Rhodes, {{circa|625 BCE}} (Louvre)]]

The '''Wild Goat Style''' (variously capitalized and hyphenated) is a modern term describing [[Pottery_of_ancient_Greece#Vase_painting|vase painting]] produced in the east of Greece, namely the southern and eastern Ionian islands, between {{circa|650 to 550 BCE}}. Examples have been found notably at the sites in [[Chios]], at [[Miletus]] and in [[Rhodes]]. The style owes its name to the predominant motif found on such vases: friezes of goats. The style developed the technique introduced during the [[Orientalizing Period]] of rendering the heads of figures in outline by applying it to the whole of a figure.  Thus where previously an image was a silhouette, the Wild Goat Style allowed a greater representation of detail and marked a step forward in the progress towards naturalism.

[[File:East Greek plate in Wild Goat style.jpg|thumb|Plate in the 'Wild Goat' style, showing a sphinx with geometric and floral motifs above a zone of petals]]
Goats are not the only creatures depicted on such vases; in common with other Orientalizing pottery, hares, lions, hounds, [[griffin]]s and [[sphinx]]es are also to be found along with favoured in-filling devices like intertwining lines and dots or a checker pattern. The variety of ornamentation makes a careful distinction of a number of phases in the development of the style possible which in turn has been used to date the founding of Greek colonies in the [[Levant]] and North Africa.

The '''Yale Center for British Art''' at [[Yale University]] in downtown [[New Haven, Connecticut]], houses the largest and most comprehensive collection of [[British art]] outside the [[United Kingdom]]. The collection of paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints, rare books, and manuscripts reflects the development of British art and culture from the Elizabethan period onward.

==Creation==
The Center was established by a gift from [[Paul Mellon]] (Yale College Class of 1929) of his British art collection to [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1966, together with an endowment for operations of the Center, and funds for a building to house the works of art. The building was designed by [[Louis I. Kahn]] and constructed at the corner of York and Chapel Streets in New Haven, across the street from one of Kahn's earliest buildings, the [[Yale University Art Gallery]], built in 1953.  The Yale Center for British Art was completed after Kahn's death in 1974, and opened to the public on April 15, 1977. The exterior is made of matte steel and reflective glass; the interior is made of [[travertine]] marble, white oak, and Belgian linen. Kahn succeeded in creating intimate galleries where one can view objects in diffused natural light. He wanted to allow in as much daylight as possible, with artificial illumination used only on dark days or in the evening. The building’s design, materials, and sky-lit rooms combine to provide an environment for the works of art that is simple and dignified.

The Center is affiliated with the [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] in [[London]], which awards grants and fellowships, publishes academic titles, and sponsors Yale’s first credit-granting undergraduate study abroad program, Yale-in-London.

==Collection==
The collection consists of nearly 2,000 paintings and 200 sculptures, with an emphasis on the period between [[William Hogarth]]'s birth (1697) to [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s death (1851). Other artists represented include [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[George Stubbs]], [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], [[John Constable]], [[Joshua Reynolds]], [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Thomas Lawrence]], [[Robert Polhill Bevan]], [[Stanley Spencer]], [[Barbara Hepworth]], and [[Ben Nicholson]].
[[File:YCBA interior1.jpg|thumb|Interior of the fourth floor]]
[[File:YCBA interior2.jpg|thumb|Fourth floor lobby]]

The collection also has works by artists from Europe and North America who lived and worked in Britain. These include [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Canaletto]], [[Johann Zoffany]], [[John Singleton Copley]], [[Benjamin West]], and [[James McNeill Whistler]].

Some areas of emphasis of the collection are small group [[portrait]]s, known as "[[conversation piece]]s", including those by Hogarth, Gainsborough, Zoffany and [[Arthur Devis (1712-1787)|Arthur Devis]]; landscape paintings by Gainsborough, Richard Wilson, Constable, [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and Turner; and British sporting and animal paintings, featuring [[George Stubbs]], [[John Wootton]], [[Benjamin Marshall]], and [[Alfred Munnings]]. Other genres include marine paintings, represented by Samuel Scott and Charles Brooking; London cityscapes; travel art from India, scenes of [[Shakespeare]]an plays, and portraits of actors.

Sculptors represented include [[Louis-Francois Roubiliac]], [[Joseph Nollekens]], [[Francis Chantrey]], [[Jacob Epstein]], and [[Henry Moore]].

The collection of 20,000 drawings and watercolors and 31,000 prints features British sporting art and figure drawings. It includes works by Hogarth, [[Paul Sandby]], Thomas Rowlandson, [[William Blake]], John Constable, [[Samuel Palmer]], Richard Parkes Bonington, [[John Ruskin]], J. M. W. Turner, [[Walter Sickert]], [[Duncan Grant]], [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Edward Burra]], [[Stanley Spencer]], [[Augustus John]], [[Gwen John]], and the Pre-Raphaelites.

The Center's collection of rare books and manuscripts comprises 35,000 volumes, including maps, atlases, sporting books, and archival material of British artists. It also has some 1,300 leaves originating in illustrated [[incunabula]]. The collection also includes a complete set of William Morris’s Kelmscott Press publications as well as a growing collection of contemporary artists’ books. The core of the collection of illustrated books is the material amassed by Major J. R. Abbey‚ one of the first collectors of British color-plate books, and includes more than 2‚000 volumes describing British life‚ customs‚ scenery‚ and travel during the period 1770–1860. The Center’s collection also contains a significant number of early maps and atlases.

The four-floor Center offers a year-round schedule of exhibitions and educational programs, including films, concerts, lectures, tours, symposia, and family programs. It also provides numerous opportunities for scholarly research, including residential fellowships. Academic resources of the Center include the reference library (40,000 volumes) and photo archive, conservation laboratories, and a study room for examining works on paper from the collection.

The Center is open to the public free of charge six days a week, and is a member of the [[North American Reciprocal Museums]] program.
