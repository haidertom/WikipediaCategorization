{{Years in film}}
The decade of the '''1870s in film''' involved some significant events.

==Events==
*1874 – French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen]] used his "photographic revolver" to photograph the [[Passage de Venus|transit of the planet Venus across the Sun]]. 
*1877 – French inventor [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] improved on the [[Zoetrope]] idea by placing mirrors at the center of the drum. He called his invention the [[Praxinoscope]]. Reynaud developed other versions of the Praxinoscope, too, including a Praxinoscope Theatre (where the device was enclosed in a viewing box) and the Projecting Praxinoscope. Eventually he created the "[[Théâtre Optique]]", a large machine based on the Praxinoscope, but was able to project longer animated strips. In the United States, the McLoughlin Bros. from New York released in 1879 a simplified (and unauthorized) copy of Reynaud's invention under the name "Whirligig of Life".
*1878 – Railroad tycoon [[Leland Stanford]] hired British photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] to settle the questions of whether a galloping horse ever had all four of its feet off the ground. Muybridge [[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|successfully photographed]] a horse in fast motion using a series of 12 cameras controlled by trip wires. Muybridge's photos showed the horse with all four feet off the ground. Muybridge went on a lecture tour showing his photographs on a moving-image device he called the [[zoopraxiscope]]. Muybridge's experiments inspired French scientist [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] to invent equipment for recording and analyzing animal and human movement. Marey called his invention the chronophotographic camera, which was able to take multiple images superimposed on top of one another.
*1879 – American [[George Eastman]] invents an emulsion-coating machine which enables the mass-production of [[photography|photographic]] dry plates.

'''Albert Henri Victor Cleuter''' (10 August 1901 [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]] - 1996) was a Belgian botanical artist. He was the only child of Francois Ernest Cleuter and Henriette Marie Catherine Denys of Brussels. The father loved to draw and produced ink and watercolour sketches admired by his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3668130|title=Albert Cleuter (1901-1996), dessinateur botaniste|first=A.|last=Lawalrée|date=1 January 1997|journal=Bulletin du Jardin Botanique National de Belgique / Bulletin van de National Plantentuin van België|volume=66|issue=1/2|pages=3–11|via=|doi=10.2307/3668130|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert enrolled at the [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts]] in Brussels in August 1917 where he successfully completed a year of design study and 4 years of architecture and related courses, and two years of ornamental composition. He also produced sketches and designs for ladies' fashion.

At the Botanical Garden of Belgium he succeeded [http://www.br.fgov.be/PUBLIC/GENERAL/HISTORY/durandhelene.php Hélène Durand], a prolific illustrator of conifers. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.br.fgov.be/PUBLIC/GENERAL/EVENTS/EVENTSNL/Persbericht%20Plantenportretten.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A master at developing his own style, Albert Cleuter, was active as botanical illustrator at the ''[[Jardin Botanique National de Belgique]]'' from 1936 to 1966, his style becoming an accepted standard there. An architect by training, he discovered a new vocation in botanical illustration and produced hundreds of plates, proving himself to be a great observer, and creating virtuoso work with his pen. He occasionally used the time-consuming stipple technique for shading when he felt that a line drawing was not adequate. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/-titre-expo-5-bonnes-raisons-de-voir-l-expo-portraits-d_t-20090107-00L0WY.html|title=Partners - lesoir.be|first=|last=lesoir.be|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war years he worked as illustrator for the underground paper ''[[La Libre Belgique]]'' and forged identity documents for fugitives such as downed pilots. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.randkrant.be/files/rand-krant/2008/randkrant-12-2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleuter illustrated works for W Robyns: "Flore du Congo Belge et Ruanda-Urundi" 1948+; André Lawalrée: "Flore gén Belgique" 1950-9; J Fouarge/J Louis: "Essences forestières d'Afrique"; F White: "Forest Flora N Rhodesia" 1962. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/hi/gnt/dsi2/index.php?table_name=dsi&amp;page=0&amp;function=search&amp;execute_search=1|title=DSI - Database of Scientific Illustrators|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alice Jacob''' (26 January 1862 – 31 July 1921) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[botany|botanical]] illustrator, lace designer, and design teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Botanical Art Collections: Alice Jacob|url=http://www.botanicgardens.ie/lib/art.html|website=National Botanical Gardens Glasnevin|accessdate=8 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114000858/http://www.botanicgardens.ie/lib/art.html|archive-date=2013-11-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Alice Jacob was born in 1862 in [[New Zealand]], to Irish parents. The family returned to Ireland in 1871 to live in Dublin.&lt;ref name="Project MUSE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Clúdach: Cover, New Hibernia Review 19.1 (2015): 33-33|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/new_hibernia_review/v019/19.1.article.pdf|website=Project MUSE|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family were Quakers, with her father Anthony Pim Jacob running a temperance hotel at 88 Thomas Street. Jacob went on to attend the [[National College of Art and Design|Dublin Metropolitan School of Art]] (DMSA), and was awarded the Gilchrist Trust Scholarship in 1882 and a free studentship in 1888.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia|title=Irish Botanical Illustrators &amp; Flower Painters|date=2000|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Suffolk|isbn=9781851493579|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in Dublin on 31 July 1921.&lt;ref name=Desmond /&gt;

==Artistic career==
Jacob was a successful and well known artist in her time. She was a prizewinner in Art Industries competition at the [[Royal Dublin Society]] Horse Show in 1890. In 1891, the [[Miranda Hill|Kyrle Society]] in London awarded her a prize for a frieze she painted. Her work was featured at the ''Art de la femme'' exhibitions in Paris between 1891 and 1893. Jacob designed and painted a set of [[Belleek Pottery|Belleek porcelain]] for Dr Perceval Wright, the Professor of Botany at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. Her work was selected for by the Hungarian Government in 1898 to be exhibited in the new Museum of Industrial Art in [[Budapest]]. Having worked at the Cork School of Art and Rathmines Technical School,&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; Jacob was appointed as the teacher of Design and Ornament at the DMSA in 1898.&lt;ref name="Project MUSE" /&gt; She collaborated with Reverend [[F.C.

==Plot overview==
''American Sniper'' tells the story of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL who completed four tours in Iraq from 1999–2009. The book describes Kyle's upbringing in [[Odessa, Texas]], Navy SEAL training, and combat experiences in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/taylor-dibbert/book-review-american-snip_b_6753216.html | title = Book Review: American Sniper |date=27 April 2015 | accessdate = 6 October 2016 | publisher = ''Huffington Post'' | author = Taylor Dibbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/13/book-review-american-sniper/ | title = BOOK REVIEW: 'American Sniper' |date=13 January 2012 | accessdate = 6 October 2016 | publisher = ''Washington Times'' | author = Joshua Sinai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyle describes his role in the battle for control of Ramadi, events that led to Iraqi insurgents' nicknaming Kyle the "Devil of Ramadi" and placing a bounty on his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2012/01/01/meet-the-big-shot/|title=Meet the big shot – SEAL is America's deadliest sniper|author=Buiso, Gray|date=January 1, 2012|accessdate=October 6, 2016|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/01/20/chris-kyle-american-sniper-fact-sheet/22046493/ | title = The fascinating life of Chris Kyle, the 'American Sniper' | date=23 January 2015 | accessdate = 6 October 2016 | publisher = ''USA Today'' | author = Lindsay Deutsch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyle writes that after his first confirmed kill, "the others come easy. I don't have to psych myself up, or do something special mentally—I look through the scope, get my target in the cross hairs, and kill my enemy, before he kills one of my people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/05/entertainment/la-et-book-20120305 | title = Book review: 'American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History' by Chris Kyle, Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice | date=5 March 2012 | accessdate = 6 October 2016 | publisher = ''Los Angeles Times'' | author = Tony Perry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

===Post-publication retraction===
In July 2014, the sub-chapter "Punching Out Scruff Face" was removed from later editions of the book, after a three-week trial in U.S. Federal Court wherein the jury found that the author, Chris Kyle, had [[unjust enrichment|unjustly enriched]] himself by [[defamation|defaming]] plaintiff [[Jesse Ventura]]. In the book, Kyle described blackening the eye of "Scruff Face", whom he later identified in media interviews as Jesse Ventura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_26299954/venturas-1-8m-award-defamation-trial-ruled-reasonable | title=Jesse Ventura's $1.8M award in defamation trial ruled reasonable | work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] | date=August 8, 2014 | accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury awarded Ventura $500,000 for defamation and $1,345,477.25 for unjust enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140729-breaking-jury-awards-jesse-ventura-1.8-million-in-american-sniper-lawsuit.ece |title=Jury awards Jesse Ventura $1.8 million in 'American Sniper' lawsuit |newspaper=Dallas Morning News |date=July 29, 2014 |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris Kyle trial: Jesse Ventura wins $1.8 million in defamation case|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/lake-oswego/index.ssf/2014/07/chris_kyle_trial_jurors_warn_t.html|accessdate=January 15, 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Oregon Live|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, attorneys for Ventura filed a separate lawsuit against HarperCollins, the parent company of the publisher, for failing to check the accuracy of the story it used in publicity. The suit alleges that the false account used in publicity had "increased sales" and generated "millions of dollars for HarperCollins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holley |first=Peter |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/12/16/jesse-ventura-sues-harpercollins-over-chris-kyles-american-sniper/ |title=Jesse Ventura sues HarperCollins over Chris Kyle's 'American Sniper' |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=December 16, 2014 |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 13, 2016, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] vacated the verdict on the defamation count, remanding the case for a new trial on that count, and reversed the unjust enrichment verdict outright.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/16/06/143876P.pdf ''Ventura v. Kyle'', No. 14-3876 (8th Cir. June 13, 2016)].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity donation claims===
Some sources claimed Kyle's family had said all his book proceeds were donated to veterans' charities. ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' and ''[[National Review]]'' disputed the donation amount, asserting that around 2 percent ($52,000) went to the charities, while Kyle's family received $3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jilani|first1=Zaid|title=7 heinous lies "American Sniper" is telling America|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/01/23/7_enormous_lies_american_sniper_is_telling_america_partner/|accessdate=January 26, 2015|agency=[[Alternet]]|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delgado|first1=A.J.|title=Justice for Jesse: Ventura Was Right in His Lawsuit|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/384176/justice-jesse-ventura-was-right-his-lawsuit-j-delgado/|accessdate=January 26, 2015|publisher=[[National Review Online]]|date=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military record claims===
In May 2016, ''[[The Intercept]]'' claimed that Kyle's autobiography "embellished" his military record, and that he had been warned by Navy officials about the inaccuracies before publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Chris Kyle overstated his military medal record, documents show|url=http://fox5sandiego.com/2016/05/25/american-sniper-chris-kyle-lied-about-his-record-documents-show/|accessdate=May 26, 2016|agency=Fox 5 San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gettys|first1=Travis|title=REVEALED: Conservative hero 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle grossly exaggerated his military record|url=https://www.rawstory.com/2016/05/revealed-conservative-hero-american-sniper-chris-kyle-grossly-exaggerated-his-military-record/|accessdate=May 27, 2018|agency=The Raw Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://theintercept.com/2016/05/25/american-sniper-chris-kyle-distorted-his-military-record-documents-show/ |title= "American Sniper" Chris Kyle Distorted His Military Record, Documents Show |date= May 25, 2016 |first1= Matthew |last1= Cole |first2= Sheelagh |last2= McNeill |work= [[The Intercept]] |accessdate= May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle's truthfulness is in question once again|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/05/25/how-american-sniper-chris-kyles-truthfulness-is-in-question-once-again/|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016|first=Dan|last=Lamothe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including co-author Scott McEwen, disputed this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-sniper-author-defends-chris-899044|title='American Sniper' Co-Author Defends Chris Kyle's Military Record Over New Controversy|quote=We submitted the book for vetting with the DOD ... and certain parts of the manuscript were, at their request, redacted. [C]ertain other figures ... for example the number of Chris' confirmed kills —were agreed upon as something that could be released to the public.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' did an analysis, concluding that the newly released internal Navy documents were inconclusive — that the document that typically is the definitive record of military service matched Kyle's claims and that the Navy had not yet publicly stated this document or the facts within it were incorrect. Kyle's [[DD Form 214]] listed a total of two Silver Stars and six Bronze stars, more than he claimed in his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-sniper-chris-kyle-medal-898004|title='American Sniper' Chris Kyle's Record Under Fire, But Is It a Memorial Day Rush to Judgment?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 8, 2016, the U.S. Navy corrected Kyle's DD-214 regarding some decorations listed on his original discharge document.&lt;ref name="cnn20160708"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crawford|first=Jamie|publisher=CNN|title=Navy: 'American Sniper' medal count corrected|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy revised it to one Silver Star and four Bronze Stars with valor.&lt;ref name="cnn20160708"/&gt; The Navy said "Kyle would have played no role in the production of his personnel files other than signing the DD-214 upon his discharge" and "[a]fter thoroughly reviewing all available records, the Navy determined an error was made" and "issued a corrected copy of the DD-214, which accurately reflects Kyle's years of honorable and extraordinary service."&lt;ref name="cnn20160708"/&gt;

==Film adaptation==
[[Clint Eastwood]]'s film ''[[American Sniper]]'' (2014) is based on Kyle's autobiography. It had its world première on November 11, 2014, at the [[AFI Fest|American Film Institute Festival]], followed by a limited theatrical release in the United States on December 25, 2014.  It received a wide release January 16, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Warner Bros.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4150">{{about||the 1989 film|Anecdote (film)|a comparison of anecdote with other kinds of stories|traditional story}}
An '''''anecdote''''' is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|title=Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory, Third Ed.|year=1992|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally [[humor]]ous, anecdotes differ from [[joke]]s because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke [[laughter]] but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific [[wikt:quirk|quirk]] or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Epstein|first=Lawrence|title=A Treasury of Jewish Anecdotes|year=1989|publisher=Jason Aronson|location=Northvale, NJ|pages=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anecdote is "a story with a point."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Epstein|1989|pp=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Anecdotes may be real or fictional;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Kennedy |first=X. J.|title=Handbook of Literary Terms, Third Ed.|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anecdotal digression is a common feature of literary works,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cuddon|1992|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even oral anecdotes typically involve subtle exaggeration and dramatic shape designed to entertain the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |contributor-first=Jurgen |contributor-last=Heine |contribution=Die Anekdote |last=Knorrich |first=Otto |title=Formen der Literatur in Einzeldarstellugen |year=1981 |publisher=Alfred Kroner|location=Stuttgart|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an anecdote is always presented as the recounting of a real incident, involving actual persons and usually in an identifiable place. In the words of Jurgen Heine, they exhibit "a special realism" and "a claimed historical dimension."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heine|1981|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''anecdote'' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀνέκδοτον "unpublished", literally "not given out") comes from [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the biographer of [[Justinian I]], who produced a work entitled {{lang|grc|Ἀνέκδοτα}} (''Anekdota'', variously translated as ''Unpublished Memoirs'' or ''Secret History''), which is primarily a collection of short incidents from the private life of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] court. Gradually, the term "anecdote" came to be applied&lt;ref&gt;Its first appearance in English is of 1676 (''[[OED]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; to any short tale utilized to emphasize or illustrate whatever point the author wished to make. In the context of [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Russian humor]], an anecdote refers to any short humorous story without the need of factual or biographical origins.

== Qualification as evidence ==
{{main|Anecdotal evidence}}
Anecdotal evidence is an informal account of [[evidence]] in the form of an anecdote. The term is often used in contrast to [[scientific evidence]], as evidence that cannot be investigated using the [[scientific method]]. The problem with arguing based on anecdotal evidence is that anecdotal evidence is not necessarily typical; only statistical evidence can determine how typical something is. Misuse of anecdotal evidence is an [[informal fallacy]].

When used in [[advertising]] or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal evidence is often called a [[testimonial]]. The term is also sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony. [[Psychologist]]s have found that people are more likely to remember notable examples than the typical example.

Established in 1994, ANAM's Professional Performance Program is flexible for students wishing to study their instrument in the following categories - strings, woodwind, brass, percussion, harp and keyboard instruments. From 2012, ANAM offers a master's degree delivered in collaboration with [[Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University]],  along with Fellowship and short course opportunities.

==2008/09 funding crisis==
On 23 October 2008, the [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|Minister for the Arts]], [[Peter Garrett]], announced that ANAM would not receive any government funding in 2009&lt;ref name=Age&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/canberra-axes-music-academy-funds-20081023-57gq.html Canberra axes music academy funds], Robin Usher, ''[[The Age]]'', 24 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; despite funding having been arranged initially in 1994 by the then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], [[Paul Keating]]. A spokesman for Garret is reported to have said, "ANAM no longer represents the most efficient way of delivering support for elite classical music training." The ANAM Artistic Director Brett Dean said, "That is heart-breaking for music education in this country."

'''Bad Girrls Studios''' was a popular [[Boston]] [[Art gallery|gallery]] and performance space from 1996 to 2000, located at 209 Green Street in Jamaica Plain. Founded by [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] student Jessica Brand, the [[artist-run]] studio hosted numerous events until it closed due to pressure from the [[Boston Licensing Commission]] and lack of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/03/04/no_alternative/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=No alternative | first=Geoff | last=Edgers | date=March 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=98915 The Harvard Crimson :: Arts :: The Field Guide: Art in Boston&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://users.rcn.com/kyp/dog.html Putting Shakespeare's Dog to Sleep&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad Girrls Studios supported [[female]] artists in particular, and art that pushed boundaries of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], the largest of which was a 1998 exhibit "Naughty Girrls Nite @ Bad Girrls Studios", produced by studio member Rebecca Goldberg, which drew over 50 women artists and performers from [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New England]].

Several of the studio members were also co-founders or members of the [[Art School Cheerleaders]]. This performance art group, which began at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]], used Cheerleading as a medium for satirical commentary about art and the art world, and to advocate for arts funding.

The artist-run gallery was partially inspired by another important [[performance art]] space in Boston during that time, [[Mobius Artists Group]], that brought cutting-edge performance artists to Boston through an international exchange program. Mobius had been founded by another member of the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] community, instructor Marilyn Arsem. 

Bad Girrls Studios operated under the slogan "Art is Not A Luxury."

The '''Book of Tobit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|oʊ|b|ɪ|t}}){{efn|from the {{lang-grc-gre|Τωβίθ}} ''Tōbith'' or {{lang|el|Τωβίτ}} ''Tōbit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Τωβείθ}} and {{lang|el|Τωβείτ}} spellings are also attested; see [[iotacism]].&lt;/ref&gt; itself from {{lang-he|טובי}} ''Tovi'' "my good";  '''Book of Tobias''' in the [[Vulgate]] from the Greek {{lang|grc|Τωβίας}} ''Tōbias'', itself from the Hebrew {{lang|he|טוביה}} ''Tovyah'' "[[Jah|Yah]] is good"}} is a book of scripture that is part of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[biblical canon]]s. It was pronounced canonical by the [[Council of Hippo]] (in 393), the [[Councils of Carthage]] of 397 and 417, and the [[Council of Florence]] (in 1442), and confirmed in the [[Counter-Reformation]] by the [[Council of Trent]] (1546). It is not found in Protestant or Jewish biblical canons.

==Canonical status==
===In Christianity===
The Book of Tobit is listed as a canonical book by the [[Council of Rome]] (382 AD),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tertullian.org/decretum_eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Hippo]] (393 AD),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xv.iv.iv.xxv.html |chapter=Canon XXIV.

Westcott, ''A General Survey of the History of the Canon of the New Testament'' (5th ed. Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 440, 541-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and (419 AD),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3816.htm Council of Carthage (A.D. 419) Canon 24]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Florence]] (1442)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eccumenical Council of Florence and Council of Basel Session 11—4 February 1442|publisher=ewtn|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/FLORENCE.HTM|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally the [[Council of Trent]] (1546),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/TRENT4.htm Session IV Celebrated on the eighth day of April, 1546 under Pope Paul III]&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of the canon of both the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]]. Roman Catholics often refer to it as [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]].&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer55"/&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=of Hippo|first1=Augustine|title=On Christian Doctrine Book II Chapter 8:2|publisher=newadvent|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/12022.htm|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 397 AD) and [[Pope Innocent I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Westcott|first1=Brooke Foss|title=A general survey of the history of the canon of the New Testament Page 570|date=2005|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock|location=Eugene, Oregon|isbn=1597522392|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; (405 AD) affirmed that Tobit is a part of the Old Testament Canon. [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] (367 AD) mentioned that certain other books, including the book of Tobit, while not being part of the Canon, "were appointed by the Fathers to be read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=of Alexandria|first1=Athanasius|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Letter 39 (Athanasius)|publisher=newadvent|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2806039.htm|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the monk [[Rufinus of Aquileia]] (c. 400 AD) the book of Tobit and other deuterocanonical books were not called Canonical but Ecclesiastical books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=of Aquileia|first1=Rufinus|title=Commentary on the Apostles' Creed #38|publisher=newadvent|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2711.htm|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abraham de Pape 001.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Tobit and Anna''. Painting by Abraham De Pape (c. 1658), [[National Gallery of London]]]]

Article VI of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]] lists it as a book of the "[[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |title=Anglican Articles of Religion |publisher=Anglicansonline.org |date=2007-04-15 |accessdate=2014-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Prjkilh0?url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |archivedate=2007-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protestantism|Protestants]] regard Tobit as [[apocrypha]]l because it was not included in the [[Tanakh]] nor considered canonical by Judaism.

===In Judaism===
Before the 1952 discovery of [[Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] fragments of Tobit among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in a cave at [[Qumran]], scholars believed Tobit was not included in the Jewish canon because of late authorship, estimated to 100 AD.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer55" &gt;Fitzmyer, at pp. 50, 55–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/learn-about-the-scrolls/scrolls-content |title=Scrolls Content |publisher=The Dead Sea Scrolls |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qumran fragments of the text, which were copied between 100 BC to 25 AD, evidence a much earlier origin than previously thought.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer55" /&gt; These fragments evidence authorship no later than the 2nd century BC and, likely, contemporary with the date ascribed, by modern scholars, to the final compilation of the [[Book of Daniel]], which did attain canonical status.&lt;ref&gt;R. Glenn Wooden, "Changing Perceptions of Daniel: Reading Chapters 4 and 5 of Daniel", in'' From Biblical Criticism to Biblical Faith'', Brackney &amp; Evans eds., p. 10 (Mercer Univ.Press 2007) {{ISBN|0-88146-052-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars have postulated that Tobit was excluded from the Jewish Scriptures for a [[Halakha|halakhic]] reason because Raguel, the bride's father, wrote the marriage document discussed in 7:16, instead of the bridegroom, as required by Jewish rabbinical law.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer55" /&gt;

However, it could be hypothesized that some ancient Jewish rabbinic scholars considered Tobit to be historical. [[Bereishit Rabbah|Midrash Bereishit Rabbah]], an aggadic commentary on the [[Book of Genesis]] compiled circa 400–600 AD, includes a truncated [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] version of Tobit. Tobit was also considered part of the [[Septuagint]] (the Greek translation/interpretation of the Hebrew Bible).&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer55" /&gt;  In more contemporary times, a number of Jews in Israel have sought to reclaim Tobit as part of the canon.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bredin, ''Studies in the Book of Tobit: A Multidisciplinary Approach'', p. 3 (T&amp;T Clark 2006), {{ISBN|0-567-08229-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Tobias Saying Good-Bye to his Father (1860).png|thumb|left|240px|''Tobias Saying Good-Bye to his Father''. Painting by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] (1860)]]
This book tells the story of '''Tobit''', a righteous Israelite of the [[tribe of Naphtali]], living in [[Nineveh]] after [[Sargon II]] had deported the northern tribes of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] to [[Assyria]] in 721 BC. In the two Greek versions, the first two and a half chapters are written in the first person; in the Vulgate version, they are written in the third person.&lt;ref&gt;''Septuaginta: Editio altera/Revised Edition,'' 2006: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, pp. 1002-1039; ''Biblia Sacra Vulgata,'' vierte, verbesserte Auflage 1994: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, pp. 676-690.&lt;/ref&gt; Tobit, raised by his paternal grandmother, Deborah, remains loyal to the worship of God at the temple in Jerusalem, refusing the cult of the [[golden calf|golden calves]] that [[Jeroboam]], king of Northern Israel, set up at [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. He is particularly noted for his diligence in attempting to provide proper burials for fallen Israelites whom Sargon's successor, [[Sennacherib]], has slain. For this behavior the king seizes his property and exiles him. After Sennacherib's death, Tobit is allowed to return to Nineveh, where he buries a man who has been murdered on the street. That night, he sleeps in the open and is blinded by bird droppings which fall into his eyes. The blindness caused by this injury strains his marriage and, ultimately, he prays for death.&lt;ref name=je&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14422-tobit-book-of "Tobit, book of", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tobias cura a cegueira de seu pai - Domingos Sequeira.png|thumb|right|250px|''Tobias heals the blindness of his father Tobit'', by [[Domingos Sequeira]]]]

Meanwhile, in faraway [[Medes|Media]], a young woman named Sarah has prayed for death in despair. The [[demon]] of lust, [[Asmodeus]] ("the worst of demons"), abducts and kills every man Sarah marries on their wedding night before the marriage can be consummated. God sends the angel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], disguised as a human, to heal Tobit and free Sarah from the demon.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

The main narrative is dedicated to Tobit's son, Tobiah or Tobiyah (Greek: {{lang|el|Τωβίας}} ''Tobias''), who is sent by his father to collect money that the elder has deposited in distant Media. Raphael presents himself as Tobit's kinsman, Azariah, and offers to aid and protect Tobias. Under Raphael's guidance, Tobias journeys to Media with his dog.

Along the way, while washing his feet in the river [[Tigris]], a fish tries to swallow his foot. By the angel's order, he captures it and removes its heart, liver and gall bladder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tobit+6&amp;version=GNT |title= Tobit 6 GNT – Tobias Catches a Fish – So Tobias and |publisher= Bible Gateway |accessdate= 2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arriving in Media, Raphael tells Tobias of the beautiful Sarah, whom Tobias has the right to marry because he is her cousin and closest relative. The angel instructs the young man to burn the fish's liver and heart to drive away the demon when he attacks on the wedding night.&lt;ref name=Drum&gt;{{cite book|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14749c.htm|chapter=Book of Tobias|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|year=1909|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two marry, and the fumes of the burning organs drive the demon to [[Upper Egypt]], where Raphael follows and binds him. Sarah's father had been digging a grave to secretly bury Tobias under the assumption that he would be killed. Surprised to find his son-in-law alive and well, he orders a double-length wedding feast and has the grave secretly filled. Since the feast prevents him from leaving, Tobias sends Raphael to recover his father's money.&lt;ref name=Drum/&gt;

After the feast, Tobias and Sarah return to Nineveh. There, Raphael tells the youth to use the fish's gall to cure his father's blindness. Raphael then reveals his identity and returns to heaven, and Tobit sings a hymn of praise.&lt;ref name=Drum/&gt;

Tobit tells his son to leave Nineveh before God destroys it according to prophecy (compare the [[Book of Nahum]]). After the prayer, Tobit dies at an advanced age.&lt;ref&gt;
Tobit's age at death is variously given as 127 years in Greek I, 117 years in Greek II and the [[Vetus Latina]], and 102 years in most manuscripts of the [[Vulgate]], 112 years in others,
* (158) "an hundred and eight and fifty years old" in [[s:Bible (King James)/Tobit#14:11|Tobit 14:11 KJV]] (Wikisource)
* (102) "a hundred and two years" {{bibleref|Tobit|14:2|63}} Douay-Rheims (Biblegateway)
&lt;/ref&gt;
After burying his father and mother, Tobias returns to Media with his family.

==Liturgical and religious significance==
Readings from the book are used in the [[Latin Rite]]. Because of the book's praise for the purity of marriage, it is often read during weddings in many rites. Doctrinally, the book is cited for its teaching on the [[intercession]] of angels, [[filial piety]], and reverence for the dead.&lt;ref name=nab&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PCA.HTM "Introduction"], ''Tobit'', NAB, Libreria Editrice Vaticana {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227202156/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PCA.HTM |date=February 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

===Dating===
The story in the Book of Tobit is set in the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, at p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of historical errors (according to Miller, though some may dispute this) rule out contemporaneous authorship,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, at p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and most scholars now date the book's composition between 225 and 175 BC.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer51"&gt;Fitzmyer, at p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  The direct quote in Tobit 2:6 from the [[Book of Amos]] ("Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your mirth into lamentation"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Tobit.2:5–7;Amos.8:10||DRA|cf. Tobit 2:5–7 &amp;amp; Amos 8:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) indicates that the prophetic books had become not only fixed but authoritative, signalling a [[post-exilic]] date.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer51"/&gt; Moreover, reference to the "Book of Moses" (6:13, 7:11–13) and the "Law of Moses" (7:13) echo identical phrasing in the [[Book of Chronicles]], which some believe was composed after the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmyer, at p. 51; Miller, at p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contextually, dating Tobit's authorship to after 175 BC is problematic, as the author expresses no awareness of [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] attempts to [[Hellenization|Hellenize]] [[Judea]] (from 175 BC) or of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] against the Seleucids (165 BC), nor does it espouse apocalyptic or messianic expectations upon which later writings focused.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmyer, at pp. 51–52; Miller at pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, some scholars espouse a later date of composition of at least portions of Tobit.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmyer, at p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location and language===
No scholarly consensus exists on the place of composition, and "almost every region of the ancient world seems to be a candidate."&lt;ref name="Miller12"&gt;Miller, at pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Mesopotamian]] origin seems logical given that the story takes place in [[Assyria]] and [[Persia]], as does the invocation of the Persian demon "aeshma daeva", rendered "[[Asmodeus]]" by Tobit.&lt;ref name="Miller12"/&gt; But significant errors in geographical detail (such as the distance from [[Ecbatana]] to [[Rey, Iran|Rhages]] and their topography) render this origin questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, at p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against and in favor of Judean or Egyptian composition also exist.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, at pp. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original language of composition remains unclear. Tobit may have been originally composed either in [[Aramaic]] or Hebrew, since fragments of Tobit in both languages have been discovered at [[Qumran]].

===Genre===
The book is closely related to Jewish [[wisdom literature]]. This is especially clear in Tobit's instructions to Tobias before his departure for Media in Chapter 4, which particularly praise the value of prayer, fasting, and almsgiving.

==Manuscripts==
As stated, fragments of Tobit in both Aramaic and Hebrew have been discovered at [[Qumran]].&lt;ref&gt;Four Aramaic fragmentary texts of Tobit (4QTob&lt;sup&gt;a–d&lt;/sup&gt;ar [=4Q196-199]) and one Hebrew text (4QTob&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; [=4Q200]) were found at [[Qumran]] in Cave IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ccat.sas.upenn.edu"&gt;A.A. Di Lella, [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/19-tobit-nets.pdf ''New English Translation of the Septuagint'', "Tobit" (PDF)], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]] described his version for the [[Vulgate]] as being made from an Aramaic text available to him.

Surviving [[Greek (language)|Greek]] translations are found in two versions. The shorter, which Robert Hanhart called Greek I in his edition of the [[Septuagint]], is found in [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Alexandrinus|Alexandrinus]], Venetus, and most cursive manuscripts. The Greek II version, 1700 words longer, is found in [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and closely aligns with the Hebrew and Aramaic fragments found at Qumran. Apparently the Old Latin (La) manuscripts are also translated from the longer Greek II version. Most English translations since 1966 have relied on the Greek II version.&lt;ref name="ccat.sas.upenn.edu"/&gt;

'''Came glasswork''' is the process of joining cut pieces of [[art glass]] through the use of [[came]] strips or foil into picturesque designs in a framework of soldered metal.

Final products include a wide range of glasswork, including [[stained glass]] and [[leadlight|lead light]] pieces. Came is made of different metals, such as [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[brass]] and [[copper]]. The metal came selected generally depends upon the size, complexity and weight of the project. As an alternative to came, copper foil may be used, for small, intricate pieces.

==Overview==
Came glasswork includes assembling pieces of cut and possibly painted [[Art glass|glass]] using [[came]] sections. The joints where the came meet are [[solder]]ed to bind the sections. When all of the glass pieces have been put within came and a border put around the entire work, pieces are [[cement]]ed and supported as needed.&lt;ref name=Shannon/&gt; The work may be made [[waterproof]] by forcing a soft oily cement or [[Putty|mastic]] between the glass and the cames. A form of [[embellishment]] and [[gilding]], such as [[Angel gilding]] and [[Eglomise]], may be added to finish the piece.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Works may need to be reinforced, like large pieces or ones that will be exposed to the outdoor elements. Support can be provided as the piece is made through the use of reinforced and metal-covered lead came, the use of steel strips in the came channels, or use of rigid cames, such as [[copper]], [[brass]] or [[zinc]]. Bars of steel or [[steel]] [[rebar]] may be attached to the back of finished works as reinforcement.&lt;ref name=Shannon60&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 60. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Theophilus Presbyter]], the first to write about joining art glass using the came technique&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Daniel and Susan Chace. (editors). (1979). ''Reader's Digest Crafts &amp; Hobbies''. Readers Digest. p. 114. {{ISBN|0-89577-063-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the book ''De Divers Artibus''. Theophilus was a Benedictine Monk who was a glass and pigment worker who practiced in the late 11th and early 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley, J. et al. (1998). Back to the Roots: The Raw Materials, Glass Recipes and Glassmaking Practices of Theophilus. In: McCray, P. (ed). ''The Prehistory and History of Ancient Glassmaking''. p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, I. (1992). ''Theophilus and the Composition of Medieval Glass, Materials Issues in Art and Archaeology III''. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Materials Research Society. p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Materials to complete a glasswork project may include the [[pattern]], [[Art glass|cut glass]], [[came]], [[wood]] [[Molding (decorative)|trim]], [[solder]], [[cement]]. Additional supplies include [[newspaper]], cutter oil, a [[plywood]] board, [[masking tape]], flux,{{refn|Flux is used during the soldering process to better disperse heat from the soldering iron, improve the soldering process and to clean. Care should be taken to avoid contact to the skin or inhalation of its fumes.&lt;ref name=Stevenson14&gt;Stevenson, Christine. (2004).

''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 52. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Whiting has two purposes. It is used to seal the glaze or cement. It is also used to clean residue off of the came and the project.&lt;ref name=Stevenson14/&gt;|group=nb}}

===Came===
Lead came is often supplied in lengths of 2&amp;nbsp;m and in widths of differing sizes. It also comes in flat or domed profiles.

====Brass and copper====
Brass and copper have been used to bring a copper or golden hue to the works.&lt;ref name=Berry10&gt;Berry, Leigh Ann. (2003). ''Basic Stained Glass Making: All the Skills and Tools You Need to Get Started''. Stackpole Books. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-8117-2846-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, though, they were used only for windows between about 1890 and 1920. Both metals were often alternatives to zinc for [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] designed windows.&lt;ref name=DOI&gt;Department of Interior. (2004). ''The Preservation of Historic Architecture: The U.S. Government's Official Guidelines for Preserving Historic Homes''. Lyons Press Series. Globe Pequot. p. 397. {{ISBN|1-59228-126-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinz/&gt;

====Brass-capped lead====
Brass-capped lead is another type of came used for glasswork projects.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;

====Lead====
The traditional method of creating "camework glass" uses [[lead]] [[came]], which ages into a dark blue-gray [[patina]]. In comparison to other came metal strips, like brass, copper and zinc, lead is softer and more flexible, making it easier to cut and bend. It's also inexpensive and durable. A downside is that the finished projects may be prone to sagging due to lead's softness. This can be mitigated somewhat by stretching the lead to make it more rigid before it is used.&lt;ref name=Shannon&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 51. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevenson12&gt;Stevenson, Christine. (2004). ''Creative Stained Glass: Modern Designs &amp; Simple Techniques''. Lark Books. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-57990-487-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Special precautions should be taken when working with this metal came to avoid to lead contamination.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;

The lead came windows of the medieval churches are sturdier than those of the 19th century and much of the 20th century. The composition of lead came changed over time, at first by removing other metals to make a "pure lead" and then again during war years when lead was needed for ammunition. Since the 1970s a new form of lead, restoration lead, was developed based upon medieval lead's metal composition. Restoration lead is stronger than lead came of the prior 100 years or so.&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;

Water tightness is achieved by brushing [[adhesive|cement]] under the flanges of the leads to both faces prior to installation or by applying [[putty]] afterwards. Typically the cement consisted of [[linseed oil]], [[Chalk|whiting]], [[lamp black]] and [[white spirit]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Zinc====
Zinc makes a lightweight, strong and rigid came, which lends itself to glasswork projects that don't have many curved lines, are large, or have a number of straight lines that require greater support than lead would afford. Zinc accepts finishes, such as black and copper. Because of its strength, zinc is often used for border cames, which are U-channel cames for the outside edges.&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 55-60. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Lloyd Wright used zinc came for his stained glass windows.&lt;ref name=Heinz&gt;Heinz, Thomas A. (September / October 1989). "Use &amp; Repair of Zinc Cames in Art-Glass Windows." ''Old House Journal''. pp. 35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beveled glass]] work is generally done in zinc came, primarily because of its ability to manage the weight of heavy plate glass; whereas beveled glass works made of lead came are much more likely to buckle or sag over time.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Anita and Seymour Isenberg. (2002). ''How to Work in Beveled Glass: Forming, Designing, and Fabricating''. Dover Stained Glass Instruction Series. Courier Dover Publications. p. 21. {{ISBN|0-486-42062-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper foil===

This is an example of copper foil glasswork, an alternative to came glasswork.]]

Copper foil is an easy, versatile alternative to came and is particularly useful for small projects.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt; Using [[copper]] [[foil (chemistry)|foil]], the edges of the glass pieces are wrapped with adhesive copper tape and [[soldering|soldered]] together along the adjacent copper strips. The copper foil technique (commonly called [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|''Tiffany'']] stained glass, even though there is a debate about whether [[John La Farge]] or [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] originated it) was invented in the 19th century, enabling creation of [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] works, in addition to [[two-dimensional]] ones to which the lead came method is limited. A patent for the method of "Joining Glass Mosaics" was issued to Sanford Bray in 1886. This new method of joining pieces of stained glass used copper/copper foil instead of lead sashes. By using copper foil, one could now make cylinders, cones, and globe-shaped shades or many other irregular forms.

''''The Center for Contemporary Printmaking''' (CCP) is a nonprofit multimedia studio and gallery in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]], dedicated to the art of the print, including traditional and innovative printmaking, papermaking, book arts, digital processes, and related disciplines. Its stated mission is to support, preserve, and advance the art of original prints. It was founded in 1995 by Michael Costello, Grace Shanley, and Andrew Stasik. 

The only printmaking facility of its kind between New York City and Boston, CCP is located in [[Central Norwalk]] near [[South Norwalk]]. It is housed in an historic landmark 19th-century carriage house in [[Mathews Park]], near the [[Lockwood-Mathews Mansion]] and the [[Stepping Stones Museum for Children]].

CCP offers about one hundred workshops each year, conducted by nationally recognized artists, on techniques such as [[monotype]], [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]], [[silkscreen]], and [[lithography]]. Artists can also work independently in CCP’s studios, work with CCP’s master printers on special projects or specific techniques, and collaborate with CCP printers to create an edition of work. CCP offers a wide variety of educational and outreach programs to the [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] community, including teacher education and workshops for students from area schools.

CCP features a full schedule of exhibitions in its Grace Ross Shanley Gallery, ranging from solo shows by artists such as [[Jim Dine]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], and [[Wolf Kahn]] to thematic group exhibitions. Two international competitions are held in alternating years: the ''International Miniature Print Competition,'' a [[Juried (competition)|juried]] exhibition limited to works no more than four square inches in size, and ''Footprint International,'' featuring works that are exactly one foot square.

Adjacent to CCP’s main building is the Helen Frankenthaler Printmaking Cottage, site of the Artist-in-Residence Program. The cottage houses printmaking studios as well as a compact, furnished, two-bedroom living residential space. Artists can apply for residencies, for a week or up to a month, to pursue projects independently or in collaboration with CCP printers.

'''Congress on Research in Dance''' was a professional organization for dance historians in the United States and worldwide that merged in 2017 with the [[Society of Dance History Scholars]] to form the [[Dance Studies Association]] (DSA). 

An international non-profit [[learned society]] for [[dance research]]ers, artists, performers and choreographers, CORD published the ''Dance Research Journal'' and sponsored annual conferences and awards for scholarship and contributions to the field.&lt;ref&gt;CORD award recipients. http://congressonresearchindance.camp7.org/pastwinners&lt;/ref&gt; The journal and awards have been absorbed into the DSA.

The society was founded in 1964 as the '''Committee on Research in Dance''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A pillar supporting research in dance for 40 years|author=Kolcio, Katja|journal=CORD Newsletter|publisher=Congress on Research in Dance|volume=XXVII|date=Spring 2007|accessdate=2008-06-08|format=Word doc|url=http://www.cordance.org/downloads/newsletter_spring_2007.doc|issue=1}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and based at [[New York University]]. It was formally incorporated as a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit organization in 1969. The organization changed its name to Congress on Research in Dance in 1977. In 1991, it moved to the [[State University of New York College at Brockport]]. In 2007, the CORD National Office moved to the care of Prime Management Services based in Birmingham, Alabama. Membership generally includes performers, choreographers, artists and dance academics from colleges and universities.

==Publications==

The ''Dance Research Journal'' is a triannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] publishing scholarly articles, book reviews, and other reports of interest to the field of dance research, with its primary orientation being towards the historical and critical theory of dance. The journal was published by [[Cambridge University Press]] on behalf of the Congress on Research in Dance until the merger in 2017. Now it is on behalf of the Dance Studies Association. The journal was established in 1968.

The journal is abstracted and indexed in [[Academic ASAP]], [[Academic Search Elite]], [[Academic Search Premier]], [[Expanded Academic]], [[Humanities Index]], [[Index to Dance Periodicals]], [[International Index to Performing Arts]], and [[ProQuest]].

'''''Crawick Multiverse''''' is a [[land art]] project by the landscape architect and designer [[Charles Jencks]] near [[Sanquhar]], [[Dumfries and Galloway]]. It opened to the public on 21 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Crawick Multiverse press release, and subsequent news reports: {{Cite web|url = http://www.crawickmultiverse.co.uk/new-scottish-multiverse-artland-is-out-of-this-world/|title = New £1m Scottish ‘Multiverse’ artland is out of this world|date = 2015-04-29|accessdate = 2015-04-30|website = Crawick Multiverse|publisher = |last = |first = }}

'''Demonology''' is the study of [[demon]]s or beliefs about demons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demonology "Demonology"] at Dictionary.com Unabridged, (v 1.1) Random House, Inc.. Retrieved January 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the methods used to summon and control them. The original sense of "demon", from the time of [[Homer]] onward, was a benevolent being,&lt;ref name="DDD"&gt;van der Toorn, Becking, van der Horst (1999), ''Dictionary of Deities and Demons in The Bible'', Second Extensively Revised Edition, Entry: '''Demon''', pp. 235-240, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-8028-2491-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in English the name now holds connotations of malevolence. (To keep the distinction, when referring to the word in its original Greek meaning, English may use the spelling "[[Daemon (classical mythology)|Daemon]]" or "[[Daimonic|Daimon]]".)

Demons, when regarded as [[spirit]]s, may belong to either of the classes of spirits recognized by primitive [[animism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01526a.htm Animism] at [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/index.html The Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, they may be human, or non-human, separable souls, or discarnate spirits which have never inhabited a body. A sharp distinction is often drawn between these two classes, notably by the [[Melanesians]], several African groups, and others. The [[Islam]]ic [[jinn]], for example, are not reducible to modified human souls. At the same time these classes are frequently conceived as producing identical results, e.g. diseases.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=207375 "Demon"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016201216/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=207375 |date=2007-10-16 }} from Funk &amp; Wagnalls ''New Encyclopedia'', © 2006 World Almanac Education Group, retrieved from [http://www.history.com/ history.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;

The word ''[[wiktionary:demonology|demonology]]'' is from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:δαίμων|δαίμων]]}}, ''daimōn'', "divinity, divine power, god";&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/Reference/Autenrieth.html Georg Autenrieth, A Homeric Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]''.

== Prevalence of demons ==
[[File:Nachtmahr (Abildgaard).jpg|thumb|right|250px|"[[The Nightmare|Nightmare]]", 1800, by [[Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard]].]]
According to some societies, all the affairs of life are supposed to be under the control of spirits, each ruling a certain "[[Classical element|element]]" or even object, and themselves in subjection to a greater spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig, Theodore M., ''The Sacred Paths: Understanding the Religions of the World'', Second Edition, pp. 48-51, © 1989 Prentice-Hall, Inc., {{ISBN|0-02-372175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Inuit]] are said to believe in spirits of the sea, earth and sky, the winds, the clouds and everything in nature. Every cove of the seashore, every point, every island and prominent rock has its guardian spirit. All are potentially of the malignant type, to be propitiated by an appeal to knowledge of the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;Rink, Henry (1875), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/inu/tte/tte1-4.htm "Chapter IV: Religion"] of ''Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo'', London, 1875, at [http://www.sacred-texts.com/index.htm sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional [[Korea]]n belief posits countless demons inhabit the natural world; they fill household objects and are present in all locations.  By the thousands they accompany travelers, seeking them out from their places in the elements.&lt;ref name="E1911"&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/DEM_DIO/DEMONOLOGY_L1alwv_demon_genius_.html Demonology] at the Online Encyclopedia, Originally appearing in Volume 8, Page 10 of the ''1911 Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient [[Babylon]], demonology had an influence on even the most mundane elements of life, from petty annoyances to the emotions of love and hatred.  The numerous demonic spirits were given charge over various parts of the human body, one for the head, one for the neck, and so on.

Greek philosophers such as [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], who claimed influence from [[Platonic realism|Platonism]],&lt;ref&gt;Cumont, Franz (1911), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/orrp/orrp19.htm ''The Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism''], Chapter VI: Persia, p. 267 at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church Fathers|fathers of the Christian Church]], held that the world was pervaded with spirits,&lt;ref name="E1911" /&gt; the latter of whom advanced the belief that demons received the worship directed at pagan gods.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, [http://ccel.org/fathers/NPNF1-02/c1.8.htm ''The City of God''], Book 8, Chapters 24-25, at the [http://ccel.org/ Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religions and cultures believe, or once believed, that what is now known as [[soothsaying]], was, or is, a form of physical contact with demons.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Character of the spiritual world==
The ascription of malevolence to the world of spirits is by no means universal. In [[Central Africa]], the [[Mpongwe]] believe in local spirits, just as do the Inuit; but they are regarded as inoffensive in the main.  Passers-by must make some trifling offering as they near the spirits' place of abode; but it is only occasionally mischievous acts, such as the throwing down of a tree on a passer-by, are, in the view of the natives, perpetuated by the class of spirits known as ''Ombuiri''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamill Nassau, Robert (Rev.) M.D., S.T.D., (1904), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/fiwa/fiwa07.htm ''Fetichism in West Africa''], Chapter V: Spiritual Beings in Africa - Their Classes and Functions, Charles Scribners Son&lt;/ref&gt;

So too many of the spirits, especially concerned with the operations of nature, are conceived as neutral or even benevolent; the European peasant fears the [[Vegetation deity|corn-spirit]] only when he irritates him by trenching on his domain and taking his property by cutting the corn;&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, Sir James George (1922), [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/f/frazer/james/golden/chapter46.html ''The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303101920/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/f/frazer/james/golden/chapter46.html |date=2007-03-03 }}, Chapter 46, "The Corn-Mother in Many Lands," at [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/ The University of Adelaide Library]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903005321/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/ |date=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, there is no reason why the more insignificant personages of the [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] should be conceived as malevolent, and we find that the Petara of the [[Dayak people|Dyaks]] are far from indiscriminate and malignant, being viewed as invisible guardians of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Greem, Eda (c. 1909), [http://anglicanhistory.org/asia/sarawak/green/04.html ''Borneo: The Land of River and Palm''] at the [http://anglicanhistory.org/ Project Canterbury] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{See also|Classification of demons}}
Demons are generally classified as spirits which are believed to enter into relations with the human race. As such the term includes:
# [[angel]]s in the [[Christian]] tradition that [[fallen angel|fell from grace]],&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;
# malevolent [[Genie|genii]] or [[Familiar spirit|familiars]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demon Demon], entry in the  ''Online Etymology Dictionary'', © 2001 Douglas Harper, hosted at [http://dictionary.reference.com dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
# such as receive a [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] (e.g., [[ancestor worship]]),&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;
# [[ghost]]s or other malevolent [[revenant (folklore)|revenants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ghost Ghost], entry in ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, Copyright © 2000, Houghton Mifflin Company, hosted at [http://dictionary.reference.com dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Excluded are souls conceived as inhabiting another world. Yet just as gods are not necessarily spiritual, demons may also be regarded as corporeal; [[vampire]]s for example are sometimes described as human heads with appended entrails, which issue from the tomb to attack the living during the night watches. The so-called Spectre Huntsman of the Malay Peninsula is said to be a man who scours the firmament with his dogs, vainly seeking for what he could not find on Earth: a buck mouse-deer pregnant with male offspring; but he seems to be a living man; there is no statement that he ever died, nor yet that he is a spirit. The [[incubus (demon)|incubi]] and [[succubus|succubi]] of the [[Middle Ages]] are sometimes regarded as spiritual beings; but they were held to give proof of their bodily existence, such as offspring (though often deformed).&lt;ref&gt;Masello, Robert, ''Fallen Angels and Spirits of The Dark'', pp. 64-68, 2004, The Berkley Publishing Group, 200 Madison Ave. New York, NY 10016, {{ISBN|0-399-51889-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in demons goes back many millennia. The [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] faith teaches that there are 3,333 Demons, some with specific dark  responsibilities such as war, starvation, sickness, etc.

===Ancient Near East===
{{main article|Mesopotamian demon}}
{{further information|Asag| Pazuzu}}
In [[Babylonian mythology]], the seven evil deities were known as ''[[shedu]]'', or "storm-demons". They were represented in [[Bull (mythology)|winged bull form]], derived from the colossal bulls used as protective genii of royal palaces, the name "shed" assumed also the meaning of a propitious genius in [[Babylon]]ian magic literature.&lt;ref&gt;See Delitzsch, ''Assyrisches Handwörterbuch''. pp. 60, 253, 261, 646; Jensen, ''Assyr.-Babyl. Mythen und Epen'', 1900, p. 453; [[Archibald Sayce]], l.c. pp. 441, 450, 463; [[François Lenormant|Lenormant]], l.c. pp. 48-51.&lt;/ref&gt; It was from Chaldea that the name "shedu" came to the Israelites, and so the  writers of the Tanach applied the word [[Shedim]]  to certain Canaanite deities. They also spoke of "the destroyer" (Exodus xii. 23) as a Lord who will "strike down the Egyptians." In II Samuel xxiv; 16 and II Chronicles xxi. 15 the pestilence-dealing angel, that is spirit, called  "the destroying angel" (compare "the angel of the Lord" in II Kings xix. 35; Isaiah xxxvii. 36).

===Buddhism===
Traditionally, [[Buddhism]] affirms the existence of [[Hell#Buddhism|hells]]&lt;ref&gt;Boeree, Dr. C. George (2000), [http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/buddhacosmo.html Chapter: "Buddhist Cosmology"], ''An Introduction to Buddhism'', Shippensburg University&lt;/ref&gt; peopled by demons who torment sinners and tempt mortals to sin, or who seek to thwart their [[Bodhi|enlightenment]], with a demon named [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] as chief tempter, "prince of darkness," or "Evil One" in Sanskrit sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/reference/glossary-of-buddhist-terms-a-e#Demon "Demon"] and [http://kadampa.org/en/reference/glossary-of-buddhist-terms-k-o#Mara "Mara"] in the ''Glossary of Buddhist Terms'' at [http://www.kadampa.org/ kadampa.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strickman"&gt;Strickmann, Michel. ''Chinese Magical Medicine'',(2002) Stanford: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-3449-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of Mara were also called ''mara'', the devils, and are frequently cited as a cause of disease or representations of mental obstructions.&lt;ref name="strickman"/&gt;
The ''mara'' became fully assimilated into the Chinese worldview, and were called ''mo''.

The idea of the imminent decline and collapse of the Buddhist religion amid a "great cacophony of demonic influences" was already a significant component of Buddhism when it reached China in the first century A.D., according to Michel Strickmann.&lt;ref name="strickman"/&gt; Demonic forces had attained enormous power in the world. For some writers of the time this state of affairs had been ordained to serve the higher purpose of effecting a "preliminary cleansing" that would purge and purify humanity in preparation for an ultimate, messianic renewal.&lt;ref name="strickman"/&gt;

Medieval Chinese Buddhist demonology was heavily influenced by Indian Buddhism. Indian demonology is also fully and systematically described in written sources, though during Buddhism's millennium of direct influence in China, "Chinese demonology was whipped into respectable shape," with a number of Indian demons finding permanent niches even in [[Taoist]] ritual texts.&lt;ref name="strickman"/&gt;

Also, [[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]], a major Mahayana Buddhism text, describes fifty demonic states: the so-called fifty skandha maras, which are "negative" mirror-like reflections of or deviations from correct samādhi (meditative absorption) states. In this context demons are considered by Buddhists to be beings possessing some supernatural powers, who, in the past, might have practiced [[Dharma]], Buddha's teaching, but due to practicing it incorrectly failed to develop [[Prajñā (Buddhism)]], true wisdom and [[Karuṇā]], true compassion, which are inseparable attributes of an enlightened being such as a [[Buddha]] or a [[Bodhisattva]]. In his autobiography, The Blazing Splendor, [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], a prominent Tibetan Buddhist master of the 20th century describes encounters with such beings. Therefore, depending on the context, in Buddhism demons may refer to both disturbed mind states and actual beings.

===Christianity===
{{Main article|Christian demonology}}
Christian demonology is the study of [[demon]]s from a [[Christianity|Christian]] point of view. It is primarily based on the [[Bible]] ([[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]]), the [[exegesis]] of these scriptures, the writings of early Christian [[philosopher]]s and [[hermit]]s, [[tradition]], and [[legend]]s incorporated from other beliefs.

Some scholars{{who|date=March 2016}} suggest the origins of early [[Greek Old Testament]] demonology can be traced to two distinctive and often competing mythologies of evil – Adamic and Enochic, one of which was tied to the [[fall of man]] caused by [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] and the other to the fall of angels in the [[antediluvian]] period.&lt;ref&gt;A. Orlov, Dark Mirrors: Azazel and Satanael in Early Jewish Demonology (Albany, SUNY, 2011) 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Adamic story traces the source of evil to Satan’s transgression and the fall of man, a trend reflected in the Books of Adam and Eve which explains the reason for Satan’s demotion by his refusal to obey God’s command to venerate newly created Adam.

In contrast, the early Enochic tradition bases its understanding of the origin of demons on the story of the fallen [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]] led by Azazel. Scholars{{who|date=March 2016}} believe these two enigmatic figures - Azazel and Satan exercised formative influence on early Jewish demonology. While in the beginning of their conceptual journeys Azazel and Satan are posited as representatives of two distinctive and often rival trends tied to the distinctive etiologies of corruption, in later Jewish and Christian demonological lore both antagonists are able to enter each other’s respective stories in new conceptual capacities. In these later traditions Satanael is often depicted as the leader of the fallen angels while his conceptual rival Azazel is portrayed as a seducer of Adam and Eve.&lt;ref&gt;A. Orlov, Dark Mirrors: Azazel and Satanael in Early Jewish Demonology (Albany, SUNY, 2011) 7.&lt;/ref&gt; While historical [[Judaism]] never recognized any set of doctrines about demons,&lt;ref name="MM_1998"/&gt; scholars{{who|date=March 2016}} believe its [[Babylonian captivity|post-exilic]] concepts of [[eschatology]], angelology, and demonology were influenced by [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=Zoroastrianism '''Zoroastrianism'''], NET Bible Study Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jahanian, Daryoush, M.D., [http://www.meta-religion.com/World_Religions/Zoroastrim/zoroastrian-biblical_connections.htm "The Zoroastrian-Biblical Connections,"] at [http://www.meta-religion.com/ meta-religion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Some, however, believe these concepts were received as part of the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Franck, Adolphe (1843), translated by Sossnitz, I. (1926), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/rph/rph16.htm ''The Kabbalah'', or, ''The Religious Philosophy of the Hebrews''], Part Two, Chapter IV, "Continuation of The Analysis of The Zohar: The Kabbalists' View of The World," p. 184 at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; While many people believe today [[Lucifer]] and Satan are different names for the same being, not all scholars subscribe to this view.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Gustav (1967), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ed7yHWuTEewC A Dictionary of Angels, Including The Fallen Angels]'', Free Press, p. 176, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 66-19757, {{ISBN|9780029070505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of authors throughout Christian history have written about demons for a variety of purposes.  Theologians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote concerning the behaviors of which Christians should be aware,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1114.htm Thomas Acquinas's Summa Theologica], Question 114, hosted on [[New Advent]]&lt;/ref&gt; while witchhunters like [[Heinrich Kramer]] wrote about how to find and what to do with [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|people they believed were involved with demons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/mm/index.htm Malleus Maleficarum], hosted on the Internet Sacred Text Archive&lt;/ref&gt;  Some texts such as the [[Lesser Key of Solomon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/lks/lks17.htm Lesser Key of Solomon, The Conjuration To Call Forth Any of the Aforesaid Spirits], hosted on [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[The Grimoire of Pope Honorius]] (although these, the earliest manuscripts, were from well after these individuals had died) are written with [[grimoire|instructions on how to summon demons]] in the name of God and often were claimed to have been written by individuals respected within the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/bcm14.htm Arthur Edward Waite, Book of Ceremonial Magic, page 64] [http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/bcm23.htm#page_106 and page 106]&lt;/ref&gt;  These latter texts were usually more detailed, giving names, ranks, and descriptions of demons individually and categorically.&lt;ref name=sacred&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/bcm14.htm |title=Waite, page 64 |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most Christians commonly reject these texts as either diabolical or fictitious.&lt;ref name=sacred/&gt;

In modern times, some demonological texts have been written by Christians, usually in a similar vein of Thomas Aquinas, explaining their effects in the world and how faith may lessen or eliminate damage by them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SFmrx7s7OtIC&amp;dq=Jessie+Penn-Lewis+war+on+the+saints&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TCR4AVdC-L&amp;sig=N8TVdhBcTt1ev3YCFR-DvOwm9NY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QbnsSvbRCMqztgeM9fA6&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Jessie Penn-Lewis, War on the Saints on Google Books], introductory chapter&lt;/ref&gt;  A few Christian authors, such as [[Jack Chick]] and [[John Todd (occultist)|John Todd]], write with intentions similar to Kramer, proclaiming that demons and their human agents are active in the world.&lt;ref name="broken"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/catalog/comics/0102.asp |title=The Broken Cross - by Jack T. Chick |publisher=Chick.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These claims can stray from mainstream ideology, and may include such beliefs as that [[Christian rock]] is a means through which demons influence people.

Not all Christians believe that demons exist in the literal sense. There is the view that the language of exorcism in the New Testament is an example of what was once employed to describe the healings of what would be classified in modern days as epilepsy, mental illness etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realdevil.info/4-1.htm |title=The Devil, Satan And Demons |publisher=Realdevil.info |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{further information|Hindu demon}}
Vedic Scriptures include a range of spirits (Vetalas, [[Raksha (Vedic)|Rakshasa]]s, Bhutas and Pishachas) that might be classified as demons. These spirits are souls of beings that have committed certain specific sins. As a purging punishment, they are condemned to roam without a physical form for a length of time, until a rebirth. Beings that died with unfulfilled desires or anger are also said to "linger" until such issues are resolved. Hindu text [[Atharvaveda]] gives an account of nature and habitats of such spirits including how to persuade/control them. There are [[occult]] traditions in Hinduism that seeks to control such spirits to do their bidding. Hindu text [[Garuda Purana]] details other kinds of punishments and judgments given out in [[Hell]]; this also given an account of how the spirit travels to nether worlds.

===Islam===
Islam has no doctrinal hierarchy of demonology. Even though some Muslim scholars tried to classify jinn and demons, there is no established classification and terms on [[jinn]] may overlap or used interchangeable. Naming the Jinn also depends on cultural influences. [[Julius Wellhausen]] states, that Islamic ''demonology'' is also [[zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} page 114 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Many demonic or demon-like entities are not purely spiritual, but also physical in nature and related to animals. One prominent classification is made by [[Jahiz]]&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} page 63 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Amir: A Jinni, who lives among humans
* [[Shaitan]]: malicious and rebellious Jinn
* [[Marid]]: A stronger type of Shaitan, trying to steal news from heaven
* [[Ifrit]]: the most powerful type of Shayateen

The German orientalist [[Almut Wieland-Karimi]] classified the Jinn in the ten most common categories mentioned in folklore literature &lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} page 67 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Jinn or [[Jann (legendary creature)|Jann]]: Ordinary Jinn, a class apart from other Jinn types, but also used as a collective to refer to invisible beings in general
* Shaitan: Malevolent Jinni, who causes illness and madness
* Ifrit: Delimitation to ordinary Jinn remains unclear. Can be either a powerful cunning Jinn or strong Shaitan. Ifrits are in general bad.
* Marid: A haughty and powerful Shaitan or very malevolent Ifrit.
* Bu'Bu: A Jinn frightening Children.
* [[Sila (mythology)|Si'lah]]: A female demon, seducing men.
* Amir: Spirits dwelling in houses.
* [[Ghul]]: Generally evil and living in the desert.
* Qarina: The name for a specific demon struggling children.
* [[Hatif]]: A mysterious phenomen, which can just be heard but never seen.

The Ghul and the Si'lah often challanged orientalists to hold them apart, because both are shapeshifter and also appear as females to seduce men. A Ghul in Arabic meaning, terms any shapeshifting spirit, including the Si'lah.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 140&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Marid and Ifrit may be hard to distinguish, since they are often used interchangeable, for example in "[[One Thousand and One Nights ]]". However both entities have properties apart from the other. The Ifrit is also related to the [[ghost]]s of the dead, seeking for revenge, unlike the Marid. On the other hand, the Marid  is related to assistans of truthsayers, striving to heaven to access informations from the angels, while the Ifrit does not.

Additionally the [[Peri]] and the [[Daeva]] are kinds of Jinn in [[Persian people|Persian]] lore. While the Daeva are akin to the Shayateen, subordinates of [[Satan]], the Peris are good Jinn fighting the Daeva. However the Peri may endanger people, if they become angered.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lebling ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185}}

[[Ahmad al-Buni]] relates four Ifrits to archdemons, diametral to the four archangels of Islam. They have their own Shayateen under command but are subordinate to [[Iblis]], who is thought to be the leader of Shayateen.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lebling ''Robert Lebling'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}} page 86-87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{see also|Jewish mythology}}
[[Judaism]] does not have a demonology or any set of doctrines about demons.&lt;ref name="MM_1998"&gt;Mack, Carol K., Mack, Dinah (1998), ''A Field Guide to Demons, Fairies, Fallen Angels and Other Subversive Spirits'', p. XXXIII, New York: Henry Holt and Co., {{ISBN|0-8050-6270-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Use of the name "Lucifer" stems from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3–20|NIV}}, a passage which does speak of the defeat of a particular [[Babylon]]ian King, to whom it gives a title which refers to what in English is called the Day Star or Morning Star (in Latin, ''lucifer'', meaning "light-bearer", from the words ''lucem ferre'').&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Gustav (1967), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ed7yHWuTEewC A Dictionary of Angels, Including The Fallen Angels]'', Free Press, p. 176, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 66-19757, {{ISBN|9780029070505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is more than one instance in Jewish medieval myth and lore where demons are said to have come to be, as seen by the Grigori angels, of [[Lilith]] leaving Adam, of demons such as [[vampire]]s, unrest spirits in [[Jewish mythology|Jewish folklore]] such as the [[dybbuk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=245&amp;letter=D&amp;search=demonology Demonology] at [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/ jewishencyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "wars"&gt;Josephus, Flavius, [http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/josephus.html ''Wars of The Jews''], Book VII, Chapter VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
In the [[Zoroastrian]] tradition, [[Ahura Mazda]], as the force of good [[Amesha Spenta|Spenta Mainyu]], will eventually be victorious in a cosmic battle with an evil force known as [[Angra Mainyu]] or Ahriman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/zor33.html "Who are the Zoroastrians,"] at [http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/ tenets.zoroastrianism.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''''' is a sociological study of [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Paganism]] in the United States written by the American  Wiccan and journalist [[Margot Adler]]. First published in 1979 by [[Viking Press]], it was later republished in a revised and expanded edition by [[Beacon Press]] in 1986, with third and fourth revised editions being brought out by [[Penguin Books]] in 1996 and then 2006 respectively.

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the book "is credited with both documenting new religious impulses and being a catalyst for the panoply of practices now in existence"&lt;ref name=Goldscheider&gt;Goldscheider, Eric. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/28/national/28religion.html?_r=1&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=margot+adler+drawing&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin  Witches, Druids and Other Pagans Make Merry Again in the Magical Month of May], ''The New York Times'', May 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and  "helped popularize earth-based religions."&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Anthony.

Margot Adler, NPR Biography, NPR website, accessed August 27, 2006 [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100166]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is an examination of [[Neopaganism in the United States]] from a [[sociology|sociological]] standpoint, discussing the history and various forms of the movement.  It contains excerpts from many interviews with average Pagans, as well as with well-known leaders and organizers in the community.

The first edition of the book sold 30,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]]. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;
Successive versions have included over one hundred and fifty pages of additional text and an updated contacts section.  It has been praised by [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Susan Brownmiller]], ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and the ''Journal of the [[American Academy of Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblio.com/isbn/0807032530.html 0807032530 - Drawing Down the Moon by Margot Adler - 9780807032534&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Paganism and Wicca in the United States===
Contemporary Paganism, which is also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an [[umbrella term]] used to identify a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], is one of a number of different Pagan religions, and developed in England during the first half of the 20th century. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884-1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934-2017), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s which was heavily influenced by [[second wave feminism]], rejecting the veneration of the Horned God and emphasizing female-only covens. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions, who used the pseudonym of [[Starhawk]] (1951-), later founded her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]], as well as publishing ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), through which she helped to spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adler and her research===
In 1976, Adler publicly announced that Viking Press had offered her a book contract to undertake the first wide-ranging study of American Paganism.&lt;ref name="Lloyd 2012. pp. 235"&gt;[[#Llo12|Lloyd 2012]]. pp. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Margot-adler-2004.jpg|thumb|right|Margot Adler in 2004.]]
{{Expand section|date=August 2012}}
''Drawing Down the Moon'' offers a guide to the Pagan movement across the United States.

==Republication==

===1986 revision===
In 1986, Adler published a revised second edition of ''Drawing Down the Moon'', much expanded with new information. Identifying several new trends that had occurred in American Paganism since 1979, Adler recognized that in the intervening seven years, U.S. Pagans had become increasingly self-aware of Paganism as a movement, something which she attributed to the increasing number of Pagan festivals.&lt;ref name="Pike 1996 363"/&gt;
One reviewer noted that the alterations made for the 1986 edition "often creates a vivid contrast with events and persons first described in 1979."&lt;ref name="Herndobler 1987"&gt;[[#Her87|Herndobler 1987]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 revision===
{{Expand section|date=August 2012}}

===2006 revision===
The 2006 edition includes a new section on Greencraft (pp.&amp;nbsp;127–129), a Wiccan tradition emerging out of an [[Alexandrian Wicca]] [[coven]] which had been given authority over the [[Benelux]] countries, and which features its own [[rune]] alphabet and a non-[[Hebrew]] form of [[Kabbalah]] based on work by Neopagan author [[R. J. Stewart]]; it emphasizes the practice of Wicca as a nature religion and as a [[mystery religion]]. It also gives a more complete and sympathetic treatment of the Northern European Neopagan revivals grouped under the rubric "[[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenism]]," which she admits to having consciously omitted from the first edition because of discomfort with the more conservative social values of this form of Pagan revival, and because some far-right and even [[neo-Nazi]] groups were using it as a front for their activities at the time (pp.&amp;nbsp;286–296). And she prefaces her chapter "Women, Feminism, and the Craft," which discusses the emergence of [[feminist Wicca|feminist forms of Neopaganism]], with discussion of how her personal feelings about such groups have changed, but "decided to leave the chapter pretty much as is, with a few minor corrections, and address the question of feminist spirituality today at the end."

==Reception==

===Academic reviews===
Writing in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', Mara E. Donaldson of the [[University of Virginia]] commented that Adler's book provided an "extensive study of paganism" that "demythologizes" the movement "without being sentimental or self-righteous." Considering it to be a "serious corrective to common misconceptions" propagated in the media, Donaldson stated that it was "worth reading" despite what she herself perceived as "neopaganism's weaknesses", namely the movement's lack of "historical-traditional-cultural memory" and a lack of "sensitivity to the Western problem of evil".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Don82|Donaldson 1982]].&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote     = "''Drawing Down the Moon'' is unmatched in its sweeping survey of Neo-Pagan culture and for the historical perspective it provides on the emergence of various small groups within the larger movement. More a report from the trenches than rigorous analysis, Adler's straightforward account of these groups is not an attempt to justify their existence or to explain them away. Her examination of the meanings that individuals make out of their lives through the encounter with and construction of Pagan culture is a welcome shift away from the focus of sociologists on questions of "deviancy" and "conversion" - all concepts defined from outside."

|source    = Sarah M. Pike, American sociologist, 1996.&lt;ref name="Pike 1996 363"/&gt;}}

In a 1996 paper discussing the various sociological studies that had then been made of Paganism, the sociologist Sarah M. Pike noted that ''Drawing Down the Moon'' had gone "a long way towards answering the question" as to "what makes these [Pagan ritual] activities valid and viable to those who engage in them". In doing so, Pike believed that Adler's work was an improvement on earlier sociological studies of the movement, namely that of [[Nachman Ben-Yehuda]], which Pike felt had failed to answer this question.&lt;ref name="Pike 1996 362"&gt;[[#Pik96|Pike 1996]]. p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting Adler's position as a practicing Wiccan, and the impact which this would have on her study, Pike however felt that the book was "less defensive and apologetic than sociological studies conducted by many supposedly objective "outsiders"."&lt;ref name="Pike 1996 362"/&gt; Summarizing ''Drawing Down the Moon'' as being "unmatched" in its "sweeping survey" of the Pagan movement, Pike notes that in providing an overview of the subject it failed to focus on "detailed examination of specific issues and events."&lt;ref name="Pike 1996 363"&gt;[[#Pik96|Pike 1996]]. p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other reviews===
Writing for ''The Women's Review of Books'', Robin Herndobler praised Adler's "clear, graceful prose", and the manner in which she had written about Paganism "with interest and compassion."&lt;ref name="Herndobler 1987"/&gt;

==Influence==

===Pagan community===
Writing in his later biography of [[Eddie Buczynski]], the Pagan independent scholar Michael G. Lloyd noted that Adler's book was a marked departure from earlier books dealing with Pagan Witchcraft which continued to equate it with either historical Early Modern witchcraft or Satanism.&lt;ref name="Lloyd 2012. pp. 235"/&gt; In her 1999 study of American Wiccans, ''[[A Community of Witches]]'', the sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] noted that ''Drawing Down the Moon'' had been influential in getting many Wiccans to accept the non-existence of a historical [[Witch-cult hypothesis|Witch-Cult]] from which their religion descended.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
In her sociological study of American Paganism, Loretta Orion, author of ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' (1995), noted that she had "benefitted" from Adler's study, believing that it contained "insightful reflections" on those whom it was studying.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VIA Mini-ITX Form Factor Comparison.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Comparison of some common [[motherboard]] form factors]]
'''Form factor''' is an aspect of hardware [[design]] which defines and prescribes the size, shape, and other physical [[specification (technical standard)|specifications]] of components, particularly in [[consumer electronics]] and [[electronic packaging]].&lt;ref name="webopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Form factor|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/form_factor.html|website=Webopedia|publisher=Quinstreet Enterprise|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techtarget"&gt;{{cite web|title=Form factor|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/form-factor|website=WhatIs.com|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form factor may represent a broad class of similarly sized components, or it may prescribe a specific standard.

==Evolution and standardization==
As electronic hardware has become smaller following [[Moore's law]] and related patterns, ever-smaller form factors have become feasible. Specific technological advances, such as [[PCI Express]], have had a significant design impact, though form factors have historically been slower to evolve than individual components. [[Standardization]] of form factors is vital for compatibility of hardware from different manufacturers.

==Trade-offs==
Smaller form factors may offer more efficient use of limited space, greater flexibility in the placement of components within a larger assembly, reduced use of material, and greater ease of transportation and use. However, smaller form factors typically incur greater costs in the [[design]], [[manufacturing]], and [[corrective maintenance|maintenance]] phases of the [[product lifecycle|engineering lifecycle]], and do not allow the same expansion options as larger form factors. In particular, the design of smaller form factor computers and network equipment must entail careful consideration of [[computer cooling|cooling]].&lt;ref name="sff_network"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=John|title=Passive Cooling – An Experiment|url=https://smallformfactor.net/reviews/passive-cooling-experiment|website=SFF Network|publisher=Minutiae|accessdate=13 June 2016|date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[End user|End-user]] maintenance and repair of small form factor electronic devices such as mobile phones is often not possible, and may be discouraged by [[warranty]] [[voidable|voiding]] clauses; such devices require professional servicing—or simply replacement—when they fail.&lt;ref name="prowse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prowse|first1=David L.|title=CompTIA A+ Exam Cram: Mobile Device Hardware and Operating Systems|url=http://www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1926198|website=Pearson IT Certification|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=13 June 2016|date=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:MacBookEeePCNintendoDS.JPG|thumb|300px|Size comparison of various mobile form factors (from smallest to largest: [[Nintendo DS Lite]] [[Handheld game console|handheld]], [[Asus Eee PC]] [[netbook]], and [[MacBook]] [[laptop]])]]
'''[[Computer form factor]]s''' comprise a number of specific industry standards for [[motherboard]]s, specifying dimensions, [[power supply|power supplies]], placement of mounting holes and [[computer port (hardware)|ports]], and other parameters. Other types of form factors for computers include:
* [[Small form factor]] (SFF), a more loosely defined set of standards which may refer to both motherboards and [[computer case]]s. SFF devices include mini-towers and  [[home theater PC]]s.
* [[Pizza box form factor]], a wide, flat case form-factor used for computers and network switches; often sized for installation in a [[19-inch rack]].

===Components===
* [[Hard disk drive#Form factors|Hard disk drive form factors]], the physical dimensions of a computer hard drive
* [[Disc form factors|Hard disk enclosure form factor]], the physical dimensions of a computer hard drive enclosure

===Mobile form factors===
* [[Laptop]] or notebook, a form of portable computer with a "clamshell" form factor.
* [[Subnotebook]], [[ultra-mobile PC]], [[netbook]], and [[tablet computer]], various form factors for devices which are smaller and often cheaper than a typical notebook.
* [[Form factor (mobile phones)|Mobile phone form factor]], comprising the size, shape, layout, and style of mobile phones. Broad categories of form factors include bars, [[flip (form)|flip phones]], and sliders, with many subtypes and variations of each.

[[File:Courtyard of Irish Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|right|Courtyard of the IMMA]]
The '''Irish Museum of Modern [[Art]]''' ({{lang-ga|Áras Nua-Ealaíne na hÉireann}}) also known as '''IMMA''', is Ireland's leading national institution for the collection and presentation of [[Modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]]. Located in [[Kilmainham]], [[Dublin]], the Museum presents a wide variety of art in a changing programme of exhibitions, which regularly includes bodies of work from its own collection and its education and community department. It also aims to create more widespread access to art and artists through its studio and national programmes.

The Museum’s mission is to foster within society an awareness, understanding and involvement in the [[visual arts]] through policies and programmes which are excellent, innovative and inclusive.

==History==
The Irish Museum of Modern Art was established by the Government of Ireland in 1990. It was officially opened on 25 May 1991 by [[Taoiseach]] [[Charles Haughey|Charles J Haughey]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/art-and-design/twenty-years-of-the-irish-museum-of-modern-art-1.577173 "Twenty years of the Irish Museum of Modern Art"], ''The Irish Times'', March 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Building and grounds==
The Irish Museum of Modern Art is housed in the 17th-century [[Royal Hospital Kilmainham]]. The Royal Hospital was founded in 1684 by [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|James Butler]], the [[Duke of Ormonde]] and Viceroy to Charles II, as a home for retired soldiers and continued in that use for almost 250 years. The Royal Hospital is a striking location for displaying modern art. Modelled on [[Les Invalides]] in Paris, it is arranged around a courtyard and the interior has long corridors running along series of modest interlocking rooms. The original stables have been restored, extended and converted into artists' studios, and the museum runs an artist-in-residence programme.

==Collection==

IMMA holds the Irish National Collection of modern and contemporary art, consisting of over 3500 works by Irish and international artists. The collection's emphasis is on works produced post-1940 and features works by many significant artists including [[Marina Abramović]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Joseph Cornell]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Louis le Brocquy]], [[Matt Mullican]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and [[Lawrence Weiner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immacollection.com/eMuseumPlus Irish Museum of Modern Art Collection website], Retrieved 22 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is fully catalogued and searchable via a dedicated website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immacollection.com/eMuseumPlus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hennessy]] Art Fund for IMMA Collection was launched in 2016 in part as a response to funding cuts preventing the museum from having a viable acquisitions budget to collect the work of emerging and mid-career artists since 2011. The fund is a new multi-year corporate partnership and acquisition fund to purchase works by Irish and Irish based artists that are not yet part of the IMMA National Collection of Contemporary and Modern Art. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imma.ie/en/page_237228.htm The Hennessy Art Fund for IMMA Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this the museum relied heavily on private philanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imma.ie/en/page_237083.htm IMMA Collection: A Decade], Irish Museum of Modern Art, Retrieved 22 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hennessy Art Fund has thus far allowed the collection to acquire the work of Kevin Atherton, David Beattie, Rhona Byrne and Dennis McNulty in 2016; and Ciarán Murphy, Maireád McClean, Mark Garry and Yuri Pattison in 2017. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imma.ie/en/page_237209.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status and funding==
The Museum is a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital. The company is funded by [[grant-in-aid]] through the [[Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht]] and by sponsorship, franchise and own resource income.

[[File:Wamps-Harvest.jpg|thumb|200px|Harvesting the [[Manna]]]]
[[File:Lille St Maurice Wamps.JPG|thumb|325px|The [[Last Supper]]]]
'''Bernard-Joseph Wamps''' (30 November 1689, [[Lille]] - 9 August 1744, Lille) was a French painter; mostly of religious subjects.

== Biography ==
His father was listed in the "Registre aux Bourgeois" and he received his first lessons in his hometown from [[Arnould de Vuez]].&lt;ref name="G"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V6IZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA693&amp;dq=Bernard-Joseph+Wamps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMIyJTYnIDcxwIVApqICh1kawpI#v=onepage&amp;q=Bernard-Joseph%20Wamps&amp;f=false Biographical notes] from the ''Dictionary of Painters and Engravers: Biographical and Critical, Volume 2'' @ Google books.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he studied [[porcelain painting]] at the local manufactory and went to Paris, where he worked in the studios of [[Pierre-Jacques Cazes]]. Around 1706, he painted his first major work: "Saint John Preaching in the Wilderness", commissioned by the Lancry family. 

In 1715, he was awarded the [[Prix de Rome]] of the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] with his rendering of [[Judith beheading Holofernes]],&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; and received a pension to study at the [[French Academy in Rome]], where he spent five years.

After returning in 1720, he received numerous commissions from religious institutions and created decorations for the Governor's residence. He worked throughout the area, painting murals and other works at churches and convents in [[Douai]], [[Cambrai]], [[Arras]], [[Tournai]], [[Ghent]] and [[Valenciennes]]. Eventually, he acquired enough money to purchase the home of his former teacher, Vuez.

In, the loom-worker Guillaume Werniers produced a series of tapestries on the life of Christ, after drawings by Wamps. These were installed in the choir room of the "Église Saint-Sauveur". Most were later moved to museums, but one went to the "Église Saint Pierre d'Antioche" in [[Villeneuve-d'Ascq]].

His paintings for [[Anchin Abbey]] were destroyed during World War II and are now preserved only as sketches. Other major works include "The Dream of Saint Joseph" and "The Resurrection of Christ" at the [[Hospice Comtesse]] and "The Judgment of David" at the [[Palais des beaux-arts de Lille]].

[[File:Ballet Monte Carlo.jpg|thumb|250px]]
'''Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo''' (The Monte Carlo Ballet) is a [[classical ballet]] company established in 1985 by [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|the Princess of Hanover]] in accordance with the wishes of her mother, [[Grace Kelly|Princess Grace of Monaco]].  It is the official national company of [[Monaco|the Principality of Monaco]].

==History==
The first performance took place on 21 December 1985, casting among others several guest stars of the [[Opéra National de Paris|Paris Opera]]. Directed by Ghislaine Thesmar and [[Pierre Lacotte]], the company rehearsed in the Diaghilev studio, performing on the stage of the Salle Garnier at the [[Monte Carlo Opera]] and immediately started touring. Their repertoire includes works from the [[Ballets Russes]] and contemporary pieces from guest [[choreography|choreographer]]s such as Kevin Haigen, John Clifford, [[Jean-Christophe Maillot]], Dieter Amman, and Uwe Scholz. In 1989, Jean Yves Esquerre became artistic director, after the departure of Ghislaine Thesmar and Pierre Lacotte one year earlier.

In 1992, Jean-Christophe Maillot joined the company, first as artistic consultant, and was officially promoted to the rank of director-choreographer in September 1993. Four years later, thanks to his vision and his energy, the ''Ballets de Monte-Carlo'' left the building that had been their historical home, which had by then become too small, and moved into their own dance center: L'ATELIER. Further, in December 2000, they inaugurated their first ballet season on the huge stage of the [[Salle des Princes]] at the brand new congress center in Monaco, the [[Grimaldi Forum]]. These were two turning points in the modern history of the company and the beginning of a new dance era in Monaco.

{{main|The Hard Goodbye}}
[[File:Marvwendy.png|thumb|250px|right|[[Mickey Rourke]] as Marv and [[Jaime King]] as Wendy in a scene from ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'']]

First published as ''Sin City'' in ''[[Dark Horse Presents]]'' issues #51–62 and 5th Anniversary Special (June 1991–June 1992), and reprinted as ''Sin City (The Hard Goodbye)'' in trade paperback form (January 1993), '''''The Hard Goodbye''''' is the first [[comic book]] story that [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] drew and wrote about the desperate denizens of Basin City/"Sin City". The [[protagonist]] is Marv, a chivalrous yet dangerous and possibly [[psychotic]] ex-convict with a penchant for fine coats. Marv meets a mysterious and very beautiful woman at Kadie's bar. The woman seduces Marv much to his surprise and delight, since he doesn't usually attract women due to scars from his many years as a street fighter. Marv wakes up after a one-night stand to discover Goldie, the woman he had just met and had sex with, has been killed in the night. When he hears sirens of the police drawing near (long before anyone but he and the killer could know what had happened) he realizes that he is being framed by someone with a lot of money and influence in Basin City. The thirteen-part serial follows Marv on his single-minded quest to understand why Goldie was killed and bring [[revenge]] upon her murderers.

This story is one of three Sin City stories retold in the movie ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''. In the film version, [[Mickey Rourke]] plays Marv, [[Jaime King]] plays Goldie and Wendy, [[Carla Gugino]] plays Lucille, [[Elijah Wood]] plays [[Kevin (Sin City)|Kevin]], and [[Rutger Hauer]] plays [[Roark family|Cardinal Roark]].

==''A Dame to Kill For''==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Frank Miller (comics)]] --&gt;

{{main|A Dame to Kill For}}
First published November 1993–May 1994, '''''A Dame to Kill For''''' is the second compilation of the ''[[Sin City]]'' series. It chronicles Dwight's attempts to rescue Ava Lord, his former fiancée, from her husband and servant, who she says are [[Sadism and Masochism|sadistically]] torturing her. Dwight begins to suspect that things aren't what they seem with Ava. [[File:A dame to kill for.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''[[Sin City]]: A Dame To Kill For'', 2nd edition]]

The story begins as [[Dwight McCarthy]], working as a photographer for a grossly overweight man named Agamemnon, saves one of the Old Town prostitutes from one of her customers, whom Dwight was investigating on behalf of his wife; he then drives her back to Old Town. That night, he receives a call from a woman named Ava, asking him to meet her at a seedy bar called Kadie's Club Pecos. Dwight is suspicious of her, as Ava broke his heart four years ago by running off with another richer man, but he agrees to meet her anyway. Marv is also there and greets Dwight. Ava arrives late (as she often used to) and tries to persuade Dwight to take her back, claiming that her life is "a living Hell"; Dwight refuses to listen. Just then, Manute, Ava's husband's valet, arrives and takes Ava away. Dwight goes home, but cannot sleep. He decides to check up on Ava and her new husband, Damien Lord.

He hops a fence and, using his photography equipment, scopes out the estate and, in particular, Ava, who is swimming in the nude. He is discovered and claims that he is simply a [[Voyeurism|Peeping Tom]]. Manute, who seemingly doesn't recognize him from the bar, beats him brutally before throwing him from a car into the street. Dwight calls Agamemnon for a ride home and they stop several times for fast food.

As Dwight arrives home, he finds his [[Ford Mustang]] returned and his door unlocked. In his bedroom is a nude Ava. Following a heated argument, they eventually reconcile and make love. Manute arrives and violently beats naked Dwight. Dwight is knocked out of his upper story apartment window to the street below, where he blacks out momentarily. He awakens to see Manute driving off with Ava.

Determined to rescue her, Dwight arrives at Kadie’s, where Marv is in the middle of a squabble with some out-of-town punks. One of them pulls a gun on Marv, who knocks him flat; the rest quickly scatter. Dwight convinces Marv, over several drinks and whilst watching [[Nancy Callahan|Nancy]] dance, to help him storm Damien's estate. As they approach the mansion, Dwight insists Marv leave the punk's gun, which Marv has procured, in the car. Marv tackles the guards as a distraction and eventually takes on Manute, ripping his right eye out and beating him savagely.

With Manute and the guards occupied, Dwight makes his way to Damien. When he finds him in his office, he beats him to death. As Dwight begins to realize what he has done, Ava appears, and explains how Dwight was all a part of her plan to get Damien murdered so she could inherit his estate. She shoots Dwight six times, including once in the head. Dwight once again falls out of a window and is picked up by Marv. Upon Dwight's insistence, Marv drives him to Old Town, where Dwight has his old flame, Gail, help him. The girls of Old Town perform surgery on Dwight's multiple bullet wounds, then ask him to leave. He convinces Gail and Miho, a deadly assassin he saved three years prior, to let him stay, and they operate further on him.

Two detectives following up on Damien Lord's death, Mort and Bob, talk to Ava. She claims that Dwight was a [[Stalking|stalker]] [[psychopath]] who killed Damien out of jealousy. They believe her story, and Mort starts sleeping with her. They interrogate Agamemnon, who tells how Dwight is an upright man who went clean after being a wild [[alcoholic]] with a short temper in his younger days. When they speak with Dwight's [[landlord|landlady]], she tells about letting Ava in and the resulting loud noises of the fight the night of Damien's murder. Bob doubts Ava considerably now, while Mort, who is still sleeping with her, becomes more on-edge towards his partner. This culminates with Mort killing Bob, then committing suicide. (On an unrelated note, during the scene in which Mort kills Bob, while they are driving in the car you can clearly see Wendy and Marv drive past them, presumably on their way to butcher [[Roark family|Kevin]].)

Meanwhile, Dwight is recovering from his near-fatal wounds and calls Ava to inform her he's coming for her soon. Ava, with her late husband's financial assets, is joining her corporation with the mob boss Wallenquist. Unaffected by Ava's flirting, he warns her not to underestimate him again and tells her to tie up her loose ends with Dwight; he has someone arriving from Phoenix soon to meet her about that.

Dwight (with his new face), accompanied by Gail and Miho, poses as Wallenquist's man from Phoenix. Inside Ava's estate, however, Manute sees past the new face and captures Dwight. Gail and Miho strike from Dwight's car, and Dwight shoots Manute with a hidden .25 he had up his left sleeve. Six bullets fail to kill him, and Manute aims shakily at Dwight as Ava grabs one of Manute's guns, shooting Manute in his shoulder. Manute falls through a window and, upon landing, is stabbed in the arms by Miho, pinning him to the ground. Ava then tries to get Dwight to kill him, telling him that Manute had her under mind control to manipulate her and Damien and that it would be a cruel irony if he killed her now. Dwight finally sees through all the lies and kills Ava.

==''The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories''==

First published November 1994, ''The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories'' is a publication of short stories:
* "And Behind Door Number Three..." (4 pages long)
* "The Customer Is Always Right" (3 pages long)
* "The Babe Wore Red" (23 pages long) It reprints a serial run in ''Previews''.

"And Behind Door Number Three..." is a short story about Gail and Wendy (who's now wearing Marv's necklace) setting a trap for a man they suspect is 'carving up' girls in Old Town.

The enigmatic "Cowboy" is captured by the allure of Wendy and subsequently shot and tied up by Gail. Although the Cowboy is willing to confess to the cops, the girls have other plans and invite Miho to finish the job.

"The Customer Is Always Right" served as the opening sequence for the film ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', which featured [[Josh Hartnett]] and [[Marley Shelton]]. The sequence served as the original [[proof of concept]] footage that director [[Robert Rodriguez]] filmed to convince Frank Miller to allow him to adapt ''Sin City'' to the silver screen.

The story involves an enigmatic tryst between two nameless characters; "The Customer" and "The Salesman." They meet on the terrace of a high rise building, hinting that although they seem to be acting like strangers, they do indeed have some sort of past. It is unclear what their past involves even as they embrace in a passionate kiss.

A silenced gunshot stabs the night air to reveal that The Salesman has shot The Customer. The reader is led to believe that The Customer had fallen into a serious and difficult situation and, with no other feasible alternative, hired The Salesman to kill her. Later information given by Frank Miller on the commentary of the Recut &amp; Extended DVD Edition states that The Customer had an affair with a member of the mafia, and when she found out tried to break it off with him. The mafia member then swore to her that she would die in the most terrible way possible, and when it is least expected. The Customer, having connections, hires The Salesman (who is referred to as "The Lady-Killer") to kill her. In the comic The Salesman is the Colonel, as Miller has verified in the BLAM! section page 29 of the one-shot issue "Sex &amp; Violence."

"The Babe Wore Red" centers around the character of Dwight and the murder of his friend Fargo. Dwight stumbles upon the hanging corpse of Fargo in his apartment and encounters Mr Shlubb, half of the recurring supporting duo, Douglas Klump and Burt Shlubb (aka Fat Man and Little Boy).

He knocks out Shlubb and finds the titular character hiding in the shower. Under a barrage of sniper shots from Douglas Klump, Dwight and the Babe reach their car and speed off. Although they successfully elude the pair, Dwight refuses to let them off easy, choosing rather to head to The Farm to deal with them. In the meantime, the Babe introduces herself as a hooker named Mary, but Dwight can tell she's lying. He duels with both of them again and due to insistence from Mary decides to shoot them in the leg instead of killing them. He eventually receives a package from Fargo who had shipped it off before his untimely demise. Dwight reads up on the whole situation and realizes that Fargo was simply the scapegoat for illegal drug-related activities and had paid the ultimate price. He also receives a package from Mary. She was not a hooker, rather a nun that had flirted with temptation before ultimately deciding to dedicate her life to God.

The time frame for the story is given as during the time Marv spent on death row in "The Hard Goodbye", as noted when Dwight mentions that he had a friend on death row because of what happened at the Roark family farm.

==''The Big Fat Kill''==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Frank Miller (comics)]] --&gt;

[[File:bfk2.png|Cover to ''Sin City: The Big Fat Kill'' #2. Art by Frank Miller. The characters Dwight and Gail.|thumb]]
{{main|The Big Fat Kill}}

First published in five issues November 1994&amp;ndash;March 1995, '''''The Big Fat Kill''''' opens in Shellie's apartment, where a drunken former fling is furiously rapping on her door, demanding to be let in. Shellie is obviously scared, but is comforted by Dwight who has gotten a new face (see ''A Dame To Kill For''). Dwight tells the barmaid to let the man and his ensuing entourage in, expressing confidence in his ability to 'handle them'. When the man outside threatens to break down her door, Shellie reluctantly opens it while Dwight hides in the bathroom. Dwight deals with the man, who then leaves, heading into [[The Girls of Old Town|Old Town]]. The story deals with the repercussions of Dwight's and the Old Town Girls' actions towards him.

The story is one of three from Sin City related in the film ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''. In the film, [[Clive Owen]] plays Dwight, [[Brittany Murphy]] plays Shellie, [[Benicio del Toro]] plays Jack, [[Rosario Dawson]] plays Gail, [[Devon Aoki]] plays Miho, [[Alexis Bledel]] plays Becky, and [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] plays Manute.

=="Silent Night"==

"Silent Night" is a one-shot short story that Frank Miller released in November 1995. It is a 26-page story featuring Marv. It has almost no dialogue; only one speech bubble appears in the entire story. The original issue had no functional cover, i.e. the story started on the top page, which had no title, author or publisher information. These were appended at the end of the issue.

Against a backdrop of heavy snow, Marv (a hulking, scarred figure in a trenchcoat) approaches a door in a dark alley. He intimidates the bouncer, Fatman, by simply glaring at him, and is let in. He proceeds down a flight of stairs, and is met by two men with machine pistols and a leather-clad woman, who is apparently their boss. Marv hands her a wad of bills and is shown to a steel door in the far wall. Through a small viewing slit, he can see a terrified little girl crouching in darkness in the room beyond. It is not stated, but is apparent that the child was being sold for sex. Marv draws two pistols and kills the pair of henchmen, then executes the woman, the only time he kills a woman in all of his Sin City appearances. He says to the little girl, "Your momma's been asking after you, Kimberly. Let's get you home." Cuddling the girl gently in his arms, he walks off into the distance, as the snow obscures his receding form.

==''That Yellow Bastard''==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Frank Miller (comics)]] --&gt;
{{main|That Yellow Bastard}}
[[File:Sin City - That Yellow Bastard (front cover).png|thumb|Cover to ''That Yellow Bastard'' #1. Art by Frank Miller. It shows a menacing-looking Detective Hartigan.]]
First published in February 1996&amp;ndash;July 1996, '''''That Yellow Bastard''''' is a six-issue [[comic book]] miniseries, and the sixth in the ''Sin City'' series. It follows the usual black and white noir style artistry of previous ''Sin City'' novels. The first collected edition by [[Dark Horse Comics]] became available in July 1997 ({{ISBN|1-56971-225-5}}).

The story begins more than eight years before any other ''Sin City'' book takes place, with possibly the most noble, and heroic [[protagonist]] in the ''Sin City'' universe, [[policeman]] [[John Hartigan]] (suffering from severe [[Angina pectoris|angina]] problems) on his final mission before his forced retirement. Roark Junior, son of one of the most powerful and [[Political corruption|corrupt]] officials in Basin City, is indulging his penchant for [[Child sexual abuse|raping]] and murdering [[puberty|pre-pubescent]] girls. It is Hartigan's mission to rescue Junior's latest quarry, a thin eleven-year-old named [[Nancy Callahan]]. Hartigan rescues her, but only after severely wounding Junior and sending him into a coma. Hartigan is then framed for kidnapping and raping Nancy, and sent to prison for eight years, until he manages to achieve parole and attempts to locate and protect Nancy from Roark's men.

In the film adaptation, [[Bruce Willis]] stars as Hartigan, [[Jessica Alba]] as Nancy, [[Nick Stahl]] as the Yellow Bastard/Junior, [[Powers Boothe]] as Senator Roark and [[Michael Madsen]] as Hartigan's partner, Bob. There are only a few notable differences in the film version: Mort is replaced by Bob when Hartigan is released from prison, an appearance by [[Carla Gugino]] as Lucille is omitted (but reinstated in the extended version released to DVD), and Senator Roark ([[Powers Boothe]]) has a mustache.

In the DVD commentary, Frank Miller indicated that he was initially motivated to write ''That Yellow Bastard'' after his disappointment with ''[[The Dead Pool]]'', the fifth and final film in the ''[[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]]'' series. Nancy—who prior to this story had no last name—was named "Callahan", a name shared with [[Clint Eastwood]]'s character.

=="Daddy's Little Girl"==

"Daddy's Little Girl" was first published in ''A Decade of Dark Horse'' #1 (July 1996) and reprinted in ''Tales to Offend'' #1 (July 1997), and ''Booze, Broads, and Bullets.''

Johnny is a middle-aged man who seems to be in love with a much younger girl by the name of Amy. Amy insists that they cannot be together and alludes to the solution that he kills her father. Torn by his emotions and manipulated by Amy, he attempts to confront her father first, asking for her hand in marriage. Daddy refuses and Johnny shoots him with a revolver that Amy gave him. Daddy then reveals that the gun was in fact loaded with [[blank (cartridge)|blank]]s and was a plot orchestrated by him and Amy. The two are either lovers with a daddy/daughter [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] based relationship or a father and daughter in an [[incest]]uous relationship. Daddy strangles Johnny for sexual satisfaction, and it implied this was the only way he was able to become aroused.

==''Lost, Lonely, &amp; Lethal''==

First published December 1996, ''Lost, Lonely &amp; Lethal'' contains three stories:
* "Fat Man and Little Boy" (3 pages) – first published in ''San Diego Comic Con Comics'' #4 (July 1996)
* "Blue Eyes" (14 pages)
* "Rats" (7 pages)

"Fat Man and Little Boy" is a short three-page story about Douglas Klump and Burt Shlubb, who also appear in ''That Yellow Bastard'' and ''Family Values''. These characters use a large vocabulary to make it appear that they are more intelligent than they truthfully are. However their wordy speeches are sprinkled with [[malapropism]]s. In this yarn, Shlubb's boots are in horrible shape, and he wishes to steal the shoes off a corpse, wrapped in a rug, that they're supposed to dump in the river.

Klump tells him that they're supposed to leave the body as it is. Shlubb disagrees and pulls the boots off, to discover that there are no feet in them, and a ticking sound rings through their ears. This was apparently a test, and the two buffoons get thrown several yards away as the explosion hits. It seems they failed the test miserably.

"Blue Eyes", the second story, begins as a man named Jim notices someone he assumes is a hitman following him. He runs into Kadie's, where he is confronted by an ex-flame named Delia. Marv is sitting next to them at the bar, and provides some comic relief. The hitman enters the bar, and Jim convinces Delia to leave with him. Marv then steals his drink, reasoning that it would have gone to waste otherwise.

Jim and Delia go back to his place and make love. She then attacks him, and explains that this is her test. She wants to become a [[hitman|hitwoman]], and she must first kill the only man she ever loved. After killing Jim, the Colonel appears - he was the 'hitman' who had been following Jim. He gives her an assignment, and she takes on the name 'Blue Eyes', which is what Jim used to call her.

Blue Eyes is shown to take place at the same time as ''A Dame To Kill For'', as part of the story shows Gail telling Shelley what to tell the police about Dwight.  The story also has brief appearances by many characters, including Miho, Agammemnon and Manute.

"Rats" is the final story, it is about a disturbed war criminal who eats dog food. It was adapted to a 2004 [[fan film]] of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2655362]&lt;/ref&gt;

A sadistic war criminal (and presumed [[Nazi]]) stuffs rats in his oven to eat as he mentally rambles about the [[London Blitz]], his arthritis, and how he killed all the 'rats', which were all people. A vigilante known amongst readers as 'The Janitor' kicks down the door and incapacitates him, before shoving his head into the oven, gassing him to death.

==''Sex &amp; Violence''==

''Sex &amp; Violence'' was first published in March 1997 and only contains two stories, both of which feature Delia:
* "Wrong Turn" (23 pages)
* "Wrong Track" (3 pages)
The two stories take place on the same night, with the second taking place minutes after the first.

"Wrong Turn" is the first story, in which a man named Phil drives aimlessly in the rain, eventually finding Delia unconscious on a dirt road. He picks her up, and she tells him that she must have got struck by lightning. He offers to take her to the hospital, but she refuses. She asks if he is married, and he says that he is not. She takes him to the pits, and they make love. In the middle of it, he confesses that he is, in fact, married.

She starts choking him and calls him by the name of Eddie. She claims he has a trunk-load of stolen jewels he plans to sell in Sacred Oaks, violating an exclusivity agreement with the Wallenquist Organization. He explains that he is a used car salesman named Phil, and she understands. Eddie was supposed to be driving a similar Studebaker, and looked very similar. She sticks the heel of her shoe in his eye socket, killing him. She meets up with the Colonel and Gordo at the entrance to the pits. They check the trunk of Phil's car and find his wife with six bullets in her chest. They throw him in as well and Gordo pushes the car into the pits. Delia explains that she has a train to catch.

"Wrong Track" is the second story, which picks up soon after. Eddie is riding the train. His internal monologue explains that he had a flat tire. Delia hits on him, and they make love near the back of the train.

When they're done, she snaps his neck and throws him off the train. Leaving the rear of the train, the Colonel waits for her. "Delia-- do you plan to make love to each and every one of them?" he asks. Her response is "Only the ones I like."

=="Just Another Saturday Night"==

"Just Another Saturday Night" was first published in ''Sin City #1/2'' (August 1997), a limited mail-in comic available only through a special offer in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #73. It was later reprinted in a mass-market edition as ''Just Another Saturday Night'' (October 1998).

It is the story of what Marv was up to on the night [[John Hartigan]] met back up with [[Nancy Callahan|Nancy]] (from ''[[That Yellow Bastard]]''). Marv regains consciousness on a highway overlooking the Projects, surrounded by dead young guys, unable to remember how he got there. He lights one of the dead guys' cigarettes and thinks back; since it is Saturday, he deduces he must have been at Kadie's watching Nancy dance.

Marv was rather depressed after seeing Nancy leave with Hartigan, as he had always had an unrequited crush on her, so the barkeep gives him a bottle to drown his sorrow with. He gets drunk and steps outside, only to find some preppy college kids trying to burn drunks and winos to death. He immediately kills one of them and chases the rest to The Projects, where along the way he destroys a police patrol car and hijacks another vehicle. At the Projects, it is clear that they are being watched, but Marv uses hand signals to identify himself and instruct his former neighbors to attack the kids, and they do so by firing arrows at them and providing Marv with a knife. After questioning the last surviving kid about him being called 'Bernini boy' (it was the name of the brand of coat he was wearing), he slits his throat. This done, he muses, "And one fine coat it ''is''. Somebody must've spent a ''fortune'' on it. I wonder ''who''?" But he cannot seem to remember where he got the coat or gloves.

==''Family Values''==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Frank Miller (comics)]] --&gt;
{{main|Family Values (comics)}}
'''''Family Values''''' was first published in (October 1997) and was the fifth "yarn" in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Sin City]]'' series. Unlike the previous four stories, ''Family Values'' was released as a 128-page [[graphic novel]] rather than in serialized issues that would later be collected in a trade paperback volume. The plot concerns Dwight and Miho going on a mission from Gail to dig up information about a recent mob hit at a small diner.

'''Maria Morris Miller''' (1813-1875) was a Canadian artist from [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] who is known for her botanical paintings and illustrations. She is also the first professional woman artist in Nova Scotia, recognized in her field during her active career years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/maria-morris-miller/|title=Maria Morris Miller|website=thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked with scientists and government officials, garnering her accolades as the "Audubon of Nova Scotian field flowers".&lt;ref name="journals.msvu.ca"&gt;http://journals.msvu.ca/index.php/atlantis/article/viewFile/4155/3399&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born into a middle class family, Miller's mother Sybilla encouraged her to learn about art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kAS6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller |title=Social History |volume=30 |page=11 |publisher=University of Ottawa Press |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller studied her craft in Halifax under the tutelage of a visiting British painter named L'Estrange. She also studied with W.H. Jones, a Bostonian who taught at [[Dalhousie College]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=UgrrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt2qHaz5faAhXs7YMKHZdkCIw4ChDoAQgtMAE&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830, she began offering drawing classes to female students which gave her some financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=4LW7y8EQQUcC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjioNLzzJfaAhWE3oMKHVjUCvMQ6AEITDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Maria%20Morris%20Miller&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=W9DpsO-tjKYC&amp;q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt2qHaz5faAhXs7YMKHZdkCIw4ChDoAQhBMAU&lt;/ref&gt;  The North British Society of Halifax honoured her with the title of "Painter of the Year" in 1836.&lt;ref name =nsgallery&gt;https://artgalleryofnovascotia.ca/maria-morris-miller/&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Nova Scotia's Secretary of Agriculture and botanist, Titus Smith, asked Miller to paint a series of canvasses depicting local wildflowers. He brought her specimens which she quickly had to immortalize, before the plants deteriorated.&lt;ref name="journals.msvu.ca"/&gt; During the mid 1830s, aided by Smith's scientific input, Miller produced a large number of water colour drawings which later ended up in an important Halifax art exhibition in 1848.&lt;ref name=nsgallery/&gt;

Smith provided botanical descriptions for Miller's first catalog of coloured [[lithograph]]s entitled ''Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=2OoBMQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjioNLzzJfaAhWE3oMKHVjUCvMQ6AEIQTAE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=LRQ1AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjioNLzzJfaAhWE3oMKHVjUCvMQ6AEIWzAJ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=5175&lt;/ref&gt; It was issued in 1840 by a London bookseller and local publisher, with the financial support of the province's [[lieutenant-governor]] [[Sir Colin Campbell]]. Two other sets of lithographs followed in 1853 and 1866. The second publication was also issued as ''Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia''. The third catalog was entitled ''Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick'' and  was annotated by [[George Lawson (botanist)|George Lawson]], a botanist who founded the Botanical Society of Canada.&lt;ref name=nsgallery/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.ca/search?q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA703CA703&amp;tbm=bks&amp;ei=YgrAWuLnGoS9jwTYqKuYDw&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=907&amp;bih=425&amp;dpr=1.5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, the first series was reissued with a new title, ''Wild Flowers of British North America''.  With her four catalogs, Miller was able to document 22 native plants, at a time when there was an increasing interest in natural history.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=iv95AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt2qHaz5faAhXs7YMKHZdkCIw4ChDoAQgzMAI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsgallery"/&gt;

In 1862, Miller participated in an International Exhibition in [[London]], [[England]]. Although her drawings arrived too late to be part of the competition, she received positive reviews in the English press.&lt;ref&gt;https://cwahi.concordia.ca/sources/artists/displayArtist.php?ID_artist=70&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, a copy of her botanical paintings were exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Exposition]].

==Personal life==
Most records indicate that Maria Morris Miller was born in 1813 in [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], the daughter of Captain Guy Morris and Sibylla Amelia Maria Sophia Leggett. Her father, who was a descendent of [[Charles Morris (jurist)|Charles Morris]], died when Maria was a small child. (She may have also been born in 1810 in Country Harbour, Nova Scotia with her mother moving the family to Halifax after her father's death in 1813.) In 1840, Maria Morris Miller married Garret Trafalgar Nelson Miller, the son of [[Garrett Miller (politician)|Garrett Miller]] and Catherine Pernette, who was the daughter of [[Joseph Pernette]]. Maria Morris Miller and her husband had five children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Morris, Maria Frances Ann (Miller) |encyclopedia=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=5175 |access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"/&gt; She passed away in Halifax in 1875.

'''''The Miracle of the Slave''''' (also known as '''''The Miracle of St. Mark''''', 1548) is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Jacopo Tintoretto]].  Currently housed in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]] in [[Venice]], northern Italy, it was originally commissioned for the [[Scuola Grande di San Marco]], a confraternity in the city.

It portrays an episode of the life of [[Saint Mark]], patron saint of Venice, taken from [[Jacopo da Varazze]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]''. The scene shows, in the upper part, the saint intervening to make invulnerable a slave about to be martyred for his veneration of another saint's relics. All the figures are inscribed into an architectonic scenario.

Different influences on Tintoretto's art can be seen in the picture: while the anatomies are [[Michelangelo]]-like, the vivid and intense colors are typical of the [[Venetian School (art)|Venetian School]].

[[File:Etty – Musidora- The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed'.jpg|right|upright=1.35|thumb|''Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed{{'}}'', Tate version, exhibited&amp;nbsp;1846, {{convert|65.1|by|50.2|cm|in|abbr=on}}|alt=Naked woman standing in a stream]]
'''''Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed'''''', also known as '''''The Bather''''',&lt;ref name="MonthlyCritic1843"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1843|title=Exhibition of the Royal Academy|journal=The Court Magazine and Monthly Critic|issue=14|publisher=William Syme|location=London|volume=9|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a name given to four nearly identical [[oil painting]]s on canvas by English artist [[William Etty]]. The paintings illustrate a scene from [[James Thomson (poet, born 1700)|James Thomson]]'s 1727 poem ''[[The Seasons (Thomson)|Summer]]'' in which a young man accidentally sees a young woman bathing naked, and is torn between his desire to look and his knowledge that he ought to look away. The scene was popular with English artists as it was one of the few legitimate pretexts to paint [[nude (art)|nude]]s at a time when the display and distribution of nude imagery was suppressed.

Other than minor differences in the background landscape, the four paintings are identical in composition. The first version was exhibited in 1843. Two versions are in public collections, one in [[Tate Britain]] and one in the [[Manchester Art Gallery]]; one of these was painted in 1844 and first exhibited in 1846 and the other was painted at around the same time; it is not known which is the version exhibited in 1846.  A fourth version is of poorer quality and may be a later copy by a student.

''Musidora'' was extremely well received when first exhibited, and considered one of the finest works by an English artist. Etty died in 1849 and his work rapidly went out of fashion. At the same time, the topic of Musidora itself became a cliche, and from the 1870s Thomson's writings faded into obscurity. Etty's ''Musidora'' is likely to have influenced ''The Knight Errant'' by [[John Everett Millais]], but other than that has had little influence on subsequent works. The Tate's version of the painting was exhibited in major exhibitions in 2001–02 in London and in 2011–12 in York.

==Background==
[[File:Hill &amp; Adamson – William Etty at easel.jpg|thumb|upright|William Etty in 1844, around the time ''Musidora'' was painted.|alt=man standing at an easel]]
[[William Etty]] (1787–1849), the seventh child of a [[York]] baker and miller,{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=2}} began his career as an apprentice printer in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] at the age of 11.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=5}} On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London "with a few pieces of chalk crayons",{{sfn|Burnage|2011a|p=157}} with the intention of becoming a [[history painting|history painter]] in the tradition of the [[Old Masters]],{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=86}} and studied under renowned artist [[Thomas Lawrence]].{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=14}} Strongly influenced by the works of [[Titian]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], Etty submitted numerous paintings to the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and the [[British Institution]], all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=31}}

In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, ''[[The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia]]'' (also known as ''The Triumph of Cleopatra''),{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=31}} which depicted a large number of [[Nude (art)|&lt;!-- Normally this would be overlinking, but in this context readers are likely to want to learn more about the tradition of nude art --&gt;nude figures]].{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=30}} ''Cleopatra'' was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full [[Royal Academy of Arts#Membership|Royal Academician]] in 1828, ahead of [[John Constable]].{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=118}} He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones.{{sfn|Burnage|2011c|p=198}} Following the exhibition of ''Cleopatra'', over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings.&lt;ref name="MAG Etty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html |title=About the artist |publisher=Manchester Art Gallery |accessdate=10 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024806/http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html |archivedate=11 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}}

While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 [[Society for the Suppression of Vice|Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice]].{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=53}} Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude,{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=55}} and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p = 54}}{{efn-ua|Etty's male nude portraits were primarily of mythological heroes and classical combat, genres in which the depiction of male nudity was considered acceptable in England.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=32–33}}}} From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=42}}

&lt;/poem&gt;|source=These lines from ''[[The Seasons (Thomson)|Summer]]'' accompanied the painting on its original exhibit.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=58}}}}
''Musidora'' is based on ''[[wikisource:Summer (Thomson)|Summer]]'',{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=148}} a poem by the Scottish poet and playwright [[James Thomson (poet, born 1700)|James Thomson]] (best known today as the author of ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]'').&lt;ref name="ODNBThomson"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=27306|title=James Thomson}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Summer'' was initially published in 1727 and was republished in an altered form in 1730 along with Thomson's ''Winter'' (1726), ''Spring'' (1728) and ''Autumn'' (1730) as ''[[The Seasons (Thomson)|The Seasons]]''.&lt;ref name="ODNBThomson" /&gt; Although the individual poems attracted little interest on their release, ''The Seasons'' proved critically and commercially successful once completed, and Thomson began to associate with important and influential London political and cultural figures.&lt;ref name="ODNBThomson" /&gt; In June 1744 Thomson published a drastically revised version of ''The Seasons'', which became extremely influential over the following century. [[Joseph Haydn]] wrote [[The Seasons (Haydn)|a major oratorio]] based on the poem, significant artists including [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[Richard Westall]] painted scenes from it, and over 400 editions of ''The Seasons'' in a number of languages were published between 1744 and 1870.&lt;ref name="ODNBThomson" /&gt;

The painting depicts a scene from ''Summer'' in which the young Damon sits thinking by a stream on a hot summer's day.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=148}} The beautiful Musidora strips naked to cool down by bathing in the stream, not knowing that Damon can see her. Damon is torn between his desire to watch her and the "delicate refinement" of knowing he should avert his gaze. Damon decides to respect her modesty and leaves a note on the riverbank reading "Bathe on, my fair,&amp;nbsp;/ Yet unbeheld save by the sacred eye&amp;nbsp;/ Of faithful love: I go to guard thy haunt;&amp;nbsp;/ To keep from thy recess each vagrant foot&amp;nbsp;/ And each licentious eye". Musidora sees the paper and panics, but on reading it and realising that it has been written by Damon, feels admiration for his behaviour as well as a surge of pride that her own beauty can provoke such a reaction. She leaves him a note in turn, reading "Dear youth! sole judge of what these verses mean,&amp;nbsp;/ By fortune too much favoured, but by love,&amp;nbsp;/ Alas! not favoured less, be still as now&amp;nbsp;/ Discreet: the time may come you need not fly."{{sfn|Thomson|1794|pp=86–89}}

[[File:Gainsborough - Musidora.jpg|right|upright=.9|thumb|''Musidora'' by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] c.1780–1788. This painting was not exhibited during  Gains{{shy}}borough's lifetime.|alt=woman undressing with her feet in a stream]]
As a nude scene from a major and well respected work of English literature, the theme of Musidora was one of the few pretexts under which mainstream English painters felt able to paint nudes, and Musidora has been described as "the nation's surrogate [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]".{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=58}} Four versions of ''Musidora'' attributed to Etty exist in total, the first of which was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1843. The best known version is that now in [[Tate Britain]], painted in 1844 and probably first exhibited at the [[British Institution]] in 1846.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=149}}{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=100}} The four paintings are identical in composition, although the landscape background varies slightly.{{sfn|Farr|1958|pp=100–01}} One of the paintings is of poorer quality, and may be a later copy by a student.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=150}}

==Composition==
The painting shows the moment from ''Summer'' in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into "the lucid coolness of the flood" to "bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream".{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=148}} Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=149}} By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as "a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome".{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=149}}

The pose of Musidora is based on that of the [[Aphrodite of Cnidus]] and the [[Venus de' Medici]].{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=58}} It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's ''Musidora'', which shares similar elements.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=101}} Gainsborough's ''Musidora'', his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gainsborough-musidora-n00308|title=Musidora|date=May 2007|publisher=Tate|accessdate=14 June 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Etty was familiar with its then-owner [[Robert Vernon (art patron)|Robert Vernon]] and may have seen it in his collection.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=254}}

[[File:The Plantation at Acomb, York YORAG-714.jpg|right|thumb|''The Plantation at Acomb'', William Etty, 1842|alt=broad stream and trees]]
The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of [[Acomb, North Yorkshire|Acomb]], near York.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=58}} The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=149}} In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement;{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=27}} Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=149}}

Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for ''Musidora'' he adopted a much softer and earthier palette,{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=149}} although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=58}} He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=149}} This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of [[classical mythology]], and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. ''The Seasons'', by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=149}}

==Reception==
Both exhibited versions met with great acclaim,{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=149}} and ''Musidora'' was Etty's most successful painting of a single nude figure.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=254}} ''[[La Belle Assemblée|The Court Magazine and Monthly Critic]]'' called the 1843 version "One of the most delicate and beautiful female figures in the entire gallery", saying that "no hues can be more natural—more Titianesque, if we may so speak."&lt;ref name="MonthlyCritic1843" /&gt; ''[[The Literary Gazette]]'' called the version exhibited in 1846 "by far his finest work of art", comparing the piece favourably to [[Rembrandt]] and in particularly praising Etty's ability to capture shadows and reflections in water, where "in the management of these effects [reflections and shadows] Etty has no superior, and very few equals, in any school, from the earliest dawn of art".{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=149}} ''[[The Critic (magazine)|The Critic]]'' described it as "a preeminent work" and "the triumph of the British school".{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=149}}

Leonard Robinson argues that the popularity of ''Musidora'' reflects a change in art buyers. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the primary market for art was no longer a privately educated [[landed aristocracy]] who had been taught the [[Classics]] and were familiar with ancient mythology, but the emerging middle class.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=189}} These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand the references in history paintings, but could appreciate ''Musidora'' as a skilful execution and as a work of beauty in its own right.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=255}}

By the time Etty exhibited ''Musidora'', the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by ''The Literary Gazette'' as "a favourite subject for a dip of the brush".{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=58}} As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by [[Lady Godiva]], who had become a topic of increased interest owing to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s poem ''[[Godiva (poem)|Godiva]]''.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=58}} After the death of [[William Wordsworth]] in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than ''Rule, Britannia!'' were little known.&lt;ref name="ODNBThomson" /&gt;

When Etty died in 1849,{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}} despite having worked and exhibited until his death,{{sfn|Burnage|2011e|p=243}} he was still  regarded by many as a pornographer. [[Charles Robert Leslie]] observed shortly after Etty's death that {{nowrap|"[Etty]}} himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leslie|first=Charles Robert|date=30 March 1850|title=Lecture on the Works of the late W. Etty, Esq, R.A., by Professor Leslie|journal=The Athenæum|location=London|issue=1170|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in him declined as [[Victorian painting|new movements]] came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}}

[[File:The Knight Errant b John Everett Millais 1870.jpg|right|upright|thumb|It is likely that the composition of Millais's 1870 ''The Knight Errant'' was influenced by ''Musidora.''|alt=Dishevelled and distressed naked woman tied to a tree, being cut free by a man in armour]]
It is likely that the composition and style of [[John Everett Millais]]'s controversial ''The Knight Errant'' was influenced by ''Musidora'',{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=70}} but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator [[William Edward Frost]], few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=433}} In 1882 ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' commented on ''Musidora'' that "I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=4 February 1882|title=Vanities|journal=Vanity Fair|publisher=Thomas Gibson Bowles|location=London|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word "[[Victorian morality|Victorian]]" had become a derogatory term.{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=11}} [[Frederick Mentone]]'s ''The Human Form in Art'' (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view ''Musidora''.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=28}}

===Versions===
The 1843 ''Musidora'' was bought directly from Etty by [[City of London]] merchant George Knott for 70&amp;nbsp;[[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|70|1843|r=-2}}|0}} in today's terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) who sold it on two years later for 225&amp;nbsp;guineas (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|225|1845|r=-3}}|0}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=283}} It has passed through the hands of a number of private collectors since, remaining in private collections until at least 1948.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=149}}{{efn-ua|The 1843 version was bought by [[Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons]] in November 1947 for 60 guineas from an anonymous seller, and was sold to a Mrs Dunne the following year for an undisclosed sum.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=149}} No full inventory of Etty's works has been conducted since 1958, and the current whereabouts of this version is not recorded.}} As well as its 1843 exhibition at the Royal Academy, it was exhibited at an 1849 retrospective of Etty's work at the [[Royal Society of Arts|Society of Arts]], and at the Royal Academy's 1889 ''Old Masters'' exhibition.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=149}}

It is not clear which ''Musidora'' was exhibited at the British Institution in 1846. The [[Tate Britain]] version was bought from Etty for an unknown sum by [[Jacob Bell (chemist)|Jacob Bell]]. It was exhibited in Etty's 1849 Society of Arts retrospective, but was described as "not previously exhibited".{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=149}} It was bequeathed to the [[National Gallery]] by [[Jacob Bell (chemist)|Jacob Bell]] in 1859,{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=70}} and transferred to the [[Tate Gallery]] (now Tate Britain) in 1900.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=149}} In 2001–02 this painting was shown as part of Tate Britain's ''Exposed: The Victorian Nude'' exhibition,{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=58}} and exhibited in 2011–12 as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the [[York Art Gallery]].{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=148}}

An almost identical version, which is possibly that originally exhibited in 1846, was bequeathed in 1917 to the [[Manchester Art Gallery]],{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=150}} where {{asof|2015|lc=y}} it remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doit2013tarek.co.uk/salvaged/the-painting/other-works-by-etty/index.html|title=Other works by Etty|work=Salvaged|publisher=Manchester Art Gallery|accessdate=14 June 2015|location=Manchester}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version, again almost identical to the Tate and Manchester paintings, is in a private collection; it is of poorer quality, and is possibly a copy by a 19th-century student.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=150}}

The '''National Indigenous Radio Service''' is a [[satellite]] program feed available in [[Australia]] to [[community radio]] stations that are subscribers of the [[Community Broadcasting Association of Australia|CBAA’s]] [[Community Radio Network (Australia)|Community Radio Network]].  The NIRS provides targeted and specialist programming for and by [[Australia|Australia’s]] [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] broadcasters.   From its base in [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]] the NIRS provides a feed of programs and music supplied by a number of contributing stations including [[Koori Radio]], [[4AAA]] and [[8KNB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the NIRS |url=http://www.nirs.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=2 |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-07-18 |publisher= NIRS |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321223348/http://www.nirs.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=2 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscribing stations are able to re-transmit individual programs or entire blocks of program time as needed. As NIRS is broadcast 24 hours a day, stations with limited resources who are unable to provide a full-time service can use NIRS to fill the gaps between [[local programming]]. For those radio stations that already broadcast 24 hours a day, NIRS gives them access to national coverage of current affairs and indigenous issues, which some stations may not have the resources to provide themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communications in remote Indigenous communities |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib310631/chptr6_0607commreport.pdf

==Funding==

The National Indigenous Radio Service receives the bulk of its funds from the [[Australian Government]] through the [[Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indigenous Broadcasting Program |url=http://www.arts.gov.au/indigenous/broadcasting |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2008-07-18 |publisher=[[Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|DEWHA Australia]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720114534/http://www.arts.gov.au/indigenous/broadcasting |archivedate=20 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The service can also broadcast limited [[advertising]] in the form of sponsorship and offers an in-house production and placement service.

==Programming==
Along with its bed of purely [[Music of Australia|Australian]] and [[Indigenous Australian music|Indigenous]] music is national programming covering topics such as [[health]], [[education]], Government department updates and issues relevant to [[Indigenous Australian]]s. Other programming includes regional news, sporting events and coverage of live music and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NIRS Programs |url=http://www.nirs.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9&amp;Itemid=4 |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-07-18 |publisher= NIRS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian rules football===
During the home and away season, NIRS broadcasts descriptions of at least three [[Australian Football League]] matches every weekend.&lt;ref name="NIRS_AFL2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nirs.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=48|title=AFL 2009|publisher=NIRS|accessdate=2009-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Color commentator|Expert commentators]] in 2011 included [[Gilbert McAdam]], [[Ronnie Burns (footballer)|Ronnie Burns]],Chris Johnson, [[Indigenous Team of the Century]] umpire [[Glenn James]], and [[Darryl White]].&lt;ref name="NIRS_AFL2009"/&gt;

===Simulcast===
The National Indigenous Radio Service broadcasts on relay and simulcasts on [[Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association|CAAMA Radio FM]] programs.

===VAST===
In December 2013, the National Indigenous Radio Service will join the new [[Viewer Access Satellite Television|VAST]] satellite platform.

==National Indigenous News Service==

The '''National Indigenous News Service''' also operates from the Brisbane base and provides an hourly five-minute bulletin of regional, national and international news.  The bulletins are an Indigenous focused news service with Indigenous news from across the country taking priority over mainstream news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About NINS

[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech was one of the 50 recordings added on the first year of existence of the United States National Recording Registry.]]
The '''National Recording Registry''' is a list of sound recordings that "are culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States." The registry was established by the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000,&lt;ref name="NRPB"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-home.html |publisher=[[The Library of Congress]] |title= Current Registry |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which created the [[National Recording Preservation Board]], whose members are appointed by the [[Librarian of Congress]]. The recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry form a registry of [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]]s selected yearly by the [[National Recording Preservation Board]] for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-home.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= Current Registry |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislative intent of the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 was to develop a national program to guard America's [[sound recording]] heritage. The Act resulted in the formations of the National Recording Registry, The National Recording Preservation Board and a fund-raising foundation to aid their efforts.&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-about.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= Overview |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act established the Registry specifically for the purpose of maintaining and preserving sound recordings and collections of sound recordings that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&lt;ref name="NRPB"/&gt; Beginning in 2002, the National Recording Preservation Board began selecting nominated recordings each year to be preserved.

The first four yearly lists each included 50 selections. However, since 2006, 25 recordings have been selected annually. Thus, a total of 500 recordings have been preserved in the Registry {{as of|2017|lc=on}}. Each calendar year, public nominations are accepted for inclusion in that year's list of selections to be announced the following spring. Nominations are made in the following categories:

{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
* Blues
* Broadway/Musical Theatre/Soundtrack
* Cajun/Zydeco/"Swamp"
* Children's recordings
* Choral
* Classical
* Comedy/Novelty
* Country/Bluegrass
* Documentary/Broadcast/Spoken Word
* Environmental
* Field
* Folk/Ethnic
* Gospel/Spiritual
* Heavy metal
* Jazz
* Latin
* Pop (pre-1955)
* Pop (post-1955)
* R&amp;B
* Radio
* Rap/Hip-hop
* Rock
* Technology
{{div col end}}

Each yearly list has often included a few recordings that have also been selected for inclusion in the holdings of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]' audiovisual collection. Those recordings on the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry that are of a political nature will tend to overlap with the audiovisual collection of the National Archives. The list shows overlapping items and whether the National Archives has an original or a copy of the recording.

==Selection criteria==
The criteria for selection are as follows:&lt;ref name="NRRC"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-nrr.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= National Recording Registry Criteria |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recordings selected for the National Recording Registry are those that are culturally, historically or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States.
* For the purposes of recording selection, "sound recordings" are defined as works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not including the sound component of a moving image work, unless it is available as an autonomous sound recording or is the only extant component of the work.
* Recordings may be a single item or group of related items; published or unpublished; and may contain music, non-music, spoken word, or broadcast sound.
* Recordings will not be considered for inclusion into the National Recording Registry if no copy of the recording exists.
* No recording should be denied inclusion into the National Recording Registry because that recording has already been preserved.
* No recording is eligible for inclusion into the National Recording Registry until ten years after the recording's creation.

==2002==
On January 27, 2003, the following 50 selections were announced by the National Recording Preservation Board.&lt;ref name="NRR2"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2002reg.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= The National Recording Registry 2002 |date=December 6, 2006 |accessdate=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
{{As of|2014}}, the oldest recording on the list is [[Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville]]'s [[Phonautograms]] which date back to 1853. The most recent is ''[[Fanfare for the Uncommon Woman]]'' by [[Joan Tower]], performed by the [[Colorado Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Marin Alsop]], which was released in 1999.&lt;ref name="NRPB2"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-masterlist.html |publisher=[[The Library of Congress]] |title= Full Registry |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selections vary widely in duration. Both the early Edison recordings and the instrumental "[[Rumble (instrumental)|Rumble]]" by [[Link Wray]], as well as "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" by [[Bill Haley and His Comets]] clock in at under three minutes; the Edison Talking Doll cylinder is only 17 seconds long and some of Scott de Martinville's Photoautograms are just as brief. Meanwhile, [[Georg Solti]]'s recording of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s complete ''[[Ring Cycle]]'' is approximately 15 hours in duration and [[Alexander Scourby]]'s recitation of the [[King James Bible]] is over 80 hours in length.&lt;ref name="NRPB2"/&gt;

Portions of [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s music for [[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]], produced by Detroit's [[Nederlander Organization]], were composed on the piano that resides in the library at [[Cranbrook Educational Community|Cranbrook]] in the Detroit suburb of [[Bloomfield Hills, MI|Bloomfield Hills]]. [[Nederlander Organization|David T. Nederlander]]'s career began after purchasing a 99-year lease on the Detroit Opera House. His son, the organization's chairman, James M.

[[File:CampusMartius1907.JPG|left|thumb|Old Detroit Opera House on Campus Martius in 1907]]
During the late 1980s the great old [[motion picture]] screens and live performance stages began to be restored. The [[Fox Theatre (Detroit, Michigan)|Fox Theatre]], [[Detroit Opera House]] (formerly the Grand Circus Theatre; Broadway Capitol Theatre; Paramount Theatre; Capital Theatre), and [[The Fillmore Detroit]] (formerly the State Theater; Palms Theater) are notable restorations. The Fillmore Detroit is the site of the annual [[Detroit Music Awards]] held in April. Other venues were modernized and expanded such as [[Orchestra Hall, Detroit|Orchestra Hall]], the home of the world-renowned [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]]. Next to the Detroit Opera House is the restored 1,700-seat [[Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts]] (1928) at 350 Madison Avenue, designed by William Kapp and developed by [[Matilda Dodge Wilson]]. The [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] contains the renovated 1,150-seat [[Detroit Film Theatre]]. Smaller sites with long histories in the city were preserved by physically moving the entire structure. In a notable preservation, the [[Gem Theatre (Detroit)|Gem Theatre]] and  [[Century Theatre (Detroit)|Century Theatre]] were moved (off their foundation) to a new address across from the Music Hall Center in order to construct [[Comerica Park]]. Detroit's 1,571-seat [[Redford Theatre]] (1928), with its Japanese [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]], is home to the Motor City Theatre Organ Society (MCTOS).&lt;ref name=DetroitInteriors&gt;{{cite web |author = AIA Detroit Urban Priorities Committee |date = January 10, 2006 |url = http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/lookinside.aspx |title = Top 10 Detroit Interiors |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080723121710/http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/lookinside.aspx |archive-date = July 23, 2008 |publisher = Model D Media |access-date = November 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RedfordTheatre&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/16098.htm |title = Redford Theatre Building |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606135050/http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/16098.htm |archive-date = June 6, 2011 |publisher = Michigan State Historic Preservation Office |access-date = January 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Wayne State University]]’s  [[Hilberry Theatre (Wayne State University)]] in [[Midtown Detroit|Midtown]], the only graduate [[repertory theater]] in the nation, Detroit has enjoyed a resurgence in theatrical productions and attendance. In the 2000s, shows ranging from touring musicals to local theater happen nightly and the theaters have sparked a significant increase in nightlife; [[hospitality]] ventures serving the area have increased accordingly. With its sports venues and casinos, the Detroit Theater District has helped revitalized high rise residential areas like those surrounding [[Grand Circus Park Historic District|Grand Circus Park]] and its nearby ''Foxtown'', [[Greektown Historic District|Greektown]], the [[Cultural Center Historic District|Cultural Center]] and [[New Center Detroit|New Center]] area anchored by the 2,089-seat [[Fisher Building|Fisher Theatre]].&lt;ref name=AIADetroit/&gt;

The city has some surviving historic theaters which have been converted to other uses while others await redevelopment.

'''Priam's Treasure''' is a cache of [[gold]] and other artifacts discovered by classical [[archaeologist]] [[Heinrich Schliemann]]. The majority of the artifacts are currently in the [[Pushkin Museum]] in Moscow.

Schliemann claimed the site to be that of [[Iliad|Homeric]] [[Troy]], and assigned the artifacts to the Homeric king [[Priam]]. This assignment is now thought to be a result of Schliemann's zeal to find sites and objects mentioned in the [[Homeric epics]] which take place in northwestern Turkey. At the time the stratigraphy at Troy had not been solidified, which was done subsequently by the archaeologist [[Carl Blegen]]. The layer in which Priam's Treasure was alleged to have been found was assigned to Troy II, whereas Priam would have been king of Troy VI or VII, occupied hundreds of years later.

== Background ==

With the rise of modern critical history, Troy and the [[Trojan War]] were consigned to the realms of legend. In 1871-73 and 1878–79, Schliemann excavated a hill called [[Hisarlik|Hissarlik]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]], near the town of Chanak ([[Çanakkale]]) in north-western [[Anatolia]], Turkey. Here he discovered the ruins of a series of ancient cities, dating from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period. Schliemann declared one of these cities—at first Troy I, later Troy II—to be the city of Troy, and this identification was widely accepted at that time.

Concerning events on or about May 27, 1873 Schliemann reported:

{{quote|In excavating this wall further and directly by the side of the palace of King Priam, I came upon a large copper article of the most remarkable form, which attracted my attention all the more as I thought I saw gold behind it. … In order to withdraw the treasure from the greed of my workmen, and to save it for archaeology, … I immediately had "paidos" (lunch break) called. … While the men were eating and resting, I cut out the Treasure with a large knife…. It would, however, have been impossible for me to have removed the Treasure without the help of my dear wife, who stood by me ready to pack the things which I cut out in her shawl and to carry them away.}}

Schliemann's oft-repeated story of the treasure being carried by his wife, Sophie, in her shawl was untrue. Schliemann later admitted making it up, saying that at the time of the discovery Sophie was in fact with her family in Athens, following the death of her father.&lt;ref&gt;Moorehead, Caroline (1994). ''The Lost Treasures of Troy'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, page 133. {{ISBN|0-297-81500-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The treasure ==
[[File:Sophia schliemann treasure.jpg|thumb|{{Interlanguage link multi|Sophia Schliemann|de}} (''née'' Engastromenos) wearing the "Jewels of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]" excavated by her husband, [[Heinrich Schliemann]], in [[Hisarlik]] (photograph taken ''ca.'' 1874)]]

[[File:Tesoro di priamo, nastro d'oro, cat. 12; piccolo diadema con pendenti, cat. 11; due orecch. con pendenti, cat. 15-16.JPG|thumb|The "small" diadem]]

A partial catalogue of the treasure is approximately as follows:
* A copper shield
* a copper cauldron with handles
* an unknown copper artifact, perhaps the hasp of a chest
* a silver vase containing two gold [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadems]] (the "Jewels of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]"), 8750 gold rings, buttons and other small objects, six gold bracelets, two gold goblets
* a copper vase
* a wrought gold bottle

== The treasure as an art collection ==

Apparently, Schliemann smuggled Priam's Treasure out of Anatolia. The officials were informed when his wife, Sophia, wore the jewels for the public. The Ottoman official assigned to watch the excavation, [[Amin Effendi]], received a prison sentence. The Ottoman government revoked Schliemann's permission to dig and sued him for its share of the gold. Schliemann went on to [[Mycenae]]. There, however, the [[Greek Archaeological Society]] sent an agent to monitor him.

Later Schliemann traded some treasure to the government of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in exchange for permission to dig at Troy again. It is located in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]]. The rest was acquired in 1881 by the [[Berlin State Museums|Royal Museums of Berlin]] ''(Königliche Museen zu Berlin)'',&lt;ref&gt;Urice, Stephen K., editor (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_8AddekkdZ8C Law, Ethics and the Visual Arts]'', Kluwer Law International, page 63. {{ISBN|90-411-2517-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Jeanette (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-r032DSDsOIC The Return of Cultural Treasures]'', Cambridge University Press, page 197. {{ISBN|0-521-80216-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in whose hands it remained until 1945, when it disappeared from a protective bunker beneath the [[Zoologischer Garten Berlin|Berlin Zoo]].

In fact, after the capture of the bunker by the [[Red Army]] Professor [[Wilhelm Unverzagt]] turned the treasure over to the Soviet commendant and thus saved it from plunder and division. The commander promised to guarantee the safety of the art treasures. The artefacts were taken away to [[Moscow]]. During the [[Cold War]], the Soviet government denied any knowledge of the fate of Priam's Treasure. However, in September 1993 the treasure turned up at the [[Pushkin Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolstikov, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/8567721.html?dids=8567721&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS&amp;date=Sep+6%2C+1993&amp;author=Atkinson%2C+Rick&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C1&amp;desc=Trojan+treasure+unlocks+art+war | title=Trojan treasure unlocks art war | date=September 6, 1993 | first=Rick | last=Atkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia keeps what the West terms the [[looted art]] as compensation for the destruction of Russian cities and looting of Russian museums by [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]]. A 1998 Russian law, the [[Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation]], legalizes the looting in Germany as compensation and prevents Russian authorities from proceeding to restitutions.

== Authenticity of the treasure ==

There have always been doubts about the authenticity of the treasure. Within the last few decades these doubts have found fuller expression in articles and books.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 1987; Silberman, 1989; Traill, 1997.{{pages needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The treasures are actually a thousand years older than Homer's King Priam of Troy, who died about 1200 B.C.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">The '''Private Libraries Association''' (PLA) came into being in 1956 when 18-year-old Philip Ward wrote a letter to the [[The Observer|Observer]] inviting booklovers and [[book collectors]] to attend a meeting to discuss the setting up of an association whose aims would be:-
*To help readers in the organisation, cataloguing and fuller enjoyment of their personal collections;
*To cover every subject field by voluntary organised specialisation, and to record locations for loans.&lt;ref&gt;David Chambers, editor, ''A Modest Collection'' (Pinner, Middlesex, Private Libraries Association, 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-900002-67-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the membership has always included distinguished experts, it largely consists of ordinary collectors who share their enthusiasms and their knowledge. Since its foundation, the PLA has published a quarterly journal, originally called ''P.L.A. Quarterly'' but quickly renamed (from 1958) ''The Private Library''; since Spring 1968, the journal has appeared in a standard format of some 40-50 pages containing two or three illustrated articles. It also publishes a members’ book every year or two years. The articles and books are written by members and cover a wide range of subjects – classic fine printing and modern [[private press]]es, modern [[small press]]es and [[children's books]], [[illustrators]] and [[publishers]], famous books and the history of [[printing]], [[bookplates]] and [[bookbinding]], [[bookselling]], etc.. Details of the books and ''the Private Library'' can be found on the association’s website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plabooks.org/ The website of the Private Libraries Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedman]]. The organization presents contemporary art in New York City's public spaces through a series of highly visible artists' projects, new commissions, installations, and exhibitions that are emblematic of the organization's mission and innovative history.

==History==
Public Art Fund was founded in 1977 by [[Doris Freedman|Doris C. Freedman]] who served as the first Director of [[New York City]]'s [[New York City Department of Cultural Affairs|Department of Cultural Affairs]], the President of the [[Municipal Art Society]], and a tireless supporter of New York City's Percent for Art legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcla/html/panyc/percent-for-art.shtml|title=Percent for Art - NYC Department of Cultural Affairs|website=www.nyc.gov|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public Art Fund was born from the merger of two preexisting organizations, CityWalls, which was founded in 1966, and the Public Arts Council, founded in 197). Working with artists and museums,  Public Art Fund works to bring artwork outside of traditional spaces and into the public sphere. Since its inception, Public Art Fund has presented more than 500 artists' exhibitions and projects at sites throughout New York City's five boroughs as varied as streets, plazas, parks, buses, billboards, and even major landmarks including [[Times Square]], [[Rockefeller Center]], the [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]], [[Columbus Circle]], and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]]. [[Susan Freedman|Susan K. Freedman]] has served as president since 1986. Nicholas Baume joined Public Art Fund as Director and Chief Curator in 2009 and Jill Kraus has been Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/top200/jill-and-peter-kraus/|title=Jill and Peter Kraus -|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Programs ==
In addition to presenting works of art, Public Art Fund also hosts additional programs including Public Art Fund Talks. This series encompasses discussions and presentations from today's most influential artist. Another program, In the Public Realm,  is an open call which allows emerging artist to conceive and develop innovative ideas for public works. Public Art Fund also releases a semi annual magazine and exhibition catalog which provides its audience with a summary of the organizations activities and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/218/public-art-fund|title=Public Art Fund - NYC-ARTS|work=NYC-ARTS|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Tambo art in Yonezawa, Yamagata.jpg|thumb|Tambo art in Yonezawa, Yamagata]]
In 1993, the people of [[Inakadate, Aomori|Inakadate]], in [[Aomori Prefecture]], were looking for a way to revitalize their village. Archaeological exploration led to a realization that rice had been grown in the area for more than 2000 years.&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt; To honor this history, the villagers started a rice field behind the town hall. With the [[Paddy field|paddy]] as a canvas, the villagers cultivated and used four different types&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt; of heirloom and modern strains of rice to create a giant picture in the field. To allow viewing of the whole picture, a mock castle tower 22 meters high was erected at the village office.&lt;ref name="jtimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20070826x1.html|title=Homegrown art|last=Hani|first=Yoko|date=2007-08-26|publisher=The Japan Times|accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, more than 200,000 people visited the village to see the art.&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt;

Another observation tower was built looking down the Tambo art location 2 at [[roadside station|Michi no eki]] Inakadate nicknamed “Yayoi no sato”&lt;ref name=inaka/&gt; or a village of prehistoric [[Yayoi period]]. Both places charge admission fees, while visitors are encouraged to take bus serving both location 1 and 2 to avoid traffic jam.&lt;ref name=inaka/&gt; In August 2015, a video camera was installed for both locations and started live stream the art,&lt;ref name=livecam&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.inakadate-tanboart.net/news/2015/08/post-1.html |title= Tambo Art has its website now|language=ja| publisher= Inakadate, Aomori|date= 2015-08-05|accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were registered on [[Google Street View]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vill.inakadate.lg.jp/docs/2015090400027/|title=Tambo art is on Google Street View|publisher= Inakadate Village|language=ja|date= 2015-10-19 |accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A winter campaign since 2016 has been held on location 2 with instruction initially by snow artist Simon Beck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vill.inakadate.lg.jp/docs/2017113000016/|title= Winter tambo art 2018 will be held|date=2018-01-15|language=ja|publisher= Inakadate Village|accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first nine years, the farmers created a simple picture of Mount Iwaki&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; before going to more complex designs.

Following Inakadate's example, other villages such as [[Yonezawa, Yamagata|Yonezawa]] in Yamagata prefecture have started to create their own tambo art.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

== Advertising controversy ==
In 2008, it was planned to change the lower part of the field to include the logos of [[Japan Airlines]] and To-o Nippo, a local newspaper, for a reported 2 million yen to offset increased costs. The members of the local landowners' organization, along with the former mayor, protested, saying that the land would not be leased from the following year if the plan to display advertising logos was not abandoned. The village revitalization group voted by a narrow margin not to include the advertisements, and the seedlings that were planted were removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0704/TKY200807040155.html 田んぼアート、広告いらない 地権者抗議で苗抜き取り] – Asahi Shimbun, 4 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonippo.co.jp/news_too/nto2008/20080704072922.asp 田んぼアートの広告削除へ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707015517/http://www.toonippo.co.jp/news_too/nto2008/20080704072922.asp# |date=2008-07-07 }} – Too Nippo, 4 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainichi.jp/select/wadai/horidashi/news/20080705mog00m040033000c.html 田んぼアート もったいない? 企業広告絵柄を抜き取り]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – Mainichi Shimbun, 5 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Bernardino of Siena''''' is a 1603 work by [[El Greco]]. It is owned by the [[Museo del Prado]] but displayed at the [[El Greco Museum, Toledo|El Greco Museum]] in [[Toledo, Spain]].

Showing [[Bernardino of Siena]] in a Franciscan habit, holding a cane topped with the monogram [[Holy Name of Jesus|IHS]] and with a book under his left arm, it was commissioned for the university college of San Bernardino in Toledo. He was paid 3,000 [[Spanish real|reales]] for it in February 1603 and it was ready the following September. In the left background is a landscape of the city of Toledo, whilst in the right foreground are three mitres, each representing one of the bishoprics the saint declined ([[Bishop of Siena|Siena]], [[Bishop of Urbino|Urbino]] and [[Bishop of Ferrara|Ferrara]]).

A '''short story''' is a piece of [[prose]] [[fiction]] that typically can be read in one sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a "single effect" or mood, however there are many exceptions to this.

A dictionary definition is "an invented prose narrative shorter than a novel usually dealing with a few characters and aiming at unity of effect and often concentrating on the creation of mood rather than plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/short%20story|title=Definition of SHORT STORY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short story is a crafted form in its own right. Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components as in a [[novel]], but typically to a lesser degree. While the short story is largely distinct from the [[novel]] or [[novella]] (a shorter novel), authors generally draw from a common pool of [[literary technique]]s.

Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form. They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation.

Short stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognised in modern society for hundreds of years. The short form is, conceivably, more natural to us than longer forms. We are drawn to short stories as the well-told story, and as William Boyd, the award-winning British author and short story writer has said:&lt;blockquote&gt;"[short stories] seem to answer something very deep in our nature as if, for the duration of its telling, something special has been created, some essence of our experience extrapolated, some temporary sense has been made of our common, turbulent journey towards the grave and oblivion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/william-boyd-short-history-of-the-short-story|title=A short history of the short story|last=Boyd|first=William|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In terms of length, [[word count]] is typically anywhere from 1,000 to 4,000 for short stories, however some have 20,000 words and are still classed as short stories. Stories of fewer than 1,000 words are sometimes referred to as "short short stories", or "[[flash fiction]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/Portland/Arts/63088-Who-reads-short-shorts/|title=Who reads short shorts?|author=Deirdre Fulton|date=2008-06-11|publisher=thePhoneix.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821224948/http://thephoenix.com/Portland/Arts/63088-Who-reads-short-shorts|archivedate=2009-08-21|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-06-06|quote="each of their (less-than-1000-word) stories"|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Short stories today ==
[[:Category:21st-century short story writers|21st-century short story writers]] run into the thousands.

Global sales of short story fiction are very strong. In the UK sales jumped 45 per cent in 2017, driven by collections from international names such as Alice Munro, new writers to the genre such as Tom Hanks, and the revival of short story [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], such as those held by short fiction company, Pin Drop Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/short-story-collections-surge-half-value-and-third-volume-2017-709376|title=Sales of short story collections surge  {{!}} The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 690,000 short stories and anthologies were sold in the UK in 2017, generating £5.88 million, the genre’s highest sales since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/short-story-revival-cuts-novels-down-to-size-mj6xzz535|title=Short story revival cuts novels down to size|last=Media Correspondent|first=Matthew Moore|date=2018|work=The Times|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Short story salons ==
In 2012 [[Pin Drop Studio]] launched a short story salon held regularly in London and other major cities. Short story writers who have appeared at the salon to read their short stories to a live audience include [[Ben Okri]], [[Lionel Shriver]], [[Elizabeth Day]], [[A. L. Kennedy|A.L.

==Nobel Prize in Literature==
[[Alice Munro]], "master of the contemporary short story" according to her citation for the 2013 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], said she hopes the award would bring readership for the short story in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2013/munro-telephone.html|title=Telephone|author=Munro|date=2013|website=Nobel Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short story adaptations==
Short stories are sometimes adapted for radio, TV and film:
* [[Radio drama]]s, as on ''[[NBC Presents: Short Story]]'' (1951–52). A popular example of this is "[[The Hitch-Hiker (radio play)|The Hitch-Hiker]]", read by [[Orson Welles]].
* [[Short film]]s, often rewritten by other people, and even as feature-length films; such is the case of "[[Children of the Corn]]", "[[The Shawshank Redemption]]", "[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]", "[[Brokeback Mountain]]", "[[Who Goes There?]]", "[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]", "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", "[[The Body (2001 film)|The Body]]", "[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]", "[[The Lawnmower Man]]", "[[Hearts in Atlantis]]", and "[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]".
* [[Television special]]s, such as "[[12:01 PM]]" (1993 television movie), "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]" (October 11, 1963, on ''The Twilight Zone''), "[[The Lottery]]", and "[[Button, Button (The Twilight Zone)|Button, Button]]" (on ''The Twilight Zone'').

==Length==

Determining what exactly separates a short story from longer fictional formats is problematic. A&amp;nbsp;classic definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[essay]] "[[The Philosophy of Composition]]" (1846).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eldritchpress.org/nh/nhpoe1.html|title=Edgar Allan Poe: Essays and Reviews|last=Poe|first=Edgar Allan|publisher=Library of America|year=1984|pages=569–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpreting this standard nowadays is problematic, because the expected length of "one sitting" may now be briefer than it was in Poe's era.

Short stories have no set length. In terms of word count there is no official demarcation between an [[anecdote]], a short story, and a novel. Rather, the form's parameters are given by the rhetorical and practical context in which a given story is produced and considered, so that what constitutes a short story may differ between genres, countries, eras, and commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|publisher=Penguin|year=1999|edition=3rd|location=London|page=864}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the novel, the short story's predominant shape reflects the demands of the available markets for publication, and the evolution of the form seems closely tied to the evolution of the publishing industry and the submission guidelines of its constituent houses.&lt;ref name="Abrams1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=Glossary of Literary Terms|last=Abrams|first=M.H.|publisher=Harcourt Brace|year=1999|isbn=0-155-05452-X|edition=7th|location=Orlando, FL|pages=286–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a point of reference for the genre writer, the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] define short story length in the [[Nebula Award]]s for [[science fiction]] submission guidelines as having a word count of fewer than 7,500 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nebulas.sfwa.org/about-the-nebulas/nebula-rules|title=Complete Nebula Awards Rules Including the Ray Bradbury and Andre Norton Awards (Revised &amp; Updated)|publisher=sfwa.org|accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longer stories that cannot be called novels are sometimes considered "[[novellas]]" or novelettes and, like short stories, may be collected into the more marketable form of "collections", often containing previously unpublished stories. Sometimes, authors who do not have the time or money to write a novella or novel decide to write short stories instead, working out a deal with a [[E-book|popular website]] or [[magazine]] to publish them for profit.

==History==

Emerging from earlier oral [[storytelling]] traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization.

With the rise of the [[realism (arts)|realistic]] novel, the short story evolved in a parallel tradition, with some of its first distinctive examples in the tales of [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]. The character of the form developed particularly with authors known for their short fiction, either by choice (they wrote nothing else) or by critical regard, which acknowledged the focus and craft required in the short form. An example is [[Jorge Luis Borges]], who won American fame with "[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]", published in the August 1948 ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]''. Another example is [[O. Henry]] (author of "[[The Gift of the Magi (O. Henry story)|Gift of the Magi]]"), for whom the [[O. Henry Award]] is named. Other of his most popular, inventive and most often reprinted stories (among over 600) include: ''A Municipal Report'', ''An Unfinished Story'', ''A Blackjack Barginer'', ''A Lickpenny Lover'', ''Mammon and the Archer'', ''Two Thanksgiving Day Gentlemen'', ''The Last Leaf''. American examples include: [[Jack London]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[John Cheever]], and [[Raymond Carver]]. [[Science fiction]] short story with a special poetic touch was a genre developed with great popular success by [[Ray Bradbury]].
The genre of the short story was often neglected until the second half of the 19th century.

The evolution of printing technologies and periodical editions were among the factors contributing to the increasing importance of short story publications. Pioneering role in founding the rules of the genre in the [[Western canon]] include, among others, [[Rudyard Kipling]] (United Kingdom), [[Anton Chekhov]] (Russia), [[Guy de Maupassant]] (France), [[Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera]] (Mexico) and [[Rubén Darío]] (Nicaragua).

An important theoretical example for storytelling analysis is provided by Walter Benjamin in his illuminated essay ''The Storyteller'' where he argues about the decline of storytelling art and the incommunicability of experiences in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Storyteller|title="The Storyteller" Commentary by Leo Hall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar Wilde's essay ''The Decay of Lying'' and Henry James's ''The Art of Fiction'' are also partly related with this subject.

=== Predecessors ===
Short stories date back to oral storytelling traditions which originally produced epics such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. Oral narratives were often told in the form of rhyming or [[rhythm]]ic [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], often including recurring sections or, in the case of Homer, ''[[Homeric epithet]]s''. Such stylistic devices often acted as [[mnemonic]]s for easier recall, rendition and adaptation of the story. Short sections of verse might focus on individual narratives that could be told at one sitting. The overall arc of the [[Narrative|tale]] would emerge only through the telling of multiple such sections.

The other ancient form of short story, the [[anecdote]], was popular under the [[Roman Empire]]. Anecdotes functioned as a sort of [[parable]], a brief realistic narrative that embodies a point. Many surviving Roman anecdotes were collected in the 13th or 14th century as the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]''. Anecdotes remained popular in Europe well into the 18th century, when the fictional anecdotal letters of Sir [[Roger de Coverley]] were published.

In Europe, the oral story-telling tradition began to develop into written stories in the early 14th century, most notably with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]''. Both of these books are composed of individual short stories (which range from farce or humorous anecdotes to well-crafted literary fictions) set within a larger narrative story (a [[frame story]]), although the frame-tale device was not adopted by all writers.  At the end of the 16th century, some of the most popular short stories in Europe were the darkly tragic "[[novella]]" of [[Matteo Bandello]] (especially in their French translation).

The mid 17th century in France saw the development of a refined short novel, the "nouvelle", by such authors as [[Madame de Lafayette]]. In the 1690s, traditional [[fairy tale]]s began to be published (one of the most famous collections was by [[Charles Perrault]]). The appearance of [[Antoine Galland]]'s first modern translation of the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'' (or ''Arabian Nights'') (from 1704; another translation appeared in 1710–12) would have an enormous influence on the 18th-century European short stories of [[Voltaire]], [[Diderot]] and others.

=== 1790–1850 ===
There are early examples of short stories published separately between 1790 and 1810, but the first true collections of short stories appeared between 1810 and 1830 in several countries around the same period.&lt;ref&gt;''Short Story'' in Jacob E. Safra e.a., ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th edition, Micropaedia volume 10, Chicago, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first short stories in the United Kingdom were [[gothic fiction|gothic tales]] like [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]]'s "remarkable narrative" "The Poisoner of Montremos" (1791).&lt;ref&gt;Internet Book List: Book Information: Oxford Book of Gothic Tales.&lt;/ref&gt; Great novelists like Sir [[Walter Scott]] and [[Charles Dickens]] also wrote some short stories.

One of the earliest short stories in the United States was [[Charles Brockden Brown]]'s "Somnambulism" from 1805. [[Washington Irving]] wrote mysterious tales including "[[Rip van Winkle]]" (1819) and "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" (1820). [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] published the first part of his ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]'' in 1837. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote his tales of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]]
and imagination between 1832 and 1849. Classic stories are "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]", "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]", "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]", "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]", and the first [[detective fiction|detective story]], "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]". In "[[The Philosophy of Composition]]" (1846) Poe argued that a literary work should be short enough for a reader to finish in one sitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/Guides7/philcomp.html |title=Poe's The Philosophy of Composition: a Study Guide |publisher=Cummingsstudyguides.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the first collection of short stories was by [[Heinrich von Kleist]] in 1810 and 1811. The [[Brothers Grimm]] published their [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|first volume of collected fairy tales]] in 1812. [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] followed with his own original [[fantasy]] tales, of which "[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]" (1816) is the most famous.

In France, [[Prosper Mérimée]] wrote ''Mateo Falcone'' in 1829.

=== 1850–1900 ===
In the latter half of the 19th century, the growth of print magazines and journals created a strong demand for short fiction of between 3,000 and 15,000 words.

In the United Kingdom, [[Thomas Hardy]] wrote dozens of short stories, including "[[The Three Strangers]]" (1883), "[[A Mere Interlude]]" (1885) and "[[Barbara of the House of Grebe]]" (1890). Rudyard Kipling published [[short story collection]]s for grown-ups, e.g. ''[[Plain Tales from the Hills]]'' (1888), as well as for children, e.g. ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894). In 1892 [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] brought the [[detective fiction|detective story]] to a new height with ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]''. [[H.G. Wells]] wrote his first [[science fiction]] stories in the 1880s. One of his best known is "[[The Country of the Blind]]" (1904).

In the United States, [[Herman Melville]] published his story collection ''[[The Piazza Tales]]'' in 1856.  "[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]" was the title story of [[Mark Twain]]'s first book one year later. In 1884, [[Brander Matthews]], the first American professor of dramatic literature, published ''The Philosophy of the Short-Story''. At that same year, Matthews was the first one to name the emerging genre "short story". Another theorist of [[narrative]] [[fiction]] was [[Henry James]]. James wrote a lot of short stories himself, including "[[The Real Thing (story)|The Real Thing]]" (1892), "Maud-Evelyn" and ''[[The Beast in the Jungle]]'' (1903). In the 1890s [[Kate Chopin]] published short stories in several magazines.

The most prolific French author of short stories was Guy de Maupassant. Stories like "''[[Boule de Suif]]''" ("Ball of Fat", 1880) and "''L'Inutile Beauté''" ("The Useless Beauty", 1890) are good examples of French [[Literary realism|realism]].

In Russia, [[Ivan Turgenev]] gained recognition with his story collection ''[[A Sportsman's Sketches]]''. [[Nikolai Leskov]] created his first short stories in the 1860s. Late in his life [[Fyodor Dostoyevski]] wrote "[[A Gentle Creature|The Meek One]]" (1876) and "[[The Dream of a Ridiculous Man]]" (1877), two stories with great psychological and philosophical depth. [[Leo Tolstoy]] handled ethical questions in his short stories, for example in "[[Ivan the Fool (story)|Ivan the Fool]]" (1885), "[[How Much Land Does a Man Need?]]" (1886) and "[[Alyosha the Pot]]" (1905). The greatest specialist of the Russian short story, however, was Anton Chekhov. Classic examples of his realistic prose are "[[The Bet (short story)|The Bet]]" (1889), "Ward No. 6" (1892), and "[[The Lady with the Dog]]" (1899). [[Maxim Gorky]]'s best known short story is "[[Twenty-six Men and a Girl]]" (1899).

The prolific Indian author of short stories [[Munshi Premchand]], pioneered the genre in the [[Hindustani language]], writing a substantial body of short stories and novels in a style characterized by realism and an unsentimental and authentic introspection into the complexities of Indian society. [[Premchand]]'s work, including his over 200 short stories (such as the story "Lottery") and his novel [[Godaan]] remain substantial works.

A master of the short story, the Urdu language writer [[Saadat Hasan Manto]], is revered for his exceptional depth, irony and sardonic humour. The author of some 250 short stories, radio plays, essays, reminiscences and a novel, Manto is widely admired for his analyses of violence, bigotry, prejudice and the relationships between reason and unreason. Combining realism with surrealism and irony, Manto's works such as the celebrated short story [[Toba Tek Singh]] are aesthetic masterpieces which continue to give profound insight into the nature of human loss, violence and devastation.

In India, [[Rabindranath Tagore]] published short stories, on the lives of the poor and oppressed such as peasants, women and villagers under colonial misrule and exploitation.

In Poland, [[Bolesław Prus]] was the most important author of short stories. In 1888 he wrote "[[A Legend of Old Egypt]]".

[[Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis|Machado de Assis]], one of the majors novelist from Brazil was the most important short story writer from his country at the time, under influences (among others) of [[Xavier de Maistre]], [[Lawrence Sterne]], [[Guy de Maupassant]]. In the end of the 19th century the writer [[João do Rio]] became popular by short stories about the [[bohemianism]]. Writing about the former slaves, and very ironical about [[nationalism]], [[Lima Barreto]] died almost forgotten, but became very popular in the 20th century.

In Portuguese literature, the major names of the time are [[Almeida Garrett]] and the [[historian]] and novelist [[Alexandre Herculano]]. Still influential, [[Eça de Queiroz]] produced some short stories with a style influenced by [[Émile Zola]], [[Balzac]] and [[Dickens]].

=== 1900–1945 ===
In the United Kingdom, periodicals like ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' and ''[[Story-Teller]]'' contributed to the popularity of the short story. Hector Hugh Munro (1870–1916), also known by his pen name of [[Saki]], wrote [[satire|satirical]] short stories about [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] England. [[W. Somerset Maugham]], who wrote over a hundred short stories, was one of the most popular authors of his time. [[P.G. Wodehouse]] published his first collection of comical stories about valet [[Jeeves]] in 1917. Many [[detective fiction|detective stories]] were written by [[G.K. Chesterton]], [[Agatha Christie]] and [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]. Short stories by [[Virginia Woolf]] are "[[Kew Gardens (short story)|Kew Gardens]]" (1919) and "Solid Objects," about a politician with mental problems. [[Graham Greene]] wrote his [[Twenty-One Stories]] between 1929 and 1954. A specialist of the short story was [[V.S. Pritchett]], whose first collection appeared in 1932. [[Arthur C. Clarke]] published his first [[science fiction]] story, "[[Travel by Wire!]]" in 1937. [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Muriel Spark]] and [[L.P. Hartley]] were other popular British storytellers whose career started in this period.

In Ireland, [[James Joyce]] published his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' in 1914. These stories, written in a more accessible style than his later novels, are based on careful observation of the inhabitants of his birth city.

In the first half of the 20th century, a number of high-profile American magazines such as ''The [[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner's]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' published short stories in each issue. The demand for quality short stories was so great and the money paid for such so well that F. Scott Fitzgerald repeatedly turned to short-story (as Matthews preferred to write it) writing to pay his numerous debts. His first collection ''[[Flappers and Philosophers]]'' appeared in book form in 1920. William Faulkner wrote over one hundred short stories. ''[[Go Down, Moses (book)|Go Down, Moses]]'', a collection of seven stories, appeared in 1941. Ernest Hemingway's concise writing style was perfectly fit for shorter fiction. Stories like "[[A Clean, Well-Lighted Place]]" (1926), "[[Hills Like White Elephants]]" (1927) and "[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (story)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]" (1936) are only a few pages long, but carefully crafted. [[Dorothy Parker]]'s bittersweet story "Big Blonde" debuted in 1929. A popular [[science fiction]] story is "[[Nightfall (Asimov short story and novel)|Nightfall]]" by [[Isaac Asimov]].

[[Katherine Mansfield]] from New Zealand wrote many short stories between 1912 and her death in 1923. "[[The Doll's House (short story)|The Doll's House]]" (1922) treats the topic of social inequity.

Two important authors of short stories in the [[German language]] were [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Franz Kafka]]. In 1922 the latter wrote "[[A Hunger Artist]]", about a man who [[Fasting|fasts]] for several days.

[[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]] (1892–1927) is called the Father of the Japanese short story.

In Brazil, the most famous modern short story writer is [[Mário de Andrade]]. At the time, [[São Paulo|Paulistan]] writer [[António de Alcantâra Machado]] became very popular from his collection of short stories titled, ''Brás, Bexiga e Barra Funda'' (1928), about several Italian neighborhoods, but now he is mostly read in just São Paulo. Also, novelist [[Graciliano Ramos]] and poet [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]] have significant short story works.

Portuguese writers like [[Mário de Sá-Carneiro]], [[Florbela Espanca]] and [[Fernando Pessoa]] wrote well-known short stories, although their major genre was poetry.

=== 1945 to modern day ===
The period following [[World War II]] saw a great flowering of literary short fiction in the United States. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' continued to publish the works of the form's leading mid-century practitioners, including [[Shirley Jackson]], whose story, "[[The Lottery]]", published in 1948, elicited the strongest response in the magazine's history to that time. Other frequent contributors during the last 1940s included [[John Cheever]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Jean Stafford]], and [[Eudora Welty]]. [[J.D. Salinger]]'s  ''Nine Stories'' (1953) experimented with point of view and voice, while [[Flannery O'Connor]]'s story "[[A Good Man is Hard to Find]]" (1955) reinvigorated the [[Southern Gothic]] style. Cultural and social identity played a considerable role in much of the short fiction of the 1960s. [[Philip Roth]] and [[Grace Paley]] cultivated distinctive Jewish-American voices. [[Tillie Olsen]]'s "[[I Stand Here Ironing]]" (1961) adopted a consciously feminist perspective. [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]]'s collection ''[[Going to Meet the Man]]'' (1965) told stories of African-American life. [[Frank O'Connor]]'s ''[[The Lonely Voice]]'', an exploration of the short story, appeared in 1963. [[Wallace Stegner]]'s short stories are primarily set in the American West. [[Stephen King]] published many short stories in men's magazines in the 1960s and after. The 1970s saw the rise of the postmodern short story in the works of [[Donald Barthelme]] and [[John Barth]]. Traditionalists including [[John Updike]] and [[Joyce Carol Oates]] maintained significant influence on the form. [[Minimalism]] gained widespread influence in the 1980s, most notably in the work of [[Raymond Carver]] and [[Ann Beattie]].

Canadian short story writers include [[Alice Munro]], [[Mavis Gallant]], and Lynn Coady.

In the United Kingdom, [[Daphne du Maurier]] wrote [[suspense]] stories like "[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]" (1952) and "[[Don't Look Now]]" (1971). [[Roald Dahl]] was the master of the twist-in-the-tale. Short story collections like ''Lamb to the Slaughter'' (1953) and ''[[Kiss Kiss (book)|Kiss Kiss]]'' (1960) illustrate his dark humour.

In Italy, [[Italo Calvino]] published the short story collection ''[[Marcovaldo]]'', about a poor man in a city, in 1963.

In Brazil, the short story became popular among female writers like [[Clarice Lispector]], [[Lygia Fagundes Telles]], [[Adélia Prado]], who wrote about their society from a feminine viewpoint, although the genre has great male writers like [[Dalton Trevisan]], [[Autran Dourado]] [[Moacyr Scliar]] and [[Carlos Heitor Cony]] too. Also, writing about poverty and the [[favela]]s, [[João Antonio]] became a well known writer. Other post-modern short fiction authors include writers [[Hilda Hilst]] and [[Caio Fernando Abreu]]. Detective literature was led by [[Rubem Fonseca]]. It is also necessary to mention [[João Guimarães Rosa]], wrote short stories in the book ''Sagarana'' using a complex, experimental language based on tales of oral traditional.

Portuguese writers like [[Virgílo Ferreira]], [[Fernando Goncalves Namora]] and [[Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen]] are among the most influential short story writers from 20th-century Portuguese language literature. [[Manuel da Silva Ramos]] is one of the most well-known names of [[postmodernism]] in the country. [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[José Saramago]] published few short stories, but became popular from his novels.

The [[Angloa|Angolan]] writer [[José Luandino Vieira]] is one of the most well-known writers from his country and has several short stories. [[José Eduardo Agualusa]] is also increasingly read in Portuguese-speaking countries.

[[Republic of Mozambique|Mozambican]] [[Mia Couto]] is a widely known writer of post modern prose, and he is read even in non-Portuguese speaking countries. Other Mozambican writers such as [[Suleiman Cassamo]], [[Paulina Chiziane]] and [[Eduardo White]] are gaining popularity with Portuguese-speakers too.

The [[Argentine]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] is one of the most famous writers of short stories in the [[Spanish language]]. "[[The Library of Babel]]" (1941) and "[[The Aleph (short story)|The Aleph]]" (1945) handle difficult subjects like [[infinity]]. Two of the most representative writers of the [[Magical realism]] genre are also widely known Argentinian short story writers: [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]] and [[Julio Cortázar]].

The [[Uruguay]]an writer [[Juan Carlos Onetti]] is known as one of the most important magical realist writer from Latin America.

In [[Colombia]], the [[Nobel prize]] laureate author [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]] is the main novelist and short story writer, known by his magical realist stories and his defense of the [[Communist Party]] in his country.

The [[Peruvian]] writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], also a [[Nobel prize]] winner, has significant short story works.

The [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Nobel Prize]]-winner Naguib Mafouz is the most well-known author from his country, but has only a few short stories.

Japanese world-known short story writers include [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] ([[Nobel prize]] winner of 1994), [[Yukio Mishima]] and [[Haruki Murakami]].

Multi-awarded [[Philippine]] writer [[Peter Solis Nery]] is one of the most famous writers of short stories in [[Hiligaynon language]]. His stories "Lirio" (1998), "Candido" (2007), "Donato Bugtot" (2011), and "Si Padre Olan kag ang Dios" (2013) are all gold prize winners at the [[Palanca Awards]] of [[Philippine Literature]].

==Characteristics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
As a concentrated, concise form of narrative and descriptive prose fiction, the short story has been theorized through the traditional elements of [[dramatic structure]]: '''exposition''' (the introduction of setting, situation and main characters), '''complication''' (the event that introduces the conflict), [[rising action]], '''crisis''' (the decisive moment for the protagonist and his commitment to a course of action), '''climax''' (the point of highest interest in terms of the conflict and the point with the most action) and '''resolution''' (the point when the conflict is resolved). Because of their length, short stories may or may not follow this pattern. For example, modern short stories only occasionally have an exposition, more typically beginning in the middle of the action (''[[in medias res]]''). As with longer stories, plots of short stories also have a climax, crisis, or turning point. However, the endings of many short stories are abrupt and open and may or may not have a moral or practical lesson. As with any art form, the exact characteristics of a short story will vary by creator.

'''''Spiral Jetty''''' is an [[land art|earthwork]] sculpture constructed in April 1970 that is considered to be the most important work of American sculptor [[Robert Smithson]]. Smithson documented the construction of the sculpture in a 32-minute color film also titled ''Spiral Jetty''.

Built on the northeastern shore of the [[Great Salt Lake]] near Rozel Point in [[Utah]] entirely of mud, salt crystals, and [[basalt]] rocks, ''Spiral Jetty'' forms a {{convert|1500|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} counterclockwise coil jutting from the shore of the lake.

In 1999, the artwork was donated to [[Dia Art Foundation]]. Since its initial construction, those interested in its fate have dealt with questions of proposed changes in land use in the area surrounding the sculpture.

==Description==
The sculpture is built of mud, precipitated salt crystals, and [[basalt]] rocks. The sculpture forms a {{convert|1500|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} counterclockwise coil jutting from the shore of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertsmithson.com/earthworks/spiral_jetty.htm|title=Spiral Jetty|work=robertsmithson.com|publisher=James Cohan Gallery|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is sometimes visible and sometimes submerged, depending upon the water level of the Great Salt Lake.

==Construction==
[[Image:Spiraljetty.jpg|thumb|right|Person standing in the middle of ''Spiral Jetty'', viewed from the shore]]
Smithson reportedly chose the Rozel Point site based on the blood-red color of the water and its connection with the [[primordial sea]]. The red hue of the water is due to the presence of salt-tolerant [[bacteria]] and [[algae]] that thrive in the extreme 27 percent [[salinity]] of the lake's north arm, which was isolated from freshwater sources by the building of [[Great Salt Lake#Causeway|a causeway]] by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] in 1959.

Smithson was reportedly attracted to the Rozel Point site because of the stark anti-pastoral beauty and industrial remnants from nearby [[Golden Spike National Historic Site]], as well as an old pier and a few unused oil rigs.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kimmelman|first=Michael|work=nytimes.com|title=Out of the Deep|date=13 October 2002|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/13/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-10-13-02-phenomenon-out-of-the-deep.html|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While observing the construction of the piece from a helicopter, Smithson reportedly remarked "et in [[Utah]] ego" as a counterpoint to the pastoral [[Baroque]] painting ''[[et in Arcadia ego]]'' by [[Nicolas Poussin]].&lt;ref name=writings&gt;{{cite book|last=Smithson|first=Robert|editor-last=Holt|editor-first=Nancy|title=The Writings of Robert Smithson: Essays with Illustrations|location=New York NY|publisher=New York University Press|year=1979|isbn=9780814733943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To move the rock into the lake, Smithson hired Bob Phillips of nearby [[Ogden, Utah]], who used two dump trucks, a large tractor, and a [[Loader (equipment)|front end loader]] to haul the 6,650 tons of rock and earth into the lake. It is reported that Smithson had a difficult time convincing a contractor to accept the unusual proposal. Spiral Jetty was the first of his pieces to require the acquisition of land rights and earthmoving equipment.&lt;ref name=AAA-finding-aid&gt;{{cite web|title=A Finding Aid to the Robert Smithson and Nancy Holt papers|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/robert-smithson-and-nancy-holt-papers-7105/more|publisher=Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began work on the jetty in April 1970. The work was actually constructed twice; the first time requiring six days. After contemplating the result for two days, Smithson called the crew back and had the shape altered to its present configuration, an effort requiring moving 7,000 tons of basalt rock during an additional three days.&lt;ref name=trib/&gt;

==Construction contractor==
Robert "Bob" Phillips (5 August 1939 – 11 April 2016) worked for 40 years in construction, including positions as a bid estimator for Utah contracting companies Jack B. Parsons Construction, and Whitaker Construction. He often told people that his best-known construction job was “the only thing I ever built that ... was to look at and had no purpose.”

Phillips was an expert at construction materials and techniques and was proficient in projecting the cost and effort required for a projected job.

Phillips was uneasy about using earth-moving equipment in the muck around Rozel Point, where Smithson wanted to create the jetty. “It’s tricky working out on that lake,” Phillips said. “There’s lots of backhoes buried out there.” Smithson, in hip-wader boots, was in full command on the site. “When we got out there, he just took over,” Phillips said. “I don’t think he had done any geology work or anything on it. He just had in his mind what it should look like.… He just had the eye for it. I assume it was the artist in him.”

Smithson actually had Phillips’ crew build the jetty twice. The first took six days of work, using heavy equipment, but two days later, Smithson had Phillips’ team redo it, to create today's spiral shape.

Phillips said Smithson liked to use words like “entropy” to describe the interaction of the basalt and the lake.

Robert Phillips was born in [[Spanish Fork, Utah]] and grew up in [[Cache Valley]].  He married Judy Crocket in January 1961. They had four children. He earned a degree in entomology from [[Utah State University]]. He died of cancer in Ogden.&lt;ref name=trib&gt;Sean P. Means, [http://saltlaketribune.ut.newsmemory.com/ ''Contractor brought Spiral Jetty to life''], [[Salt Lake Tribune]], 19 April 2016, p. A11 {{registration|yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
The sculpture was financed in part by a $9,000 [[United States dollar|USD]] grant from the [[Virginia Dwan]] Gallery of [[New York City|New York]].

In 1999, through the generosity of the artist Nancy Holt, Smithson’s wife, and the Estate of Robert Smithson, ''Spiral Jetty'' was donated to Dia Art Foundation. As owner and custodian of ''Spiral Jetty'', Dia Art Foundation maintains the lease of Utah sovereign lands in Great Salt Lake upon which the artwork is sited, and is responsible for the stewardship of this iconic earthwork.

Smithson died in a helicopter crash in [[Texas]] three years after finishing the jetty.&lt;ref name="pagel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/gosp/tour/pagel.html|title=The Immobile Cyclone: Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty|last=Pagel|first=Angelika|publisher=National Park Service|work=nps.gov|accessdate=6 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725201046/http://www.nps.gov/gosp/tour/pagel.html|archivedate=25 July 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
At the time Dia acquired ''Spiral Jetty'', the work was fully submerged in the lake. Beginning in the early 2000s, however, sustained drought in Utah caused water levels to recede, and ''Spiral Jetty'' became visible for the first prolonged period in its history. As a result, the prominence of ''Spiral Jetty'' has risen dramatically over the past decade, increasing both the visitorship to the site and the public’s interest in the artwork, at the local, national, and international levels.

Dia is committed to maintaining a photographic record of the work and documenting changes to the piece over time. Dia collaborates with two organizations in Utah, the Great Salt Lake Institute at Westminster College (GSLI) and the Utah Museum of Fine Arts (UMFA) at the University of Utah, who have been deeply involved in the advocacy of ''Spiral Jetty'' over the years.

The issue of preservation has been complicated by ambiguous statements by Smithson, who expressed an admiration for [[entropy]] in that he intended his works to mimic earthly attributes in that they remain in a state of arrested disruption and not be kept from destruction.&lt;ref name="trib" /&gt;

In 2008 plans were announced for exploratory oil drilling approximately five miles from the jetty.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Randy. The New York Times. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/arts/06arts-ARTISTSRALLY_BRF.html "Artists Rally for Spiral Jetty in Utah"] Feb 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This was met with strong resistance from artists, and the state of Utah received more than 3,000 e-mails about the plan, most opposing the drilling.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kirk. The New York Times, 27 March 2008.

In 1970 during the construction of the jetty, Robert Smithson wrote and directed a 32-minute color film, ''Spiral Jetty''.&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertsmithson.com/films/txt/spiral.html|title=Spiral Jetty, 1970 Film by Robert Smithson|work=robertsmithson.com|publisher=James Cohan Gallery|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot by Smithson and his wife [[Nancy Holt]], and funded by Virginia Dwan and Douglas Christmas.

The film documented the construction process and also formed an ancillary artwork.  Smithson combines his interest in geology, paleontology, astronomy, mythology and cinema, stating that he had an interest in documenting "the earth's history".&lt;ref name="Jetty109"/&gt; In conjunction with filmed sequences of the jetty, Smithson incorporates footage of dinosaurs in a natural history museum and the ripped pages from a history text. During this scene, Smithson refers to the institutions of history: "the earth's history seems at times like a story recorded in a book, each page of which is torn into small pieces. Many of the pages and some of the pieces of each page are missing".&lt;ref name=film/&gt; Smithson's narrative supports an alternative view of historical discourse and the art object's placement or production outside of the museum institution. His writings also indicate that the helicopter film sequences over the jetty were a method of "recapitulating the scale of the jetty".&lt;ref name="Jetty109"/&gt; By visually disorienting the viewer, Smithson is able to negate a time and place for the materiality of the artwork or create what he calls a "cosmic rupture".&lt;ref name="Jetty109"&gt;Smithson, Robert. ''The Spiral Jetty'', 1970, published in Robert Smithson: The Collected Writings, edited by Nancy Holt, New York University Press, pp. 109-113&lt;/ref&gt; Through this state, the viewer is meant to be unable to categorize or classify the site, and will be left in a state free from the dialect of history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15178">'''Stichomythia''' (Greek: Στιχομυθία) is a technique in [[verse drama]] in which sequences of single alternating lines, or half-lines (hemistichomythia&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;[http://roberthogan.net/books/antilabe-rebuilt.pdf], Antilabe Rebuilt by Robert Hogan.&lt;/ref&gt;) or two-line speeches (distichomythia&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EwEWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Die stichomythie in der griechischen tragödie und komödie:
ihre anwendung und ihr ursprung by Adolf Gross (German).&lt;/ref&gt;) are given to alternating [[Character (arts)|characters]]. It typically features repetition and [[antithesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Lesley, ed. | title = New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 3056 | isbn = 0-19-861271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated in the [[theatre of Ancient Greece]], though many dramatists since have used the technique. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] it derives from the Greek ''stikhos'' ("row, line of verse") + ''muthos'' ("speech, talk").&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford"&gt;Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th Edition Revised&lt;/ref&gt;

Stichomythia is particularly well suited to sections of [[Dialogue (fiction)|dramatic dialogue]] where two characters are in violent dispute. The rhythmic intensity of the alternating lines combined with quick, biting ripostes in the dialogue can create a powerful effect.

==In Ancient Greek drama==
Stichomythia originated in Greek drama.&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford" /&gt; Adolf Gross concludes that stichomythia developed from choral response.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; J. Leonard Hancock differs in this regard, not finding overwhelming evidence for any particular origin theory, but admitting that the role of musical symmetry must have been significant. Instead he finds that the trends, within Ancient Greek aesthetics, toward agonistic expression, subtly in language, and love of symmetry, helped to give rise to stichomythia as a popular dialogue device.&lt;ref name="Hancock"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1zkMAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:bwNarlyOkSgC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MgIQT8LiNobqtgfDn9T5AQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=editions%3AbwNarlyOkSgC&amp;f=false], Studies in stichomythia by J. Leonard Hancock&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Seneca==
Senecan stichomythia, while ultimately derived from Athenian stichomythia (as Roman theatre is derived from Greek theatre generally&lt;ref name="usu.edu"&gt;[http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/ClasDram/chapters/131romtheatre.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;) differs in several respects. First, Seneca uses the technique less than all but the earliest extant pieces of classical Greek tragedy. Secondly, the stichomythic form found in Seneca is less rigid. Finally, and most substantially, Seneca's tragedies are much more prone to revolve around literary quibbles, even leaving aside the plot of the play for entire sections while the characters engage in an essentially linguistic tangent.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==In more recent theatre==
Renaissance Italian and French drama developed in many respects as an imitation of the classic drama of the Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref name="selu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/cfrederic/TheatreHistoryThruRenaissance.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Stichomythic elements, however, were often absent. Where they did occur, they tended to follow the lead of Seneca in using “catchwords” as launching points for each subsequent line.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

Modern theatre rarely uses verse,&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2011/nov/11/plays-verse-missing-stage | work=The Guardian | first=Raymond | last=Blankenhorn | title=Plays in verse were all the rage, but why are they missing from the stage? | date=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; so any construct that depends on verse, such as stichomythia, is also rare. Where a form of stichomythia has been used, the characters involved are typically building subsequent lines on the ideas or metaphors of previous lines, rather than words.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==General trends==
In terms of character relationships, stichomythia can represent interactions as mundane as question-and-answer exchanges, or as tense as heated rapid-fire arguments.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; While the equal line lengths can create a sense of equality of voice between the characters, stichomythia can also feature one character silencing another with a vociferous rebuff, especially where one character's line interrupts the other's.&lt;ref name="Hogan" /&gt;

In terms of how stichomythia moves forward as a section of dialogue, the Ancient Greeks tended to favor subtle flavorings and reflavorings of grammatical particles, whereas Senecan (and by extension Renaissance) stichomythic passages often turned on verbal minutiae or “catchwords”. Modern theatre, on the other hand, uses the technique in such a manner that the characters use each line to add depth to a shared idea or metaphor.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==Examples==

===Sophocles===
A short example from [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|R. C. Jebb]]'s translation of ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'': the scene is an argument between [[Ismene]] and her sister [[Antigone]].
For further examples from ''Antigone'', consult the text at the Internet Classics Archive [http://classics.mit.edu/Sophocles/antigone.html].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ISMENE:  And what life is dear to me, bereft of thee? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Ask Creon; all thy care is for him. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Why vex me thus, when it avails thee nought? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Indeed, if I mock, 'tis with pain that I mock thee. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Tell me,—how can I serve thee, even now? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Save thyself: I grudge not thy escape. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Ah, woe is me! And shall I have no share in thy fate? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Thy choice was to live; mine, to die. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   At least thy choice was not made without my protest. &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: One world approved thy wisdom; another, mine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Shakespeare ===
''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', Act I, scene ii.  [[Richard III of England|Richard Plantagenet]], [[Earl of Gloucester]] (later [[Richard III of England]]) threatens to kill himself unless Lady Anne, widow of Prince Edward (of Lancaster), agrees to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 31)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LADY ANNE:  I would I knew thy heart.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  'Tis figured in my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   I fear me both are false.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Then never man was true.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   Well, well, put up your sword.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Say, then, my peace is made.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   That shall you know hereafter.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  But shall I live in hope?&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   All men, I hope, live so.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Vouchsafe to wear this ring.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   To take is not to give. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:     Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Hamlet]]'', Act III, Scene iv (the Closet scene), [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] is confronted by his mother, the queen, about the play (III, ii) which Hamlet rigged to expose his murderous step-uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 121)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
QUEEN:   Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Mother, you have my father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
QUEEN:   Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "The Merchant of Venice", Shylock and Bassanio enter into an argument using stichomythia at 4.1.65-9, which "catches the dramatic tension of a quasi-forensic interrogation":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
SHYLOCK:  I am not bound to please thee with my answers.&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Do all men kill the things they do not love?&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  Hates any man the thing he would not kill?&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Every offence is not a hate at first.&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further intensification is often achieved by [[antilabe]], in which a single verse line is distributed on alternating speakers.

===Corneille===
An exchange  in ''[[Le Cid]]'' (1.3.215–226), by [[Pierre Corneille]], has been called "an excellent instance of Corneille's skilful handling of 'stichomythia'".&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1918, p. 103)&lt;/ref&gt;  Don Diègue (an old man, the hero's father) has been appointed the prince's tutor, a post that the Count (''le Comte'') wanted.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LE COMTE: Ce que je méritois, vous avez emporté.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Que l'a gagné sur vous l'avoit mieux merité.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Qui peut mieux l'exercer en est bien le plus digne.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: En être refusė n'est pas un bon signe.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Vous l'avez eu par brigue, ėtant vieux courtisan.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: L'éclat de mes hauts faits fut mon seul partisan.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Parlons-en mieux, le Roi fait honneur a votre âge.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Le Roi, quand il en fait, le mesure au courage.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Et par là cet honneur n'était dû qu'à mon bras.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Qui n'a pu l'obtenir ne le méritoit pas.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Ne le méritoit pas!  Moi?&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE:                      Vous.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE:                                  Ton impudence,&lt;br&gt;
Téméraire viellard, aura son récompense.  [''Il lui donne un soufflet''
&lt;ref&gt;
COUNT: What I deserved, you carried away.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: He who won it over you had deserved it more.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: He who can exercise it best is the most worthy.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: To be refused it is not a good sign.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: You had it by intrigue, being an old courtier.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: The luster of my high deeds was my only supporter.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: Let's speak better, the King does honor to your age.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: The King, when he does it, measures it according to courage.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: And by that the honor was owed to my arm only.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: He who could not obtain it did not deserve it.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: Did not deserve it!  I?&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO:                      You.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT:                                  Your impudence,&lt;br&gt;
Rash old man, will have its reward.  [''He slaps him'']
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|translation}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Musical drama===
In the scene in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', [[libretto]] by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], where Susanna learns that Marcellina is Figaro's mother, she repeats her disbelief (''Sua madre?'', that is, "his mother?") to each character and is reassured in the same words.  A critic has called that "the merriest and most congenial form imaginable" of stichomythia.&lt;ref&gt;Knepler (1997, p. 192)&lt;/ref&gt;  For another example from opera, the following passage from the libretto by [[Andrea Maffei]] for [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[I masnadieri]]'' has been called "musical stichomythia",&lt;ref&gt;Budden (1992, p. 330)&lt;/ref&gt; though it does not contain repetition or antithesis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
AMALIA: Qual mare, qual terra da me t'ha diviso?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Deh! cessa, infelice, l'inchiesta crudel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Mendaci novelle ti dissero ucciso.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Beato se chiuso m'avesse l'avel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Tu pure, o mio Carlo, provasti gli affanni?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Li possa il tuo core per sempre ignorar!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Anch'io, derelitta, ti piansi lung'anni.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: E un angelo osava per me lagrimar?&lt;ref&gt;AMALIA: Which sea, which land divided you from me?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Oh, unhappy woman, end the cruel inquiry!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: False news said you were dead.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Happy were I if shut in the tomb!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Did you, O my Carlo, feel the torment?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: May your heart never know it!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: I too, lonely, cried for you many years.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Then for me an angel dared weep?
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|translation}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples from [[Musical theatre|musical]]s are "I Remember it Well" (lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], first version in the Broadway musical ''[[Love Life (musical)|Love Life]]'', second in the film ''[[Gigi]]'') and "[[Anything You Can Do (song)|Anything You Can Do]]" (by [[Irving Berlin]], from ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'').  Another is from "The Last Supper" in ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. When Judas says Jesus knows who will betray him, a passage of stichomythia (with a two-line interruption) follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus: Why don't you go do it?&lt;br&gt;
Judas: You want me to do it!&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: Hurry, they're waiting&lt;br&gt;
Judas: If you knew why I do it...&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: I don't care why you do it&lt;br&gt;
Judas: To think I admired you,&lt;br&gt;
for now I despise you&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: You liar—you Judas&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Film===
In the prose context of most film, stichomythia has been defined as a "witty exchange of one-liners" and associated with the [[film noir]] characters  Jeff Bailey in ''[[Out of the Past]]'', [[Sam Spade]], and [[Philip Marlowe]].&lt;ref&gt;Flory (2008, p. 93)&lt;/ref&gt; Another film-noir example is in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (dialog by [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Raymond Chandler]]). Walter Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson; she resists him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dietrichson: You were anxious to talk to [my husband] weren't you?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of getting over the idea,
      if you know what I mean.&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff, 45 miles an hour.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: How fast was I going officer?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: I'd say around 90.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I let you off with a warning this time?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose it doesn't take?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: That tears it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Suffer little children to come unto me''''' is a painting attributed to the Dutch painter [[Rembrandt]]. The subject of the portrait is the [[teaching of Jesus about little children]] and it is estimated that Rembrandt painted it in Leiden in the 1620s.&lt;ref name=Volkskrant&gt;[https://www.volkskrant.nl/cultuur-media/kunsthandelaar-jan-six-ontdekt-weer-een-nieuwe-rembrandt~b7ca0af1/ Art dealer Jan Six discovers another Rembrandt] in the Volkskrant, 14 september 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rembrandt Lempertz-1029-1174-Old-Masters-and-19th-Century-Netherlandish-School-mid-17th-century-Let-the-Little-Children-C 8e28048ba4.jpg|thumb|The painting as it looked in 2014 before restoration activities began]]
The painting was recently discovered by Dutch art dealer Jan Six. He is a direct descendant of [[Jan Six]], a 17th-century burgher who sat for one of Rembrandt’s most important paintings, ''[[Portrait of Jan Six]]''. He asked an invester to buy it at Lempertz auction for €1,525,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artkurio.com/blog/2014/05/21/rembrandt-discovery-at-auction Netherlandish School, "Let the Little Children Come to Me"], oil on canvas, 122 x 104 cm Sold for €1,525,000 at Lempertz, Lot 1174, on 17th of May 2014 Estimate: 15,000 - 18,000 Euro&lt;/ref&gt;

Six recently reattributed another painting to Rembrandt, ''[[Portrait of a Young Gentleman]]''. This painting, which he discovered earlier, is dated to the 1620s and grouped under the growing list of paintings in Rembrandt's oeuvre known as his "juvenalia". It was kept secret pending investigation and restoration and was meant to be announced and introduced to the public at the opening of a Rembrandt exhibition at the [[Museum De Lakenhal]] in Leiden, scheduled to open 1 November 2019, but rumors prevented insiders from keeping it secret.&lt;ref name=Volkskrant/&gt; The painting had previously been known and rejected by experts, though all were in agreement as to the large amount of overpainting and it was during removal of this overpaint that convincing details were revealed such as the color purple used for clothing. The subject and arrangement of figures was inspired by a 1619 work by [[Pieter Lastman]] (formerly in Frederiksborg, lost in 1859 fire) and later formed the inspiration for another work previously attributed to Rembrandt and now listed as circa 1652 by his pupil [[Nicolaes Maes]]:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The painting includes a selfportrait of the young Rembrandt, a portrait of his mother, and other motifs known through his history paintings:

'''''The Bowman''''' and '''''The Spearman''''' (also known collectively as '''''Equestrian Indians''''',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.grantparkconservancy.com/sculptures&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''''Indians'''''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/80.html|title=Art, Public|accessdate=2009-03-20|year=2005|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|author=Sokol, David M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two [[bronze]] [[Equestrian sculpture|equestrian]] [[sculpture]]s standing as gatekeepers in Congress Plaza, at the intersection of [[Congress Parkway]] and [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] in [[Chicago]]'s [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Illinois]]. The sculptures were made in [[Zagreb]] by [[Croats|Croatian]] sculptor [[Ivan Meštrović]] and installed at the entrance of the parkway in 1928. Funding was provided by the [[Benjamin F. Ferguson|Benjamin Ferguson]] Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB37362D33E53CF&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=C23BE832E46446E3AEC1CCAEBDEAF5AE|title=Public statues are lumberman's legacy to city|accessdate=2009-03-18|date=1991-08-09|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Hermann, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Each statue stands seventeen feet high and rests atop an eighteen-foot [[granite]] pedestal.&lt;ref name=karamanski2004 /&gt; When the area was first designed, the statues were intended to guard a grand staircase into the park. However, this staircase was removed when Congress Parkway was extended in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=koenig2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koenig|first1=Wendy|last2=Badowski|first2=Christine|title=The Bowman and the Spearman|url=http://chicagopublicart.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-bowman-and-spearman.html|website=Chicago Public Art|accessdate=26 September 2015|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in 2006  suggested that the lettering on the pedestals designed by architects [[Holabird &amp; Roche]] was executed by sculptor [[Rene Paul Chambellan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kvaran, Einar Einarsson ''Architectural Sculpture in America'', unpublished manuscript&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of placing large sculptures at the park entrance originated from famed [[urban planner]] [[Daniel Burnham|Daniel Burnham's]] [[Burnham Plan of Chicago|1909 ''Plan of Chicago'']]. Burnham, a man of vision and charisma, was a strong influence on how the lakefront appears today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wille|first1=Lois|title=Forever open, clear, and free : the struggle for Chicago's lakefront|date=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226898725|pages=82–98|edition=2nd ed., University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He imagined a vast parkland stretching from Michigan Avenue to the lakeshore filled with beautiful gardens, walkways, and public works of art. Burnham himself, however, planned for the two statues to be of “one Indian and one ‘[[Buffalo Bill]] like’ depiction of the conquering white pioneers"&lt;ref name=karamanski2004&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karamanski|first1=Theodore|title=Monuments to a Lost Nation|url=https://cdn.citl.illinois.edu/courses/aiiopcmpss/essays/chicagomem/chicagomem10.htm|website=American Indian Online Project|accessdate=26 September 2015|date=Spring 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; to symbolize both America’s Indian heritage and its struggle for expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bowman and The Spearman|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/bowman-and-spearman#date|website=Public Art Archive|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unusual aspect of the sculptures is that both figures are missing their respective weapons, the [[bow and arrow]] and the [[spear]]. The omitting of the weapons was intentional, as the artist preferred that they be “left to the imagination while attention is focused upon the bold lines of the musculature of both man and beast, as well as the linear patterns of the horses’ manes and tails and the figures’ [[headdress]]es.”&lt;ref name=koenig2013 /&gt; Despite the fact that the weapons never actually existed, many theories have existed over time as to their supposed whereabouts. Some believe that they were taken as part of an elaborate prank, while others are under the impression that their removal was a show of respect after the events of [[September 11, 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merevick|first1=Tony|title=Warrior statues missing weapons|url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/things-to-do/warrior-statues-missing-weapons|website=Timeout Chicago|accessdate=26 September 2015|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One author said of these works, "Meštrović's finest monumental sculptures are his Chicago ''Indians'' (1926–27), they are not too obviously stylized: the muscles on the horsemen are almost anatomically realistic... These statues show how much more important true sculptural feeling is than ideology, for Meštrović hardly knew anything about the ideals of the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and they certainly did not move him."&lt;ref&gt;Keckemet, Dusko. ‘’Ivan Mestrovic’’, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1976 unpaginated&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing a number of statues in Europe and other parts of the world, Meštrović returned to the United States and spent the remainder of his life as a celebrated professor first at [[Syracuse University]] and later at the [[University of Notre Dame]].

The project '''The Project Formerly Known as Kindle Forkbomb''' is a work done by the Swiss-Austrian-American duo known as [[Ubermorgen]]. The artists are known for their creative use of digital media, combined with other means such as performance and various offline medium to convey their ideas. The project is showcased on Ubermorgen's website "www.uuuuuuuntitled.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uuuuuuuntitled.com/index.html|title=ВИЛОКАЬОМЬА|website=uuuuuuuntitled.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Secondary Forkbomb.gif|thumb|right|Blueprint of Kindle Forkbomb]] --&gt;

==Project Overview==
The project's name: "The Project Formerly Known as Kindle Forkbomb" can be broken down to better understand the meaning behind the work. [[Fork bomb|Forkbomb]] is a term used in computing, describing an attack in which a [[computer]] process continuously self-replicates until the machine's resources are depleted or the system crashes.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kindle Forkbomb Print.jpg|thumb|right|Kindle Forkbomb in print form.]] --&gt;

==Process Outline==
The art project depicts a machine process that strips comments from [[YouTube]], then uses an algorithm to compile the comments and finally titling the work under video title and respective uploader to make a book. This book is then uploaded to the [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] Publishing service &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kdp.amazon.com/|title=Self Publishing - Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing|website=kdp.amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed on the Kindle Store. After, the machine monitors the books making sure that enough sales are made to keep them alive on the store. If they aren't thriving on the store the machine is directed to purchase copies, thus prolonging their shelf-life.

== Purpose ==
Using this process the artists' message and intent was to show how easily they could clog the store with their rapidly multiplying number of books (hence Kindle Forkbomb). This is an example of critique on the digital world and the problems it poses. While it was merely a demonstration, it makes it easier to visualize the world we live in.

[[File:Kindle Forkbomb Sculpture.jpg|thumb|Kindle Forkbomb set up as a sculpture.]]

==Artists' Remarks==
Ubermorgen describes the media created by this human-machine combination as the creation of a new genre of decentralized fiction writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kunsthalaarhus.dk/en/ubermorgen-the-project-formerly-known-as-kindle-forkbomb|title=UBERMORGEN - The Project Formerly Known As Kindle Forkbomb - Kunsthal Aarhus|website=kunsthalaarhus.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist group says that these books are a compressed form of our contemporary world, but they describe just a snapshot of it, frozen in time. This type of work is a form of art sometimes referred to as "uncreative" spurred by the famous writer [[Kenneth Goldsmith]]'s efforts in uncreative writing.

==Published Books==
Some examples of the works produced through this project:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uuuuuuuntitled.com/uuuuuuubooks.html|title=ВИЛОКАЬОМЬА|website=uuuuuuuntitled.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Show country begins They'' - Sosodni Riottto
* ''It.. cut "sang" missed grabbed can't'' - Jasmmmm Evieraa
* ''Marge think caresit not is page'' - Cptmole Kenslov
* ''You funny get car'' - Nrlnick Kencals

One thing to note is that the cover of all the books feature the uploader, then the video title and underneath everything is the text string ":(){ :|:&amp; };:" which is the Bash Shell version of a computer forkbomb. Following the reference link takes you to the website where you are aloud to read the full pdf version of the books.

== Similar Projects ==
One project similar to this is by [[Stephanie Barber]] an American artist that uses many forms of media for her art. The project that relates to Kindle Forkbomb is a book titled [[Night Moves (poetry collection)|''Night Moves'']]. This book is a grouping of YouTube comments from [[Bob Seger|Bob Seger's]] song [[Night Moves (song)|Night Moves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgOA24hAe60|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visionary art''' is [[art]] that purports to transcend the physical world and portray a wider vision of [[awareness]] including [[supernatural|spiritual]] or [[mystical]] [[Theme (visual arts)|theme]]s, or is based in such experiences.&lt;ref name="AlexGrey"&gt;[http://alexgrey.com/media/writing/essays/what-is-visionary-art/ What is Visionary Art? by Alex Grey]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alex Grey - COSM 4.jpg|thumb|[[The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors]] by [[Alex Grey]].]]

==History==
The [[Vienna School of Fantastic Realism]], first established in 1946, is considered to be an important technical and philosophical catalyst in its strong influence upon contemporary visionary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://academyofvisionaryart.com/information/visionary-art |title=Academy of Visionary Art |access-date=2014-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312142009/http://academyofvisionaryart.com/information/visionary-art |archive-date=2014-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://visionaryrevue.com/webtext/manifesto.contents.html ''Manifesto of Visionary Art'' by L. Caruana]&lt;/ref&gt; Its artists included [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]], [[Rudolf Hausner]] and [[Arik Brauer]] among others. Several artists who would later work in visionary art trained under Fuchs, including [[Mati Klarwein]], [[Robert Venosa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venosa.com/bio.html Robert Venosa biography]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Rubinov Jacobson]] and [[De Es Schwertberger]].

==Definition==
[[File:Laurence caruana in his Bastille studio.jpg|thumb|Visionary artist [[Laurence Caruana]] with visionary art paintings.]]
Visionary art often carries themes of spiritual, mystical or inner awareness.&lt;ref name=AlexGrey /&gt; Despite this broad definition, there does seem to be emerging some definition to what constitutes the contemporary visionary art 'scene' and which artists can be considered especially influential. [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Psychedelic art]] are also direct precursors to contemporary visionary art. Notable visionary artists count [[Hilma af Klint]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], [[William Blake]], [[Morris Graves]] (of the Pacific Northwest School of Visionary Art), [[Emil Bisttram]], and [[Gustave Moreau]] amongst their antecedents.

==Schools and organizations==
The [[Vienna School of Fantastic Realism]], which includes [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]] and [[Arik Brauer]], is also a strong influence on visionary culture. It may also be considered the European version, with the names being interchangeable.

The [[Society for the Art of Imagination]], founded by [[Brigid Marlin]] serves as an important portal for visionary art events. More recently, a new wave of visionary artists collaborate to function as modern [[artist collectives|cooperatives]] involved in self-publishing and promotion of visionary artists through the internet and via festivals such as [[Burning Man]] and [[Boom Festival]], and exhibition/ritual spaces such as [[Temple of Visions]], Tribe 13, Psychedelic Dream Temple, Synergenesis and the [[Interdimensional art|Interdimensional Art]] Movement.

'''''Wayne's World''''' is a 1992 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Penelope Spheeris]], produced by [[Lorne Michaels]], and written by [[Mike Myers]] and [[Bonnie and Terry Turner]]. It stars Myers in his feature film debut as Wayne Campbell and [[Dana Carvey]] as Garth Algar, a pair of rock fans who broadcast a [[public-access television|public-access television show]]. It also features [[Rob Lowe]], [[Tia Carrere]], [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Ed O'Neill]], [[Ione Skye]], [[Meat Loaf]], and [[Alice Cooper]].

''Wayne's World'' was released in the US on February 14, 1992. It was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and it remains the highest-grossing [[List of Saturday Night Live feature films|film based on ''Saturday Night Live'' skits]]. A sequel, ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'', was released on December 10, 1993.

==Plot==
In [[Aurora, Illinois]], rock fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar host a [[public-access television]] show, ''Wayne's World'', from Wayne's parents' basement. After they sell the rights to the show to television producer Benjamin Oliver for $10,000, they celebrate at a night club, where they avoid Wayne's troubled ex-girlfriend Stacy. Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band performing that night, Crucial Taunt, and impresses her with his [[Cantonese]]. He purchases a 1964 [[Fender Stratocaster]] electric guitar he has long coveted.

Benjamin attempts to steal Cassandra from Wayne by using his wealth and good looks. He distracts Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an [[Alice Cooper]] concert in Milwaukee, while offering to produce a [[music video]] for Crucial Taunt. At the concert, Wayne and Garth make the acquaintance of a bodyguard to music producer Frankie Sharp, head of Sharp Records.

While filming the revamped ''Wayne's World'' under Benjamin's oversight, Wayne and Garth find it difficult to adjust to the professional studio environment. Their contract obliges them to give a promotional interview to their [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]], Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of [[amusement arcade]]s. After Wayne publicly ridicules Vanderhoff, he is fired from the show, causing a rift in his friendship with Garth. Jealous of the attention Benjamin is giving Cassandra, Wayne attempts to prevent her from participating in the Crucial Taunt music video shoot. She breaks up with him, furious at his lack of trust.

Wayne and Garth reunite and hatch a plan to win Cassandra back by having Sharp hear Crucial Taunt play. While Garth and their friends infiltrate a satellite station with the aid of Benjamin's assistant, Wayne goes to Cassandra's video shoot, but embarrasses himself in an attempt to expose Benjamin's ulterior motive. As he leaves, Cassandra changes her mind about Benjamin. Wayne apologizes and they return to Aurora.

The ''Wayne's World'' crew hacks into Sharp's satellite television and broadcast the Crucial Taunt performance from Wayne's basement, where Sharp and Benjamin converge. Sharp declines to offer Crucial Taunt a record contract, Cassandra breaks up with Wayne and departs with Benjamin for a tropical resort, Stacy reveals that she is pregnant with Wayne's child, and a fire destroys Wayne's house.

Dissatisfied, Wayne and Garth turn to the film's audience and halt proceedings. They restart the scene and unmask Benjamin as "Old Man Withers" in a ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' parody ending. Still unsatisfied, they start again with a "mega happy ending" in which Cassandra signs a record contract and reunites with Wayne, Garth begins a relationship with a waitress, and Benjamin learns that money and good looks do not necessarily bring happiness.

==Production==
''Wayne's World'' was greenlit by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1991. It was the second [[List of Saturday Night Live feature films|film based on a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch]] following ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2017/02/02/mike-myers-couldnt-drive-during-waynes-world/ |title=Mike Myers couldn't drive during 'Wayne's World' |work=[[New York Post]] |date=2017-02-02 |accessdate=2017-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Lorne Michaels]] hired [[Penelope Spheeris]] to direct, who had directed several music [[documentary film|documentaries]]. Spheeris said, "I had been just struggling as a female director in this business for many years. I was 45 years old when I got that job. I just kept hanging in there. And ''Wayne's World'' happened, and it sort of flipped my life around."&lt;ref name="Vanity-Fair"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pirnia |first=Garin |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/wanyes-world-25th-anniversary-penelope-spheeris-interview |title=How Wayne's World Made—and Broke—Its Director's Career |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=2017-02-06 |accessdate=2017-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spheeris clashed with Myers during filming. She told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that Myers was "emotionally needy and got more difficult as the shoot went along. You should have heard him bitching when I was trying to do that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' scene: 'I can't move my neck like that! Why do we have to do this so many times? No one is going to laugh at that!'" She said she attempted to assuage Myers by having her daughter provide him snacks,&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2008/06/16/mike-myers-man-mystery/|title=Mike Myers: Man of Mystery|date=2008-06-16|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on one occasion he stormed off the set, upset that there was no margarine for his bagel.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; Myers and Spheeris argued over the [[final cut (film editing)|final cut]] of the film, causing Myers to prevent Spheeris from directing ''[[Wayne's World 2|Wayne' World 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brandon Kirby |agency= |title=Mike Myers, Dana Carvey Set Aside 'Wayne's World' Feud at Academy Screening |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/waynes-world-feud-mike-myers-445044 |quote=Carvey and Spheeris both notoriously fell out with Myers despite the 1992 film's huge success.

And Carvey felt Myers later stole his Dr. Evil impression for Austin Powers, which supposedly was based on Carvey's goof on Lorne Michaels. |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 11, 2013 |accessdate=2015-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an 84% "Certified Fresh" rating based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10, with the critical consensus stating, "An oddball comedy that revels in its silliness and memorable catchphrases, ''Wayne's World'' is also fondly regarded because of its endearing characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waynes_world/|title=Wayne's World|website=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 53 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/waynes-world |title=Wayne's World Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Roger Ebert]] said in his review: "I walked into ''Wayne's World'' expecting a lot of dumb, vulgar comedy, and I got plenty, but I also found what I didn't expect: a genuinely amusing, sometimes even intelligent, undercurrent." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/waynes-world-1992|title=Wayne's World Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1992) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=Rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Desson Howe]] wrote in the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' that making a movie out of such a "teeny sketch" is "better than you'd expect" but criticized the finale as "an attempt to lampoon movie endings" "and a despair-driven inability to end the movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/waynesworldpg13howe_a0aea2.htm|title=Wayne's World (PG-13)|last=Howe|first=Desson|website=Washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded in April 2009, after the merger of the [[William Morris Agency]] and the [[Endeavor Talent Agency|Endeavor Agency]].

The company is run by Co-CEOs [[Ari Emanuel]] and [[Patrick Whitesell]].

==History==

===Beginnings===
{{main|William Morris Agency|Endeavor Talent Agency}}
As the entertainment industry evolved, so did WMA, which soon expanded into television, film, literature and music representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisbord|first=Merrily|title=Our future selves : love, life, sex, and aging|year=1991|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-1556431456|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Endeavor Talent Agency launched in 1995, nearly 100 years after WMA, grew rapidly to include clients from every facet of the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Galloway | first = Stephen | title = Jeff Berg Speaks: Plans for New Agency, What Really Happened at ICM (Exclusive) | date = March 5, 2013 | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jeff-berg-new-agency-icm-426189?page=show}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, Endeavor was one of the fastest-growing [[Hollywood]] talent agencies, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' singling out its reputation for "quick thinking, ferocity and barely bridled ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cieply|first=Michael|title=Agents Replaying a Hollywood Drama|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/business/media/27agent.html?_r=3&amp;sq=endeavor&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all| work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

===WME Merger===
On April 27, 2009, WMA and the Endeavor Talent Agency announced that they were forming William Morris Endeavor, or WME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Littleton| first = Cynthia | title = WMA, Endeavor approve merger | date = April 27, 2009 | publisher = Variety | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002879}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Endeavor executives Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell were widely seen as the architects of the merger and quickly became the Co-CEOs of WME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-05-28/news/william-morris-it-39-s-a-takeover-not-a-merger |title=It's A Takeover, Not A Merger |work= [[LA Weekly]] |date=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Emanuel was quoted in a ''[[Financial Times]]'' profile about the company, saying "We built a culture where people are rewarded for taking risks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrahan|first=Matthew|title=Rewriting the Hollywood script|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c7fd8106-1f6f-11e1-ab49-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1tY1bIPHc| work = [[Financial Times]] |accessdate= April 30, 2012|date=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel and Whitesell have implemented several leadership strategies to boost the productivity of their agents, most notably, the "Farmhouse" training program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|title=Hi, It's Ari @#$%ing Emanuel, and I plan to shake up Hollywood|url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/23/leadership/ari-emanuel-agent.pr.fortune/index.html|publisher=Fortune|accessdate=May 23, 2013|date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the merger, WME moved its headquarters into the offices of Endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finke | first = Nikki | title = WME Will Stay In Endeavor Headquarters Instead Of Moving To New Morris Building | date = October 9, 2009 | publisher = Deadline | url = http://www.deadline.com/2009/10/wme-not-moving-to-new-building-instead-will-stay-in-endeavor-headquarters/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company now takes up several floors at 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in the heart of Beverly Hills. Additionally, WME has offices in New York, London, Miami, and [[Nashville]].

=== Expansion===
Since the merger, WME has grown to include several subsidiary companies and expanded divisions. ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' named co-CEOs Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell to their 2010 "Businessperson of the Year" list, acknowledging their corporate growth strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=P.N.|title=Businessperson of the Year|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/news/companies/1011/gallery.business_person_year.fortune/50.html|publisher=Fortune|accessdate= April 30, 2012|date=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel had previously been recognized as a 21st-century "super agent" by both ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'', as well as an ''[[Advertising Age]]'' "Influencer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sabbagh | first = Dan | title = Natalie Portman sparks Hollywood battle | date = March 16, 2011 | publisher = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/organgrinder/2011/mar/16/natalie-portman-actor-fee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hampp | first = Andrew | title = Influencer: Ari Emanuel, William Morris Endeavor Agency | date = January 3, 2011 | publisher = Advertising Age | url = http://adage.com/abstract?article_id=147947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Karmin | first = Craig | title = How a Parking Garage Stymied Hollywood's Super Agent | date = January 27, 2012 | publisher = Wall Street Journal | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203363504577185142361065750.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the merger, WME helped launch the investment group Raine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lattman|first=Peter|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/ex-bankers-start-fund-to-invest-in-media/|title=Ex-Bankers Start Fund to Invest in Media| work = [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= March 29, 2011|date=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aligned the company with properties like [[Vice Media]] and [[Zumba|Zumba Fitness]]. In 2010, WME partnered with RED Interactive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/red-interactive-agency|title=RED Interactive Agency|accessdate= March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a digital advertising agency. Two years later, they formed an alliance with the social media management firm TheAudience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Empson|first=Rip|title=TheAudience: A Stealthy, Celeb-Driven Startup Co-founded By Sean Parker, Ari Emanuel &amp; Oliver Luckett|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/theaudience/|publisher=Tech Crunch|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; partnering with digital entrepreneur [[Sean Parker]] and executing social campaigns for properties like the [[Seth MacFarlane]] motion picture ''[[Ted (movie)|Ted]]'' and the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Music Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=A-Listers, Meet Your Online Megaphone|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/business/oliver-luckett-of-theaudience-building-online-fan-bases.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 brought a strategic partnership between WME and creative music agency Jingle Punks, which creates, publishes and licenses music. WME is also an investor in the e-commerce platform [OpenSky], which was named one of America's "Most Promising Companies" by ''Forbes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Most Promising Companies|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/opensky/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Whitesell and Emanuel were profiled in ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'', highlighting the company's digital growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Laporte | first = Nicole | title = WME's Agent Provocateurs Ari Emanuel And Patrick Whitesell | date = March 18, 2013 | publisher = Fast Company | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/174/creative-conversations-ari-emanuel-patrick-whitesell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, WME acquired a minority stake in the creative agency [[Droga5]]. The partnership combines the companies’ advertising and entertainment resources. Founded by [[David Droga]], [[Droga5]] was named ''[[Adweek|Adweek’s]]'' 2012 Agency of the Year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Beltrone | first = Gabriel | title = Droga's Delicious World | date = December 10, 2012 | publisher = AdWeek | url = http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/drogas-delicious-world-145813=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and oversees accounts for [[Coca-Cola]], [[Motorola]] and [[Spotify]].

Describing the partnership, ''The New York Times'' wrote, “As consumers increasingly ignore traditional advertising and are bombarded with a constant stream of content, both online and offline, advertisers have been forced to find more compelling ways to get their attention. WME could help provide the answer given its substantial reach in television, publishing, music, film and theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Vega | first = Tanzina | title = William Morris to Invest in Droga5, an Ad Agency | date = July 11, 2013 | publisher = New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/business/media/william-morris-to-invest-in-droga5-an-ad-agency.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

On December 18, 2013, WME and [[Silver Lake Partners|Silver Lake]] announced the acquisition of  [[IMG (company)|IMG]] for $2.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/12/wme-silver-lake-acquire-img-worldwide/|title=UPDATE: WME Brass Welcome IMG Staffers As Acquisition Deal Closes|first=Dominic|last=Patten|date=May 7, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WME (talent agency)|WME]]’s [[Ari Emanuel]] and [[Patrick Whitesell]] will serve as co-CEOs.

On January 21, 2015, it was announced that WME had acquired Global eSports Management (GEM), an international agency representing various [[esports]] and professional [[video game]] players and personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Zumberge | first = Marianne | url = https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/wmeimg-acquires-global-esports-management-gaming-agency-1201410955/ | title = WME{{ndash}}IMG Acquires Global eSports Management Gaming Agency | date = January 21, 2015 | publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | accessdate = February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2015, WME acquired from [[Donald Trump]] the [[Miss Universe Organization]], which produces the [[Miss Universe]], [[Miss USA]] and [[Miss Teen USA]] [[beauty pageant]]s and related content. The organization sells television rights to the pageants in other countries. Financial details were not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/donald-trump-miss-universe-wmeimg-acquisition-1201592910/|title=WME/IMG Acquires Miss Universe Organization From Donald Trump|first=Cynthia|last=Littleton|date=September 14, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23 it was announced that WME/IMG would be partnering with [[Turner Broadcasting]] to create a televised [[esports]] league, the [[ELeague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/turner-wme-img-esports-league-tbs-1201600921/|title=Turner, WME/IMG Form E-Sports League, With TBS to Air Live Events|first=Todd |last=Spangler |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=September 23, 2015 |accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2016, [[Zuffa, LLC]], the parent company of [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]], was sold to a group led by WME-IMG, its owner [[Silver Lake Partners]], [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], and [[MSD Capital]], for $4.2 billion, the largest-ever acquisition in the sports industry.&lt;ref name="nyt-ufcsold"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.F.C.

'''William''' is the nickname of a '''faience hippopotamus''' from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] who serves as an informal mascot of the museum. Found in a shaft associated with the [[Upper Egypt]] tomb chapel of "The Steward, Senbi" in what is now [[Meir, Egypt]], William dates from c. 1961 – 1878&amp;nbsp;B.C. during the reigns of [[Senusret I]] and [[Senusret II]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/544227 |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Hippopotamus |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This small figurine in [[Egyptian faience]], a clay-less material, has become popular not only for his endearing appearance but also because his defining characteristics illustrate many of the most salient facets of craft production in ancient Egypt during this time.

William is only one of several objects associated with the tomb of "The Steward, Senbi" that were acquired by the Metropolitan Museum in 1917. According to the Museum’s ''Bulletin'' from that year, this [[hippopotamus]] is a “particularly fine example of a type found, in common with various other animal forms, among the funerary furnishings of tombs of the Middle Kingdom” and also an exemplary piece of [[Egyptian faience]].&lt;ref name="Egyptian Hippopotamus Figure 1917"&gt;"An Egyptian Hippopotamus Figure." ''Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art'' 4 (April 1917): 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

William can be seen in Gallery 111 at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].

==Egyptian faience==
[[File:Medio regno, XII-inizio XIII dinastia, vitello, cane e babbuino in faience, 1938-1630 ac ca..JPG|thumb|Other faience pieces from the XII Dynasty.]]
Related to glass insofar as it attains a "vitreous" appearance, Egyptian faience was, according to [[David Grose|David F. Grose]], “a material made from powdered quartz covered with a true vitreous coating.” Significantly more porous and malleable than glass proper, faience could be shaped by hand or cast in molds to create vessels or other objects.&lt;ref&gt;David Frederick Grose, ''The Toledo Museum of Art, Early Ancient Glass: Core-Formed, Rod-Formed, and Cast Vessels and Objects from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Roman Empire, 1600&amp;nbsp;BC to AD 50'' (Manchester: Hudson Hills Press, 1999), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; While similar raw materials are involved in the creation of both faience and glass (crushed quartz or sand mixed with lime and either natron or plant ash), faience ultimately lacks the rigid crystalline structure of found in modern glass. Significantly, both glass and faience were used, according to Paul T. Nicholson, to imitate semi-precious stones in less costly materials, and both were valued for their beauty and durability.&lt;ref&gt;Paul T. Nicholson, ''Egyptian Faience and Glass'' (Buckinghamshire: Shire, 1993), 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not [[pottery]] on a strict definition, since it contains no [[clay]], faience is often treated as pottery.


This statuette demonstrates the importance of a variety of iconographic styles in Middle Kingdom era burial practices. As Nicholson writes, animal figures were common during this period and “hippopotamus figurines, usually decorated with aquatic plants, probably symbolized the revitalizing properties of the Nile”. They may have held some kind of religious significance, as they were sometimes associated with one of the forms of [[Set (mythology)|Seth]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, ''Egyptian Faience and Glass,'' 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As not all hippo statues from this era were elaborately painted, William is a particularly important example; he has been “covered with a decoration in black line of lotus flowers, buds, and leaves” to signal his “natural surroundings among the lowlands of the Nile.”&lt;ref name="Egyptian Hippopotamus Figure 1917"/&gt; As noted in the Metropolitan Museum’s summary, the hippopotamus was one of the most threatening animals for ancient Egyptians and, in this case, three of William’s legs were probably purposely broken to prevent him from harming the deceased in the afterlife (the museum has since restored these legs).&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;

In the early 20th century, Captain H.M. Raleigh and his family owned a photograph of the hippopotamus, and began to refer to him as William. Raleigh published an article about the hippo for the magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' on March 18, 1931, in which he wrote, "He is described on the back of the frame as "Hippopotamus with Lotus Flowers, Buds and Leaves, XII Dynasty (about 1950 B.C.), Series VII, Number i, Egyptian Faience;" but to us he is simply William."&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, June 1931"&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/~/media/Files/Give%20and%20Join/Planned%20Giving/William%20Bulletin%20article.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times: FYI"&gt;{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Daniel |date= 29 December 2002 |title=F.Y.I. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/nyregion/fyi-603120.html |newspaper=New York Times |location= New York City|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hippopotamus, Metropolitan Museum of Art"&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/content/interactives/Learn_About_Color/william.swf?movieName=william&lt;/ref&gt; The article was reprinted in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Bulletin in June 1931, and the name stuck.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, June 1931"/&gt; In 1936 the Met released a book entitled ''William and his Friends: A Group of Notable Creatures in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.''&lt;ref name="William and His Friends, 1936"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designarchives.aiga.org/#/entries/%2Bid%3A18968/_/detail/relevance/asc/0/3/18968/william-and-his-friends-a-group-of-notable-creatures-in-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art/1|title=William and his Friends, A Group of Notable Creatures in The Metropolitan Museum of Art|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=American Institute of Graphic Arts |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, William has continued to appear in some museum logos and merchandise for both children and adults.

'''WinCustomize''' is a [[website]] that provides content for users to customize [[Microsoft Windows]]. The site hosts thousands of [[skin (computing)|skins]], [[theme (computer)|themes]], [[icon (computing)|icons]], [[computer wallpaper|wallpapers]], and other graphical content to modify the Windows [[graphical user interface]].  There are some premium or paid content, however the vast majority of the content is free for users to download.

== Site history ==
WinCustomize was launched in March 2001 by [[Brad Wardell]] and [[Pat Ford (businessman)|Pat Ford]], both of whom work at [[Stardock]]. After the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com recession]] had taken down many popular [[skin (computing)|skin]] sites, WinCustomize quickly grew in popularity due to a combination of wide variety of content, uptime reliability, and being the preferred content destination by [[Stardock]] customers.

The site has grown at a far greater pace than its founders had anticipated. It has managed to avoid having to put many limitations on users or having to resort to pop-up advertising because of its corporate patron Stardock subsidizing its costs.
This growth has prompted several site redesigns to offer improved functionality and reliability to users.

Since launch, WinCustomize has undergone several iterations:

'''WinCustomize 2k5''' - Launched at the end of 2004, WinCustomize was redesigned for improved stability, and added functionality (personal pages for subscribers, an articles system, tutorials etc.).

'''WinCustomize 2k7''' - Launched January 15, 2007, WC2k7 was a from-the-ground-up rewrite using [[ASP.NET]]. The focus was to build a foundation that was easier to maintain and, in the future, expand.

'''WinCustomize v6''' - Planned for Late 2008/Early 2009, the WC v6 project aims be a major revision to how users navigate and interact with the site and the community as a whole. Where 2k7 was focused on the core codebase, v6 is focused on the user interface and experience.

In July 2007 the WinCustomize Wiki was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.wincustomize.com/?aid=157328|title=Welcome to the WinCustomize Wiki!|author=Mike Crassweller|date=2007-07-10|accessdate=2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WinCustomize 2010''' - WinCustomize 2010 was launched on April 20, 2010.  This major revision represents a major change in the sites look and navigation for users. A guided tour of the new site was published for users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wincustomize.com/article/378698/|title=WinCustomize 2K10 Guided Tour|author=Frogboy|date=2010-03-25|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forum criticisms==
{{peacock|section|date=July 2011}}
While nearly all users visit WinCustomize.com to download [[skin (computing)|skins]], [[Theme (computing)|themes]], [[icons]], [[computer wallpaper|wallpapers]], and other content for their personal computers, WinCustomize does have extensive forums and articles areas. As with most large sites, WinCustomize is not without its critics with regards to how the forums are run and the content in the articles and forums area.

The site's news contains a great deal of editorial content. As a result, some users are occasionally concerned with stories that they feel are biased against policies or issues they disagree with. For example, site owner [[Brad Wardell]] has written articles that are critical of Apple, European policy, commercialism, anti-commercialism, and more. One recent article criticized Norway's banning of the iPod music store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wincustomize.com/articles.aspx?aid=142193 Norway bans iTunes store, cuts nose, spites face]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of WinCustomize is the site's close association with [[Stardock]] which owns the site. Some feel there is a [[conflict of interest]] in the world's largest skinning site (over 20 million visitors monthly){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} being operated by a software developer that sells skinning solutions.

== Popular skinning programs ==
Programs heavily associated with Windows customization include:

*''[[WindowBlinds]]'' – enables users to customize the look and feel of the Windows GUI
*''[[Winamp]]'' – A skinnable media player from Nullsoft
*''[[IconPackager]]'' – A program that enables users to change their Windows icons
*''[[Rainlendar]]'' — A skinnable calendar and small desktop application (widgets &amp; monitoring) program
*''[[DesktopX]]'' — A program that enables users to build their own desktop with objects and widgets
*''[[Windows Media Player]]'' — Microsoft's skinnable media player.
*''[[LiteStep]]'' – A noted desktop shell replacement for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].
*''[[ObjectDock]]'' — provides a dock that adds functionality to the Windows interface, similar but not an emulation of the dock in Mac OS X
*''[[LogonStudio]]'' — alters the [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista]] [[welcome screen]]
*''[[BootSkin]]'' — alters the [[Windows 2000]] and Windows XP [[boot screen]]
