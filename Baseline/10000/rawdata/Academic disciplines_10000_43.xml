'''Alvin Plantinga's free will defense''' is a [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical argument]] developed by American [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] [[Alvin Plantinga]], the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the [[University of Notre Dame]], and published in its final version in his 1977 book ''God, Freedom, and Evil''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=God, Freedom, and Evil|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1977|isbn=0-8028-1731-9|location=Grand Rapids, MI:|pages=Chapter 4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Free Will Defense", in [[Max Black]] (ed), ''Philosophy in America''. Ithaca: Cornell UP / London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's argument is a defense against the [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical problem of evil]] as formulated by philosopher [[J. L. Mackie]] beginning in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Evil and Omnipotence|journal=Mind|volume=64|issue=210|pages=455–465|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in ''The Miracle of Theism,'' though he did not claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Miracle of Theism.|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=Oxford:|pages=154|quote=Since this defense is formally [that is, logically] possible, and its principle involves no real abandonment of our ordinary view of the opposition between good and evil, we can concede that the problem of evil does not, after all, show that the central doctrines of theism are logically inconsistent with one another. But whether this offers a real solution of the problem is another question.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mackie's logical argument from evil ==

The logical argument from evil argued by J. L. Mackie, and to which the free will defense responds, is an argument against the existence of the Christian God based on the idea that a logical contradiction exists between four theological tenets in orthodox Christian theology. Specifically, the argument from evil asserts that the following set of propositions are, by themselves, logically inconsistent or contradictory:
# God is omniscient (all-knowing)
# God is omnipotent  (all-powerful)
# God is omnibenevolent (morally perfect)
# There is evil in the world
Most orthodox Christian theologians agree with the first three propositions describing God as all-knowing (1), all-powerful (2), and morally perfect (3), and agree with the proposition that there is evil in the world, as described in proposition (4). The logical argument from evil asserts that a God with the attributes (1-3), must know about all evil, would be capable of preventing it, and as morally perfect would be motivated to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|year=1955|title=Evil and Omnipotence|journal=Mind|volume=64|pages=200–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCloskey|first=H. J.|year=1960|title=God and Evil|journal=Philosophical Quarterly|volume=10|pages=97–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument from evil concludes that the existence of the orthodox Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.

== Plantinga's free will defense ==
Plantinga's [[free will]] defense begins by asserting that Mackie's argument failed to establish an ''explicit'' logical contradiction between God and the existence of evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's ''implicit'' unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an ''explicit'' contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remained unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

First, Plantinga pointed out that God, though [[omnipotent]], could not be expected to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil.&lt;sup&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Plantinga's defense has received strong support among Christian academic philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="Howard-Snyder"&gt;"It used to be widely held by philosophers that God and evil are incompatible. Not any longer. Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense is largely responsible for this shift."{{cite journal|last=Howard-Snyder|first=Daniel|year=1999|title=Transworld Sanctity and Plantinga's Free Will Defense|url=http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Howard-Snyder-Transworld-Sanctity-and-Plantingas-Free-Will-Defense.pdf|journal=International Journal for the Philosophy of Religion|volume=16|issue=3|pages=336–351|author2=John O’Leary-Hawthorne|access-date=2013-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215091750/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Howard-Snyder-Transworld-Sanctity-and-Plantingas-Free-Will-Defense.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meister"&gt;"Most philosophers have agreed that the free will defense has defeated the logical problem of evil.

In addition to Plantinga's free will defense, there are other arguments purporting to undermine or disprove the logical argument from evil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Plantinga's free will defense is the best known of these responses at least in part because of his thoroughness in describing and addressing the relevant questions and issues in ''God, Freedom, and Evil.''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Further details ==
As opposed to a [[theodicy]] (a ''justification'' for God's actions), Plantinga puts forth a ''defense'', offering a new proposition that is intended to demonstrate that it is logically possible for an omnibenevolent, omnipotent and omniscient God to create a world that contains moral evil. Significantly, Plantinga does not need to assert that his new proposition is true, merely that it is logically valid. In this way Plantinga's approach differs from that of a traditional theodicy, which would strive to show not just that the new propositions are valid, but that the argument is sound, [[prima facie]] plausible, or that there are good grounds for making it.&lt;ref name="Surin1995p193"&gt;{{harvnb|Surin|1995|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the burden of proof on Plantinga is lessened, and yet his approach may still serve as a defense against the claim by Mackie that the simultaneous existence of evil and an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God is "positively irrational".&lt;ref name="Mackie200"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackie|1955|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Plantinga summarised his defense:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1974|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A world containing creatures who are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't ''cause'' or ''determine'' them to do only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not do what is right ''freely''. To create creatures capable of ''moral good'', therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of [[moral evil]]. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plantinga's argument is that even though God is omnipotent, it is ''possible'' that it was not in his power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil; therefore, there is no logical inconsistency involved when God, although wholly good, creates a world of free creatures who choose to do evil.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1991 130–133"&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|Hasker|Reichenbach|Basinger|1991|pp=130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument relies on the following propositions:
# There are possible worlds that even an omnipotent being can not actualize.
# A world with morally free creatures producing only moral good is such a world.
Plantinga refers to the first statement as "Leibniz's lapse" as the opposite was assumed by Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second proposition is more contentious. Plantinga rejects the compatibilist notion of freedom whereby God could directly cause agents to only do good without sacrificing their freedom. Although it would contradict a creature's freedom if God were to cause, or in Plantinga's terms ''strongly actualize'', a world where creatures only do good, an omniscient God would still know the circumstances under which creatures would go wrong. Thus, God could avoid creating such circumstances, thereby ''weakly actualizing'' a world with only moral good. Plantinga's crucial argument is that this possibility may not be available to God because all possible morally free creatures suffer from "transworld depravity".

== Reception ==
According to Chad Meister, professor of philosophy at [[Bethel College (Indiana)|Bethel College]], most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted.&lt;ref name="Meister134"/&gt; [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] says that "it is fair to say that Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of [[God and evil]]."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{harvnb|Howard-Snyder|O'Leary-Hawthorne|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Alston]] has said that "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{harvnb|Alston|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William L. Rowe]] has written "granted [[incompatibilism]], there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God", referring to Plantinga's argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rowe|1979|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Arguing about Gods'', [[Graham Oppy]] offers a dissent, acknowledging that "[m]any philosophers seem to suppose that [Plantinga's free will defense] utterly demolishes the kinds of 'logical' arguments from evil developed by Mackie" but continuing "I am not sure this is a correct assessment of the current state of play".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oppy|2006|pp=262–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurring with Oppy, A.M. Weisberger writes “contrary to popular theistic opinion, the logical form of the argument is still alive and beating.”&lt;ref name="Weisberger 1999 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Weisberger|1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among contemporary philosophers, most discussion on the [[problem of evil]] presently revolves around the ''evidential'' problem of evil, namely that the existence of God is unlikely, rather than illogical.&lt;ref name="BeebeIEP"&gt;{{harvnb|Beebe|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional objections and responses ==

=== Incompatibilist view of free will === 
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy2.svg|right|thumb|250px|alt=A diagram. At the top, an orange box labeled "Determinism?" with two arrows pointing to other boxes. The arrow labeled "True" points to an orange box labeled "Free will?", the arrow labeled "False" points to a light-blue box labeled "Libertarianism". The box labeled "Free will?" has two arrows pointing to other boxes. The arrow labeled "True" points to a light-blue box labeled "Compatibilism", the arrow labeled "False" points to a light-blue box labeled "Hard determinism". The two light-blue boxes labeled "Hard determinism" and "Libertarianism" are surrounded by a grey ellipse labeled "Incompatibilism".|A simplified taxonomy of the main positions on the nature of free will.]]
Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as philosopher [[Antony Flew]], have responded that it presupposes a libertarian, [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] view of free will (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilist]] view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackie|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flew|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1991 130–133"/&gt;

Plantinga dismisses compatibilism, stating "this objection... seems utterly implausible. One might as well claim that being in jail doesn't really limit one's freedom on the grounds that if one were not in jail, he'd be free to come and go as he pleased".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transworld depravity ===
Plantinga's idea of weakly actualizing a world can be viewed as having God actualizing a subset of the world, letting the free choices of creatures complete the world. Therefore, it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices; that is, there exist possible worlds where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil. However, it may be the case that for each such world, there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in the actual world. In other words, each such possible world contains a ''world segment'', meaning everything about that world up to the point where the person must make that critical choice, such that if that segment was part of the actual world, the person would instead go wrong in completing that world. Formally, ''transworld depravity'' is defined as follows:&lt;ref name="Plantinga 1977 48"&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
A person ''P suffers from transworld depravity'' if and only if the following holds: for every world ''W'' such that ''P'' is significantly free in ''W'' and ''P'' does only what is right in ''W'', there is an action ''A'' and a maximal world segment ''S´'' such that
# ''S´'' includes ''A'' 's being morally significant for ''P''
# ''S´'' includes ''P'' 's being free with respect to ''A''
# ''S´'' is included in ''W'' and includes neither ''P'' 's performing ''A'' nor ''P'' 's refraining from performing ''A''
# If ''S´'' were actual, ''P'' would go wrong with respect to ''A''.}}
Less formally: Consider all possible (not actual) worlds in which someone always chooses the right. In all those, there will be a subpart of the world that says that person was free to choose a certain right or wrong action, but does not say whether they chose it. If that subpart were actual (in the real world), then they would choose the wrong.

Plantinga responds that "What is important about the idea of transworld depravity is that if a person suffers from it, then it wasn't within God's power to actualize any world in which that person is significantly free but does no wrong—that is, a world in which he produces moral good but no moral evil"&lt;ref name="Plantinga 1977 48" /&gt; and that it is logically ''possible'' that every person suffers from transworld depravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ascocarp''', or '''ascoma''' (plural: '''ascomata'''), is the fruiting body ([[Sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarp]]) of an [[ascomycete]] phylum fungus.  It consists of very tightly interwoven [[hypha]]e and may contain millions of [[ascus|asci]], each of which typically contains four to eight [[ascospores]].  Ascocarps are most commonly bowl-shaped (apothecia) but may take a spherical (cleistothecia) or flask-like (perithecia) form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/37968/ascocarp | title = ascocarp (fruiting structure of fungi) | accessdate = 19 October 2014  | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
&lt;!-- translated from the [[:de:Ascomycota|German article on Ascomycota]].--&gt;
{{multiple image

The ascocarp is classified according to its placement (in ways not fundamental to the basic taxonomy).  It is called ''epigeous'' if it grows above ground, as with the [[morel]]s, while underground ascocarps, such as [[truffles]], are termed ''hypogeous''. The form of the [[hymenium]] is divided into the following types (which ''are'' important for classification).  Apothecia can be relatively large and fleshy, whereas the others are microscopic&amp;mdash;about the size of flecks of ground pepper.

==Apothecium==
[[Image:Ascocarp2.png|thumb|middle|270px|Diagram of an apothecium showing sterile tissues as well as developing and mature asci]]
An apothecium is a wide, open, saucer-shaped or cup-shaped fruit body. It is sessile and fleshy. The structure of the apothecium chiefly consists of three parts: ''hymenium'' (upper concave surface), ''hypothecium'', and ''excipulum''. The asci are present in the hymenium layer. The asci are freely exposed at maturity. An example are the members of ''Dictyomycetes''. Here the fertile layer is free, so that many spores can be dispersed simultaneously.  The [[morel]], ''Morchella'', an edible ascocarp, not a mushroom, favored by gourmets, is a mass of apothecia fused together in a single large structure or cap. The genera ''[[Helvella]]'' and ''[[Gyromitra]]'' are similar.

[[Image:Smardz-Morchella-Ejdzej-2006.jpg|thumb|left|179px|The ascocarp of a [[morel]] contains numerous apothecia.]]

==Cleistothecium==
A cleistothecium is a globose, completely closed fruit body with no special opening to the outside. The ascomatal wall is called ''[[peridium]]'' and typically consists of densely interwoven hyphae or ''pseudoparenchyma'' cells. It may be covered with hyphal outgrowth called ''appendages''. The asci are globose, deliquescent, and scattered throughout the interior cavity i.e. as in ''Eurotium'' or arising in tufts from the basal region of ascocarps as in ''Erysiphe''. In this case the ascocarp is round with the hymenium enclosed, so the spores do not automatically get released, and fungi with cleistothecia have had to develop new strategies to disseminate their spores.  The truffles, for instance, have solved this problem by attracting animals such as [[boar|wild boar]]s, which break open the tasty ascocarps and spread the spores over a wide area.  Cleistothecia are found mostly in fungi that have little room available for their ascocarps, for instance those that live under tree bark, or underground like truffles.

==Gymnothecium==
Similar to a cleistothecium, a gymnothecium is a completely enclosed structure containing globose or pear-shaped, deliquescent asci. However, unlike the cleistothecium, the peridial wall of a gymnothecium consists of a loosely woven "tuft" of hyphae, often ornamented with elaborate coils or spines. Examples are the ''Gymnoascus'', ''Talaromyces'' and the [[dermatophyte]] ''[[Arthroderma]]''.

==Perithecium==
[[Image:Nectria.jpg|thumb|200px|Perithecia of ''Nectria'']]
''Perithecium'': These are flask shaped structures opening by a pore or ''ostiole'' (short papilla opening by a circular pore) through which the ascospores escape. The ''ostiolar canal'' may be lined by hair-like structures called ''periphyses''. The '''unitunicate asci''' are usually cylindrical in shape, borne on a stipe (stalk), released from a pore, developed from the inner wall of the perithecium and arise from a basal plectenchyma-centrum. Examples are  members of ''Sphaeriales'' and ''Hypocreales''. Perithecia are also found in ''[[Xylaria]]'' (Dead Man's Fingers, Candle Snuff), ''[[Nectria]]'', claviceps and neurospora.

==Pseudothecium==
[[Image:Perithecium no text.PNG|thumb|right|270px|Diagram of a pseudothecium. Eight ascospores (green) are typically present in each ascus.]]
This is similar to a perithecium, but the asci are not regularly organised into a hymenium and they are ''bitunicate'', having a double wall that expands when it takes up water and shoots the enclosed spores out suddenly to disperse them.  Example species are [[Apple scab]] (''Venturia inaequalis'') and the horse chestnut disease ''[[Guignardia aesculi]]''.

In 2015, Asperger's was estimated to affect 37.2 million people globally.&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre /&gt; The syndrome is named after the Austrian [[pediatrician]] [[Hans Asperger]], who in 1944 described children in his practice who lacked nonverbal communication, had limited [[Empathy#Cognitive empathy|understanding of others' feelings]], and were physically clumsy.&lt;ref name=ha&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frith|first1=Uta | name-list-format = vanc |title=Autism and Asperger Syndrome|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-38608-1|chapter='Autistic psychopathy' in childhood|pages=37–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern conception of Asperger syndrome came into existence in 1981 and went through a period of popularization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klin A, Pauls D, Schultz R, Volkmar F | title = Three diagnostic approaches to Asperger syndrome: implications for research | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–34 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15909408 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-004-2001-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism?|veditors=Schopler E, Mesibov GB, Kunce LJ|publisher=Plenum press|location=New York|year=1998|chapter=The history of Asperger syndrome|vauthors=Wing L|pages=11–25|isbn=978-0-306-45746-3|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jz_xbeWgG9AC&amp;pg=PA11|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313123459/https://books.google.ca/books?id=jz_xbeWgG9AC&amp;pg=PA11|archive-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodbury-Smith M, Klin A, Volkmar F | title = Asperger's syndrome: a comparison of clinical diagnoses and those made according to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 235–40 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15909409 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-004-2002-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a standardized [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Linda2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Linda|name-list-format=vanc|title=Asperger's Syndrome: Intervening in Schools, Clinics, and Communities|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-62414-9|page=44|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=KiSRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313125152/https://books.google.ca/books?id=KiSRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|archive-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many questions and controversies remain about aspects of the disorder.&lt;ref name="Woodbury-Smith" /&gt; There is doubt about whether it is distinct from [[high-functioning autism]] (HFA).&lt;ref name=Klin&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klin A | title = [Autism and Asperger syndrome: an overview] | journal = Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria | volume = 28 Suppl 1 | issue = suppl 1 | pages = S3–11 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16791390 | doi = 10.1590/S1516-44462006000500002 | url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-44462006000500002&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929142312/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-44462006000500002&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en | df = dmy-all | deadurl = no | archive-date = 29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly because of this, the percentage of people affected is not firmly established.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defined Asperger syndrome (AS) as one of the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are a [[spectrum disorder|spectrum of psychological conditions]] that are characterized by abnormalities of [[social interaction]] and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.&lt;ref name="ICD-10-F84.0"&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f840|year=2006|title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|edition=10th ([[ICD-10]])|author=World Health Organization|chapter=F84.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Autism-stacking-cans 2nd edit.jpg|thumb|People with Asperger syndrome often display restricted or specialized interests, such as this boy's interest in stacking cans.]]
As a [[pervasive developmental disorder]], Asperger syndrome is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language.&lt;ref name=BehaveNet&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]])|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2000|isbn=978-0-89042-025-6|chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder (AD)|chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm|publisher=&lt;!-- pacify Citation bot --&gt;|location=&lt;!-- pacify Citation bot --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided [[verbosity]], restricted [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hannon G, Taylor EP | title = Suicidal behaviour in adolescents and young adults with ASD: findings from a systematic review | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 33 | issue = 8 | pages = 1197–204 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24201088 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2013.10.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social interaction ===
{{Further|Asperger syndrome and interpersonal relationships}}
A lack of demonstrated [[empathy]] affects aspects of communal living for persons with Asperger syndrome.&lt;ref name=Baskin /&gt; Individuals with AS experience difficulties in basic elements of social interaction, which may include a failure to develop friendships or to seek shared enjoyments or achievements with others (for example, showing others objects of interest); a lack of social or emotional [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] (social "games" give-and-take mechanic); and impaired [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal behaviors]] in areas such as [[eye contact]], [[facial expression]], posture, and gesture.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;

People with AS may not be as withdrawn around others, compared with those with other, more debilitating forms of [[autism]]; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a wish to change the topic of talk or end the interaction.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; This social awkwardness has been called "active but odd".&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; Such failures to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings and may come across as insensitive.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; However, not all individuals with AS will approach others. Some of them may even display [[selective mutism]], not speaking at all to most people and excessively to specific others. Some may choose only to talk to people they like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/912296-overview|work=Medscape eMedicine|title=Asperger's Syndrome|author=Brasic JR|date=7 July 2010|access-date=25 November 2010|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223170232/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/912296-overview|archive-date=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive ability of children with AS often allows them to articulate [[social norms]] in a laboratory context,&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naïve. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;

==== Violent or criminal behavior ====
The [[hypothesis]] that individuals with AS are predisposed to violent or criminal behavior has been investigated, but is not supported by data.&lt;ref name="McPart2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen D, Evans C, Hider A, Hawkins S, Peckett H, Morgan H | title = Offending behaviour in adults with Asperger syndrome | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 748–58 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 17805955 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0442-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More evidence suggests that children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome are victims rather than offenders.&lt;ref name=Tsatsanis&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsatsanis KD | title = Outcome research in Asperger syndrome and autism | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–63, vi | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12512398 | doi = 10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00056-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 review found that an overwhelming number of reported violent criminals with Asperger syndrome had also other coexisting psychotic [[psychiatric disorders]] such as [[schizoaffective disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newman SS, Ghaziuddin M | title = Violent crime in Asperger syndrome: the role of psychiatric comorbidity | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 38 | issue = 10 | pages = 1848–52 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18449633 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-008-0580-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior ===
People with Asperger syndrome can display behavior, interests, and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines, move in [[Stereotypy|stereotyped]] and repetitive ways, preoccupy themselves with parts of objects, or engage in compulsive behaviors like lining objects up to form patterns.&lt;ref name=BehaveNet /&gt;

Pursuit of specific and narrow areas of interest is one of the most striking among possible features of AS.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt;

Stereotyped and repetitive motor behaviors are a core part of the diagnosis of AS and other ASDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = South M, Ozonoff S, McMahon WM | title = Repetitive behavior profiles in Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–58 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15909401 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-004-1992-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements.&lt;ref name=BehaveNet /&gt; These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than [[tic]]s, which are usually faster, less rhythmical, and less often symmetrical.&lt;ref name=RapinTS&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rapin I | title = Autism spectrum disorders: relevance to Tourette syndrome | journal = Advances in Neurology | volume = 85 | pages = 89–101 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11530449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA) diagnostic test, a lack of interest in fiction and a positive preference towards non-fiction is common among adults with AS.&lt;ref name=ASAdulthood /&gt;

=== Speech and language ===
Although individuals with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, [[language acquisition]] and use is often atypical.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; Abnormalities include [[verbosity]]; abrupt transitions; literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance; use of metaphor meaningful only to the speaker; [[Auditory processing disorder|auditory perception deficits]]; unusually [[Pedantic speech|pedantic]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|formal]], or [[Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry|idiosyncratic]] speech; and oddities in loudness, [[Tone (linguistics)|pitch]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and rhythm.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; [[Echolalia]] has also been observed in individuals with AS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frith U | title = Social communication and its disorder in autism and Asperger syndrome | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–53 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 22302727 | doi = 10.1177/026988119601000108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three aspects of communication patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, [[Tangential speech|tangential]] and [[circumstantial speech]], and marked [[verbosity]]. Although [[inflection]] and intonation may be less rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky, or loud. Speech may convey a sense of [[Coherence (linguistics)|incoherence]]; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide [[Context (language use)|context]] for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt;

Children with AS may have a sophisticated vocabulary at a young age and such children have often been colloquially called "little professors", but have difficulty understanding [[figurative language]] and tend to use language literally.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; Children with AS appear to have particular weaknesses in areas of nonliteral language that include humor, irony, teasing, and sarcasm. Although individuals with AS usually understand the cognitive basis of [[humor]], they seem to lack understanding of the intent of humor to share enjoyment with others.&lt;ref name=Kasari /&gt; Despite strong evidence of impaired humor appreciation, anecdotal reports of humor in individuals with AS seem to challenge some psychological theories of AS and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | title = Humor in autism and Asperger syndrome | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 521–31 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15628606 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-004-2547-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
{{Further|Causes of autism}}
Hans Asperger described common symptoms among his patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene has yet been identified, multiple factors are believed to play a role in the [[Expressivity (genetics)|expression]] of autism, given the [[phenotypic]] variability seen in children with AS.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt; Evidence for a [[Behavioral genetics|genetic link]] is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading).&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt; Most [[behavioral genetic]] research suggests that all [[Heritability of autism|autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms]], but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism.&lt;ref name="McPart2006" /&gt; There is probably a common group of genes where particular [[allele]]s render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt;

A few ASD cases have been linked to exposure to [[Teratology#Teratogenic agents|teratogens]] (agents that cause [[birth defect]]s) during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]]. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that ASD arises very early in development.&lt;ref name=Arndt&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM | title = The teratology of autism | journal = International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 189–99 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15749245 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[environmental factor]]s have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutter M | title = Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning | journal = Acta Paediatrica | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–15 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15858952 | doi = 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x | authorlink = Michael Rutter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Therapies ===
&lt;!-- Please respect alphabetical order --&gt;
The ideal treatment for AS coordinates therapies that address core symptoms of the disorder, including poor communication skills and obsessive or repetitive routines. While most professionals agree that the earlier the intervention, the better, there is no single best treatment package.&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt; AS treatment resembles that of other high-functioning ASDs, except that it takes into account the linguistic capabilities, verbal strengths, and nonverbal vulnerabilities of individuals with AS.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; A typical program generally includes:&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt;
*
* [[Applied behavior analysis]] (ABA) procedures, including [[positive behavior support]] (PBS)&amp;mdash;or training and support of parents and school faculty in behavior management strategies to use in the home and school, and [[social skills]] training for more effective interpersonal interactions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krasny L, Williams BJ, Provencal S, Ozonoff S | title = Social skills interventions for the autism spectrum: essential ingredients and a model curriculum | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–22 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12512401 | doi = 10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00051-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Medication]] for coexisting conditions such as [[major depressive disorder]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s;&lt;ref name=Towbin /&gt;
* [[Occupational therapy|Occupational]] or [[physical therapy]] to assist with poor [[sensory processing]] and [[motor coordination]]; and,

Of the many studies on behavior-based early intervention programs, most are [[case report]]s of up to five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as [[self-injury]], [[aggression]], noncompliance, [[stereotypies]]&lt;!-- Not "stereotypes" --&gt;, or spontaneous language; unintended [[side effect]]s are largely ignored.&lt;ref name=interrev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matson JL | title = Determining treatment outcome in early intervention programs for autism spectrum disorders: a critical analysis of measurement issues in learning based interventions | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–18 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16682171 | doi = 10.1016/j.ridd.2005.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao PA, Beidel DC, Murray MJ | title = Social skills interventions for children with Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism: a review and recommendations | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 353–61 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 17641962 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0402-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sofronoff K, Leslie A, Brown W | title = Parent management training and Asperger syndrome: a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a parent based intervention | journal = Autism | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–17 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15358872 | doi = 10.1177/1362361304045215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.&lt;ref name="McPart2006" /&gt;

Anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder are the most common conditions seen at the same time; [[comorbidity]] of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; Reports have associated AS with [[medical conditions]] such as [[aminoaciduria]] and [[ligamentous laxity]], but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies.&lt;ref name="McPart2006" /&gt; One study of males with AS found an increased rate of [[epilepsy]] and a high rate (51%) of [[nonverbal learning disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cederlund M, Gillberg C | title = One hundred males with Asperger syndrome: a clinical study of background and associated factors | journal = Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology | volume = 46 | issue = 10 | pages = 652–60 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15473168 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8749.2004.tb00977.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; AS is associated with [[tic]]s, [[Tourette syndrome]], and [[bipolar disorder]], and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] and [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="Gillberg&amp;Billstedt2000"/&gt; However many of these studies are based on [[sampling bias|clinical samples]] or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.&lt;ref name="Woodbury-Smith" /&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of Asperger syndrome}}
Named after the Austrian pediatrician [[Hans Asperger]] (1906–1980), Asperger syndrome is a relatively new diagnosis in the field of autism,&lt;ref name="What'sSpecial"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S, Klin A | title = What's so special about Asperger Syndrome? | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16563588 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2006.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though a syndrome like it was described as early as 1925 by [[Grunya Sukhareva]] (1891–1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manouilenko I, Bejerot S | title = Sukhareva – Prior to Asperger and Kanner | journal = Nordic Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 479–82 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25826582 | doi = 10.3109/08039488.2015.1005022 | df = dmy-all | deadurl = no | publicationdate = 31 March 2015 | type = Report }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Asperger appears to have exhibited some features of the very condition named after him, such as remoteness and talent in language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | title = Did Hans Asperger (1906–1980) have Asperger syndrome? | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 2020–21 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17917805 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0382-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Osborne L|title=American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome|publisher=Copernicus|year=2002|isbn=978-0-387-95307-6|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Asperger described four children in his practice&lt;ref name=Baskin /&gt; who had difficulty in integrating themselves socially. The children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy. Asperger called the condition "autistic psychopathy" and described it as primarily marked by [[social isolation]].&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt; Fifty years later, several standardizations of AS as a [[medical diagnosis]] were tentatively proposed, many of which diverge significantly from Asperger's original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hippler K, Klicpera C | title = A retrospective analysis of the clinical case records of 'autistic psychopaths' diagnosed by Hans Asperger and his team at the University Children's Hospital, Vienna | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Unlike today's AS, autistic psychopathy could be found in people of all levels of intelligence, including those with intellectual disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Wing L|chapter=The relationship between Asperger's syndrome and Kanner's autism|editor=Frith U|title=Autism and Asperger syndrome|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38608-1|pages=93–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger defended the value of high-functioning autistic individuals, writing: "We are convinced, then, that autistic people have their place in the organism of the social community. They fulfill their role well, perhaps better than anyone else could, and we are talking of people who as children had the greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care-givers."&lt;ref name=ha /&gt; Asperger also believed some would be capable of exceptional achievement and original thought later in life.&lt;ref name="Baskin" /&gt; His paper was published during [[World War II]] and in German, so it was not widely read elsewhere.

Hundreds of books, articles and websites now describe AS and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS recognized as an important subgroup.&lt;ref name="What'sSpecial" /&gt; Whether it should be seen as distinct from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study,&lt;ref name="Baskin" /&gt; and there are questions about the [[empirical validation]] of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria.&lt;ref name="Klin" /&gt; In 2013, [[DSM-5]] eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.&lt;ref name=DSMV /&gt;

People identifying with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as ''aspies'' (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Willey LH|title=Pretending to be Normal: Living with Asperger's Syndrome|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|pages=71, 104|year=1999|isbn=978-1-85302-749-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[neurotypical]]'' (abbreviated ''NT'') describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical and is often used to refer to non-autistic (or ''allistic'') people. The [[Internet]] has allowed individuals with AS to communicate with each other in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. Internet sites like [[Wrong Planet]] have made it easier for individuals to connect.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

Some autistic people have advocated a shift in perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex [[syndrome]]s rather than diseases that must be cured. Proponents of this view reject the notion that there is an "ideal" brain configuration and that any deviation from the norm is [[pathological]]; they promote tolerance for what they call [[neurodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Williams CC|chapter=In search of an Asperger|veditors=Stoddart KP|title=Children, Youth and Adults with Asperger Syndrome: Integrating Multiple Perspectives|year=2005|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|isbn=978-1-84310-319-6|pages=242–52|quote=The life prospects of people with AS would change if we shifted from viewing AS as a set of dysfunctions, to viewing it as a set of differences that have merit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views are the basis for the [[autistic rights]] and [[autistic pride]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Dakin CJ|chapter=Life on the outside: A personal perspective of Asperger syndrome|editor=Stoddart KP|title=Children, Youth and Adults with Asperger Syndrome: Integrating Multiple Perspectives|year=2005|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|isbn=978-1-84310-319-6|pages=352–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a contrast between the attitude of adults with self-identified AS, who typically do not want to be cured and are proud of their identity; and parents of children with AS, who typically seek assistance and a cure for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clarke J, van Amerom G | title = Asperger's syndrome: differences between parents' understanding and those diagnosed | journal = Social Work in Health Care | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 85–106 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18551831 | doi = 10.1300/J010v46n03_05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have argued that AS can be viewed as a different cognitive style, not a disorder,&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; and that it should be removed from the standard ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'', much as [[homosexuality]] was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Disability &amp; Society|year=2009|volume=24|issue=3|pages=343–55|title=Reframing Asperger syndrome: lessons from other challenges to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual'' and ICIDH approaches|author=Allred S|doi=10.1080/09687590902789511}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 paper, [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] wrote of those with AS: "In the social world, there is no great benefit to a precise eye for detail, but in the worlds of maths, computing, cataloging, music, linguistics, engineering, and science, such an eye for detail can lead to success rather than failure." Baron-Cohen cited two reasons why it might still be useful to consider AS to be a disability: to ensure provision for legally required special support, and to recognize emotional difficulties from reduced empathy.&lt;ref name=BaronCohen2002 /&gt; Baron-Cohen argues that the genes for Asperger's combination of abilities have operated throughout recent [[human evolution]] and have made remarkable contributions to human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology|chapter=The evolution of brain mechanisms for social behavior|vauthors=Baron-Cohen S|pages=415–32|editor1=Crawford C|editor2=Krebs D|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8058-5957-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Pier Jaarsma and Welin wrote in 2011 that the "broad version of the neurodiversity claim, covering low-functioning as well as high-functioning autism, is problematic. Only a narrow conception of neurodiversity, referring exclusively to high-functioning autists, is reasonable."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaarsma P, Welin S | title = Autism as a natural human variation: reflections on the claims of the neurodiversity movement | journal = Health Care Analysis | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–30 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 21311979 | doi = 10.1007/s10728-011-0169-9 | url = http://www.imh.liu.se/avd_halsa_samhalle/filarkiv1/1.264263/JaarsmaWelin2011Autismasanaturalvariation.pdf | format = PDF | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131101015957/http://www.imh.liu.se/avd_halsa_samhalle/filarkiv1/1.264263/JaarsmaWelin2011Autismasanaturalvariation.pdf | df = dmy | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 1 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They say that "higher functioning" individuals with autism may "not [be] benefited with such a psychiatric defect-based diagnosis [...] some of them are being harmed by it, because of the disrespect the diagnosis displays for their natural way of being", but "think that it is still reasonable to include other categories of autism in the psychiatric diagnostics. The narrow conception of the neurodiversity claim should be accepted but the broader claim should not."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt; [[Jonathan Mitchell (writer)|Jonathan Mitchell]], an [[autistic]] author and blogger who advocates a cure for autism, has described autism as having "prevented me from making a living or ever having a girlfriend.

A '''binary moment diagram (BMD)''' is a generalization of the [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD) to linear functions over domains such as booleans (like BDDs), but also to integers or to real numbers.

They can deal with boolean functions with complexity comparable to BDDs, but also some functions that are dealt with very inefficiently in a BDD are handled easily by BMD, most notably [[multiplication]].

The most important properties of BMD is that, like with BDDs, each function has exactly one canonical representation, and many operations can be efficiently performed on these representations.

The main features that differentiate BMDs from BDDs are using linear instead of pointwise diagrams, and having weighted edges.

The rules that ensure the canonicity of the representation are:
* Decision over variables higher in the ordering may only point to decisions over variables lower in the ordering.
* No two nodes may be identical (in normalization such nodes all references to one of these nodes should be replaced be references to another)
* No node may have all decision parts equivalent to 0 (links to such nodes should be replaced by links to their always part)
* No edge may have weight zero (all such edges should be replaced by direct links to&amp;nbsp;0)
* Weights of the edges should be [[coprime]]. Without this rule or some equivalent of it, it would be possible for a function to have many representations, for example 2''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 could be represented as 2&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'') or 1&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''x'').

== Pointwise and linear decomposition ==

In pointwise decomposition, like in BDDs, on each branch point we store result of all branches separately.  An example of such decomposition for an integer function (2''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'') is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \text{if } x
\begin{cases}
 \text{if } y , 3
\\
 \text{if } \neg y , 2
\end{cases}
\\ 
 \text{if } \neg x
\begin{cases}
 \text{if } y \text{ , } 1
\\
 \text{if } \neg y \text{ , } 0
\end{cases}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

In linear decomposition we provide instead a default value and a difference:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\text{always} 
\begin{cases}
\text{always } 0 \\
\text{if } y , +1
\end{cases}
\\
\text{if } x , +2
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

It can easily be seen that the latter (linear) representation is much more efficient in case of additive functions, as when we add many elements the latter representation will have only O(''n'') elements, while the former (pointwise), even with sharing, exponentially many.

== Edge weights ==

Another extension is using weights for edges. A value of function at given node is a sum of the true nodes below it (the node under always, and possibly the decided node) times the edges' weights.

For example, &lt;math&gt;(4x_2 + 2x_1 + x_0) (4y_2 + 2y_1 + y_0)&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as:
# Result node, always 1&amp;times; value of node 2, if &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; add 4&amp;times; value of node 4
# Always 1&amp;times; value of node 3, if &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; add 2&amp;times; value of node 4
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; add 1&amp;times; value of node 4
# Always 1&amp;times; value of node 5, if &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; add +4
# Always 1&amp;times; value of node 6, if &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; add +2
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; add +1

Without weighted nodes a much more complex representation would be required:
# Result node, always value of node 2, if &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; value of node 4
# Always value of node 3, if &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; value of node 7
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; value of node 10
# Always value of node 5, if &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; add +16
# Always value of node 6, if &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; add +8
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; add +4
# Always value of node 8, if &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; add +8
# Always value of node 9, if &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; add +4
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; add +2
# Always value of node 11, if &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; add +4
# Always value of node 12, if &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; add +2
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; add +1

'''Bush regeneration''', a form of '''natural area restoration''',  is the term used in [[Australia]] for the [[ecology|ecological]] [[restoration ecology|restoration]] of remnant vegetation areas, such as through the minimisation of negative disturbances, both exogenous such as exotic weeds and endogenous such as [[erosion]]. It may also attempt to recreate conditions of pre-European arrival, for example by simulating endogenous disturbances such as fire. Bush [[regeneration (ecology)|regeneration]] attempts to protect and enhance the floral [[biodiversity]] in an area by providing conditions conducive to the recruitment and survival of native plants. Bushcare's Major Day Out is an Australian national day of community participation in the care of bushland. In 2012 nearly 100 bushcare sites participated in this annual event.

==History==

===Bradley method===
In the early 1960s Joan and Eileen Bradley&lt;ref&gt;http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bradley-eileen-burton-9566&lt;/ref&gt; developed a series of weed control techniques through a process of trial and error. Their work was the beginning of minimal disturbance bush regeneration in [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="Buchanan"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Buchanan
  | first = Robin A.
  | authorlink =  
  | title = Bush Regeneration: Recovering Australian Landscapes
  | publisher = The Open Training and Education Network
  | year = 1989
  | location = Redfern}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Bradley method urges a [[Conservation ethic|naturalistic]] approach by encouraging the native vegetation to self-reestablish. The Bradleys used their method to successfully clear weeds from a {{convert|16|ha|acre|abbr=off}}  reserve in Ashton Park, part of Sydney Harbour National Park, NSW. The process demonstrated that, following a period of consecutive 'follow up' treatments of diminishing time requirement, subsequent maintenance was needed only once or twice a year, mainly in vulnerable spots such as [[stream|creek]] banks, roadsides, and clearings, to be maintained weed-free.

The aim of their work was to clear small niches adjacent to healthy native vegetation such that the each area will regenerate from in-situ soil seed banks or be re-colonised and stabilized by the regeneration of native plants, replacing an area previously occupied by weeds. The Bradley method follows three main principles, 
#secure the best areas first
#minimise disturbance to the natural conditions (e.g. minimise soil disturbance and off-target damage).
#don't overclear, let the regenerative ability of the bush set the pace of clearance (Bradley 1988).
The priority securing of the best quality vegetation aids in preserving areas of top [[biodiversity]] which provide regeneration potential to expand these areas and reclaim areas as bushland.

===Modern practice===
The adoption of minimal disturbance bush regeneration increased in the decades that followed the work of the Bradleys. Their principles have guided bushcare programs in Australia, although the inclusion of [[herbicide]] in modern bush regeneration is a notable deviation from the ideals of the Bradley sisters.&lt;ref name="Stenhouse 2004"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rather than 'minimal disturbance', a more favoured and ecologically sound trend since the 1990s has been towards more 'appropriate disturbance' as many Australian plant communities require some level of perturbation to trigger germination from long-buried seed banks.  This has led to a range of additional disturbance-based techniques (such as burns and [[soil resilience|soil disturbance]]) being included in the regenerator's 'tool kit' in dry forest and grassland areas.  Field experience has found that, even in [[rainforest]] areas, a [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] to disturbance is evident, enabling regenerators to clear weed in a fairly extensive manner to trigger rainforest recovery. This is borne out by a thriving rainforest regeneration industry in northern  NSW Australia, modelled on the pioneering work of John Stockard at [[Wingham Brush Nature Reserve|Wingham Brush]] (Stockard 1991, Stockard 1999).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aabr.org.au/the-regeneration-of-wingham-brush-nsw/ &lt;/ref&gt;
The rule of thumb in all cases is to constrain clearing to that area that matches the project's follow up resources.

The increased awareness and consideration of Australia's biodiversity by citizens has incrementally increased pressure on local governments to adopt conservation programs for remnant vegetation on council land. 
Most peri urban councils now have some involvement in bush regeneration, either through planning, land management, volunteer support or through employment of bush regeneration practitioners.&lt;ref name="Stenhouse 2004"/&gt; In NSW the level of coordination of bush regeneration programs through local governments is high, although in some other areas at present a lack of coordination is a serious concern in bush regeneration on public land, with only 40% of councils liaising with other councils.&lt;ref name="Stenhouse 2004"/&gt; In such areas there may be a need for strategic management at a regional scale through Natural Resource Management Boards or non government organisations such as [[Trees For Life (Australia)|Trees For Life]], which are involved in bushcare programs across wider areas.

==Purposes==

The aim of bush regeneration, also known as 'natural area restoration', is to restore and maintain ecosystem health by facilitating the natural regeneration of indigenous flora, this is usually achieved by selectively reducing the competitive interaction with invasive species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  | title = Conservation of Urban Bushland
  | publisher = National Trust of Australia (NSW)
  | year = 1986}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or mitigation of negative influences such as weeds or erosion.&lt;ref name="Buchanan"/&gt; See also [[Albert Morris]].

Invasive plant species are often the greatest threat to remnant vegetation,&lt;ref name="Stenhouse 2004"/&gt; and therefore bush regeneration is closely associated with weed abatement activities. Weed management as one aim of bush regeneration, is used to increase native plant recruitment. The management of factors such as fire and herbivory can be just as important, depending on the ecosystem being restored. In recent years research and on-ground management has begun to recognize the importance of ecosystem processes rather ecosystem composition and structure &lt;ref name=prober&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and research into other ways of facilitating native plant recruitment is increasing.

==Technique==

The original Bradley method of bush regeneration focuses on facilitating native plant recruitment from the [[seedbank]], rather than planting [[seedling]]s or sowing seeds, as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Weeding a little at a time from the bush towards the [[weed]]s takes the pressure off the natives under favourable conditions. Native seeds and spores are ready in the ground and the natural environment favours plants that have evolved in it. The balance is tipped back towards regeneration. Keep it that way, by always working where the strongest area of bush meets the weakest weeds"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last =Bradley
  | first = Joan
  | title = Bringing back the bush
  | publisher = Lansdowne Press
  | year = 1988
  | location = Sydney}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Currently the term 'bush regeneration' includes activities other than weed removal, such as [[replanting]] and introducing species into an area where soil, water, or fire regimes have shifted the type of plant appropriate to the area (e.g. a [[stormwater drain]]).&lt;ref name="Buchanan"/&gt;

Weed species can be important habitat for native fauna (e.g. [[blackberry]] is important habitat for [[Maluridae|wrens]] and the [[southern brown bandicoot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=  Haby
|first= Nerisa
|first2= Kirsten|last2= Long
|title= Recovery Plan for the Southern Brown Bandicoot in the Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia,

|year= 2005
|publisher= Department for Environment and Heritage, South Australia
|location= Adelaide
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and this should be taken into consideration with bush regeneration, for example by not clearing invasive species until adequate habitat alternatives have been established nearby with native vegetation.

Problems can occur when insufficient follow-up is conducted as the success of bush regeneration is dependent on allowing the native vegetation to regenerate in the area where weeds have been removed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3996">'''Diploma in Computer Science''', originally known as the "Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing", was a conversion course in [[Computer Science]] offered by the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]]. It was equivalent to a [[master's degree]] in present-day nomenclature but the title ''diploma'' was retained for historic reasons, "diploma" being the archaic term for a master's degree.

The Diploma was the world's first full-year taught course in computer science, starting in 1953. It attracted students with degrees in mathematics, science and engineering. At its peak, there were 50 students on the course. UK government ([[EPSRC]]) funding was withdrawn in 2001 and student numbers dropped dramatically. In 2007, the University took the decision to withdraw the Diploma at the end of the 2007-08 academical year, after 55 years of service. 

==History==
The introduction of this one-year graduate course was motivated by a [[University of Cambridge]] Mathematics Faculty Board Report on the "demand for postgraduate instruction in numerical analysis and automatic computing … &lt;nowiki&gt;[which]&lt;/nowiki&gt; if not met, there is a danger that the application to scientific research of the machines now being built will be hampered". The [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]] "was one of the pioneers in the de and use of electronic computing-machines (sic)". It had introduced a Summer School in 1950, but the Report noted that "The Summer School deals &lt;nowiki&gt;[only]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with 'programming', rather than the general theory of the numerical methods which are programmed." The Diploma "would include theoretical and practical work … &lt;nowiki&gt;[and also]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instruction about the various types of computing-machine … and the principles of design on which they are based." With only a few students initially, no extra staff would be needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/UoCCL/misc/EDSAC99/history.html Informal history of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

University-supported teaching and research staff in the [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory|Laboratory]] at the time were [[Maurice Wilkes]] (head of the laboratory), [[J. C. P. Miller]], W. Renwick, E. N. Mutch, and S. Gill, joined slightly later by C. B. Haselgrove.

In its final incarnation, the Diploma was a 10-month course, evaluated two-thirds on examination and one-third on a project dissertation. Most of the examined courses were shared by the second year ("Part IB") of the undergraduate [[Computer Science Tripos]] course, with some additional lectures specifically for the Diploma students and four of the third year undergraduate ("Part II") lecture courses also included.

There were three grades of result from the Diploma: distinction (roughly equivalent to first class honours), pass (equivalent to second or third class honours), and fail.

'''Chaos theory''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] focusing on the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s that are highly sensitive to [[initial conditions]]. "Chaos" is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of [[chaotic complex system]]s, there are underlying patterns, constant [[feedback loops]], repetition, [[self-similarity]], [[fractals]], [[self-organization]], and reliance on programming at the initial point known as ''sensitive dependence on initial conditions''. The [[butterfly effect]] describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state, e.g. a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in Texas.&lt;ref name="bo1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/ |author = Boeing |title = Chaos Theory and the Logistic Map |date = 2015 |accessdate = 2015-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation, yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Kellert |first = Stephen H. |title = In the Wake of Chaos: Unpredictable Order in Dynamical Systems |publisher = University of Chicago Press |year = 1993 |isbn = 978-0-226-42976-2 |page = 32 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens even though these systems are [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]], meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no [[randomness|random]] elements involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WerndlCharlotte"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Werndl, Charlotte |title = What are the New Implications of Chaos for Unpredictability? |journal = The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume = 60 |issue = 1 |pages = 195–220 |year = 2009 |url = http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/1/195 |doi = 10.1093/bjps/axn053 |arxiv = 1310.1576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is known as '''deterministic chaos''', or simply '''chaos'''.

The theory formed the basis for such fields of study as [[dynamical systems|complex dynamical systems]], [[edge of chaos]] theory, and [[self-assembly]] processes.

==Introduction==
Chaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can in principle be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; The amount of time that the behavior of a chaotic system can be effectively predicted depends on three things: How much uncertainty can be tolerated in the forecast, how accurately its current state can be measured, and a time scale depending on the dynamics of the system, called the [[Lyapunov time]]. Some examples of Lyapunov times are: chaotic electrical circuits, about 1 millisecond; weather systems, a few  days (unproven); the solar system, 50 million years. In chaotic systems, the uncertainty in a forecast increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with elapsed time. Hence, mathematically, doubling the forecast time more than squares the proportional uncertainty in the forecast. This means, in practice, a meaningful prediction cannot be made over an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time. When meaningful predictions cannot be made, the system appears random.&lt;ref&gt;''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Steven Strogatz, Hyperion, New York, 2003, pages 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaotic dynamics==
[[File:Chaos Sensitive Dependence.svg|thumb|The map defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''y'' → (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1&lt;/span&gt; displays sensitivity to initial x positions. Here, two series of ''x'' and ''y'' values diverge markedly over time from a tiny initial difference.]]
In common usage, "chaos" means "a state of disorder".&lt;ref&gt;Definition of {{linktext|chaos}} at [[Wiktionary]];&lt;/ref&gt; However, in chaos theory, the term is defined more precisely. Although no universally accepted mathematical definition of chaos exists, a commonly used definition originally formulated by [[Robert L. Devaney]] says that, to classify a dynamical system as chaotic, it must have these properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A First Course in Dynamics: With a Panorama of Recent Developments|last=Hasselblatt|first=Boris|author2=Anatole Katok|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58750-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# it must be sensitive to initial conditions
# it must be [[topological mixing|topologically mixing]]
# it must have [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbit]]s

In some cases, the last two properties in the above have been shown to actually imply sensitivity to initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-58488-002-8 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Basener, William F. |title=Topology and its applications |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-68755-9 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, while it is often the most practically significant property, "sensitivity to initial conditions" need not be stated in the definition.

{{Main|Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics}}In continuous time dynamical systems, chaos is the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry which is an intrinsic property of evolution operators of all stochastic and deterministic (partial) differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 2016|title=Introduction to Supersymmetric Theory of Stochastics|journal=Entropy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=108|doi=10.3390/e18040108|author=Ovchinnikov, I.V.|arxiv = 1511.03393 |bibcode = 2016Entrp..18..108O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Topological supersymmetry breaking: Definition and stochastic generalization of chaos and the limit of applicability of statistics|journal=Modern Physics Letters B|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1650086|doi=10.1142/S021798491650086X|author1=Ovchinnikov, I.V.|author2=Schwartz, R. N.|author3=Wang, K. L.|bibcode = 2016MPLB...3050086O |arxiv=1404.4076}}&lt;/ref&gt; This picture of dynamical chaos works not only for deterministic models but also for models with external noise, which is an important generalization from the physical point of view because in reality all dynamical systems experience influence from their stochastic environments. Within this picture, the long-range dynamical behavior associated with chaotic dynamics, e.g., the [[butterfly effect]], is a consequence of the [[Goldstone's theorem]] in the application to the spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking.

===Sensitivity to initial conditions===
{{Main|Butterfly effect}}
[[File:SensInitCond.gif|thumb|Lorenz equations used to generate plots for the y variable. The initial conditions for ''x'' and ''z'' were kept the same but those for ''y'' were changed between '''1.001''', '''1.0001''' and '''1.00001'''. The values for &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; were '''45.92''', '''16''' and '''4 ''' respectively. As can be seen, even the slightest difference in initial values causes significant changes after about 12 seconds of evolution in the three cases. This is an example of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.]]
'''Sensitivity to initial conditions''' means that each point in a chaotic system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future paths, or trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small change, or perturbation, of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.

Sensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the "[[butterfly effect]]", so-called because of the title of a paper given by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1972 to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Washington, D.C., entitled ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?''. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events that prevents the predictability of large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the overall system would have been vastly different.

A consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most prevalent in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.&lt;ref name="RGW"&gt;{{cite book |author=Watts, Robert G. |title=Global Warming and the Future of the Earth |publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool |year=2007 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this does not mean that we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100&amp;nbsp;°C or fall to −130&amp;nbsp;°C on earth (during the current [[geologic era]]), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.

In more mathematical terms, the [[Lyapunov exponent]] measures the sensitivity to initial conditions. Given two starting [[trajectory|trajectories]] in the [[phase space]] that are infinitesimally close, with initial separation &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{Z}_0&lt;/math&gt;, the two trajectories end up diverging at a rate given by

:&lt;math&gt; | \delta\mathbf{Z}(t) | \approx e^{\lambda t} | \delta \mathbf{Z}_0 |,&lt;/math&gt;

where t is the time and λ is the Lyapunov exponent. The rate of separation depends on the orientation of the initial separation vector, so a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents exist. The number of Lyapunov exponents is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space, though it is common to just refer to the largest one. For example, the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) is most often used because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.

Also, other properties relate to sensitivity of initial conditions, such as [[Measure (mathematics)|measure-theoretical]] [[Mixing (mathematics)|mixing]] (as discussed in [[ergodicity|ergodic]] theory) and properties of a [[Kolmogorov automorphism|K-system]].&lt;ref name="WerndlCharlotte" /&gt;

===Topological mixing===
[[File:LogisticTopMixing1-6.gif|thumb|Six iterations of a set of states &lt;math&gt;[x,y]&lt;/math&gt;  passed through the logistic map. (a) the blue plot (legend 1) shows the first iterate (initial condition), which essentially forms a circle. Animation shows the first to the sixth iteration of the circular initial conditions. It can be seen that ''mixing'' occurs as we progress in iterations. The sixth iteration shows that the points are almost completely scattered in the phase space. Had we progressed further in iterations, the mixing would have been homogeneous and irreversible. The logistic map has equation &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1} = 4  x_k  (1 - x_k )&lt;/math&gt;. To expand the state-space of the logistic map into two dimensions,  a second state, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, was created as &lt;math&gt;y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x_k + y_k &lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k -1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.]]
[[File:Chaos Topological Mixing.png|thumb|The map defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''y'' → (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1&lt;/span&gt; also displays [[topological mixing]]. Here, the blue region is transformed by the dynamics first to the purple region, then to the pink and red regions, and eventually to a cloud of vertical lines scattered across the space.]]

'''[[Topological mixing]]''' (or '''topological transitivity''') means that the system evolves over time so that any given region or [[open set]] of its [[phase space]] eventually overlaps with any other given region. This mathematical concept of "mixing" corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored [[dye]]s or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.

Topological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with only sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points eventually becomes widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behavior: all points except 0 tend to positive or negative infinity.

===Density of periodic orbits===
For a chaotic system to have [[Dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]] means that every point in the space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devaney|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt; (or approximately 0.3454915&amp;nbsp;→ 0.9045085&amp;nbsp;→ 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc. (indeed, for all the periods specified by [[Sharkovskii's theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alligood|Sauer|Yorke|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharkovskii's theorem is the basis of the Li and Yorke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li |first1=T.Y. |last2=Yorke |first2=J.A. |title=Period Three Implies Chaos |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=82 |pages=985–92 |year=1975 |url=http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf |format=PDF |author-link=Tien-Yien Li |doi=10.2307/2318254 |issue=10 |author2-link=James A.

===Strange attractors===
[[File:TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] displays chaotic behavior.  These two plots demonstrate sensitive dependence on initial conditions within the region of phase space occupied by the attractor.]]
Some dynamical systems, like the one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x''),&lt;/span&gt; are chaotic everywhere, but in many cases chaotic behavior is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior takes place on an [[attractor]], since then a large set of initial conditions leads to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strelioff|first1=Christopher|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Medium-Term Prediction of Chaos|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2006|volume=96|issue=4|pages=044101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.044101|pmid=16486826|bibcode = 2006PhRvL..96d4101S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An easy way to visualize a chaotic attractor is to start with a point in the [[basin of attraction]] of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor.  This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the [[Edward Lorenz|Lorenz]] weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern that, with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.

Unlike [[Attractor#Fixed point|fixed-point attractors]] and [[limit cycle]]s, the attractors that arise from chaotic systems, known as [[strange attractor]]s, have great detail and complexity.  Strange attractors occur in both [[continuous function|continuous]] dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] systems (such as the [[Hénon map]]). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a [[Julia set]], which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points. Julia sets can be thought of as strange repellers. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a [[fractal]] structure, and the [[fractal dimension]] can be calculated for them.

===Minimum complexity of a chaotic system===
[[File:LogisticMap BifurcationDiagram.png|thumb|right|[[Bifurcation diagram]] of the [[logistic map]] &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → ''r'' ''x'' (1 – ''x'').&lt;/span&gt;  Each vertical slice shows the attractor for a specific value of ''r''.  The diagram displays [[Period-doubling bifurcation|period-doubling]] as ''r'' increases, eventually producing chaos.]]

Discrete chaotic systems, such as the logistic map, can exhibit strange attractors whatever their [[dimension]]ality. In contrast, for [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] dynamical systems, the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] shows that a strange attractor can only arise in three or more dimensions.  [[Dimension (vector space)|Finite-dimensional]] [[linear system]]s are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it must be either [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] or infinite-dimensional.

The [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] states that a two-dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed below is generated by a system of three [[differential equation]]s such as:
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \sigma y - \sigma x, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \rho x - x z - y, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= x y - \beta z.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; make up the [[State space representation|system state]], &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are the system [[parameter]]s. Five of the terms on the right hand side are linear, while two are quadratic; a total of seven terms. Another well-known chaotic attractor is generated by the [[Rössler map|Rössler equations]], which have only one nonlinear term out of seven. Sprott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sprott |first=J.C.|year=1997|title=Simplest dissipative chaotic flow|journal=[[Physics Letters A]]|volume=228|issue=4–5 |pages=271–274|doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00088-1|bibcode = 1997PhLA..228..271S }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a three-dimensional system with just five terms, that had only one nonlinear term, which exhibits chaos for certain parameter values.

The reason is, simply put, that solutions to such systems are asymptotic to a two-dimensional surface and therefore solutions are well behaved.

While the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem shows that a continuous dynamical system on the Euclidean [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] cannot be chaotic, two-dimensional continuous systems with [[non-Euclidean geometry]] can exhibit chaotic behavior.&lt;ref name="Rosario 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosario|first=Pedro|title=Underdetermination of Science: Part I|date=2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1411693913}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps surprisingly, chaos may occur also in linear systems, provided they are infinite dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A theory of linear chaos is being developed in a branch of mathematical analysis known as [[functional analysis]].

=== Jerk systems ===
In [[physics]], [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] is the third derivative of [[position (vector)|position]], with respect to time.  As such, differential equations of the form
:: &lt;math&gt;J\left(\overset{...}{x},\ddot{x},\dot {x},x\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
are sometimes called ''Jerk equations''. It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first order, ordinary, non-linear differential equations, is in a certain sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This motivates mathematical interest in jerk systems. Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are called accordingly hyperjerk systems.&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Chlouverakis and J. C. Sprott, Chaos Solitons &amp; Fractals 28, 739–746 (2005), Chaotic Hyperjerk Systems, http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper297.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A jerk system's behavior is described by a jerk equation, and for certain jerk equations, simple electronic circuits can model solutions. These circuits are known as jerk circuits.

One of the most interesting properties of jerk circuits is the possibility of chaotic behavior. In fact, certain well-known chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor and the [[Rössler map]], are conventionally described as a system of three first-order differential equations that can combine into a single (although rather complicated) jerk equation. Nonlinear jerk systems are in a sense minimally complex systems to show chaotic behaviour; there is no chaotic system involving only two first-order, ordinary differential equations (the system resulting in an equation of second order only).

An example of a jerk equation with nonlinearity in the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^3 x}{\mathrm{d} t^3}+A\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d} t^2}+\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t}-|x|+1=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''A'' is an adjustable parameter. This equation has a chaotic solution for ''A''=3/5 and can be implemented with the following jerk circuit; the required nonlinearity is brought about by the two diodes:

[[File:JerkCircuit01.png|frameless|upright=1.4|center]]

In the above circuit, all resistors are of equal value, except &lt;math&gt;R_A=R/A=5R/3&lt;/math&gt;, and all capacitors are of equal size. The dominant frequency is &lt;math&gt;1/2\pi R C&lt;/math&gt;. The output of [[operational amplifier|op amp]] 0 will correspond to the x variable, the output of 1 corresponds to the first derivative of x and the output of 2 corresponds to the second derivative.

==Spontaneous order==
Under the right conditions, chaos spontaneously evolves into a lockstep pattern. In the [[Kuramoto model]], four conditions suffice to produce synchronization in a chaotic system.
Examples include the [[coupled oscillation]] of [[Christiaan Huygens]]' pendulums, fireflies, [[neuron]]s, the [[London Millennium Bridge]] resonance, and large arrays of [[Josephson junctions]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Strogatz, ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Hyperion, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early proponent of chaos theory was [[Henri Poincaré]]. In the 1880s, while studying the [[three-body problem]], he found that there can be orbits that are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poincaré, Jules Henri |title=Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique.

Despite initial insights in the first half of the twentieth century, chaos theory became formalized as such only after mid-century, when it first became evident to some scientists that [[linear theory]], the prevailing system theory at that time, simply could not explain the observed behavior of certain experiments like that of the [[logistic map]]. What had been attributed to measure imprecision and simple "[[Pseudorandom noise|noise]]" was considered by chaos theorists as a full component of the studied systems.

The main catalyst for the development of chaos theory was the electronic computer. Much of the mathematics of chaos theory involves the repeated [[iteration]] of simple mathematical formulas, which would be impractical to do by hand. Electronic computers made these repeated calculations practical, while figures and images made it possible to visualize these systems. As a graduate student in [[Chihiro Hayashi]]'s laboratory at Kyoto University, [[Yoshisuke Ueda]] was experimenting with analog computers and noticed, on November 27, 1961, what he called "randomly transitional phenomena".  Yet his advisor did not agree with his conclusions at the time, and did not allow him to report his findings until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abraham|Ueda|2001|loc=See Chapters 3 and 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sprott|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SEDjdjPZ158C&amp;pg=PA89 89]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turbulence]] in the [[Wingtip vortices|tip vortex]] from an [[airplane]] wing. Studies of the critical point beyond which a system creates turbulence were important for chaos theory, analyzed for example by the [[Soviet physicists|Soviet physicist]] [[Lev Landau]], who developed the [[Landau-Hopf theory of turbulence]]. [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] later predicted, against Landau, that [[fluid turbulence]] could develop through a [[strange attractor]], a main concept of chaos theory.]]

[[Edward Lorenz]] was an early pioneer of the theory. His interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on [[meteorology|weather prediction]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=Lorenz1961&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lorenz, Edward N. |title=Deterministic non-periodic flow |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume=20 |pages=130–141 |year=1963 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issue=2 |bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]], to run his weather simulation. He wanted to see a sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Chaos: Making a New Science]] |last=Gleick |first=James |year=1987 |publisher=Cardinal |location=London|page=17|isbn=978-0-434-29554-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to [[Lorenz attractor]]s, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.

In 1963, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] found recurring patterns at every scale in data on cotton prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Benoît|last = Mandelbrot|year = 1963|title = The variation of certain speculative prices|journal = Journal of Business|volume = 36|pages = 394–419|doi = 10.1086/294632|issue = 4|jstor=2350970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beforehand he had studied [[information theory]] and concluded noise was patterned like a [[Cantor set]]: on any scale the proportion of noise-containing periods to error-free periods was a constant – thus errors were inevitable and must be planned for by incorporating redundancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Berger J.M. |author2=Mandelbrot B. | year = 1963 | title = A new model for error clustering in telephone circuits | journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development | volume = 7 |issue=3 | pages = 224–236 | doi=10.1147/rd.73.0224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot described both the "Noah effect" (in which sudden discontinuous changes can occur) and the "Joseph effect" (in which persistence of a value can occur for a while, yet suddenly change afterwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mandelbrot, B. |title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature |publisher=Freeman |location=New York |year=1977 |page=248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{cite book |last1=Mandelbrot |first1=Benoît B. |last2=Hudson |first2=Richard L. |title=The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2004 |page=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This challenged the idea that changes in price were [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. In 1967, he published "[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|How long is the coast of Britain? Statistical self-similarity and fractional dimension]]", showing that a coastline's length varies with the scale of the measuring instrument, resembles itself at all scales, and is infinite in length for an [[infinitesimal]]ly small measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît |title=How Long Is the Coast of Britain?

An object whose irregularity is constant over different scales ("self-similarity") is a [[fractal]] (examples include the [[Menger sponge]], the [[Sierpiński gasket]], and the [[Koch curve]] or ''snowflake'', which is infinitely long yet encloses a finite space and has a [[fractal dimension]] of circa 1.2619). In 1982, Mandelbrot published ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'', which became a classic of chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, B.|title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature|date=1982|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0716711865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological systems such as the branching of the circulatory and bronchial systems proved to fit a fractal model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buldyrev |first1=S.V. |last2=Goldberger |first2=A.L. | last3=Havlin |first3=S. | authorlink3=Shlomo Havlin|last4=Peng |first4=C.K. | last5=Stanley | first5=H.E. |authorlink5=H.

In December 1977, the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] organized the first symposium on chaos, attended by David Ruelle, [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]], [[James A. Yorke]] (coiner of the term "chaos" as used in mathematics), [[Robert Shaw (physicist)|Robert Shaw]], and the meteorologist Edward Lorenz. The following year, independently [[Pierre Coullet]] and [[Charles Tresser]] with the article "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation" and [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] with the article "Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations" described logistic maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mitchell |last=Feigenbaum |title=Quantitative universality for a class of nonlinear transformations |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=25–52 |date=July 1978 |doi=10.1007/BF01020332 |bibcode=1978JSP....19...25F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coullet, Pierre, and Charles Tresser. "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation." Le Journal de Physique Colloques 39.C5 (1978): C5-25&lt;/ref&gt;  They notably discovered the [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality]] in chaos, permitting the application of chaos theory to many different phenomena.

In 1979, [[Albert J. Libchaber]], during a symposium organized in Aspen by [[Pierre Hohenberg]], presented his experimental observation of the [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] cascade that leads to chaos and turbulence in [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]] systems. He was awarded the [[Wolf Prize in Physics]] in 1986 along with [[Mitchell J. Feigenbaum]] for their inspiring achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wolffund.org.il/cat.asp?id=25&amp;cat_title=PHYSICS|title = The Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the New York Academy of Sciences co-organized with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and the [[Office of Naval Research]] the first important conference on chaos in biology and medicine. There, [[Bernardo Huberman]] presented a mathematical model of the [[eye tracking disorder]] among [[schizophrenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Bernardo Huberman |author=Huberman, B.A. |title=A Model for Dysfunctions in Smooth Pursuit Eye Movement |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=504 Perspectives in Biological Dynamics and Theoretical Medicine |pages=260–273 |date=July 1987 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb48737.x |bibcode = 1987NYASA.504..260H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a renewal of [[physiology]] in the 1980s through the application of chaos theory, for example, in the study of pathological [[cardiac cycle]]s.

In 1987, [[Per Bak]], [[Chao Tang]] and [[Kurt Wiesenfeld]] published a paper in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bak, Per; Tang, Chao; Wiesenfeld, Kurt |title=Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=381–4 |date=27 July 1987 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381 |bibcode=1987PhRvL..59..381B|last2=Tang |last3=Wiesenfeld }} However, the conclusions of this article have been subject to dispute. {{cite web|url=http://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |title=? |work= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214033929/https://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |archivedate=2007-12-14 |df= }}. See especially: {{cite journal |author1=Laurson, Lasse |author2=Alava, Mikko J. |author3=Zapperi, Stefano |title=Letter: Power spectra of self-organized critical sand piles |journal=Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment |volume=0511 |id=L001 |date=15 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing for the first time [[self-organized criticality]] (SOC), considered one of the mechanisms by which [[complexity]] arises in nature.

Alongside largely lab-based approaches such as the [[Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile]], many other investigations have focused on large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display [[scale invariance|scale-invariant]] behavior. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including [[earthquake]]s, (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the [[Gutenberg–Richter law]] describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the [[Aftershock|Omori law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Omori, F. |title=On the aftershocks of earthquakes |journal=Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo |volume=7 |pages=111–200 |year=1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the frequency of aftershocks), [[solar flare]]s, fluctuations in economic systems such as [[financial market]]s (references to SOC are common in [[econophysics]]), [[landscape formation]], [[forest fire]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[epidemic]]s, and [[biological evolution]] (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of "[[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]]" put forward by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of [[war]]s. These investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.

In the same year, [[James Gleick]] published ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'', which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public, though his history under-emphasized important Soviet contributions.{{citation needed|reason=No reason given for soviet under-emphasis|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|title=Chaos: Making a New Science|date=August 26, 2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0143113454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the domain of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of [[nonlinear system]]s analysis. Alluding to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s concept of a [[paradigm shift]] exposed in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), many "chaologists" (as some described themselves) claimed that this new theory was an example of such a shift, a thesis upheld by Gleick.

The availability of cheaper, more powerful computers broadens the applicability of chaos theory. Currently, chaos theory remains an active area of research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Motter | first1 = A. E. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = D.

=== Cryptography ===
Chaos theory has been used for many years in [[cryptography]]. In the past few decades, chaos and nonlinear dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of [[cryptographic primitive]]s. These algorithms include image [[encryption algorithms]], [[hash functions]], [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|secure pseudo-random number generators]], [[stream ciphers]], [[Digital watermarking|watermarking]] and [[steganography]].&lt;ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akhavan|first=A.|last2=Samsudin|first2=A.|last3=Akhshani|first3=A.|date=2011-10-01|title=A symmetric image encryption scheme based on combination of nonlinear chaotic maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003211001104|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|volume=348|issue=8|pages=1797–1813|doi=10.1016/j.jfranklin.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the control parameters and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behnia|first=S.|last2=Akhshani|first2=A.|last3=Mahmodi|first3=H.|last4=Akhavan|first4=A.|date=2008-01-01|title=A novel algorithm for image encryption based on mixture of chaotic maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077906004681|journal=Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals|volume=35|issue=2|pages=408–419|doi=10.1016/j.chaos.2006.05.011|bibcode = 2008CSF....35..408B }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a wider perspective, without loss of generality, the similarities between the chaotic maps and the cryptographic systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based cryptographic algorithms.&lt;ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813"/&gt; One type of encryption, secret key or [[symmetric key]], relies on [[diffusion and confusion]], which is modeled well by chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xingyuan|year=2012|title=An improved key agreement protocol based on chaos|journal=Commun.

=== Robotics ===
Robotics is another area that has recently benefited from chaos theory. Instead of robots acting in a trial-and-error type of refinement to interact with their environment, chaos theory has been used to build a [[Predictive modelling|predictive model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nehmzow|first=Ulrich|date=Dec 2005|title=Quantitative description of robot–environment interaction using chaos theory|journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems|volume=53|issue=3–4|pages=177–193|doi=10.1016/j.robot.2005.09.009|author2=Keith Walker|url=http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|access-date=2017-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812003513/http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chaotic dynamics have been exhibited by [[Passive dynamics|passive walking]] biped robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goswami|first=Ambarish|year=1998|title=A Study of the Passive Gait of a Compass-Like Biped Robot: Symmetry and Chaos|journal=The International Journal of Robotics Research|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1282–1301|doi=10.1177/027836499801701202|author2=Thuilot, Benoit|author3=Espiau, Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
For over a hundred years, biologists have been keeping track of populations of different species with [[population model]]s. Most models are [[continuous function|continuous]], but recently scientists have been able to implement chaotic models in certain populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eduardo|first=Liz|author2=Ruiz-Herrera, Alfonso|title=Chaos in discrete structured population models|journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems|year=2012|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1200–1214|doi=10.1137/120868980}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study on models of [[Canada lynx|Canadian lynx]] showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lai|first=Dejian|title=Comparison study of AR models on the Canadian lynx data: a close look at BDS statistic|journal=Computational Statistics \&amp; Data Analysis|year=1996|volume=22|issue=4|pages=409–423|doi=10.1016/0167-9473(95)00056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as [[hydrology]]. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sivakumar|first=B|title=Chaos theory in hydrology: important issues and interpretations|journal=Journal of Hydrology|date=31 January 2000|volume=227|issue=1–4|pages=1–20|bibcode=2000JHyd..227....1S|doi=10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00186-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another biological application is found in [[cardiotocography]]. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of [[Intrauterine hypoxia|fetal hypoxia]] can be obtained through chaotic modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bozóki|first=Zsolt|title=Chaos theory and power spectrum analysis in computerized cardiotocography|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|date=February 1997|volume=71|issue=2|pages=163–168|doi=10.1016/s0301-2115(96)02628-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, predicting gas solubility is essential to manufacturing [[polymers]], but models using [[particle swarm optimization]] (PSO) tend to converge to the wrong points. An improved version of PSO has been created by introducing chaos, which keeps the simulations from getting stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Mengshan|author2=Xingyuan Huanga|author3=Hesheng Liua|author4=Bingxiang Liub|author5=Yan Wub|author6=Aihua Xiongc|author7=Tianwen Dong|title=Prediction of gas solubility in polymers by back propagation artificial neural network based on self-adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm and chaos theory|journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria|date=25 October 2013|volume=356|pages=11–17|doi=10.1016/j.fluid.2013.07.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[celestial mechanics]], especially when observing asteroids, applying chaos theory leads to better predictions about when these objects will approach Earth and other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=A.|title=Chaotic diffusion in celestial mechanics|journal=Regular &amp; Chaotic Dynamics |year=2001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=339–353|doi=10.1070/rd2001v006n04abeh000182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the five [[moons of Pluto]] rotate chaotically.

Until recently, there was no reliable way to predict when they would occur.

Chaos theory can be applied outside of the natural sciences, but historically nearly all such studies have suffered from lack of reproducibility; poor external validity; and/or inattention to cross-validation, resulting in poor predictive accuracy (if out-of-sample prediction has even been attempted).

Researchers have continued to apply chaos theory to psychology. For example, in modeling group behavior in which heterogeneous members may behave as if sharing to different degrees what in [[Wilfred Bion]]'s theory is a  basic assumption, researchers have found that the group dynamic is the result of the individual dynamics of the members: each individual reproduces the group dynamics in a different scale, and the chaotic behavior of the group is reflected in each member.&lt;ref name="Dal FornoMerlone2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo | title = Nonlinear dynamics in work groups with Bion's basic assumptions | journal = Nonlinear Dynamics, Psychology, and Life Sciences | volume = 17| issue=2 | year = 2013 | pages = 295–315 | issn = 1090-0578  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redington and Reidbord (1992) attempted to demonstrate that the human heart could display chaotic traits.  They monitored the changes in between-heartbeat intervals for a single psychotherapy patient as she moved through periods of varying emotional intensity during a therapy session.  Results were admittedly inconclusive.  Not only were there ambiguities in the various plots the authors produced to purportedly show evidence of chaotic dynamics (spectral analysis, phase trajectory, and autocorrelation plots), but when they attempted to compute a Lyapunov exponent as more definitive confirmation of chaotic behavior, the authors found they could not reliably do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redington|first=D. J.|last2=Reidbord|first2=S. P.|title=Chaotic dynamics in autonomic nervous system activity of a patient during a psychotherapy session|journal=Biological Psychiatry|date=1992|volume=31|issue=10|pages=993–1007|pmid=1511082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1995 paper, Metcalf and Allen  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Metcalf |first1= B. R. | last2 = Allen |first2= J. D. |editor1-first=F. D. |editor1-last= Abraham |editor2-first=A. R. | editor2-last=Gilgen |title= Chaos theory in psychology |publisher= Greenwood Press |year=1995 |chapter= In search of chaos in schedule-induced polydipsia }}&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that they uncovered in animal behavior a pattern of period doubling leading to chaos.  The authors examined a well-known response called schedule-induced polydipsia, by which an animal deprived of food for certain lengths of time will drink unusual amounts of water when the food is at last presented.  The control parameter (r) operating here was the length of the interval between feedings, once resumed.  The authors were careful to test a large number of animals and to include many replications, and they designed their experiment so as to rule out the likelihood that changes in response patterns were caused by different starting places for r.

Time series and first delay plots provide the best support for the claims made, showing a fairly clear march from periodicity to irregularity as the feeding times were increased.  The various phase trajectory plots and spectral analyses, on the other hand, do not match up well enough with the other graphs or with the overall theory to lead inexorably to a chaotic diagnosis.  For example, the phase trajectories do not show a definite progression towards greater and greater complexity (and away from periodicity); the process seems quite muddied.  Also, where Metcalf and Allen saw periods of two and six in their spectral plots, there is room for alternative interpretations.  All of this ambiguity necessitate some serpentine, post-hoc explanation to show that results fit a chaotic model.

By adapting a model of career counseling to include a chaotic interpretation of the relationship between employees and the job market, Aniundson and Bright found that better suggestions can be made to people struggling with career decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pryor|first=Robert G.

For instance, [[team building]] and [[group development]] is increasingly being researched as an inherently unpredictable system, as the uncertainty of different individuals meeting for the first time makes the trajectory of the team unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Johnstone|first2=James|last3=Banks|first3=Curt|date=2018|title=An examination of initiation rituals in a UK sporting institution and the impact on group development|url=http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say the chaos metaphor—used in verbal theories—grounded on mathematical models and psychological aspects of human behavior
provides helpful insights to describing the complexity of small work groups, that go beyond the metaphor itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo |editor1-first=Gian Italo |editor1-last=Bischi  |editor2-first=Carl | editor2-last=Chiarella |editor3-first=Irina | editor3-last=Shusko |title=Global Analysis of Dynamic Models in Economics and Finance |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2013 |pages=185–204 |chapter= Chaotic Dynamics in Organization Theory |isbn= 978-3-642-29503-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It  is possible that economic models can also be improved through an application of chaos theory, but predicting the health of an economic system and what factors influence it most is an extremely complex task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juárez|first=Fernando|title=Applying the theory of chaos and a complex model of health to establish relations among financial indicators|journal=Procedia Computer Science|year=2011|volume=3|pages=982–986|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic and financial systems are fundamentally different from those in the classical natural sciences since the former are inherently stochastic in nature, as they result from the interactions of people, and thus pure deterministic models are unlikely to provide accurate representations of the data. The empirical literature that tests for chaos in economics and finance presents very mixed results, in part due to confusion between specific tests for chaos and more general tests for non-linear relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Brooks (academic)|title=Chaos in foreign exchange markets: a sceptical view |journal=Computational Economics|year=1998 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=265–281 |issn=1572-9974 |doi=10.1023/A:1008650024944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic forecasting may benefit from applications of chaos theory. Better predictions of when traffic will occur would allow measures to be taken to disperse it before it would have occurred. Combining chaos theory principles with a few other methods has led to a more accurate short-term prediction model (see the plot of the BML traffic model at right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jin|author2=Qixin Shi|title=Short-term traffic speed forecasting hybrid model based on Chaos–Wavelet Analysis-Support Vector Machine theory|journal=Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies|date=February 2013|volume=27|pages=219–232|doi=10.1016/j.trc.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos theory has been applied to environmental [[water cycle]] data (aka hydrological data), such as rainfall and streamflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/chaos-hydrology/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack – Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics :: Chaos in Hydrology|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies have yielded controversial results, because the methods for detecting a chaotic signature are often relatively subjective.  Early studies tended to "succeed" in finding chaos, whereas subsequent studies and meta-analyses called those studies into question and provided explanations for why these datasets are not likely to have low-dimension chaotic dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|date=1999-11-01|title=Does the river run wild?

In the music context, the term '''chroma feature''' or '''chromagram''' closely relates to the twelve different [[pitch classes]]. Chroma-based features, which are also referred to [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]], are a powerful tool for analyzing music whose pitches can be meaningfully categorized (often into twelve categories) and whose tuning approximates to the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]]. One main property of chroma features is that they capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation.

==Definition==

The underyling observation is that humans perceive two musical pitches as similar in color if they differ by an octave. Based on this observation, a pitch can be separated into two components, which are referred to as ''tone height'' and ''chroma''.&lt;ref name=Shepard64_pitch_ASA&gt;

|title=Circularity in judgments of relative pitch
|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America
|volume=36
|issue=212
|date=1964
|pages=2346–2353}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]], one considers twelve chroma values represented by the set

:{C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}, E ,F, F{{music|#}}, G, G{{music|#}}, A, A{{music|#}}, B}

that consists of the twelve pitch spelling attributes as used in Western music notation. Note that in the equal-tempered scale different pitch spellings such
C{{music|#}} and D{{music|b}} refer to the same chroma. Enumerating the chroma values, one can identify the set of chroma values with the set of integers {1,2,...,12}, where 1 refers to chroma C, 2 to C{{music|#}}, and so on. A [[pitch class]] is defined as the set of all pitches that share the same chroma. For example, using the [[scientific pitch notation]], the pitch class corresponding to the chroma C is the set

:{..., C&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ...}

consisting of all pitches separated by an integer number of octaves. Given a music representation (e.g. a musical score or an audio recording), the  main idea of chroma features is to aggregate for a given local time window (e.g. specified in beats or in seconds) all information that relates to a given chroma into a single coefficient. Shifting the time window across the music representation results in a sequence of chroma features each expressing how the representation's pitch content within the time window is spread over the twelve chroma bands. The resulting time-chroma representation is also referred to as [[chromagram]]. The figure above shows chromagrams for a C-major scale, once obtained from a musical score and once from an audio recording. Because of the close relation between the terms chroma and pitch class, chroma features are also referred to as [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]].

==Applications==
Identifying pitches that differ by an octave, chroma features show a high degree of robustness to variations in timbre and closely correlate to the musical aspect of harmony. This is the reason why chroma features are a well-established tool for processing and analyzing music data.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_FundamentalsMusicProcessig_SPRINGER&gt;

==Computation of audio chromagrams==
There are many ways for converting an audio recording into a chromagram. For example, the conversion of an audio recording into a chroma representation (or chromagram) may be performed either by using short-time Fourier transforms in combination with binning strategies&lt;ref name=BartschW05_chroma_IEEEMULTIMEDIA&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; or by employing suitable multirate filter banks.&lt;ref name=MuellerKC05_ChromaFeatures_ISMIR/&gt;
Furthermore, the properties of chroma features can be significantly changed by
introducing suitable pre- and post-processing steps modifying spectral, temporal,
and dynamical aspects. This leads to a large number of chroma variants, which
may show a quite different behavior in the context of a specific music analysis scenario.&lt;ref name=MuellerE11_ChromaToolbox_ISMIR&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''corecursion''' is a type of operation that is [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to [[recursion (computer science)|recursion]]. Whereas recursion works analytically, starting on data further from a base case and breaking it down into smaller data and repeating until one reaches a base case, corecursion works synthetically, starting from a base case and building it up, iteratively producing data further removed from a base case. Put simply, corecursive algorithms use the data that they themselves produce, bit by bit, as they become available, and needed, to produce further bits of data. A similar but distinct concept is ''[[Generative_recursion#Structural_versus_generative_recursion|generative recursion]]'' which may lack a definite "direction" inherent in corecursion and recursion.

Where recursion allows programs to operate on arbitrarily complex data, so long as they can be reduced to simple data (base cases), corecursion allows programs to produce arbitrarily complex and potentially infinite data structures, such as [[stream (computing)|stream]]s, so long as it can be produced from simple data (base cases) in a sequence of ''finite'' steps. Where recursion may not terminate, never reaching a base state, corecursion starts from a base state, and thus produces subsequent steps deterministically, though it may proceed indefinitely (and thus not terminate under strict evaluation), or it may consume more than it produces and thus become non-''productive''. Many functions that are traditionally analyzed as recursive can alternatively, and arguably more naturally, be interpreted as corecursive functions that are terminated at a given stage, for example [[recurrence relation]]s such as the factorial.

Corecursion can produce both [[Finite set|finite]] and [[Infinite set|infinite]] [[data structure]]s as results, and may employ [[self-reference|self-referential]] data structures. Corecursion is often used in conjunction with [[lazy evaluation]], to produce only a finite subset of a potentially infinite structure (rather than trying to produce an entire infinite structure at once). Corecursion is a particularly important concept in [[functional programming]], where corecursion and [[codata (computer science)|codata]] allow [[total language]]s to work with infinite data structures.

== Examples ==
Corecursion can be understood by contrast with recursion, which is more familiar. While corecursion is primarily of interest in functional programming, it can be illustrated using imperative programming, which is done below using the [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]] facility in Python. In these examples local variables are used, and [[Assignment (computer science)|assigned values]] imperatively (destructively), though these are not necessary in corecursion in pure functional programming. In pure functional programming, rather than assigning to local variables, these computed values form an invariable sequence, and prior values are accessed by self-reference (later values in the sequence reference earlier values in the sequence to be computed). The assignments simply express this in the imperative paradigm and explicitly specify where the computations happen, which serves to clarify the exposition.

=== Factorial ===
A classic example of recursion is computing the [[factorial]], which is defined recursively by ''0! := 1'' and ''n! := n × (n - 1)!''.

To ''recursively'' compute its result on a given input, a recursive function calls (a copy of) ''itself'' with a different ("smaller" in some way) input and uses the result of this call to construct its result. The recursive call does the same, unless the ''base case'' has been reached. Thus a [[call stack]] develops in the process. For example, to compute ''fac(3)'', this recursively calls in turn ''fac(2)'', ''fac(1)'', ''fac(0)'' ("winding up" the stack), at which point recursion terminates with ''fac(0) = 1'', and then the stack unwinds in reverse order and the results are calculated on the way back along the call stack to the initial call frame ''fac(3)'' that uses the result of ''fac(2) = 2'' to calculate the final result as ''3 × 2 = 3 × fac(2) =: fac(3)'' and finally return ''fac(3) = 6''. In this example a function returns a single value.

This stack unwinding can be explicated, defining the factorial ''corecursively'', as an [[Iteration|iterator]], where one ''starts'' with the case of &lt;math&gt;1 =: 0!&lt;/math&gt;, then from this starting value constructs factorial values for increasing numbers ''1, 2, 3...'' as in the above recursive definition with "time arrow" reversed, as it were, by reading it ''backwards'' as {{nobreak|&lt;math&gt;n! \times (n+1) =: (n+1)!&lt;/math&gt;.}} The corecursive algorithm thus defined produces a ''stream'' of ''all'' factorials. This may be concretely implemented as a [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]]. Symbolically, noting that computing next factorial value requires keeping track of both ''n'' and ''f'' (a previous factorial value), this can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt;n, f = (0, 1) : (n + 1, f \times (n+1))&lt;/math&gt;
or in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
  (\(n,f) -&gt; (n+1, f*(n+1))) `iterate` (0,1)
&lt;/source&gt;
meaning, "starting from &lt;math&gt;n, f = 0, 1&lt;/math&gt;, on each step the next values are calculated as &lt;math&gt;n+1, f \times (n+1)&lt;/math&gt;". This is mathematically equivalent and almost identical to the recursive definition, but the &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; emphasizes that the factorial values are being built ''up'', going forwards from the starting case, rather than being computed after first going backwards, ''down'' to the base case, with a &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; decrement. Note also that the direct output of the corecursive function does not simply contain the factorial &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; values, but also includes for each value the auxiliary data of its index ''n'' in the sequence, so that any one specific result can be selected among them all, as and when needed.

Note the connection with [[denotational semantics]], where the [[Denotational semantics#Denotations of recursive programs|denotations of recursive programs]] is built up corecursively in this way.

In Python, a recursive factorial function can be defined as:{{efn|Not validating input data.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This could then be called for example as &lt;code&gt;factorial(5)&lt;/code&gt; to compute ''5!''.

A corresponding corecursive generator can be defined as:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def factorials():
    n, f = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield f
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This generates an infinite stream of factorials in order; a finite portion of it can be produced by:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def n_factorials(k):
    n, f = 0, 1
    while n &lt;= k:
        yield f
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This could then be called to produce the factorials up to ''5!'' via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for f in n_factorials(5):
    print(f)
&lt;/source&gt;
If we're only interested in a certain factorial, just the last value can be taken, or we can fuse the production and the access into one function,
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def nth_factorial(k):
    n, f = 0, 1
    while n &lt; k:
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
    yield f
&lt;/source&gt;
As can be readily seen here, this is practically equivalent (just by substituting &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; for the only &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; there) to the accumulator argument technique for [[tail call|tail recursion]], unwound into an explicit loop. Thus it can be said that the concept of corecursion is an explication of the embodiment of iterative computation processes by recursive definitions, where applicable.

=== Fibonacci sequence ===
In the same way, the [[Fibonacci sequence]] can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt;a, b = (0, 1) : (b, a+b)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that because the Fibonacci sequence is a [[recurrence relation]] of order 2, the corecursive relation must track two successive terms, with the &lt;math&gt;(b, -)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to shift forward by one step, and the &lt;math&gt;(-, a+b)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to computing the next term. This can then be implemented as follows (using [[parallel assignment]]):
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def fibonacci_sequence():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
&lt;/source&gt;
In Haskell, &lt;source lang=haskell&gt; map fst ( (\(a,b) -&gt; (b,a+b)) `iterate` (0,1) )&lt;/source&gt;

=== Tree traversal ===
[[Tree traversal]] via a [[depth-first]] approach is a classic example of recursion. Dually, [[breadth-first]] traversal can very naturally be implemented via corecursion.

Without using recursion or corecursion specifically, one may traverse a tree by starting at the root node, placing its child nodes in a data structure, then iterating by removing node after node from the data structure while placing each removed node's children back into that data structure.{{efn|More elegantly, one can start by placing the root node itself in the data structure and then starting the process.}} If the data structure is a [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]] (LIFO), this yields depth-first traversal, and  if the data structure is a [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]] (FIFO), this yields breadth-first traversal.

Using recursion, a (post-order){{efn|Post-order is to make "leaf node is base case" explicit for exposition, but the same analysis works for pre-order or in-order.}} depth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node and recursively traversing each child subtree in turn (the subtree based at each child node) – the second child subtree does not start processing until the first child subtree is finished. Once a leaf node is reached or the children of a branch node have been exhausted, the node itself is visited (e.g., the value of the node itself is outputted). In this case, the call stack (of the recursive functions) acts as the stack that is iterated over.

Using corecursion, a breadth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node, outputting its value,{{efn|Breadth-first traversal, unlike depth-first, is unambiguous, and visits a node value before processing children.}} then breadth-first traversing the subtrees – i.e., passing on the ''whole list'' of subtrees to the next step (not a single subtree, as in the recursive approach) – at the next step outputting the value of all of their root nodes, then passing on their child subtrees, etc.{{efn|Technically, one may define a breadth-first traversal on an ordered, disconnected set of trees – first the root node of each tree, then the children of each tree in turn, then the grandchildren in turn, etc.}} In this case the generator function, indeed the output sequence itself, acts as the queue. As in the factorial example (above), where the auxiliary information of the index (which step one was at, ''n'') was pushed forward, in addition to the actual output of ''n''!, in this case the auxiliary information of the remaining subtrees is pushed forward, in addition to the actual output. Symbolically:
:&lt;math&gt;v, t = ([], FullTree) : (RootValues, ChildTrees)&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that at each step, one outputs the list of values of root nodes, then proceeds to the child subtrees. Generating just the node values from this sequence simply requires discarding the auxiliary child tree data, then flattening the list of lists (values are initially grouped by level (depth); flattening (ungrouping) yields a flat linear list). In Haskell, 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt; concatMap fst ( (\(v, t) -&gt; (rootValues t, childTrees t)) `iterate` ([], fullTree) )&lt;/source&gt;

These can be compared as follows. The recursive traversal handles a ''leaf node'' (at the ''bottom'') as the base case (when there are no children, just output the value), and ''analyzes'' a tree into subtrees, traversing each in turn, eventually resulting in just leaf nodes – actual leaf nodes, and branch nodes whose children have already been dealt with (cut off ''below''). By contrast, the corecursive traversal handles a ''root node'' (at the ''top'') as the base case (given a node, first output the value), treats a tree as being ''synthesized'' of a root node and its children, then produces as auxiliary output a list of subtrees at each step, which are then the input for the next step – the child nodes of the original root are the root nodes at the next step, as their parents have already been dealt with (cut off ''above''). Note also that in the recursive traversal there is a distinction between leaf nodes and branch nodes, while in the corecursive traversal there is no distinction, as each node is treated as the root node of the subtree it defines.

Notably, given an infinite tree,{{efn|Assume fixed [[branching factor]] (e.g., binary), or at least bounded, and balanced (infinite in every direction).}} the corecursive breadth-first traversal will traverse all nodes, just as for a finite tree, while the recursive depth-first traversal will go down one branch and not traverse all nodes, and indeed if traversing post-order, as in this example (or in-order), it will visit no nodes at all, because it never reaches a leaf. This shows the usefulness of corecursion rather than recursion for dealing with infinite data structures.

In Python, this can be implemented as follows.{{efn|First defining a tree class, say via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
class Tree:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left  = left
        self.right = right

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value)
&lt;/source&gt;
and initializing a tree, say via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
t = Tree(1, Tree(2, Tree(4), Tree(5)), Tree(3, Tree(6), Tree(7)))
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example nodes are labeled in breadth-first order:
     1
  2     3
 4 5   6 7
}}
The usual post-order depth-first traversal can be defined as:{{efn|Intuitively, the function iterates over subtrees (possibly empty), then once these are finished, all that is left is the node itself, whose value is then returned; this corresponds to treating a leaf node as basic.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def df(node):
    if node is not None:
        df(node.left)
        df(node.right)
        print(node.value)
&lt;/source&gt;
This can then be called by &lt;code&gt;df(t)&lt;/code&gt; to print the values of the nodes of the tree in post-order depth-first order.

The breadth-first corecursive generator can be defined as:{{efn|1=Here the argument (and loop variable) is considered as a whole, possible infinite tree, represented by (identified with) its root node (tree = root node), rather than as a potential leaf node, hence the choice of variable name.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def bf(tree):
    tree_list = [tree]
    while tree_list:
        new_tree_list = []
        for tree in tree_list:
            if tree is not None:
                yield tree.value
                new_tree_list.append(tree.left)
                new_tree_list.append(tree.right)
        tree_list = new_tree_list
&lt;/source&gt;
This can then be called to print the values of the nodes of the tree in breadth-first order:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for i in bf(t):
    print(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Definition==
{{technical|section|date=November 2010}}
[[Initial and terminal objects|Initial data type]]s can be defined as being the [[least fixpoint]] ([[up to isomorphism]]) of some type equation; the [[isomorphism]] is then given by an [[Initial algebra|initial]] [[F-algebra|algebra]]. Dually, final (or terminal) data types can be defined as being the [[greatest fixpoint]] of a type equation; the isomorphism is then given by a final [[F-coalgebra|coalgebra]].

If the domain of discourse is the [[category of sets]] and total functions, then final data types may contain infinite, [[Non-well-founded set theory|non-wellfounded]] values, whereas initial types do not.&lt;ref&gt;Barwise and Moss 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moss and Danner 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, if the domain of discourse is the category of [[complete partial order]]s and [[Scott continuity|continuous functions]], which corresponds roughly to the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] programming language, then final types coincide with initial types, and the corresponding final coalgebra and initial algebra form an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth and Plotkin 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corecursion is then a technique for recursively defining functions whose range (codomain) is a final data type, dual to the way that ordinary [[recursion]] recursively defines functions whose domain is an initial data type.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons and Hutton 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--G&amp;H ascribe this definition to Barwise and Moss--&gt;

The discussion below provides several examples in Haskell that distinguish corecursion. Roughly speaking, if one were to port these definitions to the category of sets, they would still be corecursive. This informal usage is consistent with existing textbooks about Haskell.&lt;ref&gt;Doets and van Eijck 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Also note that the examples used in this article predate the attempts to define corecursion and explain what it is.

==Discussion==
{{cleanup|section|reason=mix of discussion, examples, and related concepts|date=July 2012}}
{{Expert needed|Computer science|2=section|date=November 2010}}
The rule for ''primitive corecursion'' on [[codata (computer science)|codata]] is the dual to that for [[primitive recursion]] on data. Instead of descending on the argument by [[pattern-matching]] on its constructors (that ''were called up before'', somewhere, so we receive a ready-made datum and get at its constituent sub-parts, i.e. "fields"), we ascend on the result by filling-in its "destructors" (or "observers", that ''will be called afterwards'', somewhere - so we're actually calling a constructor, creating another bit of the result to be observed later on). Thus corecursion ''creates'' (potentially infinite) codata, whereas ordinary recursion ''analyses'' (necessarily finite) data.  Ordinary recursion might not be applicable to the codata because it might not terminate.  Conversely, corecursion is not strictly necessary if the result type is data, because data must be finite.

In "Programming with streams in Coq: a case study: the Sieve of Eratosthenes"&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc and Paulin-Mohring, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; we find
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
hd (conc a s) = a               
tl (conc a s) = s

(sieve p s) = if div p (hd s) then sieve p (tl s)
              else conc (hd s) (sieve p (tl s))

hd (primes s) = (hd s)          
tl (primes s) = primes (sieve (hd s) (tl s))
&lt;/source&gt;
where primes "are obtained by applying the primes operation to the stream (Enu 2)". Following the above notation, the sequence of primes (with a throwaway 0 prefixed to it) and numbers streams being progressively sieved, can be represented as 
:&lt;math&gt;p, s = (0, [2..]) : (hd(s), sieve(hd(s),tl(s)))&lt;/math&gt;
or in Haskell, 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
(\(p, s@(h:t)) -&gt; (h, sieve h t)) `iterate` (0, [2..])
&lt;/source&gt;
The authors discuss how the definition of &lt;code&gt;sieve&lt;/code&gt; is not guaranteed always to be ''productive'', and could become stuck e.g. if called with &lt;code&gt;[5,10..]&lt;/code&gt; as the initial stream.

Here is another example in Haskell. The following definition produces the list of [[Fibonacci numbers]] in linear time:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
&lt;/source&gt;

This infinite list depends on lazy evaluation;  elements are computed on an as-needed basis, and only finite prefixes are ever explicitly represented in memory. This feature allows algorithms on parts of codata to terminate; such techniques are an important part of Haskell programming.

This can be done in Python as well:&lt;ref&gt;Hettinger 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
from itertools import tee, chain, islice, imap

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def fibonacci():
    def deferred_output():
        for i in output:
            yield i
    result, c1, c2 = tee(deferred_output(), 3)
    paired = imap(add, c1, islice(c2, 1, None))
    output = chain([0, 1], paired)
    return result

for i in islice(fibonacci(), 20):
    print(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

The definition of &lt;code&gt;zipWith&lt;/code&gt; can be inlined, leading to this:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs
  where
    next (a: t@(b:_)) = (a+b):next t
&lt;/source&gt;

This example employs a self-referential ''data structure''.   Ordinary recursion makes use of self-referential ''functions'',   but does not accommodate self-referential data.   However,  this is not essential to the Fibonacci example.    It can be rewritten as follows:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = fibgen (0,1)
fibgen (x,y) = x : fibgen (y,x+y) 
&lt;/source&gt;

This employs only self-referential ''function'' to construct the result. If it were used with strict list constructor it would be an example of runaway recursion, but with [[lazy evaluation|non-strict]] list constructor this guarded recursion gradually produces an indefinitely defined list.

{{anchor|corecursive queue breadth-first tree traversal}}Corecursion need not produce an infinite object; a corecursive queue&lt;ref&gt;Allison 1989; Smith 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is a particularly good example of this phenomenon.   The following definition produces a [[Breadth-first search|breadth-first traversal]] of a binary tree in linear time:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data Tree a b = Leaf a  |  Branch b (Tree a b) (Tree a b)

bftrav :: Tree a b -&gt; [Tree a b]
bftrav tree = queue
  where
    queue = tree : gen 1 queue

    gen  0   p                 =         []           
    gen len (Leaf   _     : s) =         gen (len-1) s 
    gen len (Branch _ l r : s) = l : r : gen (len+1) s  
&lt;/source&gt;

This definition takes an initial tree and produces a list of subtrees.   This list serves dual purpose as both the queue and the result (&lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;gen len p&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt; produces its output &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt; notches after its input back-pointer, &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt;, along the &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;queue&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt;).  It is finite if and only if the initial tree is finite.  The length of the queue must be explicitly tracked in order to ensure termination;  this can safely be elided if this definition is applied only to infinite trees.  &lt;!-- Even if the result is finite, this example depends on lazy evaluation due to the use of self-referential data structures.

why the above was removed: it isn't true: the Haskell code can be translated into Prolog quite straightforwardly. Prolog is not a lazy language. But it does have tail recursion modulo cons. Which is emulatable in Scheme, C, etc.

bftrav(Tree,Q):- Q=[Tree|R], bfgen(1,Q,R).
bfgen(0,_,[]):- !.
bfgen(N,[leaf(_)        |P], R       ):- N2 is N-1, bfgen(N2,P,R).
bfgen(N,[branch(_,Lt,Rt)|P],[Lt,Rt|R]):- N2 is N+1, bfgen(N2,P,R).
--&gt;

Another particularly good example gives a solution to the problem of breadth-first labeling.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Gibbons 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The function &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; visits every node in a binary tree in a breadth first fashion,  and replaces each label with an integer,  each subsequent integer is bigger than the last by one.   This solution employs a self-referential data structure,  and the binary tree can be finite or infinite.

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
label :: Tree a b -&gt; Tree Int Int 
label t = t′
    where
    (t′, ns) = go t (1:ns)

    go :: Tree a b    -&gt; [Int]  -&gt; (Tree Int Int, [Int])
    go   (Leaf   _    ) (n:ns) = (Leaf   n       , n+1 : ns  )
    go   (Branch _ l r) (n:ns) = (Branch n l′ r′ , n+1 : ns′′)
                                where
                                  (l′, ns′ ) = go l ns
                                  (r′, ns′′) = go r ns′
&lt;/source&gt;

An [[apomorphism]] (such as an [[anamorphism]], such as [[Unfold (higher-order function)|unfold]]) is a form of corecursion in the same way that a [[paramorphism]] (such as a [[catamorphism]], such as [[Fold (higher-order function)|fold]]) is a form of recursion.

The [[Coq]] proof assistant supports corecursion and [[coinduction]] using the CoFixpoint command.

== History ==
Corecursion, referred to as ''circular programming,'' dates at least to {{Harv|Bird|1984}}, who credits [[John Hughes (computer scientist)|John Hughes]] and [[Philip Wadler]]; more general forms were developed in {{Harv|Allison|1989}}. The original motivations included producing more efficient algorithms (allowing 1 pass over data in some cases, instead of requiring multiple passes) and implementing classical data structures, such as doubly linked lists and queues, in functional languages.

'''DNA banking''' is the secure, long term storage of an individual’s [[genetic material]]. [[DNA]] is most commonly extracted from [[blood]], but can also be obtained from [[saliva]] and other [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. DNA banks allow for conservation of genetic material and comparative analysis of an individual's genetic information. Analyzing an individual's DNA can allow scientists to predict [[genetic disorders]], as used in preventative genetics or [[gene therapy]], and prove that person's identity, as used in the [[criminal justice system]]. There are multiple methods for testing and analyzing genetic information including [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) and [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reactions]] (PCR).
 
==Uses==

DNA banking is used to conserve genetic material, especially that of organisms that face [[extinction]]. This is a more prominent issue today due to [[deforestation]] and [[climate change]], which serve as a threat to [[biodiversity]]. The genetic information can be stored within [[lambda phage]] and plasma vectors. The National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) DNA Bank, for example, collects the DNA of agricultural organisms, such as rice and fish, for scientific research. Most DNA provided by DNA banks is used for studies to attempt to develop more productive or more environmentally friendly agricultural species. Some DNA banks also store the DNA of rare or [[endangered species]] to ensure their survival.&lt;ref&gt;Meurant, Gerard (2012). Conservation of Plant Genes : Dna Banking and in Vitro Biotechnology.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA bank can be used to compare and analyze DNA samples. Comparison of DNA samples allowed scientists to work on the [[Human Genome Project]], which maps out many of the genes on human DNA. It has also led to the development of preventative genetics. Samples from the DNA bank have been used to identify patterns and determine which genes lead to specific disorders. Once people know which genes lead to disorders, people can take steps to lessen the effects of that disorder. This can occur through adjustments in lifestyle, as demonstrated in [[preventive healthcare]], or even through gene therapy. DNA can be banked at any time during a person's life.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, A. (2007). Genetics, health care, and public policy: An introduction to public health genetics. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA banks were introduced to the criminal justice system in the 1980s. This system makes it possible to rule out or confirm the verdict of a suspect based on their personal genetic code. Once an individual’s DNA is stored, it remains in the system permanently; allowing law enforcement to identify and track criminals more easily. There is some controversy about this topic as some individuals believe the storage of citizen's DNA is an invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Krimsky, S., &amp; Simoncelli, T. (2011). Genetic justice: DNA data banks, criminal investigations, and civil liberties. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA banking capsules are also starting to be used for retaining the DNA of the deceased, a service offered by some funeral homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-dna-collection-after-death-20150814-story.html |date=23 August 2015 |author=Jessica Inman |title=DNA collection allows mourning to memorialize the dead |work=Orlando Sentinel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processes==

Scientists are capable of retrieving genetic information from [[hair]], [[skin]], blood, [[sperm]], tissue, and saliva as long as the sample contains intact DNA. [[Nucleotide sequences]] between humans differ by only 0.1%. Even so, this 0.1% includes approximately three million bases.  DNA can be analyzed through restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and Polymerase chain reactions (PCR). The RFLP process was introduced in 1988. Restriction enzymes digest portions of the DNA, leaving short fragments. These fragments are sorted through gel [[electrophoresis]]. The gel demonstrates the length of the fragments allowing specialists to determine whether the fragments came from the same  person. PCR is more commonly used today because it more efficient and requires smaller samples of genetic samples. &lt;ref&gt;Stewart, A. (2007). Genetics, health care, and public policy: An introduction to public health genetics. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==

There are various organizations founded for the purpose of storing and analyzing DNA sample. For example, the [[UK Biobank]] contains DNA samples of 500,000 individuals aged between 40 and 69 when their samples were taken in the years 2006-2010 .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/what-happens-when-you-put-500000-peoples-dna-online/543747/|title=What Happens When You Put 500,000 People's DNA Online|last=Zhang|first=Sarah|date=2017-11-06|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609184/uk-biobank-supercharges-medicine-with-gene-data-on-500000-brits/|title=UK Biobank supercharges medicine with gene data on 500,000 Brits|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|date=2017-11-15|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Da’at Miqra''''' (Hebrew דעת מקרא) is a series of volumes of [[Hebrew]]-language [[biblical]] [[Bible commentary|commentary]] published by the [[Jerusalem]]-based [[Mossad Harav Kook]] and constitutes a cornerstone of contemporary [[Israel]]i [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[bible]] scholarship. The project was headed by [[Yehuda Kiel]], who received the [[Israel Prize]] for his part in the enterprise.

==Overview==
The singularity of ''Da’at Miqra'' lies in its combination of a [[traditional]] outlook and the findings of modern research.  The ''Da’at Miqra'' editors have sought to present an interpretation based primarily upon ''[[Peshat]]'' — the direct, literal reading of the text — as opposed to ''[[Peshat|Drash]]''.  They do so by incorporating [[geographic]] references, [[archaeological]] findings and textual analysis, presenting a clear link between the commentary's traditional approach and contemporary methodology.  There has been some suggestion that the ''Da’at Miqra‘''s dualistic approach reflects an underlying polemic against [[biblical criticism]], without directly addressing the views and queries of [[bible]] critics but via a commentary aimed at debunking their methodology.

==Methodology and structure==
The ''Da’at Miqra'' relies upon the [[Aleppo Codex]] for its basic text.  The commentary includes clarifications of difficult words and [[etymological]] references—particularly with regard to the names of locations mentioned—and contains various notes aimed at demonstrating, expanding upon or presenting alternate views on the text.  Each book of the ''[[Tanakh]]'' is divided into parts, each of which is preceded by a description of the chapter’s division and literary style and a general explanation of the portion.  In addition, each book contains a general introduction aimed at clarifying general issues within the text, such as the dating of its authorship, its historical background, parallels to other biblical books, an explanation of various repeating phrases or personas, and the like.

==Editorial staff==
Editors of the series included  [[Yehuda Elitzur]] of [[Bar-Ilan University]], the [[International Bible Contest]] champion and Bible scholar [[Amos Hakham]],  [[Sha’ul Yisra’eli]] and  [[Mordechai Breuer]].

[[File:Jesuits at Akbar's court.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar the Great]] (r. 1556-1605) holds a religious assembly in the [[Ibadat Khana]] (House of Worship) in [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; the two men dressed in black are the [[Jesuit]] missionaries [[Rodolfo Acquaviva]] and [[Francisco Henriques (missionary)|Francisco Henriques]].  Illustration to the [[Akbarnama]], miniature painting by [[Nar Singh]], ca. 1605]]
The '''''Dabestān-e Mazāheb''''', also transliterated as '''''Dabistān-i Mazāhib''''' ({{lang-fa|دبستان مذاهب}}) "School of Religions", is an examination and comparison of [[South Asia]]n religions and sects of the mid-17th century. The work is written in Persian, probably having been composed in about 1655 CE.

The ''Dabistan-e Madahib'' is best known for its chapter on the [[Din-i Ilahi|Dīn-i Ilāhī]], the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion propounded by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar|Jalāl ud-Dīn Muḥammad Akbar]] ("Akbar the Great") after 1581 and is possibly the most reliable account of the [[Ibadat Khana|''Ibādat Khāna'']] discussions that led up to this.

This work was first printed by Nazar Ashraf in a very accurate edition in movable type at Calcutta in 1809 (an offset reprint of this edition was published by Ali Asghar Mustafawi from Teheran in 1982). A lithographed edition was published by Ibrahim bin Nur Muhammad from Bombay in AH 1292 (1875). In 1877, Munshi Nawal Kishore published another Lithographed edition from Lucknow. The distinguished Persian scholar Francis Gladwin translated the chapter on the Persians into English and published it from Calcutta in 1789. A German version by E. Dalburg from Wurzburg was published in 1809. The chapter on the Raushanyas was translated into English by J. Leyden for the ''Asiatic Researches'', xi, Calcutta. The entire work was translated into English by [[David Shea (linguist)|David Shea]] and Anthony Troyer under the title, ''The Dabistan or School of Manners'' (1843) in three volumes from London.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, M. Athar (2008). ''Mughal India'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-569661-1}}, pp.216-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

The critical English-language edition by David Shea and Anthony Troyer in 1843 is slightly flawed since the translators were not well-versed in much of the subject matter. The editors, who were not certain of the identity of the author, suggest a certain Muhsin Fani and propose 1670 as his date of death. They furthermore stated that he was "of the philosophic sect of [[Sufi]]s", but the 1993 edition of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'' suggests that the author was most likely a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], '''Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'''. The author may have belonged to a Persian tradition (Sipásíán) that can be considered to be heterodox relative to orthodox Zoroastrianism.

The author describes that he spent time in [[Patna]], [[Kashmir]], [[Lahore]], [[Surat]] and [[Srikakulam]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]). He is perceived to have been a person of great scholarship and curiosity, and extremely open-minded for the context of his time. He mentions numerous interviews with scholars of numerous faiths, which suggests that he was well connected, and so qualified to report on the Dīn-i Ilāhī.

According to ''The Jew in the Lotus'' by Rodger Kamenetz, a ''Dabistan'' was commissioned by a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] mystic prince, [[Dara Shikoh]]. The section on Judaism consists of translations by a Persian Jewish Sufi Muslim convert, [[Sarmad Kashani]], and his Hindu disciple from [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;Jews and Judaism at the Court of the Moghul Emperors in Medieval India, Walter J. Fischel, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 18, (1948 - 1949), pp. 137-177&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Fischel notes: {{Quote|Through the medium of the ''Dabistan'' Sarmad thus became the channel through which Jewish ideas, though with a Sufic blending, penetrated into the religious fabric of the India of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamenetz p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;}} An English version of the ''Dabistan'' by David Shea (1843) is available at the Digital Library of India IISc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data/upload/0010/694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719101952/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=%2Fdata%2Fupload%2F0010%2F694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689 |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author's perspective==

Although the author spent most of life in South Asia, he regarded himself as a [[Persian people|Persian]]. However his perspective of the Hindus, and of other religions was unusually liberal. He writes:&lt;ref&gt;DABISTÁN, OR SCHOOL OF MANNERS. TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL PERSIAN, BY DAVID SHEA AND ANTHONY TROYER,1843.&lt;/ref&gt;

:As inconstant fortune had torn away the author from the shores of Persia, and made him the associate of the believers in transmigration and those who addressed their prayers to idols and images and worshipped demons, therefore the tenets held by this most subtle class of reasoners come to be considered next after those of the Parsees.

:... According to these sectaries, the worship offered to the forms of Mahadeo and Naráyan, and to the statues of the other spiritual beings, is highly to be commended. Strangers to their faith suppose them to look upon the idol as God, which is by no means the case, their belief being as follows: “The idol is merely a Kiblah, and they adore under that particular form, the Being who has neither accident nor form.” ...

: Rai Manuhar Kuchwáhhah has said:

::“O Moslem! if the Kâbah be the object of thy worship,
::Why dost thou reproach the adorers of idols?”

He personally met many scholars of different faiths. For example, about the [[Jainism|Jains]] he writes:

:The author of this book affirms he has seen a great number of Srivaras &lt;ref&gt;Sevada implies a Jain monk of the [[Shvetambara]] order, from Sanskrit Shvetapata.&lt;/ref&gt; and their followers. From them he knew Meher chand, a Lúnú,&lt;ref&gt;Lunia means someone belonging to the [[Lonka Gachchha]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 1056 of the Hejira (1646 A. D.), in Dotárah, which is under the dominion of Jodpur Márawár, he found also Síva rama, a Pujári, in Mirta, which place belongs to Marawar, and one named Jagna, a Banian, in Ráwel Pandi: he was adorned with all the good qualities of Jatis. When he saw a bird in the hands of a fowler, he bought it of him and set it free. This sect do whatever they can for the liberation of living beings.

:[[Hafez|Hafiz]] Shirázi says:

::“Avoid hurting any living animal, and do whatever thou likest,
::For in my book of laws there is no crime but this.”

[[File:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Parsis of [[Bombay]]" with traditional [[Parsi hat]]s, a wood engraving, ''ca.'' 1878]]
He observes that while Hindus dress following their own custom, the non-Muslims of Iran and Turan pass themselves off as Muslims, while practicing their faith in secret:

:... there are Samradíán, Khodaníán, Radián, Shíderangíán, Pâikeríán, Mílánían, Aláríán, Shídábíán, Akhshían, and [[Mazdak]]ían, who are dispersed in Iran and Turan, and all appear in the dress of Musulmans, although in secret they follow each the path of their own chosen faith; in the same manner various sects are also established in Hindostan, but they do not appear in the dress of Musulmans.

He describes the disputations in [[Akbar]]'s [[Ibadat Khana]] in detail, as if he had been there:

:A learned philosopher came into the hall, where Hindus also were present, and three other learned men; a Musulman, a Nazarene, and a Jew: these were summoned, and ranged in opposition to the learned philosopher.The latter opened the discussion in this manner: “The divine mission of your prophets has not been proved, for several reasons: the first is, that whatever the prophet says ought to be conformable to reason; the second is, that he ought to be free from crime, and not hurtful to other beings. But Moses, according to the opinion of the Jews, was brought up by Pharâoh, and yet he caused him by a stratagem to be drowned in the waters of the Nile,... Jesus permitted the killing and ill using of animals. And Muhammed himself attacked the forces and caravans of the Koreish; he shed blood, nay, with his own hand put to death animated beings.

:... Now the Christian said: “The Messiah was born without a father.” The doctor replied: “You yourselves say that Joseph, the carpenter, had taken Mary to wife; how can it be made out that Jesus was not the son of Joseph?” The Nazarene was reduced to silence.

He describes and defends the liberal views of Akbar:

:His Majesty, Akbar, as he was ordered by God, used to read prayers, containing the praise of the sun, in the Persian, Hindi, Turkish, and Arabic languages, among which all was one prayer, which is proper to the Hindus, and which they sing at midnight and at sun-rise. Besides, the emperor forbade his subjects to kill cows and to eat their flesh; .... The Hindus say also that, as many advantages are derived from the cow, it is not right to kill it. The Yezdánian maintained that it is tyranny to kill harmless animals ...

__NOTOC__
'''Drift seeds''' (also '''sea beans''') and '''drift fruits''' are seeds and fruits adapted for long distance [[seed dispersal|dispersal]] by water.  Most are produced by tropical trees, and they can be found on distant beaches after drifting thousands of miles through [[ocean current]]s.  This method of propagation has helped many species of plant such as the [[Coconut]] colonize and establish themselves on previously barren islands. Consequently, drift seeds and fruits are of interest to scientists who study these currents.

In botanical terminology, a drift fruit is a kind of [[diaspore (botany)|diaspore]], and drift seeds and fruits are [[wikt:disseminule|disseminules]].

[[File:Toisa Perseus&amp;Discoverer Enterprise.jpg|thumb|In the foreground, offshore support vessel ''Toisa Perseus'' with the fifth-generation deepwater drillship ''[[Discoverer Enterprise]]''.]]

A '''drillship''' is a merchant vessel designed for use in exploratory offshore drilling of new oil and gas wells or for scientific drilling purposes. In most recent years the vessels are used in deepwater and ultra-deepwater applications, equipped with the latest and most advanced [[dynamic positioning]] systems.

==History==
The first drillship was the [[CUSS I]], designed by Robert F. Bauer of Global Marine in 1955. The CUSS I had drilled in 400 feet deep waters by 1957.&lt;ref name="Schempf"&gt;Schempf, F. (2007). Pioneering Offshore : The Early Years. [Tulsa, OK]: PennWell Custom Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;
Robert F. Bauer became the first president of the Global Marine in 1958.&lt;ref name="Schempf"/&gt;

In 1961 Global Marine started a new drillship era. They ordered several self-propelled drillships each with a rated centerline drilling of 20,000 foot-wells in water depths of 600 feet. The first was named CUSS ([[GlobalSantaFe Corporation|Glomar]]) II, a 5,500-deadweight-ton vessel, Costing around $4.5 million. Built by a Gulf Coast shipyard, the vessel was almost twice the size of the CUSS I, and became the world’s first drillship built as new construction which set sail in 1962.&lt;ref name="Schempf"/&gt;

In 1962 The Offshore Company elected to build a new type of drillship, larger than that of the Glomar class. This new drillships would feature a first ever anchor mooring array based on a unique turret system. The vessel was named Discoverer I. The Discoverer I had no main propulsion engines,&lt;ref name="Schempf"/&gt; meaning they needed to be towed out to the drill site.

==Application==
The drillship can be used as a platform to carry out well maintenance or completion work such as casing and tubing installation, subsea tree installations and well capping. Drillships are often built to the design specification to meet the requirements set by the oil production company and/or investors.

From the first drillship CUSS I to the Deepwater Asgard the fleet size has been growing ever since. In 2013 the worldwide fleet of drillships tops 80 ships, more than double its size in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/world/highvalueships/rigsonorder.htm | title = Drillship Building Statistics | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090917032912/http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/world/highvalueships/rigsonorder.htm | archivedate = 2009-09-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drillships are not only growing in size but also in capability with new technology assisting operations from academic research to ice-breaker class drilling vessels. U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s decision in late March 2010 to expand U.S. domestic exploratory drilling seems likely to increase further developments of drillship technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/business/energy-environment/01drill.html | work=The New York Times | title=Risk Is Clear in Drilling; Payoff Isn't | first1=John M. | last1=Broder | first2=Clifford | last2=Krauss | date=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Q4000-Discoverer-Enterprise.jpg|thumb|Drillship [[Discoverer Enterprise]].]]
[[File:Mohopix-1.gif|thumb|Drillship CUSS I.]]
Drillships are just one way to perform various types of drilling. This function can also be performed by [[semi-submersibles]], jackups, [[barges]], or platform rigs.

Drillships have the functional ability of semi-submersible drilling rigs and also have a few unique features that separate them from all others. First being the ship-shaped design. A drillship has greater mobility and can move quickly under its own propulsion from drill site to drill site in contrast to semi-submersibles and jackup barges and platforms. Drillships have the ability to save time sailing between oilfields worldwide. A drillship takes 20 days to move from the Gulf of Mexico to the Offshore Angola. Whereas, a semi-submersible drilling unit must be towed and takes 70 days.&lt;ref name="Leffler, Sterling, &amp; Pattarozzi"&gt;Leffler, W. , Sterling, G. , &amp; Pattarozzi, R. (2011). Deepwater Petroleum Exploration &amp; Production : A Nontechnical Guide. Tulsa, Okla.: PennWell Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;
Drillship construction cost is much higher than that of a semi-submersible. But although mobility comes at a high price, the drillship owners can charge higher day rates and get the benefit of lower idle times between assignments.&lt;ref name="Leffler, Sterling, &amp; Pattarozzi"/&gt;

The table below depicts the industry’s way of classifying drill sites into different vintages, depending on their age and water depth.&lt;ref name="Leffler, Sterling, &amp; Pattarozzi"/&gt;

The drilling operations are very detailed and in depth. A simple way to understand what a drillship is to do in order to drill, a marine riser is lowered from the drillship to the seabed with a blowout preventer (BOP) at the bottom that connects to the wellhead. The BOP is used to quickly disconnect the riser from the wellhead in times of emergency or in any needed situation.
Underneath the derrick is a moonpool, an opening through the hull covered by the rig floor. Some of the modern drillships have larger derricks that allow dual activity operations, for example simultaneous drilling and casing handling.

==Types==
There are different types of [[offshore drilling]] units such as the [[oil platform]], [[jackup rig]], [[submersible drilling rig]], [[semi-submersible]] platform and of course drillships. All drillships have what is called a ”moon pool”. The [[Moon pool]] is an opening on the base of the hull and depending on the mission the vessel is on, drilling equipment, small submersible crafts and divers may pass through the moon pool. Since the drillship is also a vessel, it can easily relocate to any desired location. But due to its mobility, drillships are not as stable compared to semi-submersible platforms. To maintain its position, drillships may utilize their anchors or use the ship’s computer-controlled system on board to run off their [[Dynamic positioning]].&lt;ref name="SOS-HOTLO"&gt;SOS-HOTLO.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5582">'''EcoPark''' ({{zh|t=環保園}}) located in [[Tuen Mun]] Area 38, on west side of [[Hong Kong]], is similar to an [[industrial park]] exclusively for [[waste recycling]] and [[environmental engineering]].  This is the first of its kind in Hong Kong.

== Introduction ==
In December 2003, the [[Hong Kong Government]] mapped out a strategy on waste management emphasized waste reduction and recovery. Hong Kong currently recycles 48% of its [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW), but over 99% of recovered recyclable materials are exported to [[Mainland China]] for further re-processing while less than 1% are treated locally and re-manufactured into useful products. With the measures to promote waste recovery, recycling and reuse in place, a local waste management area like EcoPark is a viable option for furthering Hong Kong's recycling program.  

EcoPark aims to promote the local [[recycling|recycling industry]] and jump-start a circular economy to provide a sustainable solution to the city's waste problems. By encouraging and promoting the reuse, recovery and recycling of waste resources and returning them to the consumption loop, the EcoPark will help realize the full potential of the local recycling industry and alleviate the heavy reliance on the export of recyclable materials recovered from Hong Kong.

== Design and construction ==
The EcoPark occupies 200,000 square metres of land in Tuen Mun Area 38 and will be developed in two phases. As pledged in the Policy Framework, the aim is to commission Phase I of EcoPark (80,000 square metres) towards the end of 2006 and Phase II (120,000 square metres) in 2009. Hong Kong Government funding will be used to build the basic infrastructure of EcoPark.

The EcoPark will be divided into lots of different sizes. Lots in EcoPark will be tendered for specific recovered materials and processes that help achieve Hong Kong's government waste management objectives, in particular, in recycling local wastes. Admission criteria will be developed with priority given to processes involving value-added technologies, and target materials of the proposed Producer Responsibility Schemes. 

== Progress ==
All six lots in EcoPark Phase I has been allocated for recycling of waste cooking oil, waste computer equipment, waste metals, waste wood, waste plastics and waste car batteries.  Some of them are already in operation, while the rest of tenants will start their operation shortly.

Construction works of the EcoPark Phase II have already completed.  Two lots have been allocated to non-government organisations for recycling of plastics and waste electrical appliances.  The remaining lots in EcoPark Phase II will be available for tendering in late 2010.  

== Phase I tenants ==

== Phase II lots ==
Tendering of Phase II lots (with a total area of 100,000 square metres) will start in late 2010.  Further information on the tendering can be obtained from EcoPark management office.

== Visitor Centre ==
The 1,000-square metre EcoPark Visitor Centre is the first education centre in Hong Kong with a main theme of solid waste management.  Admission is free and docent service will be provided.  Online and telephone booking can be arranged through the EcoPark Management Office. 

== Public consultation ==
Hong Kong Government has consulted the [[Tuen Mun District|Tuen Mun District Council]] and members support the development of EcoPark and agree that EcoPark will help promote development of local recycling industry and create job opportunities in Tuen Mun. The Council hopes that EcoPark will become a landmark for Tuen Mun.

Local trade associations and recyclers were also consulted and they support the development of EcoPark, agreeing that by providing long-term land at affordable cost, together with supporting infrastructure, EcoPark will help enhance recycling technology development and improve waste recovery rates in Hong Kong.

== Environmental considerations ==
An [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] (EIA) was carried out in respect of air and water quality, waste management, land contamination, [[landfill gas]] hazard and hazard to life, in which a wide range of recycling processes for different material types were examined. The assessment recommends a list of materials and processes to be allowed and also recommends a number of mitigation measures. With these measures in place, the EIA concludes that there will be no significant environmental impacts to the surrounding areas.

'''Estate satire''' is a genre of writing from 14th Century, [[Medieval literature|Medieval literary]] works. The three Medieval estates were the Clergy (those who prayed), the [[Nobility]] (those who fought) and lastly the [[Peasantry]] (those who labored). These estates were the major [[social classes]] of the time and were typically gender specific to men, although the clergy also included nuns. Nevertheless, women were considered as a separate class in themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Jill. ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; the best-known example being [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[The Wife of Bath's Tale|Wife of Bath]]. Estates satire praised the glories and purity of each class in its ideal form, but was also used as a window to show how society had gotten out of hand. The ''Norton Anthology of [[English Literature]]'' describes the duty of estates satire: "They set forth the functions and duties of each estate and castigate the failure of the estates in the present world to live up to their divinely assigned social roles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estates Satire|work=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/middleages/topic_1/satire.htm|publisher=W.W.

The First Estate, the Church, consisted of those who ran the Catholic church and part of the country. They were the recipients of the ''[[tithe]]'' or the 10% tax given to the Church.

The Second Estate, the Nobility, were royalty, not including the King. They were never taxed but could collect taxes from the Third Estate, and had other special privileges.

The Third Estate, the Commons, is the largest, consisting of around 96% of the population (UCL). The commons included everyone who did not belong to the first two estates, primarily rural [[peasants]] and the urban [[bourgeois]] or middle class. They had none of the privileges or luxuries that the first two estates enjoyed, although the [[History of capitalism|rise of capitalism]] in the late 14th Century resulted in the bourgeois having relatively more power.

Among 14th-century English authors, [[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and Chaucer were three of the most prominent writers of the time to include estates satire in their works. Although Gower was more aggressive in his approach, Chaucer was more subtle and more successful, making himself to be the fool of the joke and subverting may of the conventions of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Medieval authors used estates satire to express their disgust towards the hypocrisy of the three estates and their supposed virtuous ways.

'''Field recording''' is the term used for an [[Sound recording|audio recording]] produced outside a [[recording studio]], and the term applies to recordings of both natural and human-produced sounds.

Field recording of natural sounds, also called '''phonography''' (a term chosen to illustrate its similarities to [[photography]]), was originally developed as a documentary adjunct to research work [[field work|in the field]], and [[Foley (filmmaking)|foley]] work for film.  With the introduction of high-quality, portable recording equipment, it has subsequently become an evocative artform in itself.  In the 1970s, both processed and natural phonographic recordings, (pioneered by Irv Teibel's [[Environments (series)|''Environments'' series]]), became popular.

"Field recordings" may also refer to simple monaural or stereo recordings taken of musicians in familiar and casual surroundings, such as the [[ethnomusicology]] recordings pioneered by [[John Lomax]], [[Nonesuch Records]], and [[Vanguard Records]].

==Techniques==

[[File:Ecoacoustics recording in Rural Illinois, USA.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Two individuals recording [[ecoacoustics]] in the field. ]]

Field recording often involves the capture of ambient noises that are low level and complex, and, in response, the requirements from the field recordist have often pushed the technical limits of recording equipment, that is, demanding low noise and extended frequency response in a portable, battery-powered unit. For this reason, field recordists have favoured high-quality (usually professional) recorders, microphones, and microphone [[pre-amplifiers]]. The history of the equipment used in this area closely tracks the development of professional portable audio recording technology.

Field recording is typically recorded in the same channel format as the desired result, for instance, stereo recording equipment will yield a stereo product. In contrast, a [[multitrack recording|multitrack]] [[remote recording]] captures many microphones on multiple channels, later to be creatively modified, augmented, and mixed down to a specific consumer format.

Field recording experienced a rapid increase in popularity during the early 1960s, with the introduction of high-quality, portable recording equipment, (e.g., the [[Uher (brand)|Uher]], and [[Nagra]] portable reel-to-reel decks). The arrival of the [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] (Digital Audio Tape) in the 1980s introduced a new level of audio recording [[Fidelity#Audio|fidelity]] with extended frequency response and low [[Microphone#Measurements and specifications|self-noise]]. In addition to these technologies, other popular means for field recording have included the [[compact audio cassette|analog cassette]] (CAC), the [[Digital Compact Cassette|DCC]] (Digital Compact Cassette), and the [[MiniDisc]]. The latest generation of recorders are completely digital-based (hard disk/[[Flash Memory|Flash]]). It is also possible to use personal electronic devices, (e.g., a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet]]), with software, to do field recording and editing.

Newly developed techniques include the creative placement of microphones, (including [[contact microphones]] and [[hydrophones]], for example), the diffusion of captured sounds, and individual approaches.

==Research==

===Ethnomusicology===
Field recording was originally a way to document oral presentations, and [[ethnomusicology]] projects (pioneered by [[Charles Seeger]], [[John Lomax]] and [[Béla Bartók]]).

===Bioacoustics===
Field recording is an important tool in [[bioacoustics]] and [[biomusicology]], most commonly in research on [[bird song]].  Animals in the wild can display very different vocalizations from those in captivity.

==Art==

===Music===
The use of field recordings in [[avant-garde]], [[musique concrète]], [[Experimental music|experimental]], and, more recently, [[ambient music]] was evident almost from the birth of recording technology. Most noteworthy for pioneering the conceptual and theoretical framework with art music that most openly embraced the use of raw sound material and field recordings was [[Pierre Schaeffer]], who was developing musique concrète as early as 1940. Further impetus was provided by the [[World Soundscape Project]], initiated by Canadian composer [[R. Murray Schafer]] in the 1970s; this work involved studying the [[acoustic ecology]] of a particular location by the use of field recordings.

Field recordings are now a common source material for a range of musical results, from contemporary musique concrète compositions to film soundtracks, video game soundtracks, and effects. [[Chris Watson (musician)|Chris Watson]], formerly of [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], is now perhaps the world's leading exponent of this art, with his recordings used for [[David Attenborough filmography|David Attenborough's series]] for the [[BBC]], programmes for [[BBC Radio]], and many other outlets. Another notable application of field recordings as of contemporary music is its inclusion in some [[vaporwave]] tracks, commonly recordings of public areas such as malls or grocery stores to add atmosphere.

The sounds recorded by any device, and then transferred to digital format, are used by some musicians through their performance with [[MIDI]]-interfaced instruments. A contemporary artist with great success for his compositions is [[Christian Fennesz]]. In addition, electronic musicians, such as DJ Throwing Shade, have been using field recordings to create music that has "someone actually playing an instrument in real life, something which cannot be re-created in the same way through synthesised sounds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_uk/article/between-worlds-how-field-recordings-can-challenge-our-perceptions-of-electronic-music|title=Between Worlds: How Field Recordings Can Challenge Our Perceptions of Electronic Music {{!}} Thump|last=Darton|first=James|date=January 19, 2017|work=|newspaper=Thump|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-01-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier innovators who are noted for the importance and boldness of their projects are [[Luigi Russolo]], who, in 1913, with his manifesto, ''L'arte dei rumori'' (''[[The Art of Noises]]''), gave musical value to [[environmental noise]]. He also designed and built the [[Intonarumori]]—the first instruments for making noise. [[Francesco Balilla Pratella]] utilized the Intonarumori in his opera, ''L'aviatore Dro'', which was written in close collaboration with [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], (the founder of the [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement).

===Radio documentary===
[[Radio documentary|Radio documentaries]] often use recordings from the field, e.g., a locomotive engine running, for evocative effect.  This type of sound functions as the non-fictional counterpart to the [[sound effect]].

===Politics===
During the early years of commercial recordings, the speeches of politicians sold well, since few people had radios. The [http://www.worldcat.org/title/gramophone-records-of-the-first-world-war-an-hmv-catalogue-1914-1918/oclc/1938531 HMV ("His Master's Voice") catalogue for 1914–1918] lists over a dozen such records. Probably the last time such records sold well was in 1965, when the [[LP record|LP]], ''The Voice of Churchill'', reached number 7 in the UK album charts. This was immediately after [[Winston Churchill|Churchill's]] death.

A '''heterotroph''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|t|ər|ə|ˌ|t|r|oʊ|f|,_|-|ˌ|t|r|ɒ|f}};&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|grc|τροφή}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek ἕτερος ''héteros'' = "other" plus ''trophe'' = "nutrition") is an [[organism]] that cannot produce its own food, relying instead on the intake of nutrition from other sources of organic carbon, mainly plant or animal matter. In the food chain, heterotrophs are secondary and tertiary consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heterotroph Definition |publisher=Biology Dictionary |url=https://biologydictionary.net/heterotroph/|date=15 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="essential microbiology"&gt;{{cite book | last= Hogg| first= Stuart| title= Essential Microbiology| year= 2013| edition=2nd| publisher= Wiley-Blackwell| page= 86| isbn= 978-1-119-97890-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-five percent or more of all types of living organisms are heterotrophic, including all [[animal]]s and [[fungi]] and some [[bacteria]] and [[protists]].&lt;ref name="cell"&gt;[http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0072965819/415836/rav65819_ch07.pdf "How Cells Harvest Energy"]. McGraw-Hill Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt; The term heterotroph arose in [[microbiology]] in 1946 as part of a classification of [[microorganisms]] based on their type of [[nutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;Lwoff, A., C.B. van Niel, P.J. Ryan, and E.L. Tatum (1946). Nomenclature of nutritional types of microorganisms. ''Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology'' (5th edn.), Vol. XI, The Biological Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., pp. 302–303, [http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/11/local/back-matter.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now used in many fields, such as [[ecology]] in describing the [[food chain]].

Heterotrophs may be subdivided according to their energy source. If the heterotroph uses chemical energy, it is a [[chemotroph|chemoheterotroph]] (e.g., humans and mushrooms). If it uses light for energy, then it is a [[photoheterotroph]] (e.g., [[green non-sulfur bacteria]]).

Heterotrophs represent one of the two mechanisms of nutrition ([[trophic levels]]), the other being [[autotroph]]s (auto = self, troph = nutrition). Autotrophs use energy from [[sunlight]] ([[photoautotroph]]s) or inorganic compounds ([[lithoautotroph]]s) to convert inorganic [[carbon dioxide]] to organic carbon compounds and energy to sustain their life. Comparing the two in layman's terms, heterotrophs (such as animals) eat either autotrophs (such as plants) or other heterotrophs, or both.
 
[[Detritivore]]s are heterotrophs which obtain [[nutrient]]s by consuming [[detritus]] (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as [[feces]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel, R. G. 2001. Limnology: Lake and River Ecosystems. Academic Press. 3rd. p.700.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saprotroph]]s (also called lysotrophs) are [[chemoheterotroph]]s that use [[extracellular digestion]] in processing decayed organic matter. It is a term most often associated with [[fungus|fungi]]. The process is most often facilitated through the [[active transport]] of such materials through [[endocytosis]] within the internal mycelium and its constituent [[hypha]]e.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1"&gt;''Advanced biology principles'', p 296—states the purpose of saprotrophs and their internal nutrition, as well as the main two types of fungi that are most often referred to, as well as describes, visually, the process of saprotrophic nutrition through a diagram of hyphae, referring to the Rhizobium on damp, stale whole-meal bread or rotting fruit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Heterotrophs can be [[organotroph]]s or [[lithotroph]]s. Organotrophs exploit reduced carbon compounds as electron sources, like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from plants and animals. On the other hand, lithotrophs use inorganic compounds, such as ammonium, nitrite, and sulfur to obtain electron sources. Another way of classifying different heterotrophs is by assigning them as [[chemotroph]]s or [[phototroph]]s. Phototrophs utilize light to obtain energy and carry out metabolic processes, whereas chemotrophs use the energy obtained by the oxidation of chemicals from their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mills|first1=A.L.|title=The Environmental Geochemistry of Mineral Deposits: Part A: Processes, Techniques, and Health Issues Part B: Case Studies and Research Topics|date=1997|publisher=Society of Economic Geologists|isbn=978-1-62949-013-7|pages=125–132|url=http://lmecol.evsc.virginia.edu/pubs/C13-Mills_Bull%20Econ%20Geol%20.PDF|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photoorganoheterotrophs, such as [[Rhodospirillaceae]] and purple non-sulfur bacteria synthesize organic compounds using sunlight coupled with oxidation of organic substances, including [[hydrogen sulfide]], elemental [[sulfur]], [[thiosulfate]], and molecular [[hydrogen]].
They use organic compounds to build structures. They do not fix carbon dioxide and apparently do not have the [[Light-independent reactions#Calvin Cycle|Calvin cycle]].&lt;ref name="botany"&gt;{{cite book | last= Mauseth| first= James D.| title= Botany: an introduction to plant biology| year= 2008| edition=4th| publisher= Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers| page= 252| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xPLGdYW9t5kC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=heterotroph+fix+carbon&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=heterotroph%20fix%20carbon&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-7637-5345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemolithoheterotrophs like the ''Oceanithermus profundus''&lt;ref&gt;M.

==Ecology==
{{Main|Consumer (food chain)}}

Many heterotrophs are [[Organotroph|chemoorganoheterotrophs]] that use organic carbon (e.g. glucose) as their carbon source, and organic chemicals (e.g. carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) as their energy and electron sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lmecol.evsc.virginia.edu/pubs/C13-Mills_Bull%20Econ%20Geol%20.PDF|title=The role of bacteria in environmental geochemistry|last1=Mills|first1=A.L.|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterotrophs function as [[Consumer (food chain)|consumers in food chain]]: they obtain these nutrients from [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]], [[Parasitic nutrition|parasitic]], or [[Holozoic nutrition|holozoic nutrients]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/22/m022p101.pdf|title=Heterotrophic nutrition and control of bacterial density|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They break down complex organic compounds (e.g., carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) produced by autotrophs into simpler compounds (e.g., carbohydrates into [[glucose]], fats into [[fatty acids]] and [[glycerol]], and proteins into [[amino acids]]). They release energy by oxidizing carbon and hydrogen atoms present in carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins to carbon dioxide and water, respectively.

They can catabolize organic compounds by respiration, fermentation, or both. [[Fermentation|Fermenting]] heterotrophs are either facultative or obligate [[anaerobes]] that carry out fermentation in low oxygen environments, in which the production of ATP is commonly coupled with [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] and the production of end products (e.g. alcohol, CO2, sulfide).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4612-1072-6|title=Bacterial Metabolism|last1=Gottschalk|first1=Gerhard|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0387961538|edition=2|accessdate=19 November 2017|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-1072-6|series=Springer Series in Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; These products can then serve as the substrates for other bacteria in the [[anaerobic digest]], and be converted into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is an important step for the carbon cycle for removing organic fermentation products from anaerobic environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Heterotrophs can undergo [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], in which ATP production is coupled with [[oxidative phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=MICB 201: Introductory Environmental Microbiology|last1=Wade|first1=Bingle|date=2016|pages=236–250|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the release of oxidized carbon wastes such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and reduced wastes like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into the atmosphere. Heterotrophic microbes’ respiration and fermentation account for a large portion of the release of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere, making it available for autotrophs as a source of nutrient and plants as a cellulose synthesis substrate.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Processes in Microbial Ecology|last1=Kirchman|first1=David L.|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199586936|pages=79–98|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Respiration in heterotrophs is often accompanied by [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]], the process of converting organic compounds to inorganic forms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When the organic nutrient source taken in by the heterotroph contains essential elements such as N, S, P in addition to C, H, and O, they are often removed first to proceed with the oxidation of organic nutrient and production of ATP via respiration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; S and N in organic carbon source are transformed into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; through desulfurylation and [[deamination]], respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Heterotrophs also allow for [[dephosphorylation]] as part of [[decomposition]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The conversion of N and S from organic form to inorganic form is a critical part of the [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[sulfur cycle]]. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S formed from desulfurylation is further oxidized by lithotrophs and phototrophs while NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; formed from deamination is further oxidized by lithotrophs to the forms available to plants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Heterotrophs’ ability to mineralize essential elements is critical to plant survival.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Most [[opisthokont]]s and [[prokaryotes]] are heterotrophic; in particular, all animals and fungi are heterotrophs.&lt;ref name="cell" /&gt; Some animals, such as [[coral]]s, form [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with autotrophs and obtain organic carbon in this way. Furthermore, some [[parasitic plant]]s have also turned fully or partially heterotrophic, while [[carnivorous plant]]s consume animals to augment their nitrogen supply while remaining autotrophic.

Animals are classified as heterotrophs by ingestion, fungi are classified as heterotrophs by absorption.

The '''hyponastic response''' is an upward bending of [[leaf|leaves]] or other [[plant]] parts, resulting from growth of the lower side. This can be observed in many terrestrial plants and is thought to be linked to the [[plant hormone]] [[auxin]].

Submerged plants often show the hyponastic response, where the upward bending of the leaves and the elongation of the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s might help the plant to restore normal gas exchange with the atmosphere.

Plants produce ethylene, and normally this dissolves in the air quite easily. But when the plant is submerged ethylene is trapped in the plant. Plants that are exposed to elevated ethylene levels in experimental set-ups also show the hyponastic response.

Sea ice algal communities are mostly concentrated in the bottom layer of the ice, but can also occur in [[Brine rejection|brine channels]] within the ice, in melt ponds, and on the surface.

Because terrestrial ice algae occur in freshwater systems, the species composition differs greatly from that of sea ice algae. These communities are significant in that they often change the color of glaciers and ice sheets, impacting the [[Albedo|reflectivity]] of the ice itself.

''Melosira arctica'', which forms up to meter-long filaments attached to the bottom of the ice, are also widespread in the Arctic and are an important food source for marine species.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While sea ice algae communities are found throughout the column of sea ice, abundance and community composition depends on the time of year.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Lasse M.|last2=Laney|first2=Samuel R.|last3=Duarte|first3=Pedro|last4=Kauko|first4=Hanna M.|last5=Fernández-Méndez|first5=Mar|last6=Mundy|first6=Christopher J.|last7=Rösel|first7=Anja|last8=Meyer|first8=Amelie|last9=Itkin|first9=Polona|date=July 2017|title=The seeding of ice algal blooms in Arctic pack ice: The multiyear ice seed repository hypothesis|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016jg003668|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences|volume=122|issue=7|pages=1529–1548|doi=10.1002/2016jg003668|issn=2169-8953}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many microhabitats available to algae on and within sea ice, and different algal groups have different preferences. For example, in late winter/early spring, motile diatoms like ''N. frigida'' have been found to dominate the uppermost layers of the ice, as far as briny channels reach, and their abundance is greater in [[multi-year ice]] (MYI) than in [[first year ice]] (FYI). Additionally, dinoflagellates have also been found to dominant in the early austral spring in Antarctic sea ice.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Sea ice algal communities can also thrive at the surface of the ice, in surface [[melt pond]]s, and in layers where [[Ice-sheet dynamics|rafting]] has occurred. In melt ponds, dominant algal types can vary with pond salinity, with higher concentrations of diatoms being found in melt ponds with higher salinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sang H.|last2=Stockwell|first2=Dean A.|last3=Joo|first3=Hyoung-Min|last4=Son|first4=Young Baek|last5=Kang|first5=Chang-Keun|last6=Whitledge|first6=Terry E.|date=2012-04-01|title=Phytoplankton production from melting ponds on Arctic sea ice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JC007717/abstract|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|language=en|volume=117|issue=C4|pages=C04030|doi=10.1029/2011JC007717|issn=2156-2202|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317055136/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JC007717/abstract|archivedate=2017-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of their adaption to low light conditions, the presence of ice algae (in particular, vertical position in the ice pack) is primarily limited by nutrient availability. The highest concentrations are found at the base of the ice because the porosity of that ice enables nutrient infiltration from seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960106363|title=Sea ice|last=1962-|first=Thomas, David N.

To survive in the harsh sea ice environment, organisms must be able to endure extreme variations in salinity, temperature, and solar radiation. Algae living in brine channels can secrete [[osmolyte]]s, such as [[dimethylsulfoniopropionate]] (DMSP), which allows them to survive the high salinities in the  channels after ice formation in the winter, as well as low salinities when the relatively fresh meltwater flushes the channels in the spring and summer.  [[File:Thurber snow.jpg|thumb|Snow at the surface reduces light availability in specific areas and thus the ability of algae to grow]]Some sea ice algae species secrete ice-binding proteins (IBP) as a gelatinous [[extracellular polymeric substance]] (EPS) to protect cell membranes from damage from ice crystal growth and freeze thaw cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krembs|first=Christopher|last2=Eicken|first2=Hajo|last3=Deming|first3=Jody W.|date=2011-03-01|title=Exopolymer alteration of physical properties of sea ice and implications for ice habitability and biogeochemistry in a warmer Arctic|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/9/3653|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=108|issue=9|pages=3653–3658|doi=10.1073/pnas.1100701108|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3048104|pmid=21368216|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228094427/http://www.pnas.org/content/108/9/3653|archivedate=2015-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  EPS alters the microstructure of the ice and creates further habitat for future blooms.

=== Role in ecosystem ===
Ice algae play a critical role in [[primary production]] and serve as part of the base of the polar food web by converting carbon dioxide and inorganic nutrients to oxygen and organic matter through photosynthesis in the upper ocean of both the Arctic and Antarctic. Within the Arctic, estimates of the contribution of sea ice algae to total primary production ranges from 3-25%, up to 50-57% in high Arctic regions.&lt;ref name="Kohlbach 2027–2044"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohlbach|first=Doreen|last2=Graeve|first2=Martin|last3=A.

Ultimately, these organisms are eaten by fish, whales, penguins, and dolphins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  When sea ice algal communities detach from the sea ice they are consumed by pelagic grazers, such as zooplankton, as they sink through the water column and by [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrates as they settle on the seafloor.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Sea ice algae as food are rich in [[Polyunsaturated fatty acid|polyunsaturated]] and other essential fatty acids, and are the exclusive producer of certain essential [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s that are important for [[copepod]] egg production, egg hatching, and zooplankton growth and function.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; [[Image:Krillicekils.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The undersurface of the [[pack ice]] in Antarctica colored green - [[Antarctic krill]] scraping off the ice algae]]

==== Temporal variation ====
The timing of sea ice algae blooms has a significant impact on the entire ecosystem. Initiation of the bloom is primarily controlled by the return of the sun in the spring (i.e. the solar angle). Because of this, ice [[Algal bloom|algae blooms]] usually occurs before the blooms of pelagic [[phytoplankton]], which require higher light levels and warmer water.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leu|first=E.|last2=Søreide|first2=J.

==== Bloom initialization ====
There are several ways in which sea ice algal blooms are thought to start their annual cycle, and hypotheses about these vary depending on water column depth, sea ice age, and taxonomic group. Where sea ice overlays deep ocean, it is proposed that cells trapped in multiyear ice brine pockets are reconnected to the water column below and quickly colonize nearby ice of all ages. This is known as the ''multiyear sea ice repository hypothesis''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This seeding source has been demonstrated in diatoms, which dominate [[Sympagic ecology|sympagic]] blooms. Other groups, such as the [[dinoflagellate]]s, which also bloom in the spring/summer, have been shown to maintain low cell numbers in the water column itself, and do not primarily overwinter within the ice.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kauko|first=Hanna M.|last2=Olsen|first2=Lasse M.|last3=Duarte|first3=Pedro|last4=Peeken|first4=Ilka|last5=Granskog|first5=Mats A.|last6=Johnsen|first6=Geir|last7=Fernández-Méndez|first7=Mar|last8=Pavlov|first8=Alexey K.|last9=Mundy|first9=Christopher J.|date=2018-06-06|title=Algal Colonization of Young Arctic Sea Ice in Spring|journal=Frontiers in Marine Science|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fmars.2018.00199|issn=2296-7745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where sea ice covers ocean that is somewhat shallower, resuspension of cells from the sediment may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnsen|first=Geir|last2=Hegseth|first2=Else Nøst|date=June 1991|title=Photoadaptation of sea-ice microalgae in the Barents Sea||journal=Polar Biology|volume=11|issue=3|doi=10.1007/bf00240206|issn=0722-4060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications of climate change ===
[[Climate change]] and warming of Arctic and Antarctic regions have the potential to greatly alter ecosystem functioning. Decreasing ice cover in polar regions is expected to lessen the relative proportion of sea ice algae production to measures of annual primary production.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2007: Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report.

This melting also contributes to [[Stratification (water)|stratification]] of the water column that alters the availability of nutrients for algae growth by decreasing the depth of the surface [[mixed layer]] and inhibiting the upwelling of nutrients from deep waters. This is expected to cause an overall shift towards pelagic phytoplankton production.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Changes in multiyear ice volume&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nghiem|first=S.

Because sea ice algae are often the base of the food web, these alterations have implications for species of higher trophic levels.&lt;ref name="Kohlbach 2027–2044" /&gt; The reproduction and migration cycles of many polar [[Consumer (food chain)|primary consumers]] are timed with the bloom of sea ice algae, meaning that a change in the timing or location of primary production could shift the distribution of prey populations necessary for significant keystone species. Production timing may also be altered by the melting through of surface melt ponds to the seawater below, which can alter sea ice algal habitat late in the growing season in such a way as to impact grazing communities as they approach winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sang Heon|last2=McRoy|first2=C.

The production of DMSP by sea ice algae also plays an important role in the carbon cycle. DMSP is oxidized by other plankton to dimethylsulfide (DMS), a compound which is linked to cloud formation. Because clouds impact precipitation and the amount of solar radiation reflected back to space ([[albedo]]), this process could create a positive feedback loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sievert|first=Stefan|last2=Kiene|first2=Ronald|last3=Schulz-Vogt|first3=Heide|title=The Sulfur Cycle|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2007.55|journal=Oceanography|volume=20|issue=2|pages=117–123|doi=10.5670/oceanog.2007.55|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud cover would increase the [[Solar irradiance|insolation]] reflected back to space by the atmosphere, potentially helping to cool the planet and support more polar habitats for sea ice algae. As of 1987, research has suggested that a doubling of [[Cloud condensation nuclei|cloud-condensation nuclei]], of which DMS is one type, would be required to counteract warming due to increased atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charlson|first=Robert J.|last2=Lovelock|first2=James E.|last3=Andreae|first3=Meinrat O.|last4=Warren|first4=Stephen G.|date=1987-04-22|title=Oceanic phytoplankton, atmospheric sulphur, cloud albedo and climate|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v326/n6114/pdf/326655a0.pdf|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=326|issue=6114|pages=655–661|doi=10.1038/326655a0|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ice algae as a tracer for paleoclimate ====
Sea ice plays a major role in the global climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/index.html|title=All About Sea Ice {{!}} National Snow and Ice Data Center|website=nsidc.org|access-date=2017-03-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320204331/http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/index.html|archivedate=2017-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite [[Measurement of sea ice|observations of sea ice]] extent date back only until the late 1970s, and longer term observational records are sporadic and of uncertain reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halfar|first=Jochen|last2=Adey|first2=Walter H.|last3=Kronz|first3=Andreas|last4=Hetzinger|first4=Steffen|last5=Edinger|first5=Evan|last6=Fitzhugh|first6=William W.|date=2013-12-03|title=Arctic sea-ice decline archived by multicentury annual-resolution record from crustose coralline algal proxy|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/49/19737|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=110|issue=49|pages=19737–19741|doi=10.1073/pnas.1313775110|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3856805|pmid=24248344|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130230957/http://www.pnas.org/content/110/49/19737|archivedate=2014-01-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While terrestrial ice [[paleoclimatology]] can be measured directly through ice cores, historical models of sea ice must rely on proxies.

Organisms dwelling on the sea ice eventually detach from the ice and fall through the water column, particularly when the sea ice melts. A portion of the material that reaches the seafloor is buried before it is consumed and is thus preserved in the [[Core sample|sedimentary record]].

There are a number of organisms whose value as proxies for the presence of sea ice has been investigated, including particular species of diatoms, [[dinoflagellate cysts]], [[ostracod]]s, and [[Foraminifera|foraminifers]]. Variation in carbon and oxygen isotopes in a sediment core can also be used to make inferences about sea ice extent. Each proxy has advantages and disadvantages; for example, some diatom species that are unique to sea ice are very abundant in the sediment record, however, preservation efficiency can vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Vernal|first=Anne|last2=Gersonde|first2=Rainer|last3=Goosse|first3=Hugues|last4=Seidenkrantz|first4=Marit-Solveig|last5=Wolff|first5=Eric W.|date=2013-11-01|title=Sea ice in the paleoclimate system: the challenge of reconstructing sea ice from proxies – an introduction|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379113003089|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|series=Sea Ice in the Paleoclimate System: the Challenge of Reconstructing Sea Ice from Proxies|volume=79|pages=1–8|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2013.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terrestrial ice algae ==
Algae also occur on terrestrial ice sheets and glaciers. The species found in these habitats are distinct from those associated with sea ice because the system is freshwater. Even within these habitats, there is a wide diversity of habitat types and algal assemblages. For example, cryosestic communities are specifically found on the surface of glaciers where the snow periodically melts during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6112-7_17|title=Algae and Cyanobacteria in Extreme Environments|last=Komárek|first=Jiří|last2=Nedbalová|first2=Linda|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402061110|editor-last=Seckbach|editor-first=Dr Joseph|series=Cellular Origin, Life in Extreme Habitats and Astrobiology|pages=321–342|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6112-7_17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On enduring ice sheets and snow pack, terrestrial ice algae often color the ice due to accessory pigments, popularly known as "[[watermelon snow]]".

=== Implications for climate change ===
Recent research, known as the Black and Bloom project, has shown the impact of ice algae on the rate of melting of ice sheets. Because of the dark colors of the algae, sunlight absorption by the ice is enhanced, leading to an increase in the melting rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|date=2016-07-21|title=Algae are melting away the Greenland ice sheet|url=http://www.nature.com/news/algae-are-melting-away-the-greenland-ice-sheet-1.20265|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=535|issue=7612|pages=336–336|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20265|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174437/http://www.nature.com/news/algae-are-melting-away-the-greenland-ice-sheet-1.20265|archivedate=2017-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the Black and Bloom project is to determine how much the algae are contributing to the darkening of the ice sheets.

An '''Internet band''', also called an '''online band''', is a [[musical group]] whose members collaborate online through broadband by utilizing a content management system and local [[digital audio workstation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/virtual-band.htm|title=What is a virtual band?|author=|date=2 July 2008|website=HowStuffWorks.com|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is sometimes released under a [[Creative Commons]] license, so musicians can share their "samples" to create collaborative musical expressions for noncommercial purposes without ever meeting face to face.

==History==

=== Cathedral ===
In March 1996, Nora Farrell and [[William Duckworth (composer)|William Duckworth]] began to develop Cathedral, one of the first interactive works of music and art on the World Wide Web.  Their aim was to create an interactive website with web-based musical instruments that anyone could play.  Also in the preliminary stages of the system, they determined that they wanted to make a place on the Web for acoustic music through a series of live webcasts and performances online.

In June 1997, Cathedral went live online.  The first build of this system included streaming audio, streaming video, animation, images, and text.  At the time, there were fewer than one million sites on the World Wide Web and fewer than 2% of those made any sounds.

According to the creators of Cathedral, their goals at that point were:
* To create an imaginative, ongoing artistic experience that builds community.
* To blur the distinctions that separate composers, performers, and audiences.
* To offer each individual listener the ability to create his or her own unique work online.
By 2003, Cathedral consisted of three primary components:
* A website that featured a variety of interactive musical, artistic, and text-based experiences.
* A group of virtual instruments that allowed listeners to participate actively and creatively.
* An Internet band that gave periodic live performances and offered listeners focused moments in which to come together and play music in community online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perceptual and Structural Implications of "Virtual" Music on the Web|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1196/annals.1284.036/abstract|journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date = 2003-11-01|issn = 1749-6632|pages = 254–262|volume = 999|issue = 1|doi = 10.1196/annals.1284.036|first = William|last = Duckworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current scenario==
Social networking sites have gained a large number of users because many aspects of society revolve around computers and the Internet. The music industry itself has undergone this change as well. People are using iTunes, YouTube and MySpace Music to share the music and communicate with others. Adaptively, artists and record labels can utilize Web sites and file sharing sites to spread their music.  Musicians who use the Internet can also form bands online.

Internet bands became popular in the early 2000s when music technology, file sharing and collaboration software became more prevalent on the Internet. While the extent of collaboration between bands may vary, an Internet band identifies as a band whose members collaborate on music projects via the Internet.

A growing number of websites offer people the opportunity to compose music online. They marry social networking with music mixing and uploading technology. Users decide what projects they wish to add their special touches to and how actively they want to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/virtual-band.htm/|title=What is a virtual band?|author=|date=2 July 2008|website=HowStuffWorks.com|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadclowns.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadclowns.com/index.php?page=/about.php|title=The Dead Clowns|author=|date=|website=The Dead Clowns|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The advantages of joining an [[online band]] include the ability to collaborate with musicians, vocalists, [[audio engineers]], etc. who reside in any part of the world with [[Internet access]]. Also, since many online bands do not perform or record in "real-time", it allows members to record their track (their part of a collaboration) at their leisure.&lt;ref name="deadclowns.com"/&gt;

=== Education through online music collaboration ===
In addition to setting a platform to creatively collaborate with other musicians, online music collaboration gives opportunities to educators and students that were not possible before its conception.  This platform provides an alternative to the traditional 1:1 music lesson, but its effectiveness on a higher scale is questionable.

Research conducted in 2007 at [[Boston University]] led by [[musicologist]] and comparative educationist [[David G. Hebert]] provided five key challenges for online music education programs:
# Prejudice regarding the legitimacy of online degrees
# Coordination between distance education and music departments
# Pressure to maximize profits at the expense of educational quality
# Management of adjunct music instructors
# Management of student behavior and provision of student services
To address these challenges, Hebert pointed out the importance of expert mentors, outstanding research theses completed online, a strong record of graduate job placement from online programs, detailed planning between instructors and music departments, and the implementation of assessment moderation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ814926.pdf|title = Five Challenges and Solutions in Online Music Teacher Education|last = Hebert|first = David G.|date = September 2007|journal = Research and Issues in Music Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaboration==
Online music collaboration is an Internet-based system designed to help coordinate online music projects. Most platforms provide a virtual space to upload recorded music files, a community forum where members can offer feedback or make alterations to the uploaded music.

Each musician usually needs to record to a click track or metronome and upload the instrument or vocals for the song independently. Then a designated Internet music producer can edit for timing and tightness between all tracks, arrange, optimize and mix all instruments together and do a final mastering process to get a complete song out of single tracks.

== Related phenomenon ==
Internet-based music collaboration can be done by individuals who never form one permanent band. The [[Playing for Change]] Foundation is a musical charity that releases music recorded by musicians from all around the globe, only some of whom have gone on to play together live.  Even more decentralized collaboration happens between YouTube users; one ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' columnist praised the cover of the ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' theme performed by violinist Jason Yang and guitarist and sound engineer Roger Lima and directed by Paolo Dy.{{quote|And these people have never met. The Internet isn't just causing collaborations between people who would otherwise never have got together, it's creating collaborations between people who still haven't got together. There's just so much creativity being uploaded that we've reached collaboration critical-mass, where mixes can be generated across the world with nothing but HTTP.  The result is a "super-feit" -- a copy superior to the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-music-videos-that-justify-existence-internet/#ixzz2AWxUYQCe|title=5 Music Videos That Justify the Existence of the Internet|author=|date=|website=Cracked.com|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Internet band communities ==
Internet bands develop online and base the foundations their work within various communities.  The systems below are examples of communities which support the formation and maintenance of online bands:
* BANDMIX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandmix.com|title=Musicians Wanted - Search Local Musician Classifieds : BandMix.com|author=|date=|website=www.BandMix.com|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the highest rated and largest "musicians wanted" and musicians classifieds online. It has a search function that enables users to find musicians and bands by instrument and zip code. It also allows users to browse the musicians and bands by state within the United States.

An '''introduced species''' ('''alien species''', '''exotic species''', '''non-indigenous species''', or '''non-native species''') is a [[species]] living outside its [[indigenous (ecology)|native]] distributional [[range (biology)|range]], but which has arrived there by [[human]] activity, either deliberate or accidental. Non-native species can have various effects on the local ecosystem.  Introduced species that become established and spread beyond the place of introduction are called [[invasive species]]. The impact of introduced species is highly variable. Some have a negative effect on a local ecosystem, while other introduced species may have no negative effect or only minor impact. Some species have been introduced intentionally to combat pests. They are called [[biocontrol]]s and may be regarded as beneficial as an alternative to pesticides in agriculture for example. In some instances the potential for being beneficial or detrimental in the long run remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Dov Sax, Aug 2008. [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/suppl.1/11490.full The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706102943/http://www.pnas.org/content/105/suppl.1/11490.full |date=July 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The effects of introduced species on natural environments have gained much scrutiny from scientists, governments, farmers and others.

== Terminology: introduced species and subsets  ==
{{Life timeline}}
The formal definition of an introduced species, from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], is ''A species that has been intentionally or inadvertently brought into a region or area. Also called an exotic or non-native species.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment. September 16, 2003. Introduced species. Web site at [http://search.epa.gov/epasearch/epasearch?typeofsearch=epa&amp;client=new_frontend&amp;epasearch&amp;&amp;filter=sample4filt.hts&amp;fld&amp;url_directory&amp;federated=no&amp;max_results=200&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fmaia%2Fhtml%2Fintro-species.html&amp;result_template=2col.ftl&amp;areaname&amp;areapagehead=epafiles_pagehead&amp;areapagefoot=epafiles_pagefoot&amp;areasidebar=search_sidebar&amp;stylesheet&amp;sort=term_relevancy&amp;faq=true&amp;results_per_page=20&amp;cluster=both&amp;sessionid=A6EA2542B3CE0920A94CACBE45CED381&amp;querytext=introduced%20species&amp;q=introduced%20species%20definition US EPA]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many terms associated with introduced species that represent subsets of introduced species, and the terminology associated with introduced species is now in flux for various reasons. Examples of these terms are ''acclimatized'', ''[[adventive species|adventive]]'', ''naturalized'', and ''immigrant''  species but those terms refer to a subset of introduced species. The term "invasive" is used to describe introduced species when the introduced species causes substantial damage to the area in which it was introduced.

'''Subset descriptions:'''

:Acclimatized species: Introduced species that have changed physically and/or behaviorally in order to adjust to their new environment.  Acclimatized species are not necessarily optimally adjusted to their new environment and may just be physically/behaviorally sufficient for the new environment.

:[[Adventive species]]

:Naturalized species (plants): A naturalized plant species refers to a non-native plant that does not need human help to reproduce and maintain its population in an area that it is not native to.

'''General description of introduced species:'''

In the broadest and most widely used sense, an introduced species is synonymous with ''non-native'' and therefore applies as well to most garden and farm organisms; these adequately fit the basic definition given above. However, some sources add to that basic definition "and are now reproducing in the wild",&lt;ref name="carlton2002"&gt;Carlton, James T. 2002. ''Introduced Species in U.S. Coastal Waters''. Pew Oceans Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; which removes from consideration as ''introduced'' species that were raised or grown in gardens or farms that do not survive without tending by people. With respect to plants, these latter are in this case defined as either ''ornamental'' or ''cultivated'' plants.

===Invasive species===

Introduction of a species outside its native range is all that is required to be qualified as an "introduced species" such that one can distinguish between introduced species that may not occur except in cultivation, under domestication or captivity whereas others become established outside their native range and reproduce without human assistance. Such species might be termed "naturalized", "established", "wild non-native species". If they further spread beyond the place of introduction and cause damage to nearby species, they are called "invasive". The transition from introduction, to establishment and to invasion has been described in the context of plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/ddi/2000/00000006/00000002/art00003= Richardson et al. 2000]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced species are essentially "non-native" species. Invasive species are those introduced species that spreadwidely or quickly and cause harm, be that to the environment,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070303161312/http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/publications/policy/invasivesEng.htm biodiversity]&lt;/ref&gt; human health, other valued resources or the economy. There have been calls from scientists to consider a species "invasive" only in terms of their spread and reproduction rather than the harm they may cause.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x A neutral terminology to define ‘invasive’ species - Colautti and MacIsaac 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a practical definition, an [[invasive species]] is one that has been introduced and become a pest in its new location, spreading (invading) by natural means. The term is used to imply both a sense of urgency and actual or potential harm. For example, U.S. Executive Order 13112 (1999) defines "invasive species" as "an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health".&lt;ref&gt;CEQ (1999). Web site page with [http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/nepa/regs/eos/eo13112.html Executive Order 13112] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515154626/http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/nepa/regs/eos/eo13112.html |date=2008-05-15 }} text.&lt;/ref&gt; The biological definition of invasive species, on the other hand, makes no reference to the harm they may cause, only to the fact that they spread beyond the area of original introduction.

Although some argue that "invasive" is a loaded word and harm is difficult to define,&lt;ref name=carlton2002 /&gt; the fact of the matter is that organisms have and continue to be introduced to areas in which they are not native, sometimes with but usually without much regard to the harm that could result.

From a regulatory perspective, it is neither desirable nor practical to list as undesirable or outright ban all non-native species (although the [[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]] has adopted an approach that comes close to this). Regulations require a definable distinction between non-natives that are deemed especially onerous and all others. Introduced ''pest species'' that are ''officially listed'' as invasive, best fit the definition of an ''invasive species''.  Early detection and rapid response is the most effective strategy for regulating a pest species and reducing economic and environmental impacts of an introduction &lt;ref&gt;2013. Invasive Species Program. Clemson University – DPI. http://www.clemson.edu/public/regulatory/plant_industry/invasive_exotic_programs/. Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]], the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]] prevents the introduction of any animal not naturally occurring in the wild or any of a list of both animals or plants introduced previously and proved to be invasive.

== Nature of introductions ==
By [[invasion biology terminology|definition]], a species is considered "introduced" when its transport into an area outside of its native range is human mediated.  Introductions by humans can be described as either intentional or accidental.  Intentional introductions have been motivated by individuals or groups who either (1) believe that the newly introduced species will be in some way beneficial to humans in its new location or, (2) species are introduced intentionally but with no regard to the potential impact.  Unintentional or accidental introductions are most often a byproduct of human movements, and are thus unbound to human motivations.  Subsequent range expansion of introduced species may or may not involve human activity.

[[File:Wheat-haHula-ISRAEL.JPG|thumb|300px|Wheat ''[[Triticum]]'' introduced worldwide from its place of origin [[Mesopotamia]].]]

=== Intentional introductions ===
Species that humans intentionally transport to new regions can subsequently become successfully established in two ways. In the first case, organisms are purposely released for establishment in the wild. It is sometimes difficult to predict whether a species will become established upon release, and if not initially successful, humans have made repeated introductions to improve the probability that the species will survive and eventually reproduce in the wild.  In these cases it is clear that the introduction is directly facilitated by human desires.
[[Image:Male Silver Pheasant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Male ''Lophura nycthemera'' ([[silver pheasant]]), a native of East Asia that has been introduced into parts of [[Europe]] for ornamental reasons.]]
In the second case, species intentionally transported into a new region may escape from captive or cultivated populations and subsequently establish independent breeding populations. Escaped organisms are included in this category because their initial transport to a new region is human motivated.

==== Motivations for intentional introductions ====

'''Economic:'''  Perhaps the most common motivation for introducing a species into a new place is that of economic gain. Non-native species can become such a common part of an environment, culture, and even diet that little thought is given to their geographic origin. For example, soybeans, kiwi fruit, [[wheat]], [[honey bees]], and all [[livestock]] except the [[American bison]] and the [[wild turkey|turkey]] are non-native species to North America. Collectively, non-native crops and livestock comprise 98% of US food.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, Lori Lach, Rodolfo Zuniga, and Doug Morrison, Environmental and Economic Costs Associated with Non-Indigenous Species in the United States, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Cornell University (Ithaca, New York), June 12, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; These and other benefits from non-natives are so vast that, according to the Congressional Research Service, they probably exceed the costs.&lt;ref&gt;Corn; Tim Johnson, "Invasive Species," The Burlington Free Press, November 9, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other examples of species introduced for the purposes of benefiting [[agriculture]], [[aquaculture]], or other economic activities are widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Naylor, R.L., S.L. Williams, and D.R. Strong.  2001.  Aquaculture—a gateway for exotic species.  Science 294: 1655–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eurasian carp]] was first introduced to the United States as a potential food source. The [[apple snail]] was released in Southeast Asia with the intent that it be used as a protein source, and subsequently to places like Hawaii to establish a food industry.  In Alaska, foxes were introduced to many islands to create new populations for the fur trade. About twenty species of African and European [[dung beetles]] have established themselves in Australia after deliberate introduction by the [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]] in an effort to reduce the impact of livestock manure. The timber industry promoted the introduction of Monterey pine (''[[Pinus radiata]]'') from California to Australia and New Zealand as a commercial timber crop.  These examples represent only a small subsample of species that have been moved by humans for economic interests.

The rise in the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s has added another potential economic advantage to introducing new/modified species into different environments.  Companies such as [[Monsanto]] that earn much of their profit through the selling of genetically modified seeds has added to the controversy surrounding introduced species.  The effect of genetically modified organisms varies from organism to organism and is still being researched today, however the rise of genetically modified organisms has added complexity to the conversations surrounding introduced species.

==== Human enjoyment ====
Introductions have also been important in supporting recreation activities or otherwise increasing human enjoyment.  Numerous fish and game animals have been introduced for the purposes of sport fishing and hunting ([[earthworms as invasive species]]).  The introduced amphibian (''[[Ambystoma tigrinum]]'') that threatens the endemic California salamander (''[[Ambystoma californiense]]'') was introduced to California as a source of bait for fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, SPD,  H.B. Shaffer, S.R. Voss, B.M. Fitzpatrick.  Hybridization between a rare, native tiger salamander and its introduced congener.  2003. Ecological Applications 13: 1263–1275.&lt;/ref&gt; Pet animals have also been frequently transported into new areas by humans, and their escapes have resulted in several successful introductions, such as those of feral cats and parrots.

Many plants have been introduced with the intent of aesthetically improving public recreation areas or private properties.  The introduced [[Norway maple]] for example occupies a prominent status in many of Canada's parks.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, J. and A. Sandberg.  Friends or foe? Invasive species and public green space in Toronto.  2004.  The Geographical Review 94: 178–198.&lt;/ref&gt; The transport of [[ornamental plants]] for landscaping use has and continues to be a source of many introductions.  Some of these species have escaped horticultural control and become invasive. Notable examples include [[water hyacinth]], [[salt cedar]], and [[purple loosestrife]]

In other cases, species have been translocated for reasons of "cultural nostalgia," which  refers to instances in which humans who have migrated to new regions have intentionally brought with them familiar organisms.  Famous examples include the introduction of [[starling]]s to North America by Englishman [[Eugene Schieffelin]], a lover of the works of Shakespeare and the chairman of the [[American Acclimatization Society]], who, it is rumoured, wanted to introduce all of the birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays into the United States.  He deliberately released eighty starlings into Central Park in New York City in 1890, and another forty in 1891.

Yet another prominent example of an introduced species that became invasive is the [[European rabbit]] in [[Rabbits in Australia|Australia]]. [[Thomas Austin]], a British landowner had rabbits released on his estate in Victoria because he missed hunting them. A more recent example is the introduction of the [[common wall lizard]] to North America by a [[Cincinnati]] boy, George Rau, around 1950 after a family vacation to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Deichsel, G. &amp; Gist, D. H. [http://www.lacerta.de/Themengebiete/Verschleppung%20und%20Aussetzung/Podarcis_muralis_in_Cincinnati.html On the Origin of the Common Wall Lizards Podarcis muralis (Reptilia: Lacertidae) in Cincinnati, Ohio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909153444/http://www.lacerta.de/Themengebiete/Verschleppung%20und%20Aussetzung/Podarcis_muralis_in_Cincinnati.html |date=2009-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Addressing environmental problems ====
Intentional introductions have also been undertaken with the aim of ameliorating environmental problems.  A number of fast spreading plants such as [[kudzu]] have been introduced as a means of [[erosion]] control. Other species have been introduced as [[biological control]] agents to control [[invasive species]] and involves the purposeful introduction of a [[natural enemy]] of the target species with the intention of reducing its numbers or controlling its spread.

A special case of introduction is the reintroduction of a species that has become locally endangered or extinct, done in the interests of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Shirey, P.D. and G.A. Lamberti. 2010. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123196255/PDFSTART Assisted colonization under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.] ''Conservation Letters'' 3(1): 45–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of successful reintroductions include wolves to [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the U.S., and the [[red kite]] to parts of England and Scotland.  Introductions or translocations of species have also been proposed in the interest of [[Conservation genetics|genetic conservation]], which advocates the introduction of new individuals into genetically depauperate populations of endangered or threatened species.&lt;ref&gt;Moritz, Craig. 1999. Conservation units and translocations: Strategies for conserving evolutionary processes.  Hereditas 130: 217–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above examples highlight the intent of humans to introduce species as a means of incurring some benefit. While these benefits have in some cases been realized, introductions have also resulted in unforeseen costs, particularly when introduced species take on characteristics of invasive species.

=== Unintentional introductions ===
Unintentional introductions occur when species are transported by human vectors.  Increasing rates of human travel are providing accelerating opportunities for species to be accidentally transported into areas in which they are not considered native.  For example, three species of [[rat]] (the black, Norway and Polynesian) have spread to most of the world as hitchhikers on ships, and [[arachnids]] such as scorpions and exotic spiders are sometimes transported to areas far beyond their native range by riding in shipments of tropical fruit. There are also numerous examples of marine organisms being transported in [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|ballast water]], one being the [[zebra mussel]].  Over 200 species have been introduced to the [[San Francisco Bay]] in this manner making it the most heavily invaded estuary in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A.N. And J.T. Carlton. 1998.  Accelerating invasion rate in a highly invaded estuary.  Science 279: 555–558.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also the accidental release of the Africanized honey bees (AHB), known colloquially as "killer bees" or [[Africanized bee]] to Brazil in 1957 and the [[Asian carps]] to the United States. The insect commonly known as the [[brown marmorated stink bug]] (''Halyomorpha halys'') was introduced accidentally in Pennsylvania. Another form of unintentional introductions is when an intentionally introduced plant carries a parasite or herbivore with it. Some become invasive, for example the [[Aphis nerii|oleander aphid]], accidentally introduced with the ornamental plant, [[oleander]].

Most accidentally or intentionally introduced species do not become invasive as the ones  mentioned above. For instance Some 179 coccinellid species have been introduced to the U.S. and Canada; about 27 of these non-native species have become established, and only a handful can be considered invasive, including the intentionally introduced ''Harmonia axyridis'', multicolored Asian lady beetle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://biostor.org/reference/56473|title= Field guide to recently introduced species of coccinellidae (Coleoptera) in North America, with a revised key to north American genera of coccinellini }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the small percentage of introduced species that become invasive can produce profound ecological changes. In North America ''Harmonia axyridis'' has become the most abundant lady beetle and probably accounts for more observations than all the native lady beetles put together.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lostladybug.org/summary-page-555.php Lost Ladybug Project&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduced plants ==
[[File:Horse-chestnut_800.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Aesculus|horse chestnut]] tree, ''[[Aesculus hippocastanum]]''. Native to Greece, it has been introduced across most of Europe and parts of North America as an ornamental plant. The horse chestnut tree is an example of a non-invasive introduced species, as while it is foreign it has naturalised and integrated into the ecosystems it was introduced to without apparent negative effects on native species there]]
Many non-native plants have been introduced into new territories, initially as either [[ornamental plant]]s or for [[erosion]] control, stock feed, or forestry.  Whether an exotic will become an [[invasive species]] is seldom understood in the beginning, and many non-native ornamentals languish in the trade for years before suddenly naturalizing and becoming invasive.

Peaches, for example, originated in China, and have been carried to much of the populated world. Tomatoes are native to the Andes. Squash (pumpkins), maize (corn), and tobacco are native to the Americas, but were introduced to the Old World. Many introduced species require continued human intervention to survive in the new environment. Others may become feral, but do not seriously [[interspecific competition|compete]] with natives, but simply increase the biodiversity of the area.

[[Dandelions]] are also introduced species to North America.

A very troublesome marine species in southern Europe is the [[seaweed]] ''[[Caulerpa taxifolia]]''. ''Caulerpa'' was first observed in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in 1984, off the coast of [[Monaco]]. By 1997, it had covered some 50&amp;nbsp;km². It has a strong potential to overgrow natural [[biotope]]s, and represents a major risk for sublittoral [[ecosystem]]s. The origin of the alga in the Mediterranean was thought to be either as a migration through the [[Suez Canal]] from the Red Sea, or as an accidental introduction from an aquarium.  Another troublesome plant species is the terrestrial plant ''Phyla canescens,'' which was intentionally introduced into many countries in North America, Europe, and Africa as an ornamental plant.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, K. 1992.

[[Japanese knotweed]] grows profusely in many nations.  Human beings introduced it into many places in the 19th century.  It is a source of [[resveratrol]], a dietary supplement.

[[File:Braekel.jpg|thumb|Chickens ''[[Gallus gallus domesticus]]'', from Asia, introduced in the rest of the world]]

== Introduced animals ==
Bear in mind that most introduced species do not become invasive. Examples of introduced animals that have become invasive include the [[gypsy moth]] in eastern [[North America]], the [[zebra mussel]] and [[alewife]] in the [[Great Lakes]], the [[Canada goose]] and [[Eastern gray squirrel|gray squirrel]] in Europe, the [[muskrat]] in Europe and Asia, the [[cane toad]] and [[red fox]] in Australia, [[Coypu|nutria]] in North America, Eurasia, and [[Africa]], and the [[common brushtail possum]] in [[New Zealand]]. In Taiwan, the success of introduced bird species was related to their native range size and body size; larger species with larger native range sizes were found to have larger introduced range sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Su, S.|author2=Cassey, P. | author3=Dyer, E.

One notoriously devastating introduced species is the Small Indian Mongoose (Herpestes Javanicus Auropunctatus). Originating in a region encompassing Iran and India, it was introduced to the West Indies and Hawaii in the late 1800s for pest control. Since it has thrived on prey unequipped to deal with its speed, nearly leading to the local extinction of a variety of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Sarah|title=00 of the world's worst invasive alien species: a selection from the global invasive species database|journal=Auckland: Invasive Species Specialist Group|date=2000|volume=12|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Most commonly introduced species ===

Some species, such as the [[brown rat]], [[house sparrow]], [[common pheasant|ring-necked pheasant]] and [[European starling]], have been introduced very widely. In addition there are some [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[pet]] species that frequently become [[feral]]; these include [[rabbit]]s, [[dog]]s, [[domestic duck|duck]]s, [[goat]]s, [[fish]], [[pig]]s, and [[cat]]s.

== Genetics ==
When a new species is introduced, the species could potentially breed with members of native species, producing hybrids.  The effect of the creating of hybrids can range from having little effect, a negative effect, to having devastating effects on native species.  Potential negative effects include hybrids that are less fit for their environment resulting in a population decrease.   This was seen in the Atlantic Salmon population when high levels of escape from Atlantic Salmon farms into the wild populations resulted in hybrids that had reduced survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGinnity|first=Philip|last2=Prodöhl|first2=Paulo|last3=Ferguson|first3=Andy|last4=Hynes|first4=Rosaleen|last5=Maoiléidigh|first5=Niall ó|last6=Baker|first6=Natalie|last7=Cotter|first7=Deirdre|last8=O'Hea|first8=Brendan|last9=Cooke|first9=Declan|date=2003-12-07|title=Fitness reduction and potential extinction of wild populations of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, as a result of interactions with escaped farm salmon|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/1532/2443|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=270|issue=1532|pages=2443–2450|doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2520|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1691531|pmid=14667333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential positive effects include adding to the [[genetic diversity]] of the population which can increase the [[adaptation]] ability of the population and increase the number of healthy individuals within a population. This was seen in the introduction of guppies in Trinidad to encourage population growth and introduce new alleles into the population.  The results of this introduction included increased levels of [[heterozygosity]] and a larger population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Sarah W.|last2=Gerberich|first2=Jill C.|last3=Angeloni|first3=Lisa M.|last4=Bailey|first4=Larissa L.|last5=Broder|first5=Emily D.|last6=Torres-Dowdall|first6=Julian|last7=Handelsman|first7=Corey A.|last8=López-Sepulcre|first8=Andrés|last9=Reznick|first9=David N.|date=2016-08-01|title=Gene flow from an adaptively divergent source causes rescue through genetic and demographic factors in two wild populations of Trinidadian guppies|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12356/abstract|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=879–891|doi=10.1111/eva.12356|issn=1752-4571|pmc=4947150|pmid=27468306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28531">This is a '''list of the full [[palette (computing)|color palettes]]''' for notable [[video game console]] hardware.

For each unique palette, an image color test chart and sample image ([[True Color|Truecolor]] original follows) rendered with that palette (without [[dither]]ing) are given. The test chart shows the full 8-bits, 256 levels of the red, green and blue ([[RGB color model|RGB]]) primary colors and cyan, magenta and yellow complementary colors, along with a full 8-bits, 256 levels grayscale. Gradients of RGB intermediate colors (orange, lime green, sea green, sky blue, violet and fuchsia), and a full [[hue]]'s spectrum are also present. Color charts are not [[Gamma correction|gamma]] corrected.

==Atari==

===Atari 2600===
{{see also|Television Interface Adaptor}}
The [[Atari 2600]] used different [[YIQ]] color palettes dependent on the television signal format used.&lt;ref&gt;Atari 2600 [http://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/archives/200109/msg00285.html "TIA color chart"]. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wRXhh2Zn?url=http://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/archives/200109/msg00285.html |date=February 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NTSC====
With the [[NTSC]] format, a 128-color palette was available, built based on eight [[luminance]] values and 15 combinations of Pb and Pr [[Chrominance|chroma]] signals (plus Pb&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Pr&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for a pure [[grayscale]]):

====PAL====
With the [[PAL]] format, a 104-color palette was available. 128-color entries were still selectable, but due to changes in color encoding schemes, 32 color entries results in the same eight shades of gray:

The [[SECAM]] palette was reduced to a simple [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#3-bit RGB|3-bit RGB]], containing only 8 colors (black, blue, red, magenta, green, cyan, yellow and white) by mapping the luminance to color and ignoring the hue:

==Nintendo==

===NES===
The [[Picture Processing Unit]] (PPU) was used in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and used the [[YIQ|YIQ color space]] to create a 64-color palette , of which nine are duplicates and one is out of [[NTSC]]'s [[gamut]], giving a total of 54 useful colors. The palette is built based on four [[luminance]] values and twelve combinations of Pb and Pr [[Chrominance|chroma]] signals (plus two series of Pb&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Pr&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for eight pure grays). Two of the shades of gray are identical, one has negative brightness, and one is within 2% of another, so sometimes the palette has been reported to have 53 to 55 colors.

In addition to this, it had 3 color emphasis bits which can be used to tint the entire palette any combination of red, green and blue. This extends the total available colors to 432, but inconveniently divided into 8 variations of the base 54. Because it affects the whole palette at once it may be considered more of a filter effect applied to the image, rather than an increased palette range.

The NES could select 4 palettes each containing four of these colors (however, color 0 of each palette has to be the same, so technically, 13 different colors are available at a time) to be applied to the background. A background palette is applied to a 16x16 pixel area, however through a special video mode of the [[Memory Management Controller#MMC5|MMC5]] [[Memory Management Controller|mapper]] it is possible for every 8x8 pixel tile to have its individual palette. As for sprites, 4 different palettes can be used at a time (with color 0 being transparent in each) and every 8x8 or 8x16 pixels can have their own palette, allowing for a total of 12 different colors to use for sprites at any given time.

Because of the constraints mentioned above, converting a photograph often results in [[attribute clash]]. Conversions with and without dithering follow, using the hex palette &lt;code&gt;0F160608 0F162720 0F090010 0F0A1910&lt;/code&gt;:

===Super NES (SNES)===
The Picture Processing Unit (PPU) used in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] has a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#15-bit RGB|15-bit RGB]] (32,768 color) palette, with up to 256 simultaneous colors at once.

However, while the hardware palette can only contain 256 entries, in most display modes the graphics are arranged into between 2 and 4 layers, and these layers can be combined using additive or subtractive color blending. 
Because these blended colors are calculated by the hardware itself, and do not have to be represented by any of the existing palette entries, the actual number of visible colors onscreen at any one time can be much higher.

The exact number depends on the number of layers, and the combination of colors used by these layers, as well as what blending mode and graphical effects are in use. In theory it can show the entire 32,768 colors, but in practice this is rarely the case for reasons such as memory use. Most games use 256-color mode, with 15-color palettes assigned to 8x8 pixel areas of the background.

===Game Boy===
The original [[Game Boy]] uses a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#2-bit Grayscale|monochrome 4-shades]] palette. Due to the fact that the non-backlighted LCD display background is greenish, this results in a greenscale graphic display, as it is shown in the simulated image (at Game Boy display resolution), below. The Game Boy Pocket uses a monochrome 4-shades palette using actual gray.

===Game Boy Color===
The [[Game Boy Color]] systems use a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#15-bit RGB|15-bit RGB]] (32,768 colors) palette.

The specific Game Boy Color (Type 3) game cartridges presents up to 56 colors without the use of special programming techniques from the full 32,768. From these, 32 are for a background palette, plus 8 hardware sprite palettes, with 3 colors plus transparent each. Typically, the sprite palettes shares some colors (black, white or others), so the total colors displayed are less than 56.

Though there is a 56 color limit, this in of itself is a palette storage limit and not an actual hardware limitation. As such, the programmer can swap out the palettes on a per-scanline basis. Because of this ability to swap out the palettes each scanline, over ten thousand colors can actually appear on screen per frame when programmed on a per-scanline basis.

:{|

|-
|[[File:Screen color test GameboyColor 32colors.png]]

When an older monochrome original Game Boy game cartridge (Type 1) is plugged-in, if certain combinations of the controls are held during startup (or if the game is recognized from a hard-coded list in the device's ROM), the games are colorized with one of the factory 12 false color palettes. In this mode, games can have from 4 to 10 colors, due 4 are for the background plane palette and there are two more hardware sprite planes palettes, with 3 colors plus transparent each.

The following shows these startup palettes (background plus both sprite planes) and the combination of controls used (the names are taken from the Game Boy user's manual; the colors are simulated):

===Game Boy Advance===
The [[Game Boy Advance]]/[[Game Boy Advance SP|SP]]/[[Game Boy Micro|Micro]] systems also uses a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#15-bit RGB|15-bit RGB]] palette, and along with the original and Color modes, they have also a specific [[Highcolor]] 32,768 colors mode. The LCD displays of the [[Game Boy Micro|Micro]] and some models of the [[Game Boy Advance SP|SP]] are backlit, giving brighter images.

==Sega==

===Master System===
The [[Master System]] had a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#6-bit RGB|6-bit RGB]] palette (64 colors), with 31 colors on-screen at once. It is possible to display all 64 colors at once using raster effects (line interrupts).

There are only 512 different 8x8 tile patterns to cover the screen though, when 768 would be required for a complete 256x192 screen. This means that at least 1/3 of the tiles will have to be repeated. To help maximize tile reuse, they can be flipped either vertically or horizontally. The 64 sprites of 8x16 pixels can also be used to help to cover the screen (max 8 per scanline).

Because of the constraints mentioned above, there are no current correct simulated screen images available for the Sega Master System.

:[[File:Screen color test SEGAMasterSystem.png]]

===Game Gear===
The [[Game Gear]] had a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit RGB]] palette (4096 colors), with 31 colors on-screen at once.

===Mega Drive/Genesis===
The [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] used a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#9-bit RGB|9-bit RGB]] palette (512 colors, 1536 including shadow and highlight mode) with up to 61 colors on-screen at once without raster effects (4 palette lines of 16 colors each, palette indices $x0 are definable but considered as transparent, and can only be used as the background color).

===TurboGrafx-16===
The [[TurboGrafx-16]] used a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#9-bit RGB|9-bit RGB]] palette, like the Mega Drive/Genesis, consisting of 512 colors with 482 colors on-screen at once (16 background palettes of 16 colors each, with at least 1 common color among all background palettes, and 16 sprite palettes of 15 colors each, plus transparent which was visible as the overscan area).

The '''''Marburg Journal of Religion''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[electronic journal|online]] [[academic journal]] that publishes articles on empirical and theoretical studies of [[religion]]. The first issue having appeared in April 1996. The original concept was developed by [[Michael Pye]] together with his assistant Richard Böhme, who was the first Web Editor. The editorial team was broadened in 1999 to include Peter Antes ([[Hanover|Hannover]]) and [[Andreas Grünschloß]] ([[Göttingen]]) and in 2007 Edith Franke ([[Marburg]]). Doreen Christen became Web Editor in 2002. The first separate Reviews Editor was Monika Schrimpf (from 2001) and this role was taken up by Katja Triplett from 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/ep/0004/about/editorialTeamBio/628]&lt;/ref&gt;

Papers published in the ''Marburg Journal of Religion'' are documented and abstracted in the bibliographical journal ''[[Science of Religion (journal)|Science of Religion]]'', now published by [[Brill Publishers]] in [[Leiden]]. The abstracts published in the ''Marburg Journal of Religion'' itself may be published elsewhere on condition that full documentation of the article is provided.

'''National Non-Fiction Day''' (NNFD) is annual celebration of children's [[non-fiction]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foyles.co.uk/news/national-nonfiction-day-to-be-celebrated-in-uk] Foyles: National Non-Fiction Day to be celebrated in UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/reading_the_game/news/1880_national_non-fiction_day_to_debut_on_4_november] National Literacy Trust: National Non-Fiction Day to debut on 4 November&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initiated by [[Federation of Children's Book Groups|The Federation of Children's Book Groups]] in partnership with Scholastic Children’s Books and is celebrated across the UK each year on the first Thursday in November (at approximately the same time as the announcement of the winners of the [[School Library Association]] Information Book Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sla.org.uk/information-book-award.php]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The day is used by libraries, schools, literacy organisations, book reviewers and parents to highlight the best information and narrative non-fiction books for children, and to show how it’s not just fiction that can be read and enjoyed for pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achuka.co.uk/achockablog/archives/2011/10/national-non-fi.html] Achokablog: National Non-Fiction Day, This Thursday&lt;/ref&gt; Each year there is a different theme to the day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7214">[[Language]] has a long evolutionary history and is closely related to the [[brain]], but what makes the [[human]] brain uniquely adapted to language is unclear. The regions of the brain that are involved in language in humans have similar analogues in apes and monkeys, and yet they do not use language. There may also be a [[gene]]tic component: mutations in the [[FOXP2]] gene prevent humans from constructing complete sentences.&lt;ref name=disorders&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=G.|author2=Rabagliati, H.|title=What developmental disorders can tell us about the nature and origins of language|journal=Nature Neuroscience|year=2006|volume=9|pages=1226–1229|doi=10.1038/nn1766|url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v9/n10/full/nn1766.html|issue=10|pmid=17001342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurobiological adaptations for language ==

=== Broca's and Wernicke's areas ===
{{Main|Broca's area|Wernicke's area}}
These regions are where language is located in the brain&amp;nbsp;– everything from [[speech]] to [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoff|first=E|title=Language Development|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-495-50171-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language itself is based on symbols used to represent concepts in the world, and this system appears to be housed in these areas. The language regions in human brains highly resemble similar regions in other primates, even though humans are the only species that use language.&lt;ref name=coevolution&gt;{{cite web|last=Boulton|first=David|title=Terrence Deacon, Ph.D. - The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain|url=http://www.childrenofthecode.org/interviews/deacon.htm|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain structures of chimps are very similar to those of humans. Both contain Broca's and Wernicke's [[Homology (biology)|homologues]] that are involved in communication. Broca's area is largely used for planning and producing vocalizations in both chimps and humans. Wernicke's area appears to be where linguistic representations and symbols are mapped to specific concepts. This functionality is present in both chimps and humans; the chimp Wernicke's area is much more similar to its human counterpart than is the Broca's area, suggesting that Wernicke's is more evolutionary ancient than Broca's.&lt;ref name=brocas /&gt;

=== Motor neurons ===
[[File:Sagittalmouth.png|thumb|300px|[[Sagittal plane|Sagittal section]] of human vocal tract]]
In order to speak, the breathing system must be voluntarily repurposed to produce vocal sounds,&lt;ref name=coevolution /&gt; which allows the breathing mechanisms to be temporarily deactivated in favor of [[song]] or speech production. The human [[vocal tract]] has evolved to be more suited to speaking, with a lower [[larynx]], 90° turn in the windpipe, and large, round tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Stephen|title=Doctor Dolittle's Delusion|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=London|isbn=0-300-10339-5|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Motor neurons]] in birds and humans bypass the unconscious systems in the brainstem to give direct control of the larynx to the brain.&lt;ref name=semanticurge /&gt;

== Theories of language origin ==

=== Gestural origin ===
The earliest language was strictly vocal; reading and writing came later.&lt;ref name=coevolution /&gt; New research suggests that the combination of [[gestures]] and vocalizations may have led to the development of more complicated language in protohumans. Chimps that produce attention-getting sounds show activation in areas of the brain that are highly similar to Broca's area in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arbib|first=M.|author2=Bota, M.|title=Language evolution: neural homologies and neuroimformatics|journal=Neural Networks|year=2003|volume=16|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2003.08.002|pages=1237–1260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taglialatela|first=J. P.|author2=Russell, J. L. |author3=Schaeffer, J. A. |author4=Hopkins, W. D. |title=Chimpanzee Vocal Signaling Points to a Multimodal Origin of Human Language|journal=PLoS ONE|date=20 April 2011|volume=6|series=4|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018852 |pages=e18852 |pmid=21533079 |pmc=3080370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even hand and mouth movements with no vocalizations cause very similar activation patterns in the Broca's area of both humans and monkeys.&lt;ref name=brocas&gt;{{cite web|last=Falk|first=D|title=The Evolution of Broca's Area|url=http://www.ibro.info/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=3145}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; When monkeys view other monkeys gesturing, [[mirror neurons]] in the Broca's homologue activate. Groups of mirror neurons are specialized to respond only to one kind of viewed action, and it is currently believed that these may be an evolutionary origin to the neurons that are adapted for speech processing and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fadiga|first=L|author2=Craighero, L. |author3=D'Ausilio, A |title=Broca's Area in Language, Action, and Music|journal=The Neurosciences and Music III—Disorders and Plasticity|year=2009|volume=1169|pages=448–458|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04582.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal grammar ===
The [[language bioprogram hypothesis]] proposes that humans have an innate, [[cognitive]] [[grammar|grammatical]] structure allowing them to develop and understand language. According to this theory, this system is embedded in human genetics and underpins the basic grammar of all languages.&lt;ref name=brocas /&gt; Some evidence suggests that at least some of our linguistic capacities may be genetically controlled. Mutations in the [[FOXP2]] gene prevent people from combining words and phrases into sentences.&lt;ref name=disorders /&gt; However, these genes are present in the heart, lungs, and brain, and their role is not entirely clear.&lt;ref name=disorders /&gt;

It is possible that the human capacity for grammar evolved from non-semantic behavior like singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deacon|first1=TW|title=Colloquium paper: a role for relaxed selection in the evolution of the language capacity|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=11 May 2010|volume=107 Suppl 2|pages=9000-6|doi=10.1073/pnas.0914624107|pmid=20445088|pmc=3024028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds have the ability to produce, process, and learn complex vocalizations, but the units of a birdsong, when removed from the larger meaning and context of the birdsong as a whole, have no inherent meaning. Early hominids may have evolved capacities for similar, non-semantic purposes, that were later modified for symbolic language.&lt;ref name=semanticurge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sereno|first=M. I.|title=Language origins without the semantic urge|journal=Cognitive Science Online|year=2005|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–12|url=http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/papers/LangOrigins05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6652">'''Obstacles to troop movement''' represent either natural, human habitat originated, constructed, concealed obstacles, or obstructive impediments to movement of military troops and their vehicles, or to their visibility. By impeding [[strategic movement|strategic]], [[operational mobility|operational]] or [[tactical manoeuvre]], the obstacle represents an added barrier between opposing combat forces, and therefore prevent achievement of objectives and goals specified in the operational planning schedule. The constructed obstacles are used as an aid to defending a position or area as part of the general [[defensive plan]] of the commander. The obstacles that originate from the human habitat can be converted by troops into constructed obstacles by either performing additional construction, or executing demolitions to obstruct movement over the transport network, to create a [[choke point]], or to deny traversing of an area to the enemy. The natural obstacles can be used defensively by securing a more difficult to breach defensive position by for example securing a flank on terrain that is deemed impossible to traverse, thus denying the enemy an ability to close into combat range of direct fire weapons.

==Role of obstacles==
Obstacles are used in combat operations to create [[choke point]]s, deny [[mobility corridor]]s and [[avenue of approach]] to positions, to enhance field of fire for direct fire weapons, or to protect [[key tactical terrain]] features to the enemy.

==Natural obstacles==
Natural obstacles are represented by those terrain features that for which few troops and their vehicles have capability to traverse. They include water obstacles, or areas of poor drainage such as lakes, rivers, swamps and marshes. The former two can be crossed by [[amphibious vehicles]] capable of swimming, or vehicles capable of [[deep wading]] after preparation, or by constructing a water crossing, and thus creating an easily targeted choke point. Soil and rock can also represent mobility obstacles if the soil is too soft and unable to support the weight of the military vehicles, or the terrain is fractured by cliffs, or large boulders that make organised movement impossible. While soft soil is relative to [[vehicle ground pressure]], there is little that can be done to negotiate very rocky terrain or cliffs except by using specially trained [[light infantry]] troops. Vegetation such as [[jungle]]s or dense [[forest]]s can also represent obstacles to movement, in some cases even to light infantry troops. Some natural obstacles can be a result of climatic or soil activity such as deep snow that by covering all terrain makes safe traversing difficult and slow, or [[landslide]]s that may create an obstruction suddenly despite previously clear [[route reconnaissance]] report.

==Habitat obstacles==
While human habitat had, since early construction of roads, sought to create ways of negotiating terrain faster, the human activity on the landscape can create obstacles in its own right. Artificial lakes and ponds, canals, and areas of agricultural cultivation, particularly those that are water-intensive such as rice-paddy fields create obstacles often more difficult then the natural equivalents. Mining activity creates quarries, and the building of roads, rail roads and dams also involve construction of cuts and fills. Seeded tree-line [[windbreak]]s, [[hedgerow]]s, stone walls and plantation forests also disrupt mobility, particularly of vehicles. Lastly the urban areas in themselves represent obstacles by offering elevated firing positions and canyon-like choke points by forcing the opponent to advance through the streets.

==Constructed obstacles==
Constructed obstacles are those prepared by [[military engineering]] troops, often [[combat engineer]]s, by either using materials to construct impediments to foot and vehicle-borne troops, or by using demolition methods, or excavation such as an [[abatis]], to create obstacles from natural materials and terrain in specific location in accordance with the overall plan of operations. Sometimes such obstacles can be created intentionally or unintentionally through effects of [[artillery fire cratering]]. Buildings demolished due to combat or aerial bombing become very effective obstacles as rubble represents difficult to negotiate and irregular piles of building materials.

==Concealed obstacles==
Concealed obstacles are used with the intention of not only preventing movement of enemy troops, but also causing casualties during attempted movement. Although one of the oldest forms of obstacle use, this became far deadlier with the invention of the [[Land mine|mine warfare]], and more so with air-delivered scattered submunition minelets that can create an instant minefield.

==Obstructive obstacles==
Obstructive obstacles are used primarily to deny terrain visibility to the enemy, thus creating uncertainty in targeting friendly troops. Although ancient in use as [[tar smoke pot]]s, modern [[smoke screen]]s are temporary and are used as a tactical measure during manoeuvring, often when a unit is performing a [[position change]].

==Obstacle negotiation==
Ground troops prefer to deal with physical obstacles by circumventing them as rapidly as possible, thus avoiding becoming [[stationary target]]s to the enemy direct and indirect fire weapons, and aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;p.296, Liddell Hart&lt;/ref&gt; Where this is not possible, in modern warfare the most expedient measures taken against constructed or urban obstacles are to either use armoured vehicles, preferably tanks, to remove the obstacle, or to demolish them by firing [[High Explosive]] munitions at them. Where combat engineers are present, they can perform this using their specialist skills and tools or vehicles. In the case of natural obstacles, specialist engineering equipment is usually required to negotiate the obstacle, commonly bridging or pontoons. The solution to obstacle bridging had at the strategic level created new forms of warfare and employment of troops in the amphibious operations, and later the airborne operations. At the operational level the use of helicopters in airmobile operations offers a vertical option to negotiating obstacles, often of considerable extent such as mountain passes or extensive areas of impossible vegetation.

They did this to give a smile &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metronieuws.nl/binnenland/rotterdam/2015/09/iedereen-is-blij-met-olli-in-de-hal-van-het-sophia|title=Iedereen is blij met Olli|publisher=Metro|language=Dutch|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the little patients and parents in the hospital. This original big Olli is there to stay.

==Books==
The first two Ollimania books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.limburger.nl/article/20141029/REGIONIEUWS01/141029247|title=Olli en het poepkanon|language=Dutch|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were launched in October 2014. 'Olli en het poepkanon' and 'Olli is een olifant'. Both books made it into the top 10 of best sold children books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alletop10lijstjes.nl/top-10-liefste-babyboeken/

==Design==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] from design company John Doe designed Olli from the basic shape of a [[soccer ball]]. They believe the basic shape, size and character was part of Olli's success. This made Olli easily recognizable to audiences. Olli is drawn in a minimalist style, requiring only a few lines and one [[primary color]]. Olli was created in three sizes, one small size 4.7 in. one medium, size 11 in. and one big size 7.2&amp;nbsp;ft.

==Big Olli==
There are two big Olli's. They are the elder version of small Olli. The Big Olli's is a special creature model made for several charities. One is a permanent hard [[plastic]] [[polyester]] [[statue]] at the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children's Hospital]] and another one has a temporarily place at the [[Rotterdam Zoo]]. The big Olli that is used in the short film to save the Rotterdam ZOO is stored at a secret location according to the creators.

==Fictional character biography==
Olli is toy elephant grown to the size of a real elephant. Olli is a lovable character with furry friends living in a [[Japan]]ese [[fantasy]] world. Later in 2013 there was a story added that he was also the favorite toy of Famous Soccer player [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]. Together they are the main cast of a short film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fr12.nl/dump/9360-olli--amp--giovanni-van-bronckhorst.html
|title=Olli &amp; Giovanni van Bronckhorst|publisher=FR12|language=Dutch|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rotterdam, [[Netherlands]] of 1980, Giovanni van Bronckhorst is a little boy (played in the short film by the son of Giovanni van Bronckhorst). One day, he discovers a stuffed Elephant at the Rotterdam [[Zoo]] and immediately grows attached to it. The name of the elephant is Olli. Giovanni takes him everywhere he goes, especially when he plays soccer. One day during a soccer game, he loses Olli in the canal of Rotterdam. 28 years later in 2013, Giovanni became a Famous Soccer Player and trainer of soccer club [[Feyenoord]] and Olli, also grew big, reunite again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://christianneblogs.com/2013/03/21/olli-een-aaibare-briljante-reclame
|title=Aaibare briljante reclame|publisher=Christianne Blogs|language=Dutch|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] have a history in creating things that help people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fabmagazine.nl/2014/03/wereldheerschappij-voor-rotterdamse-olli|title=Wereldheerschappij voor Rotterdamse Olli|publisher=FAB|language=Dutch|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give something back to society and convince big brands to do so too. Olli was a few times part of a strategy they developed in 2004 and created Olli as a separate brand to generate [[awareness]] and in one campaign to generate more traffic and money for a [[ZOO]] in [[Rotterdam]].

== copyright infringement ==
In 2015 John Doe BV/Ollimania started a lawsuit against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] insurance company [[ASR Nederland]] for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=John Doe BV Olli|publisher=IE Forum |date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch [[Insurance]] company used illegally images and foto’s from Ollimania to sell insurances to their customers. The Dutch court ruled in favor of John Doe BV/ Ollimania and urged ASR Nederland to stop their [[copyright infringement]].
[[ASR Nederland]] had a license for a year on one of the Olli toys that expired in August 2014. The insurance company also kept 30.000 toys that were meant for the Rotterdam zoo to earn [[money]] to keep the [[ZOO]] open. [[ASR Nederland]] was entitled to keep the toys and distribute them however they see fit as long they would not infringe the copyrights of John Doe BV and Olli again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=ASR en Olli|publisher=Reclameboek|date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASR Nederland is the biggest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.slimmeropweg.nl/het-nieuwe-werken-stappenplan/gerelateerd-nieuws/item/asr-het-nieuwe-generatie-werken|title=Het nieuwe werken|publisher=Slimmer op weg|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; insurance company of the Netherlands with almost 3000 [[employees]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6557">In [[philosophical]] [[ontology]], '''ontic''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὄν}}, genitive {{lang|grc|ὄντος}}: "of that which is") is physical, real, or factual existence.&lt;br&gt;

==Overview==
"Ontic" describes what is there, as opposed to the nature or properties of that being. To illustrate:

*[[Roger Bacon]], observing that all languages are built upon a common grammar, stated that they share a foundation of ontically anchored linguistic structures.
*[[Martin Heidegger]] posited the concept of ''Sorge'', or caring, as the fundamental concept of the [[intentionality|intentional being]], and presupposed an ontological significance that distinguishes [[ontology|ontological]] being from mere "thinghood" of an ontic being. He uses the [[German language|German]] word "[[Dasein]]" for a being that is capable of ontology, that is, [[recursivity|recursively]] comprehending [[property (philosophy)|properties]] of the very fact of its own Being. For Heidegger, "ontical" signifies concrete, specific realities, whereas "ontological" signifies deeper underlying structures of reality. Ontological objects or subjects have an ontical dimension, but they also include aspects of being like self-awareness, evolutionary vestiges, future potentialities, and networks of relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontico-Ontological Distinction|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679516_ss1-33|publisher=Blackwell Reference|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Michael|title=The Ontological and the Ontic|url=http://mikejohnduff.blogspot.com/2007/08/ontological.html|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nicolai Hartmann]] distinguishes among ontology, ontics, and metaphysics: (i) ontology concerns the categorical analysis of entities by means of the knowledge categories able to classify them, (ii) ontics refers to a pre-categorical and pre-objectual connection which is best expressed in the relation to transcendent acts, and (iii) metaphysics is that part of ontics or that part of ontology which concerns the residue of being that cannot be rationalized further according to categories.

== Philosophy of science ==
[[Harald Atmanspacher]] writes extensively about the philosophy of science, especially as it relates to [[Chaos theory]], [[determinism]], [[Causality|causation]], and [[stochastic process|stochasticity]]. He explains that "''ontic'' states describe all properties of a physical system exhaustively. ('Exhaustive' in this context means that an ''ontic'' state is 'precisely the way it is,' without any reference to [[epistemic]] knowledge or ignorance.)"{{ref|autonumber}}

In an earlier paper, Atmanspacher portrays the difference between an [[epistemic]] perspective of a [[system]], and an ontic perspective:

:Philosophical [[discourse]] traditionally distinguishes between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] and generally enforces this distinction by keeping the two subject areas separated. However, the relationship between the two areas is of central importance to [[physics]] and [[philosophy of physics]]. For instance, many [[measurement]]-related problems force us to consider both our [[knowledge]] of the [[Classical mechanics|states]] and [[observables]] of a [[system]] ([[epistemic perspective]]) and its states and observables, independent of such knowledge (ontic perspective). This applies to [[quantum|quantum systems]] in particular.{{ref|autonumber}}

== Critical realism ==
{{noref-section|date=August 2018}}
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] [[Roy Bhaskar]], who is closely associated with the philosophical [[Cultural movement|movement]] of [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] writes:
:"I differentiate the 'ontic' ('ontical' etc.) from the 'ontological'. I employ the former to refer to

:# whatever pertains to being generally, rather than some distinctively philosophical (or scientific) theory of it (ontology), so that in this sense, that of the '''ontic&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', we can speak of the ontic presuppositions of a work of art, a [[joke]] or a strike as much as a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]]; and, within this [[rubric]], to
:# the [[intransitive]] [[object (philosophy)|object]]s of some specific, [[historically determinate]], [[scientific investigation]] (or set of such investigations), the '''ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

:"The ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is always specified, and only identified, by its relation, as the intransitive object(s) of some or other (denumerable set of) particular transitive process(es) of enquiry. It is cognitive process-, and level-specific; whereas the ontological (like the ontic&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not."{{ref|autonumber}}

[[Ruth Groff]] offers this expansion of Bhaskar's note above:
:"'ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;' is an abstract way of denoting the [[object-domain]] of a particular [[scientific]] area, field, or inquiry. E.g.: [[molecules]] feature in the ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of chemistry. He's just saying that the scientific undertaking ITSELF is not one of the objects of said, most narrowly construed, immediate object-domain. So [[chemistry]] itself is not part of the ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of chemistry."

'''Patter''' is a prepared and practiced [[Speech communication|speech]] that is designed to produce a desired response from its audience. Examples of occupations with a patter might include the [[auctioneer]], [[salesperson]], [[dance caller]], [[magician (illusionist)|magician]], or [[comedian]].

The term may have been a colloquial shortening of "[[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]", and may have referred to the practice of mouthing or mumbling [[prayers]] quickly and mechanically.

From this, it became a slang word for the secret and equally incomprehensible mutterings of a [[cant language]] used by beggars, thieves, gypsies, etc., and then the fluent plausible talk that a [[cheap-jack]] employs to pass off his goods. Many [[illusionist]]s, e.g., [[card magic]]ians, use patter both to enhance the show and to distract the attention of the spectators.

It is thus also used of any rapid manner of talking, and of a [[patter-song]], in which a very large number of words have to be sung at high speed to fit the music. A western square dance [[Caller (dancing)#The modern Western square dance caller|caller]] may interpolate patter—in the form of metrical lines, often of nonsense—to fill in between commands to the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 Square Dance Patter Sayings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102112218/http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 |date=2013-01-02 }} Vic &amp; Debbie Ceder's Square Dance Resource Net.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some circumstances, the talk becomes a different sense of "patter": to make a series of rapid strokes or pats, as of raindrops. Here it a form of [[onomatopoeia]].

In certain forms of entertainment, [[peep show]]s (in the historical meaning) and Russian ''[[rayok]]'', patter is an important component of a show.  The [[radio DJ]] patter is among the roots of [[rapping]].

In [[hypnotherapy]], the hypnotist uses a 'patter' or script to deliver positive suggestions for change to the client.

In ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'', [[Henry Mayhew]] divides the street-sellers of his time into two groups: the ''patterers'', and everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/05/grafter200605?currentPage=all "The Gentleman Grafter"] by Howard Kaplan, May 2006.

'''Paul Morris Fitts Jr.''' (May 6, 1912 – May 2, 1965) was a [[psychologist]] at the [[Ohio State University]] (later at the [[University of Michigan]]). He developed a model of human movement, [[Fitts's law]], based on rapid, aimed movement, which went on to become one of the most highly successful and well studied [[mathematical model]]s of human motion. By focusing his attention on [[human factors]] during his time as [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[US Air Force]], Fitts became known as one of the pioneers in improving [[aviation safety]]. There are also indications Fitts worked in some capacity as a consultant concerning the interview of alleged UFO witnesses, and was planning work on how terrestrial or psychological explanations could account for UFO sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=MAXW-PBB2-6|title=Project Blue Book Archive|website=www.bluebookarchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1965 he died unexpectedly at the age of 52.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=KfLhAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=Paul+Fitts+1965&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii-qqTjvDWAhUJ0GMKHWeqC704ChDoAQglMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Paul%20Fitts%201965&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was President of Division 21 (Division of Applied Experimental and [[Engineering psychology]]) of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), in 1957-1958. The association now has a Paul Fitts honorary award. From 1962-63 Paul M. Fitts was president of the [[Human Factors and Ergonomics Society]].

== Education ==

He received degrees in psychology at the following universities:

* [[University of Tennessee]] (BS 1934)
* [[Brown University]] (MS 1936)
* [[University of Rochester]] (PhD 1938)

'''Pauly &amp; C. – Compagnia Venezia Murano''' is a [[Venice|Venetian]] company that produces [[glass art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts | first = Philippe | last = Garner | publisher = Galahad Books | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-88365-641-8 | page = 231}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably Roman murrine, [[mosaic]]s and [[chandelier]]s.

The company was formed in 1919 by a merger of Pauly &amp; C (founded 1902) and the Compagnia di Venezia e Murano (founded 1866). It has since expanded in 1932 with the acquisition of MVM Cappellin and in 1990 by the addition of the drawings and back catalogues of Toso Vetri d’Arte. The company maintains retail showrooms as well as exhibiting antiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Venetian Glass: The Nancy Olnick and Giorgio Spanu Collection | first = David Revere | last = McFadden |author2=Susan Sacks |author3=Marino Barovier |author4=Susanne K.

==History==

===Compagnia di Venezia e Murano===
Compagnia di Venezia e Murano began as [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati &amp;C.]] in London in 1866 under the direction of Vicenza attorney [[Antonio Salviati]] and with the backing of two British men: archaeologist [[Austen Henry Layard]] and antiquarian Sir William Drake. The company was dedicated to using ancient techniques and utilized master glassblowers in its efforts to do so. It called in specialists from other fields like [[goldsmith]]ing and [[engraver|engraving]] to ensure authenticity and employed artist [[Giuseppe Devers]] to teach the techniques of enamelling and heat-applied glass gilding to company artisans. Archaeologist Layard was particularly interested in the mosaic glass techniques of Roman and pre-Roman artists, and he spent years personally overseeing the work of the company's technicians and glassblowers in attempting to revive those techniques.

The company was renamed Venice and Murano Glass and Mosaic Company Limited in 1872, and, in 1877, Layard purchased Salviati's interest so that Salviati could pursue other interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Art &amp; design in Europe and America, 1800-1900 | first = Simon | last = Jervis |author2=Albert Museum | publisher = E.P.

The last specimen, a portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln]], was produced and donated in 1866.

Through the last years of the 19th century, Compagnia di Venezia e Murano took part in many other displays. Prior to the 1878 exhibition in Paris, it had shown at the [[Maritime Exhibition]] in Naples and the Trieste Exhibition in 1871 and at the International Exhibition in Vienna in 1873, where it won 13 prizes for decorative arts. It unveiled a new focus in 1881 with the display of the first of its glass phoenixes at the National Exhibition in Milan. It exported several thousand works for display at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893, also setting up a [[kiln]] so that the public could observe the company's glass blowing techniques. In 1895, it exhibited at the first [[Venice Biennale]] (an event at which it would also feature later), with artisan Vincenzo Moretti taking prizes and artisan Attilio Spaccarelli earning special note for his engraving.

1900 saw a change in the company when its British owners sold their interest to a businessman from Venice named Tosolini, who was the owner of shops in St. Mark's Square. Under Tosoloni's ownership, the company stopped production in 1909, though it continued commercial distribution at St. Mark's Square.

===Merger with Pauly &amp; C===
[[File:Ponte dei consorzi.JPG|thumb|upright|Ponte dei Consorzi, front entry of Palazzo Cappello Trevisan in Venice.]]
Pauly &amp; C was formed in 1903 by Emilio Pauly, Alessandro Hirscber Hellman, Vittorio Emanuele Toldo and Ernesto Graziadei, opening showrooms in [[Palazzo Trevisan Cappello]], which would remain the headquarters of the company until its closure in 2007 for restoration. In 1919, Pauly &amp; C. and Compagnia di Venezia e Murano were both purchased by the Milan Società Anonima Sanitaria, which resold them the following year to Gaetano Ceschina of [[Milan]]. The newly merged company, retitled to its present name, continued display in its previous locations of St. Mark's Square and the Palazzo Trevisan Cappello. In 1925, the merged company resumed production of glassworks on Murano and began exhibiting again at the Monza Tirennale.

===Post-merger growth and development===
The company grew in 1933 with the acquisition of Maestri Vetrai Muranesi Cappellin, or MVM Cappellin, a glass company formed in 1925 by Paolo [[Venini]] and Giacomo Cappellin, which transferred to them rights to the works and designs of the MVM Cappellin artists such as [[Vittorio Zecchin]] and [[Carlo Scarpa]]. The company expanded into commissioned chandeliers, with notable pieces from the period being placed in such locations as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] in Rome; the [[Vatican Palace]], and the [[Amalienborg Palace|Royal Palace in Copenhagen]]. More recently, interior lighting has been designed for such places as the Palazzo Bezzi in [[Ravenna]] and the Al Assawi family palace. In 1990, the company again expanded with the acquisition of [[Toso Vetri d’Arte]] glassworks.

===Transition===
Ceschina sold his interest in the company in 1963 to the Barbon family, who retained it until 1976, when they sold to Andrea Boscaro. Boscaro owned the company for almost 30 years before 2005.

==Artistic associations==
The company has a long history of association with international artisans. In the period following [[World War II|the second World War]], the company undertook long-term associations with master glassblowers [[Anzolo Fuga]] and [[Alfredo Barbini]], engraver [[Francesco Andolfato]] and painter [[Enzo Scarpa]]. Shorter associations include sculptor [[Napoleone Martinuzzi]] in the 1960s, painter [[Libero Vitali]] in 1971, architect [[Franz Prati]] between 1996 and 1997, and fashion designer [[Romeo Gigli]] in 1997. In the later 1990s, the company also featured exclusive designs by [[Heinz Oestergaard]], [[Maria Teresa Lorella Gnutti]] and [[Berit Johansson]], whose association with the company persisted. Since the turn of the century, associations have included Venetian sculptor [[Livio de Marchi]] and Chinese artist [[Xiao Fan Ru]].

==Museum display==
Glass art produced by Pauly &amp; C. – Compagnia Venezia Murano is on display in a number of museums. Among them:

*The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]], UK
*The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]], USA

'''Philip Weller''' (born 1956) is a Canadian environmental scientist.

==Biography==
Philip Weller studied environmental science at the [[University of Waterloo]] in Canada and received a Master of Urban and Regional Planning degree from the same university with a focus on rehabilitation and clean-up of environmental hot spots within the Great Lakes of North America.&lt;ref name=danubewatch&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait of Philip Weller and biography in Danube Watch Magazine|url=http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr/static/dw2003_2/dw0203p04.htm|accessdate=9 February 2011|date=February 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later he served for four years as director of Great Lakes United dealing with environmental measures in the [[Great Lakes]] area and as a program director of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] International (Danube Carpathian Programme) in Austria. As a consultant, he managed projects in both Canada and Austria and completed assignments for governments and international organisations.

Since 2013, he is project manager for the International Association of Water Supply Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area (IAWD).

In February 2000, EU Commissioner for the Environment [[Margot Wallström]] appointed him as a member of the [[Baia Mare]] Task Force. In 2003, he became executive secretary of the ICPDR at its headquarters in Vienna. Philip Weller is author of three books on environmental topics, including ‘Freshwater Seas’, an environmental history of the Great Lakes of North America. He is married to an Austrian and is father of two sons.&lt;ref name=official-bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Official biography published by the ICPDR in 2003|url=http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr-files/9392|accessdate=9 February 2011|date=February 20, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726170953/http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr-files/9392|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gati or existences.jpg|right|thumb|In [[Jainism]], a [[soul]] travels to any one of the four states of existence after death depending on its [[karma]]s.]]

'''Reincarnation''' is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]]  or [[Religion|religious]] concept that an aspect of a living [[being]] starts a new [[life]] in a different [[physical body]] or form after each biological [[death]]. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the [[Saṃsāra]] doctrine of cyclic existence.{{Sfn|Norman C. McClelland|2010|pp=24–29, 171}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}} It is a central tenet of all major [[Indian religions]], namely [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sikhism]].{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}}{{sfn|Stephen J.

McClelland|2010|pp=102–103}} and a belief in rebirth/[[metempsychosis]] was held by Greek historic figures, such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Socrates]], and [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;see Charles Taliaferro, Paul Draper, Philip L. Quinn, ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''. John Wiley and Sons, 2010, page 640, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&amp;pg=PA640&amp;dq=reincarnation+and+rebirth&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=reincarnation%20and%20rebirth&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as [[Spiritism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and [[Eckankar]], and as an esoteric belief in many streams of [[Orthodox Judaism]]. It is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as [[Australia]], [[East Asia]], [[Siberia]], and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;Gananath Obeyesekere, ''Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth''. University of California Press, 2002, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of denominations within [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of [[Catharism|Cathars]], [[Alawites]], the [[Druze]],&lt;ref&gt;Hitti, Philip K (2007) [1924].

Oceanside, California. 4th edition. {{ISBN|0-911274-84-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of [[Neoplatonism]], [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Manicheanism]], and [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Roman era]] as well as the Indian religions have been the subject of recent scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;An important recent work discussing the mutual influence of ancient Greek and Indian philosophy regarding these matters is ''The Shape of Ancient Thought'' by [[Thomas McEvilley]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unity Church]] and its founder [[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles Fillmore]] teaches reincarnation.

In recent decades, many [[Europeans]] and [[North Americans]] have developed an interest in reincarnation,&lt;ref name="hi.is"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hi.is/~erlendur/english/Nordic_Psychology_erlhar06.pdf |title=Popular psychology, belief in life after death and reincarnation in the Nordic countries, Western and Eastern Europe }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(54.8&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reincarnation in popular culture|many contemporary works]] mention it.

==Conceptual definitions==
The word "reincarnation" derives from [[Latin]], literally meaning, "entering the flesh again". The Greek equivalent ''[[metempsychosis]]'' (μετεμψύχωσις) derives from ''meta'' (change) and ''empsykhoun'' (to put a soul into),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=metempsychosis metempsychosis], Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; a term attributed to [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Huffman (2014), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/ Pythagoras, 4.1 The Fate of the Soul—Metempsychosis] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate term is transmigration implying migration from one life (body) to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transmigration|author=Oxford Dictionaries|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/transmigrate|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reincarnation refers to the belief that an aspect of every human being (or all living beings in some cultures) continues to exist after death, this aspect may be the soul or mind or consciousness or something transcendent which is reborn in an interconnected cycle of existence; the transmigration belief varies by culture, and is envisioned to be in the form of a newly born human being, or animal, or plant, or spirit, or as a being in some other non-human realm of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/reincarnation |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Keown|2013|pp=35–40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Key Chapple|title=Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C |year=2006|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2045-6 |pages=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used by modern philosophers such as [[Kurt Gödel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karl Sigmund |url=http://www.goedelexhibition.at/goedel/goedel.html |title=Gödel Exhibition: Gödel's Century |publisher=Goedelexhibition.at |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has entered the English language. Another Greek term sometimes used synonymously is ''[[palingenesis]]'', "being born again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hinduism.iskcon.com/concepts/102.htm |title=Heart of Hinduism: Reincarnation and Samsara |publisher=Hinduism.iskcon.com |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419232238/http://hinduism.iskcon.com/concepts/102.htm |archivedate=2011-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebirth is a key concept found in major Indian religions, and discussed with various terms. ''Punarjanman'' (Sanskrit: पुनर्जन्मन्) means "rebirth, transmigration".&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams582"&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Wesley Neufeldt|title=Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaRWtgXjplQC&amp;pg=PA106|year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-87395-990-2|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reincarnation is discussed in the ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, with many alternate terms such as ''punarāvṛtti'' (पुनरावृत्ति), ''punarājāti'' (पुनराजाति), ''punarjīvātu'' (पुनर्जीवातु), ''punarbhava'' (पुनर्भव), ''āgati-gati'' (आगति-गति, common in Buddhist Pali text), ''nibbattin'' (निब्बत्तिन्), ''upapatti'' (उपपत्ति), and ''uppajjana'' (उप्पज्जन).&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams582"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7 |pages=95, 144, 151, 361, 475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These religions believe that this reincarnation is cyclic and an endless [[Saṃsāra]], unless one gains spiritual insights that ends this cycle leading to liberation.{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}}{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90–99}} The reincarnation concept is considered in Indian religions as a step that starts each "cycle of aimless drifting, wandering or mundane existence",{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}} but one that is an opportunity to seek spiritual liberation through ethical living and a variety of meditative, yogic (''marga''), or other spiritual practices.{{Sfn|John Bowker|2014|pp=84–85}}&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (2010), Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Volume II, Brill, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17893-9}}, pages 881–884&lt;/ref&gt; They consider the release from the cycle of reincarnations as the ultimate spiritual goal, and call the liberation by terms such as [[moksha]], [[nirvana]], ''mukti'' and ''kaivalya''.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pages 61–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman E.

Série in-8°, Fasc. 61, Édition-Diffusion de Boccard (Paris), {{ISBN|978-2868030610}}, pages 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Buddhist, Hindu and Jain traditions have differed, since ancient times, in their assumptions and in their details on what reincarnates, how reincarnation occurs and what leads to liberation.{{Sfn|Obeyesekere|2005|p=1-2, 108, 126–128}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=272–273}}

''Gilgul'', ''Gilgul neshamot'' or ''Gilgulei Ha Neshamot'' ([[Hebrew language|Heb.]] גלגול הנשמות) is the concept of reincarnation in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] [[Judaism]], found in much [[Yiddish literature]] among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. ''Gilgul'' means "cycle" and ''neshamot'' is "souls". Kabbalistic reincarnation says that humans reincarnate only to humans and to the same sex only: men to men, women to women.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==History==

===Origins===

The origins of the notion of reincarnation are obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Theosophical Society in America|title=Reincarnation: The Hope of the World|page=15|author=Irving Steiger Cooper|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of the subject appears in the philosophical traditions of India. The Greek [[Pre-Socratics]] discussed reincarnation, and the Celtic [[Druids]] are also reported to have taught a doctrine of reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] thought the Druids might have been influenced by the teachings of [[Pythagoras]]. Diodorus Siculus v.28.6; Hippolytus ''Philosophumena'' i.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas associated with reincarnation may have arisen independently in different regions, or they might have spread as a result of cultural contact. Proponents of cultural transmission have looked for links between Iron Age Celtic, Greek and Vedic philosophy and religion,&lt;ref&gt;one modern scholar has speculated that Buddhist missionaries had been sent to Britain by the Indian king [[Ashoka]]. Donald A.Mackenzie, ''Buddhism in pre-Christian Britain'' (1928:21).&lt;/ref&gt; some{{who|date=October 2010}} even suggesting that belief in reincarnation was present in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].{{dubious|date=October 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;M. Dillon and N. Chadwick, ''The Celtic Realms'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London, {{Page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient European, Iranian and Indian agricultural cultures, the life cycles of birth, death, and rebirth were recognized as a replica of natural [[agricultural cycle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ara, Mitra (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ12k9delf4C Eschatology in the Indo-Iranian traditions: The Genesis and Transformation of a Doctrine]''. Peter Lang Publishing Inc., New York, USA. {{ISBN|1-4331-0250-1}}. pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism===

The idea of reincarnation has early roots in the [[Vedic period]] (c. 1500 – c. 500 BCE), predating the [[Buddha]] and the [[Mahavira]].&lt;ref name=damienkeown32&gt;{{cite book|author=Damien Keown |title=Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QXX0Uq29aoC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966383-5 |pages=28, 32–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of the cycle of birth and death, [[samsara]], and liberation partly derive from ascetic traditions that arose in India around the middle of the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. Olivelle, Patrick. 2003. ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism.'' Malden: Blackwell. pg. 273-4. "The second half of the first millennium BCE was the period that created many of the ideological and institutional elements that characterize later Indian religions. The renouncer tradition played a central role during this formative period of Indian religious history....Some of the fundamental values and beliefs that we generally associate with Indian religions in general and Hinduism in particular were in part the creation of the renouncer tradition.

In early Buddhist traditions, ''Saṃsāra'' cosmology consisted of five realms through which the wheel of existence cycled.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt; This included hells (''[[niraya]]''), [[hungry ghosts]] (''[[pretas]]''), animals (''tiryak''), humans (''[[manushya]]''), and gods (''[[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s'', heavenly).&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert DeCaroli |title=Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_2XtkSRyTYC|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-803765-1|pages=94–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In latter Buddhist traditions, this list grew to a list of six realms of rebirth, adding demi-gods (''[[asuras]]'').&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Akira Sadakata|title=Buddhist Cosmology: Philosophy and Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1997|publisher= Kōsei Publishing 佼成出版社, Tokyo|isbn=978-4-333-01682-2|pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rationale====
The earliest layers of Vedic text incorporate the concept of life, followed by an [[afterlife]] in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[James Hastings]]|author2=John Alexander Selbie|author3=[[Louis Herbert Gray]]|series=[[Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics]]|title=Volume 12: Suffering-Zwingli|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.500005|year=1922|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|pages=616–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ancient Vedic [[Rishi]]s challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and the texts assert that it would be unfair for people, with varying degrees of virtue or vices, to end up in heaven or hell, in "either or" and disproportionate manner irrespective of how virtuous or vicious their lives were.{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84–86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kusum P.

Early Greek discussion of the concept likewise dates to the 6th century BCE. An early Greek thinker known to have considered rebirth is [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (fl. 540 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Schibli, S., Hermann, Pherekydes of Syros, p. 104, Oxford Univ. Press 2001&lt;/ref&gt; His younger contemporary Pythagoras (c. 570–c. 495 BCE&lt;ref&gt;"The dates of his life cannot be fixed exactly, but assuming the approximate correctness of the statement of Aristoxenus (ap. Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BCE, or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty." [[William Keith Chambers Guthrie]], (1978), ''A history of Greek philosophy, Volume 1: The earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans'', page 173. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;), its first famous exponent, instituted societies for its diffusion. [[Plato]] (428/427–348/347 BCE) presented accounts of reincarnation in his works, particularly the ''[[Myth of Er]]''.

Authorities have not agreed on how the notion arose in Greece: sometimes Pythagoras is said to have been Pherecydes' pupil, sometimes to have introduced it with the doctrine of [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], a [[Thrace|Thracian]] religion that was to be important in the diffusion of reincarnation, or else to have brought the teaching from India. In  ''[[Phaedo]]'', Plato makes his teacher [[Socrates]], prior to his death, state: "I am confident that there truly is such a thing as living again, and that the living spring from the dead." However [[Xenophon]] does not mention Socrates as believing in reincarnation and Plato may have systematised Socrates' thought with concepts he took directly from Pythagoreanism or Orphism.

The wheel of birth revolves, the soul alternates between freedom and captivity round the wide circle of necessity. Orpheus proclaimed the need of the grace of the gods, [[Dionysus]] in particular, and of self-purification until the soul has completed the spiral ascent of destiny to live for ever.

An association between [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean philosophy]] and reincarnation was routinely accepted throughout antiquity. In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' Plato makes Socrates tell how Er, the son of Armenius, miraculously returned to life on the twelfth day after death and recounted the secrets of the other world. There are myths and theories to the same effect in other dialogues, in the [[Chariot allegory]] of the [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]], in the [[Meno]], [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] and [[Laws]]. The soul, once separated from the body, spends an indeterminate amount of time in "formland" (see The [[Allegory of the Cave]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'') and then assumes another body.

In later Greek literature the doctrine is mentioned in a fragment of [[Menander]]&lt;ref&gt;Menander, ''The Inspired Woman''&lt;/ref&gt; and satirized by [[Lucian]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Gallus'', 18 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] literature it is found as early as [[Ennius]],&lt;ref&gt;Poesch, Jessie (1962) "Ennius and Basinio of Parma" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' 25(1/2): pp. 116—118, page 117, FN15&lt;/ref&gt; who, in a lost passage of his ''Annals'', told how he had seen [[Homer]] in a dream, who had assured him that the same soul which had animated both the poets had once belonged to a peacock. [[Persius]] in his satires (vi. 9) laughs at this, it is referred to also by [[Lucretius]]&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, (i. 124)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Horace]].&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Epistles'', II. i. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virgil]] works the idea into his account of the Underworld in the sixth book of the [[Aeneid]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''The Aeneid'', vv. 724 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; It persists down to the late classic thinkers, [[Plotinus]] and the other [[Neoplatonist]]s. In the [[Hermetica]], a Graeco-Egyptian series of writings on cosmology and spirituality attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]]/[[Thoth]], the doctrine of reincarnation is central.

In [[Hellenistic philosophy|Greco-Roman thought]], the concept of metempsychosis disappeared with the rise of [[Early Christianity]], reincarnation being incompatible with the Christian core doctrine of [[salvation]] of the faithful after death. It has been suggested that some of the early Church Fathers, especially [[Origen]], still entertained a belief in the possibility of reincarnation, but evidence is tenuous, and the writings of Origen as they have come down to us speak explicitly against it.&lt;ref&gt;The book ''Reincarnation in Christianity'', by the [[theosophist]] Geddes MacGregor (1978) asserted that Origen believed in reincarnation.  MacGregor is convinced that Origen believed in and taught about reincarnation but that his texts written about the subject have been destroyed. He admits that there is no extant proof for that position. The allegation was also repeated by [[Shirley MacLaine]] in her book ''Out On a Limb''.
Origen does discuss  the concept of transmigration (''metensomatosis'') from Greek philosophy, but it is repeatedly stated that this concept is not a part of the Christian teaching or scripture in his Comment on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (which survives only in a 6th-century Latin translatio): "In this place [when Jesus said Elijah was come and referred to John the Baptist] it does not appear to me that by Elijah the soul is spoken of, lest I fall into the doctrine of [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]], which is foreign to the Church of God, and not handed down by the apostles, nor anywhere set forth in the scriptures" (13:1:46–53, see [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IX/Origen on Matthew/Origen's Commentary on Matthew/Book XIII|Commentary on Matthew, Book XIII]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early Christian [[Gnostic]] sects professed reincarnation. The [[Sethians]] and followers of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] believed in it.&lt;ref&gt;Much of this is documented in R.E. Slater's book ''Paradise Reconsidered.''&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of [[Bardaisan]] of [[Mesopotamia]], a sect of the 2nd century deemed heretical by the Catholic Church, drew upon [[Babylon|Chaldean]] [[astrology]], to which Bardaisan's son Harmonius, educated in Athens, added Greek ideas including a sort of metempsychosis. Another such teacher was [[Basilides]] (132–? CE/AD), known to us through the criticisms of [[Irenaeus]] and the work of [[Clement of Alexandria]] (see also [[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]] and [[Buddhism and Gnosticism]]).

In the third Christian century [[Manichaeism]] spread both east and west from [[Babylonia]], then within the [[Sassanid Empire]], where its founder [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] lived about 216–276. Manichaean monasteries existed in Rome in 312 AD. Noting Mani's early travels to the [[Kushan Empire]] and other Buddhist influences in Manichaeism, [[Richard Foltz]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; attributes Mani's teaching of reincarnation to Buddhist influence. However the inter-relation of Manicheanism, Orphism, Gnosticism and neo-Platonism is far from clear.

===Celtic paganism===
In the 1st century BCE [[Alexander Cornelius Polyhistor]] wrote:

{{bquote|The Pythagorean doctrine prevails among the Gauls' teaching that the souls of men are immortal, and that after a fixed number of years they will enter into another body.}}

[[Julius Caesar]] recorded that the [[druids]] of Gaul, Britain and Ireland had metempsychosis as one of their core doctrines:&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, "De Bello Gallico", VI&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|The principal point of their doctrine is that the soul does not die and that after death it passes from one body into another... the main object of all education is, in their opinion, to imbue their scholars with a firm belief in the indestructibility of the human soul, which, according to their belief, merely passes at death from one tenement to another; for by such doctrine alone, they say, which robs death of all its terrors, can the highest form of human courage be developed.}}

===Germanic paganism===
{{Main|Rebirth in Germanic paganism}}
[[Image:Ed0027.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sváfa]] holding the dying [[Helgi Hjörvarðsson|Helgi]] in their first incarnation of three, as depicted in an illustration published in 1893]]
Surviving North Germanic texts make several references to beliefs in reincarnation. The ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'' states that belief in reincarnation was once widespread, but was at the time of the composition restricted to folk belief. In addition, scholars have identified a variety of references to reincarnation among the Germanic peoples outside the North Germanic sphere.

===Judaism===
The belief in reincarnation had first existed amongst Jewish mystics in the Ancient World, among whom differing explanations were given of the after-life, although with a universal belief in an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs &amp; Rituals'', By George Robinson, Simon and Schuster 2008, page 193&lt;/ref&gt; Today, reincarnation is an [[esoteric]] belief within many streams of modern Judaism.  Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism), teaches a belief in [[gilgul]], transmigration of souls, and hence the belief in reincarnation is universal in [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative, and is also held as an esoteric belief within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]. In [[Judaism]], the [[Zohar]], first published in the 13th century, discusses reincarnation at length, especially in the [[Torah]] portion "Balak." The most comprehensive [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] work on reincarnation, ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Mind in the Balance: Meditation in Science, Buddhism, and Christianity", p. 104, by  B. Alan Wallace&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Between Worlds: Dybbuks, Exorcists, and Early Modern Judaism", p. 190, by J. H. Chajes&lt;/ref&gt; was written by [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Chaim Vital]], based on the teachings of his mentor, the 16th century kabbalist [[Isaac Luria]], who was said to know the past lives of each person through his [[Ruach HaKodesh|semi-prophetic]] abilities. The 18th century Lithuanian master scholar and kabbalist, Rabbi Elijah, known as the [[Vilna Gaon]] (Elijah of Vilna), authored a commentary on the biblical [[Book of Jonah]] as an allegory of reincarnation.

The practice of conversion to Judaism is sometimes understood within Orthodox Judaism in terms of reincarnation. According to this school of thought in Judaism, when non-Jews are drawn to Judaism, it is because they had been Jews in a former life. Such souls may "wander among nations" through multiple lives, until they find their way back to Judaism, including through finding themselves born in a gentile family with a "lost" Jewish ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Tales of Reincarnation', By Yonasson Gershom, Yonasson Gershom, Jason Aronson, Incorporated, 31 Jan 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an extensive literature of Jewish folk and traditional stories that refer to reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Yonasson Gershom (1999), ''Jewish Tales of Reincarnation''. Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson. {{ISBN|0765760835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
[[Taoist]] documents from as early as the [[Han Dynasty]] claimed that [[Lao Tzu]] appeared on earth as different persons in different times beginning in the legendary era of [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]]. The (ca. 3rd century BC) ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Chuang Tzu]]'' states: "Birth is not a beginning; death is not an end. There is existence without limitation; there is continuity without a starting-point. Existence without limitation is Space. Continuity without a starting point is Time. There is birth, there is death, there is issuing forth, there is entering in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vMNI-aFtF4UC&amp;dq|title=Chuang Tzŭ: Mystic, Moralist, and Social Reformer (translated by Herbert Allen Giles)|year= 1889|page= 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Middle Ages===
Around the 11–12th century in Europe, several reincarnationist movements were persecuted as heresies, through the establishment of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] in the Latin west. These included the [[Cathar]], Paterene or Albigensian church of western Europe, the [[Paulician]] movement, which arose in Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11583b.htm |title=Newadvent.org |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-02-01 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bogomils]] in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''The Medieval Manichee: A Study of the Christian Dualist Heresy'', 1982, {{ISBN|0-521-28926-2}}, Cambridge University Press, ''The Bogomils'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=d1LGB7u5iD0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mediaeval+manichee&amp;cd=1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian sects such as the Bogomils and the Cathars, who professed reincarnation and other gnostic beliefs, were referred to as "Manichean", and are today sometimes described by scholars as "Neo-Manichean".&lt;ref&gt;For example Dondaine, Antoine. O.P. ''Un traite neo-manicheen du XIIIe siecle: Le Liber de duobus principiis, suivi d'un fragment de rituel Cathare'' (Rome: Institutum Historicum Fratrum Praedicatorum, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no known Manichaean mythology or terminology in the writings of these groups there has been some dispute among historians as to whether these groups truly were descendants of Manichaeism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01267e.htm |title=Newadvent.org |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Renaissance and Early Modern period===
While reincarnation has been a matter of faith in some communities from an early date it has also frequently been argued for on principle, as Plato does when he argues that the number of souls must be finite because souls are indestructible,&lt;ref&gt;"the souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number." Republic X, 611. The Republic of Plato By Plato, Benjamin Jowett Edition: 3 Published by Clarendon press, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]] held a similar view.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to his friend [[George Whatley]] written May 23, 1785: Jennifer T. Kennedy, Death Effects: Revisiting the conceit of Franklin's ''Memoir'', ''Early American Literature'', 2001. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/25057231 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such convictions, as in Socrates' case, arise from a more general personal faith, at other times from anecdotal evidence such as Plato makes Socrates offer in the ''Myth of Er''.

During the [[Renaissance]] translations of Plato, the [[Hermetica]] and other works fostered new European interest in reincarnation. [[Marsilio Ficino]]&lt;ref&gt;Marsilio Ficino, ''Platonic Theology'', 17.3–4&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Plato's references to reincarnation were intended allegorically, Shakespeare alluded to the doctrine of reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;"Again, Rosalind in "As You Like It" (Act III., Scene 2), says: ''I was never so be-rhimed that I can remember since Pythagoras's time, when I was an Irish rat"'' — alluding to the doctrine of the transmigration of souls." William H. Grattan Flood, quoted at [http://www.libraryireland.com/IrishMusic/XVII-2.php Libraryireland.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Giordano Bruno]] was burned at the stake by authorities after being found guilty of heresy by the [[Roman Inquisition]] for his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Boulting, 1914. pp. 163–64&lt;/ref&gt; But the Greek philosophical works remained available and, particularly in north Europe, were discussed by groups such as the [[Cambridge Platonists]].

===19th to 20th centuries===
{{See also|#Reincarnation research}}

[[Image:Wm james.jpg|upright|thumb|right|American psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] (1842–1910) was an early psychical researcher.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Arthur S. |authorlink= |author2=Berger, Joyce  |title=The Encyclopedia of Parapsychology and Psychical Research |publisher=Paragon House Publishers |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=1-55778-043-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By the 19th century the philosophers [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, A: "Parerga und Paralipomena" (Eduard Grisebach edition), On Religion, Section 177&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche and the Doctrine of Metempsychosis, in J. Urpeth &amp; J. Lippitt, ''Nietzsche and the Divine'',  Manchester: Clinamen, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; could access the Indian scriptures for discussion of the doctrine of reincarnation, which recommended itself to the [[American Transcendentalism|American Transcendentalists]] [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and was adapted by [[Francis Bowen]] into ''Christian Metempsychosis''.&lt;ref name="shirleymaclaine.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shirleymaclaine.com/articles/reincarnation/article-318 |title=Shirleymaclaine.com |publisher=Shirleymaclaine.com |accessdate=2011-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106160539/http://www.shirleymaclaine.com/articles/reincarnation/article-318 |archive-date=2011-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century, interest in reincarnation had been introduced into the nascent discipline of [[psychology]], largely due to the influence of [[William James]], who raised aspects of the [[philosophy of mind]], [[comparative religion]], the psychology of religious experience and the nature of empiricism.&lt;ref&gt;David Hammerman, Lisa Lenard, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Reincarnation'', Penguin, p.34. For relevant works by James, see; William James, ''Human Immortality: Two Supposed Objections to the Doctrine (the Ingersoll Lecture, 1897)'', ''The Will to Believe, Human Immortality'' (1956) Dover Publications, {{ISBN|0-486-20291-7}}, ''The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature'' (1902), {{ISBN|0-14-039034-0}}, ''Essays in Radical Empiricism'' (1912) Dover Publications 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-43094-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was influential in the founding of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] (ASPR) in [[New York City]] in 1885, three years after the British [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) was inaugurated in London,&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt; leading to systematic, critical investigation of paranormal phenomena.

At this time popular awareness of the idea of reincarnation was boosted by the [[Theosophical Society]]'s dissemination of systematised and universalised Indian concepts and also by the influence of magical societies like [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|The Golden Dawn]]. Notable personalities like [[Annie Besant]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Dion Fortune]] made the subject almost as [[Reincarnation in popular culture|familiar an element of the popular culture]] of the west as of the east. By 1924 the subject could be satirised in popular children's books.&lt;ref&gt;Richmal Crompton, ''More William'', George Newnes, London, 1924, XIII. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17125/17125-h/17125-h.htm William and the Ancient Souls]; "The memory usually came in a flash. For instance, you might remember in a flash when you were looking at a box of matches that you had been Guy Fawkes."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Théodore Flournoy]] was among the first to study a claim of past-life recall in the course of his investigation of the medium [[Hélène Smith]], published in 1900, in which he defined the possibility of [[cryptomnesia]] in such accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Flournoy, [http://www.psychanalyse-paris.com/-Des-Indes-a-la-planete-Mars-.html Des Indes à la planète Mars], Étude sur un cas de somnambulisme avec glossolalie, Éditions Alcan et Eggimann, Paris et Genève, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carl Gustav Jung]], like Flournoy based in Switzerland, also emulated him in his thesis based on a study of cryptomnesia in psychism. Later Jung would emphasise the importance of the persistence of memory and ego in psychological study of reincarnation: "This concept of rebirth necessarily implies the continuity of personality... (that) one is able, at least potentially, to remember that one has lived through previous existences, and that these existences were one's own...."&lt;ref name="shirleymaclaine.com"/&gt; [[Hypnosis]], used in [[psychoanalysis]] for retrieving  forgotten memories, was eventually tried as a means of studying the phenomenon of past life recall.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] states:

{{bquote|
Just as in the body childhood, adulthood and old age happen to an embodied being. So also he (the embodied being) acquires another body. The wise one is not deluded about this. – (2:13){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=98}}

As, after casting away worn out garments, a man later takes new ones. So after casting away worn out bodies, the embodied Self encounters other new ones. – (2:22){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=107}}

When an embodied being transcends, these three qualities which are the source of the body. Released from birth, death, old age and pain, he attains immortality. – (14:20){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=582}}
}}

There are internal differences within Hindu traditions on reincarnation and the state of moksha. For example, the dualistic devotional traditions such as [[Madhvacharya]]'s Dvaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a theistic premise, assert that human soul and Brahman are different, loving devotion to Brahman (god Vishnu in Madhvacharya's theology) is the means to release from Samsara, it is the grace of God which leads to moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable only in after-life (''videhamukti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

Within Japanese [[Zen]], reincarnation is accepted by some, but rejected by others. A distinction can be drawn between "folk Zen", as in the Zen practiced by devotional lay people, and "philosophical Zen". Folk Zen generally accepts the various supernatural elements of Buddhism such as rebirth. Philosophical Zen, however, places more emphasis on the present moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McClelland|first=Norman C.|title=Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma|page=281|year=2010|isbn=9780786456758|publisher=McFarland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=warner&gt;{{citation|last=Warner|first=Brad|title=Hardcore Zen|isbn= 9780861719891|publisher=Wisdom Publications|year=2005|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools conclude that [[karma]] continues to exist and adhere to the person until it works out its consequences. For the [[Sautrantika]] school, each act "perfumes" the individual or "plants a seed" that later germinates. Tibetan Buddhism stresses the state of mind at the time of death. To die with a peaceful mind will stimulate a virtuous seed and a fortunate rebirth; a disturbed mind will stimulate a non-virtuous seed and an unfortunate rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Transform Your Life'': A Blissful Journey, page 52), [[Tharpa Publications]] (2001, US ed. 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-9789067-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
{{Further information|Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Seven Jain Hells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|17th-century cloth painting depicting seven levels of [[Naraka (Jainism)|Jain hell]] according to [[Jain cosmology]]. Left panel depicts the demi-god and his animal vehicle presiding over each hell.]]
In [[Jainism]], the reincarnation doctrine, along with its theories of ''Saṃsāra'' and Karma, are central to its theological foundations, as evidenced by the extensive literature on it in the major sects of Jainism, and their pioneering ideas on these topics from the earliest times of the Jaina tradition.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=217–236}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14/&gt; Reincarnation in contemporary Jainism traditions is the belief that the worldly life is characterized by continuous rebirths and suffering in various realms of existence.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=226–228}}&lt;ref name="dundasp14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Sethia |title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karma forms a central and fundamental part of Jain faith, being intricately connected to other of its philosophical concepts like transmigration, reincarnation, liberation, non-violence (''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'') and non-attachment, among others. Actions are seen to have consequences: some immediate, some delayed, even into future incarnations. So the doctrine of karma is not considered simply in relation to one life-time, but also in relation to both future incarnations and past lives.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp. 226–230&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'' 3.3–4 states: "The ''jīva'' or the soul is sometimes born in [[devaloka|the world of gods]], sometimes in [[Naraka (Jainism)|hell]]. Sometimes it acquires the body of a [[asura|demon]]; all this happens on account of its karma. This ''jīva'' sometimes takes birth as a worm, as an insect or as an ant."&lt;ref name=krishan43&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj (1997): p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The text further states (32.7): "Karma is the root of birth and death. The souls bound by karma go round and round in the cycle of existence."&lt;ref name=krishan43 /&gt;

Actions and emotions in the current lifetime affect future incarnations depending on the nature of the particular karma. For example, a good and virtuous life indicates a latent desire to experience good and virtuous themes of life. Therefore, such a person attracts karma that ensures that his future births will allow him to experience and manifest his virtues and good feelings unhindered.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.70–71&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, he may take birth in heaven or in a prosperous and virtuous human family. On the other hand, a person who has indulged in immoral deeds, or with a cruel disposition, indicates a latent desire to experience cruel themes of life.&lt;ref name=Kuhn64&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.64–66&lt;/ref&gt; As a natural consequence, he will attract karma which will ensure that he is reincarnated in hell, or in lower life forms, to enable his soul to experience the cruel themes of life.&lt;ref name=Kuhn64/&gt;

There is no retribution, judgment or reward involved but a natural consequences of the choices in life made either knowingly or unknowingly. Hence, whatever suffering or pleasure that a soul may be experiencing in its present life is on account of choices that it has made in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.15&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this doctrine, Jainism attributes supreme importance to pure thinking and moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, Aidan (2006) p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain texts postulate four ''gatis'', that is states-of-existence or birth-categories, within which the soul transmigrates. The four ''gatis'' are: ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' (demi-gods), ''manuṣya'' (humans), ''[[Naraka (Jainism)|nāraki]]'' (hell beings) and ''tiryañca'' (animals, plants and micro-organisms).&lt;ref name=Jaini108&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p.108&lt;/ref&gt; The four ''gatis'' have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered [[Jain cosmology#Jain geography|Jain universe]]: demi-gods occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated; humans, plants and animals occupy the middle levels; and hellish beings occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated.&lt;ref name=Jaini108/&gt;

Single-sensed souls, however, called ''[[nigoda]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The Jain hierarchy of life classifies living beings on the basis of the senses: five-sensed beings like humans and animals are at the top, and single sensed beings like microbes and plants are at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; and element-bodied souls pervade all tiers of this universe. ''Nigodas'' are souls at the bottom end of the existential hierarchy. They are so tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even individual bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of ''nigodas'' can also be found in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) pp.108–09&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub-sub-categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within ''[[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (2000) p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, God has no role to play in an individual's destiny; one's personal destiny is not seen as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather as a result of its own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, ''[[Vyakhyaprajnapti|Bhagvati sūtra]]'' 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood lead to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows lead to rebirth in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj (1997) p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Each soul is thus responsible for its own predicament, as well as its own salvation. Accumulated karma represent a sum total of all unfulfilled desires, attachments and aspirations of a soul.&lt;ref name=Kuhn28&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.69&lt;/ref&gt; It enables the soul to experience the various themes of the lives that it desires to experience.&lt;ref name=Kuhn28 /&gt; Hence a soul may transmigrate from one life form to another for countless of years, taking with it the karma that it has earned, until it finds conditions that bring about the required fruits. In certain philosophies, heavens and hells are often viewed as places for eternal salvation or eternal damnation for good and bad deeds. But according to Jainism, such places, including the earth are simply the places which allow the soul to experience its unfulfilled karma.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.65–66, 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See also|Gilgul}}
{{Kabbalah||collapsed=1}}
Jewish mystical texts (the [[Kabbalah]]), from their classic Medieval canon onward, teach a belief in ''[[Gilgul Neshamot]]'' (Hebrew for metempsychosis of souls: literally "soul cycle", plural ''"gilgulim"''). The [[Zohar]] and the [[Sefer HaBahir]] specifically discuss reincarnation. It is a common belief in contemporary [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative, though understood in light of a more [[Deveikut|innate]] psychological mysticism. Kabbalah also teaches that "The soul of Moses is reincarnated in every generation."&lt;ref&gt;Kabbalah for Dummies&lt;/ref&gt; Other, Non-Hasidic, [[Orthodox Jewish]] groups while not placing a heavy emphasis on reincarnation, do acknowledge it as a valid teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aish.com/jl-old/kc/48943926.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularization entered modern secular [[Yiddish literature]] and folk motif.

The 16th century mystical renaissance in communal [[Safed]] replaced scholastic [[Jewish philosophy|Rationalism]] as mainstream traditional Jewish theology, both in scholarly circles and in the popular imagination. References to ''gilgul'' in former Kabbalah became systematized as part of the metaphysical purpose of creation. [[Isaac Luria]] (the Ari) brought the issue to the centre of his new mystical articulation, for the first time, and advocated identification of the reincarnations of historic Jewish figures that were compiled by [[Haim Vital]] in his [[Shaar HaGilgulim]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sha'ar Ha'Gilgulim, The Gate of Reincarnations'', Chaim Vital&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gilgul'' is contrasted with the other processes in Kabbalah of [[Ibbur]] ("pregnancy"), the attachment of a second soul to an individual for (or by) good means, and [[Dybuk]] ("possession"), the attachment of a spirit, demon, etc. to an individual for (or by) "bad" means.

In Lurianic Kabbalah, reincarnation is not retributive or fatalistic, but an expression of Divine compassion, the microcosm of the doctrine of cosmic rectification of creation. ''Gilgul'' is a heavenly agreement with the individual soul, conditional upon circumstances. Luria's radical system focused on [[Tohu and Tikkun|rectification]] of the Divine soul, played out through Creation. The true essence of anything is the divine spark within that gives it existence. Even a stone or leaf possesses such a soul that "came into this world to receive a rectification". A human soul may occasionally be exiled into lower inanimate, vegetative or animal creations. The most basic component of the soul, the [[nefesh]], must leave at the cessation of blood production. There are four other soul components and different nations of the world possess different forms of souls with different purposes. Each Jewish soul is reincarnated in order to fulfill each of the [[613 Mitzvot|613 Mosaic commandments]] that elevate a particular spark of holiness associated with each commandment. Once all the Sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source, the [[Mashiach|Messianic Era]] begins. Non-Jewish observance of the [[7 Laws of Noah]] assists the Jewish people, though Biblical adversaries of Israel reincarnate to oppose.

Among the many rabbis who accepted reincarnation are [[Nahmanides]] (the Ramban) and Rabbenu [[Bahya ben Asher]], [[Levi ibn Habib]] (the Ralbah), [[Shelomoh Alkabez]], [[Moses Cordovero]], [[Moses Chaim Luzzatto]]; early Hasidic masters such as the [[Baal Shem Tov]], [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]] and [[Nachman of Breslov]], as well as virtually all later Hasidic masters;  contemporary Hasidic teachers such as DovBer Pinson and [[Moshe Weinberger]]; and key Mitnagdic leaders, such as the [[Vilna Gaon]] and [[Chaim Volozhin]] and their school, as well as Rabbi [[Shalom Sharabi]] (known at the RaShaSH), the [[Ben Ish Chai]] of Baghdad, [[Baba Sali]] and Rabbi [[Joel Landau (rabbi)|Joel Landau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://limmudbayarea2016.sched.com/event/7YDY/judaism-and-reincarnation|title=Limmud Bay Area 2016: Judaism and Reincarnation|website=limmudbayarea2016.sched.com|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis who have rejected the idea include [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], [[Leon de Modena]], [[Solomon ben Aderet]], [[Maimonides]] and [[Asher ben Jehiel]]. Among the [[Geonim]], [[Hai Gaon]] argued in favour of ''gilgulim''.

The doctrines of Sikhism teach that the soul exists, and is passed from one body to another in endless cycles of [[Saṃsāra]], until liberation. Each birth begins with karma (''karam''), and these actions leave a ''karni'' (karmic signature) on one's soul which influences future rebirths, but it is God whose grace that liberates.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt; The way out of the reincarnation cycle, asserts Sikhism, is to live an ethical life, devote oneself to God and constantly remember God's name.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair |title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ  |year=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7 |pages=145–147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The precepts of Sikhism encourage the [[bhakti]] of One Lord for ''mukti'' (liberation).&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

The [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba believe]] in reincarnation within the family. The names Babatunde (Father returns), Yetunde (Mother returns), Babatunji (Father wakes once again) and Sotunde (The wise man returns) all offer vivid evidence of the Ifa concept of familial or lineal rebirth. There is no simple guarantee that your grandfather or great uncle will "come back" in the birth of your child, however.

Whenever the time arrives for a spirit to return to Earth (otherwise known as The Marketplace) through the conception of a new life in the direct bloodline of the family, one of the component entities of a person's being returns, while the other remains in Heaven (Ikole Orun). The spirit that returns does so in the form of a Guardian Ori. One's Guardian Ori, which is represented and contained in the crown of the head, represents not only the spirit and energy of one's previous blood relative, but the accumulated wisdom he or she has acquired through a myriad of lifetimes. This is not to be confused with one’s spiritual Ori, which contains personal destiny, but instead refers to the coming back to The Marketplace of one's personal blood Ori through one's new life and experiences.&lt;!--removed obvious promotional material &amp; link to that website--&gt;

The following is a story of human-to-human reincarnation as told by Thunder Cloud, a Winnebago ([[Ho-Chunk]] tribe) [[Shamanism|shaman]] referred to as T. C. in the narrative. Here T. C. talks about his two previous lives and how he died and came back again to this his third lifetime. He describes his time between lives, when he was “blessed” by Earth Maker and all the abiding spirits and given special powers, including the ability to heal the sick.

T. C.'s Account of His Two Reincarnations:

{{bquote|I ''(my ghost)'' was taken to the place where the sun sets ''(the west)''. ... While at that place, I thought I would come back to earth again, and the old man with whom I was staying said to me, “My son, did you not speak about wanting to go to the earth again?” I had, as a matter of fact, only thought of it, yet he knew what I wanted. Then he said to me, “You can go, but you must ask the chief first.” Then I went and told the chief of the village of my desire, and he said to me, “You may go and obtain your revenge upon the people who killed your relatives and you.” Then I was brought down to earth. ... There I lived until I died of old age. ... As I was lying [in my grave], someone said to me, “Come, let us go away.” So then we went toward the setting of the sun. There we came to a village where we met all the dead. ... From that place I came to this earth again for the third time, and here I am''.&lt;ref name=Jefferson2008 &gt;{{Cite book |last=Jefferson |first=Warren |year=2008 |title=Reincarnation beliefs of North American Indians : soul journeys, metamorphoses, and near-death experiences |publisher=Native Voices |isbn=1-57067-212-1 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/272306114}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Radin, 1923)}}

===Christianity===
In the major Christian denominations, the concept of reincarnation is absent and it is nowhere explicitly referred to in the Bible. However, in a survey by the Pew Forum in 2009, 24% of American Christians expressed a belief in reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS December 9, 2009 |url=http://pewforum.org/Other-Beliefs-and-Practices/Many-Americans-Mix-Multiple-Faiths.aspx |title=Pewforum.org |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 1981 survey 31% of regular churchgoing European Catholics expressed a belief in reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spirituale-wholeness.org/faqs/reinceur/reineuro.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010425113340/http://spiritual-wholeness.org/faqs/reinceur/reineuro.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-04-25 |title=Spiritual-wholeness.org |publisher=Spiritual-wholeness.org |accessdate=2011-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Christian theologians interpret certain Biblical passages as referring to reincarnation. These passages include the questioning of Jesus as to whether he is Elijah, John the Baptist, Jeremiah, or another prophet (Matthew 16:13-15 and John 1:21-22) and, less clearly (while Elijah was said not to have died, but to have been taken up to heaven), John the Baptist being asked if he is not Elijah (John 1:25).&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Frieling, ''Christianity and Reincarnation'', Floris Books 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Albrecht, ''Reincarnation, a Christian Appraisal'', InterVarsity Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn A.

====The idea of reincarnation in the early Church fathers====
There is evidence&lt;ref&gt;"The Big Book of Reincarnation", by Roy Stemman, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; that [[Origen]], a [[Church father]] in early Christian times, taught reincarnation in his lifetime but that when his works were translated into Latin these references were concealed. One of the epistles written by [[St. Jerome]], "To Avitus" (Letter 124 ; Ad Avitum. Epistula CXXIV),&lt;ref name="mlat.uzh.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/text.php?tabelle=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2&amp;rumpfid=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2,%20Epistolae,%20124,%20%20%20%20p0&amp;corpus=2&amp;lang=0&amp;current_title=EPISTOLA%20CXXIV.%20AD%20AVITUM.%20Quid%20cavendum%20in%20Libris%20%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%E1%BD%B6%20%E1%BC%80%CF%81%CF%87%E1%BF%B6%CE%BD.&amp;links=&amp;inframe=1|title=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2, Epistolae, 124, p0|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which asserts that Origen's ''On First Principles'' (Latin: ''De Principiis''; Greek: Περὶ Ἀρχῶν&lt;ref name=Cross&gt;Cross, F. L., and Elizabeth A. Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Second Edition). New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. p. 1009.&lt;/ref&gt;) was mistranscribed:

{{Quote| About ten years ago that saintly man [[Saint Pammachius|Pammachius]] sent me a copy of a certain person's [ [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]'s&lt;ref name="mlat.uzh.ch"/&gt; ] rendering, or rather misrendering, of Origen's ''First Principles''; with a request that in a Latin version I should give the true sense of the Greek and should set down the writer's words for good or for evil without bias in either direction. When I did as he wished and sent him the book, he was shocked to read it and locked it up in his desk lest being circulated it might wound the souls of many.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001124.htm|title=Church Fathers: Letter 124 (Jerome)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Under the impression that Origen was a heretic like [[Arius]], St. Jerome criticizes ideas described in ''On First Principles''. Further in "To Avitus" (Letter 124), St. Jerome writes about "convincing proof" that Origen teaches reincarnation in the original version of the book:

{{Quote|The following passage is a convincing proof that he holds the transmigration of the souls and annihilation of bodies. 'If it can be shown that an incorporeal and reasonable being has life in itself independently of the body and that it is worse off in the body than out of it; then beyond a doubt bodies are only of secondary importance and arise from time to time to meet the varying conditions of reasonable creatures. Those who require bodies are clothed with them, and contrariwise, when fallen souls have lifted themselves up to better things, their bodies are once more annihilated. They are thus ever vanishing and ever reappearing.'&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

The original text of ''On First Principles'' has almost completely disappeared.  It remains extant as ''De Principiis'' in fragments faithfully translated into Latin by St. Jerome and in "the not very reliable Latin translation of [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]."&lt;ref name=Cross /&gt;

Reincarnation was also accepted by some streams of Sufism.

===Druze===
{{Druze|collapsed=1}}
{{See also|Druze#Beliefs}}
Reincarnation is a paramount tenet in the [[Druze]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;Seabrook, W. B., ''Adventures in Arabia'', Harrap and Sons 1928, (chapters on Druze religion)&lt;/ref&gt; There is an eternal [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] of the body and the soul and it is impossible for the soul to exist without the body. Therefore, reincarnations occur instantly at one's death. While in the Hindu and Buddhist belief system a soul can be transmitted to any living creature, in the Druze belief system this is not possible and a human soul will only transfer to a human body. Furthermore, a male Druze can only be reincarnated as another male Druze and a female Druze can only be reincarnated as another female Druze. Additionally, souls cannot be divided and the number of souls existing is finite.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Dwairy, Marwan (2006) "The Psychosocial Function Of Reincarnation Among Druze In Israel" ''Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry,'' page 29 – 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few Druzes are able to recall their past but, if they are able to they are called a ''Nateq''. Typically souls who have died violent deaths in their previous incarnation will be able to recall memories. Since death is seen as a quick transient state, mourning is discouraged.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Unlike other Abrahamic faiths, heaven and hell are spiritual. Heaven is the ultimate happiness received when soul escapes the cycle of rebirths and reunites with the Creator, while hell is conceptualized as the bitterness of being unable to reunite with the Creator and escape from the cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=James |title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2002 |isbn=1615927387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spiritism====
[[File:Tombe Allan Kardec.JPG|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Allan Kardec]], founder of spiritism. The inscription says in French "To be born, die, again be reborn, and so progress unceasingly, such is the law".]]
[[Spiritism]], a Christian philosophy codified in the 19th century by the French educator [[Allan Kardec]], teaches reincarnation or rebirth into human life after death. According to this doctrine, free will and cause and effect are the corollaries of reincarnation, and reincarnation provides a mechanism for man's spiritual evolution in successive lives.&lt;ref name="Hess2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Hess|title=Spirits and Scientists: Ideology, Spiritism and Brazilian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGxsfV-lTtEC&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-04080-6|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theosophy====
The [[Theosophical Society]] draws much of its inspiration from India. The idea is, according to a recent Theosophical writer, "the master-key to modern problems", including heredity.&lt;ref name="Theosophy and reincarnation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blavatskytrust.org.uk/html/wr_reincarnation.htm |title=Theosophy and reincarnation |publisher=Blavatskytrust.org.uk |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Theosophical world-view reincarnation is the vast rhythmic process by which the soul, the part of a person which belongs to the formless non-material and timeless worlds, unfolds its spiritual powers in the world and comes to know itself. It descends from sublime, free, spiritual realms and gathers experience through its effort to express itself in the world. Afterwards there is a withdrawal from the physical plane to successively higher levels of reality, in death, a purification and assimilation of the past life. Having cast off all instruments of personal experience it stands again in its spiritual and formless nature, ready to begin its next rhythmic manifestation, every lifetime bringing it closer to complete self-knowledge and self-expression. However it may attract old mental, emotional, and energetic ''karma'' patterns to form the new personality.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Modern astrology====
Inspired by [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s major works, including ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', [[astrology|astrologers]] in the early twentieth-century integrated the concepts of [[karma]] and reincarnation into the practice of [[Western astrology]]. Notable astrologers who advanced this development included [[Alan Leo]], [[Charles E. O. Carter]], [[Marc Edmund Jones]], and [[Dane Rudhyar]]. A new synthesis of East and West resulted as Hindu and Buddhist concepts of reincarnation were fused with Western astrology's deep roots in [[Hermeticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. In the case of Rudhyar, this synthesis was enhanced with the addition of [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] [[depth psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jutta Woods. "The Theosophical Heritage in Modern Astrology." ''The Mountain Astrologer.'' Aug/Sept 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This dynamic integration of astrology, reincarnation and depth psychology has continued into the modern era with the work of astrologers [[Steven Forrest (astrologer)|Steven Forrest]] and Jeffrey Wolf Green.  Their respective schools of Evolutionary Astrology are based on "an acceptance of the fact that human beings incarnate in a succession of lifetimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forrestastrology.com/about-us/about-evolutionary-astrology|title=About Evolutionary Astrology|author=Steven Forrest and Jeffrey Wolf Green|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anthroposophy====
[[Anthroposophy]] describes reincarnation from the point of view of Western philosophy and culture. The ego is believed to transmute transient soul experiences into universals that form the basis for an individuality that can endure after death. These universals include ideas, which are intersubjective and thus transcend the purely personal (spiritual consciousness), intentionally formed human character (spiritual life), and becoming a fully conscious human being (spiritual humanity). [[Rudolf Steiner]] described both the general principles he believed to be operative in reincarnation, such as that one's will activity in one life forms the basis for the thinking of the next,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Reincarnation and Karma'' by Steiner&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of successive lives of various individualities.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Karmic Relationships'', volumes 1–6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scientology====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Whole Track]] --&gt;
{{See also|Scientology beliefs and practices}}

Past reincarnation, usually termed "past lives", is a key part of the principles and practices of the [[Church of Scientology]]. Scientologists believe that the human individual is actually a ''[[thetan]]'', an immortal spiritual entity, that has fallen into a degraded state as a result of past-life experiences. Scientology [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] is intended to free the person of these past-life traumas and recover past-life memory, leading to a higher state of spiritual awareness. This idea is echoed in their highest fraternal religious order, the [[Sea Organization]], whose motto is "Revenimus" or "We Come Back", and whose members sign a "billion-year contract" as a sign of commitment to that ideal. [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of Scientology, does not use the word "reincarnation" to describe its beliefs, noting that: "The common definition of reincarnation has been altered from its original meaning. The word has come to mean 'to be born again in different life forms' whereas its actual definition is 'to be born again into the flesh of another body.' Scientology ascribes to this latter, original definition of reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg016.html |title=Scientology Church &amp; Religion – What is Scientology? |work=Scientology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613231607/http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg016.html |archivedate=2006-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first writings in Scientology regarding past lives date from around 1951 and slightly earlier. In 1960, Hubbard published a book on past lives entitled ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life]]''. In 1968 he wrote ''[[Mission into Time]]'', a report on a five-week sailing expedition to Sardinia, Sicily and Carthage to see if specific evidence could be found to substantiate L. Ron Hubbard's recall of incidents in his own past, centuries ago.

====Meher Baba====
The Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that reincarnation occurs due to desires and once those desires are extinguished the ego-mind ceases to reincarnate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967), [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org ''Discourses''], Volume III, Sufism Reoriented, 1967, {{ISBN|1-880619-09-1}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wicca====

[[Wicca]] is a neo-pagan religion focused on nature, guided by the philosophy of [[Wiccan Rede]] that advocates the tenets "Harm None, Do As Ye Will". Wiccans believe in a form of karmic return where one's deeds are returned, either in the current life or in another life, threefold or multiple times in order to teach one lessons (The Threefold Law). Reincarnation is therefore an accepted part of the Wiccan faith.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Wicca and Witchcraft, Raven Grimassi&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}} Wiccans also believe that death and afterlife are important experiences for the soul to transform and prepare for future lifetimes.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Reincarnation in the Western world==
During recent decades, many people in the West have developed an interest in reincarnation.&lt;ref name="hi.is"/&gt; Recent studies have indicated that some Westerners accept the idea of reincarnation&lt;ref name="hi.is" /&gt; including certain contemporary people who were from Catholic families,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Walter and Helen Waterhouse, "[http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/2/187.full.pdf A Very Private Belief: Reincarnation in Contemporary England]". ''Sociology of Religion'', Vol. 60, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]], followers of [[Spiritism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and students of [[esotericism|esoteric]] philosophies such as [[Kabbalah]], and [[Gnostic]] and [[Esoteric Christianity]] as well as followers of Indian religions. Demographic survey data from 1999–2002 shows a significant minority of people from Europe and America, where there is reasonable freedom of thought and access to ideas but no outstanding recent reincarnationist tradition, believe we had a life before we were born, will survive death and be born again physically.

[[File:Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg|thumb|The [[14th Dalai Lama]] has stated his belief that it would be difficult for science to disprove reincarnation.]]
Skeptic [[Carl Sagan]] asked the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] what he would do if a fundamental tenet of his religion (reincarnation) were definitively disproved by science. The Dalai Lama answered, "If science can disprove reincarnation, Tibetan Buddhism would abandon reincarnation… but it's going to be mighty hard to disprove reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;"The Boundaries of Knowledge in Buddhism, Christianity, and Science", by Paul David Numrich, p. 13, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, {{ISBN|9783525569870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Stevenson reported that belief in reincarnation is held (with variations in details) by adherents of almost all major religions except [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].  In addition, between 20 and 30 percent of persons in western countries who may be nominal Christians also believe in reincarnation.&lt;ref name=jh&gt;Jane Henry (2005).

One 1999 study by Walter and Waterhouse reviewed the previous data on the level of reincarnation belief and performed a set of thirty in-depth interviews in Britain among people who did not belong to a religion advocating reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that surveys have found about one fifth to one quarter of Europeans have some level of belief in reincarnation, with similar results found in the USA. In the interviewed group, the belief in the existence of this phenomenon appeared independent of their age, or the type of religion that these people belonged to, with most being Christians. The beliefs of this group also did not appear to contain any more than usual of "new age" ideas (broadly defined) and the authors interpreted their ideas on reincarnation as "one way of tackling issues of suffering", but noted that this seemed to have little effect on their private lives.

Waterhouse also published a detailed discussion of beliefs expressed in the interviews.&lt;ref name=Waterhouse1999&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted that although most people "hold their belief in reincarnation quite lightly" and were unclear on the details of their ideas, personal experiences such as past-life memories and [[near-death experience]]s had influenced most believers, although only a few had direct experience of these phenomena. Waterhouse analyzed the influences of second-hand accounts of reincarnation, writing that most of the people in the survey had heard other people's accounts of past-lives from regression hypnosis and dreams and found these fascinating, feeling that there "must be something in it" if other people were having such experiences.

=={{Anchor|Reincarnation research}}Academic research into claims of reincarnation==
Psychiatrist [[Ian Stevenson]], from the [[University of Virginia]], having grown up with a mother who was a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]],&lt;ref name="Stevenson2006p13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf|title=Stevenson 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721165720/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf|archive-date=July 21, 2006|dead-url=yes|access-date=September 1, 2016|df=}}, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated his latter career to investigating claims of reincarnation in hopes of providing evidence that reincarnation happens. Other people who have undertaken similar pursuits include [[Jim B. Tucker]], [[Antonia Mills]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesgmatlock.net/resources/researchers/mills/|title=Mills|work=Signs of Reincarnation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satwant Pasricha]], [[Godwin Samararatne]], and [[Erlendur Haraldsson]], but Stevenson's publications remain the most well-known.

Stevenson conducted more than 2,500 [[case study|case studies]] of young children who claimed to remember past lives over a period of 40 years and published twelve books, including ''[[Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation]]'', [[Reincarnation_and_Biology|Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects, a two-part monograph]] and ''[[Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect]]''. He documented the family's and child's statements along with correlates to a [[deceased]] person he believed matched the child's memory. Stevenson also claimed that some [[birthmark]]s and [[birth defects]] matched wounds and scars on the deceased, sometimes providing [[medical records]] like [[autopsy]] photographs to make his case.&lt;ref&gt;Cadoret, Remi. [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=177497 Book Review: European Cases of the Reincarnation Type] ''The American Journal of Psychiatry'', April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Expecting controversy and [[skepticism]], Stevenson also searched for disconfirming evidence and alternative explanations for the reports, but he argued (not without criticism) that his methods ruled out all possible "normal" explanations for the child’s memories.&lt;ref name="document"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Shroder | first = T | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html?nav=hcmodule | title = Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 2007-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson's work in this regard was impressive enough to [[Carl Sagan]] that he referred to what was apparently Stevenson's investigations in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' as an example of carefully collected empirical data, though he rejected reincarnation as a parsimonious explanation for the stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Demon Haunted World|author=Sagan, Carl|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0-394-53512-8|location=|page=300|authorlink=Carl Sagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] cited Stevenson's works in his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'' as part of a body of data that seems to attest to the reality of psychic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The End of Faith|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|date=September 17, 2005|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=0393327655|edition=Reprint|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critical reviews of these claims include work by [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] who criticized the accounts of reincarnation as being purely [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] and [[Cherry picking|cherry-picked]].&lt;ref name="skepticreport.com"&gt;Rockley, Richard. (2002). [http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=482 "Book Review: Children who Remember Previous Lives"]. SkepticReport. Retrieved 2014-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Edwards says such stories are attributable to [[selective thinking]], [[suggestion]], and [[false memory syndrome|false memories]] that can result from the family's or researcher's belief systems, and thus cannot be counted as [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Edwards, Paul]]. (1996, reprinted in 2001). ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Keith Augustine wrote in critique that the fact that "the vast majority of Stevenson's cases come from countries where a religious belief in reincarnation is strong, and rarely elsewhere, seems to indicate that cultural conditioning (rather than reincarnation) generates claims of spontaneous past-life memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infidels.org/library/modern/keith_augustine/immortality.html|title=The Case Against Immortality|publisher=Infidels.org|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]] pointed out that a large number of Stevenson’s cases consisted of poor children remembering wealthy lives or belonging to a [[Caste system in India|higher caste]]. In these societies, claims of reincarnation are sometimes used as schemes to obtain money from the richer families of alleged former incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Wilson (author)|Wilson, Ian]]. (1981). ''Mind Out of Time: Reincarnation Investigated''. Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-02968-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these types of criticism, Stevenson published a book on ''[[European Cases of the Reincarnation Type]]'' in attempt to show the reports were cross-cultural. Even still, [[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]] explained that all the past-life experiences investigated by Stevenson and other parapsychologists are understandable in terms of known psychological factors including a mixture of [[cryptomnesia]] and [[confabulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Baker, Robert A]]. (1996). ''Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-576-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards also noted that reincarnation invokes assumptions that are inconsistent with modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, Robert. (1998). ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step''. University Press of America. pp. 202–203. {{ISBN|0-7618-1067-6}} "Edwards catalogs common sense objections which have been made against reincarnation. 1) How does a soul exist between bodies? 2) Tertullian's objection: If there is reincarnation, why are not babies born with the mental abilities of adults? 3) Reincarnation claims an infinite series of prior incarnations. Evolution teaches that there was a time when humans did not yet exist. So reincarnation is inconsistent with modern science. 4) If there is reincarnation, then what is happening when the population increases? 5) If there is reincarnation, then why do so few, if any people, remember past lives?... To answer these objections believers in reincarnation must accept additional assumptions... Acceptance of these silly assumptions, Edwards says, amounts to a crucifixion of one's intellect."

* [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Edwards, Paul]]. (1996, reprinted in 2001). ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the vast majority of people do not remember previous lives and there is no empirically documented mechanism known that allows personality to survive death and travel to another body, positing the existence of reincarnation is subject to the principle that "[[extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence]]". Researchers such as Stevenson acknowledged these limitations.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html?nav=hcmodule|title=Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children|last=Shroder|first=Tom|date=2007-02-11|accessdate=2011-12-06|publisher=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevenson also claimed there were a handful of cases that suggested evidence of [[xenoglossy]], including two where a subject under hypnosis allegedly conversed with people speaking the foreign language, instead of merely being able to recite foreign words. [[Sarah Thomason]], a linguist at the University of Michigan, reanalyzed these cases, concluding that "the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thomason|Thomason, Sarah G.]]. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~thomason/papers/xenogl.pdf "Xenoglossy"]. In [[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitutional law]], '''''rogatio''''' is the term (from [[Latin]]  ''rogo'', "ask, place a question before") for a [[Bill (proposed law)|legislative bill]] placed before an [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|Assembly of the People]] in ancient Rome. The ''rogatio'' procedure underscores the fact that the [[Roman senate]] could issue decrees, but was not a legislative or [[parliament]]arian body. Only [[SPQR|the People]] could pass legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fergus Millar]], ''The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic'' (University of Michigan Press, 1998), pp. 157–158 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YVBNzYQy5vYC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=%22it+was+only+by+the+people+that+legislation+could+be+passed%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22it%20was%20only%20by%20the%20people%20that%20legislation%20could%20be%20passed%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] with the right to summon the assembly could propose a bill (''rogatio legis''); the proposed laws themselves were ''leges rogatae''. A bill's proposer was its ''lator''; a supporter was an ''auctor''.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''The Crowd in Rome'' p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions in the senate would contribute to the drafting of a bill, which would be published (''promulgare rogationem'', that is, ''[[promulgation|promulgatio]]'') three weeks or more before it was formally submitted to the assembly. During this period, citizens could discuss the bill and propose changes, or more rarely ask for its withdrawal, at informal sessions (''contiones''). After the bill had been brought before the assembly for the vote, it could no longer be modified.&lt;ref&gt;George Mousourakis, ''The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 182 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8qE1zFHyGXoC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislator who introduced the bill asked ''Velitis iubeatis, Quirites?'' ("Citizens, are you going to approve and order?"&lt;ref&gt;Or, "Citizens, is it your will that you should order it?"&lt;/ref&gt;) and the people responded [[yea or nay]] without discussion. If a bill was withdrawn after the ''rogatio'' but before the vote was taken, it was usually because a [[tribune]] threatened to use his veto power against it, or less frequently because it proved unpopular among the ''[[plebs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lintott]], ''Judicial reform and land reform in the Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 6–7 [https://books.google.com/books?id=bcc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=rogatio+OR+rogation+inauthor:Lintott&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio%20OR%20rogation%20inauthor%3ALintott&amp;f=false online.] Lintott believes [[Cicero]] exaggerates the extent to which the ''plebs'' could influence withdrawal.&lt;/ref&gt; If a bill was passed (''rogatio lata est''), it became a law (''[[Roman law|lex]]'') after the presiding magistrate made a formal announcement (''renuntiatio'') of the assembly's decision.

In the Early [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the senate had to approve the constitutionality of a law before it was enacted; after the passage of the ''[[Conflict of the Orders#The end of the Conflict of the Orders (367-287 BC)|Lex Publilia Philonis]]'' in 339 BC, which required that at least one of the two ''[[Roman censor|censores]]'' be a plebeian, this approval (''patrum [[auctoritas]]'') was required before the bill was put to a vote in the assembly. With controversial [[populares|popularist]] measures, however, the senate was sometimes bypassed. 
If a bill was proposed for the purpose of declaring war, it had to be brought before the [[Centuriate Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Millar, ''Rome, the Greek World, and the East'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill that became law was inscribed on copper or marble tablets and kept in the state treasury (''[[aerarium]] populi romani'') under the supervision of the [[quaestor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 63 BC, [[Cicero]] managed to [[Obstructionism|obstruct]] a ''rogatio Servilia'' by making a speech before the people; this appears to be the only time in the Late Republic when oratory blocked a popular piece of legislation, which in this case had provided for the distribution of land to the poor. Or so Cicero claims; the bill's sponsor, the tribune [[Servilius Rullus]], more likely withdrew it because of the threat of veto from one of his fellow tribunes, and it never reached the ''[[comitia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Mouritsen, ''Plebs and Politics in the Late Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 54–55 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8iQQ7Xe2y-wC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.] Further discussion of the ''rogatio Servilia'' by [[Erich S.

[[Sex]] and the use of [[drug]]s (legal and illegal) have been linked throughout human history, encompassing all aspects of sex: [[desire]], [[performance improvement|performance]], [[pleasure]], [[fertilisation|conception]], [[gestation]], and [[disease]].

== Disinhibition ==
Drugs are frequently associated with reduced sexual inhibition, both when used voluntarily in social circumstances, and involuntarily, as in the case of some [[date rape drug]]s.

Because the use of drugs, including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], is commonly presented as an excuse for risky or socially unacceptable behaviour, it is necessary to treat the idea of a direct causal relation between drug use and [[unsafe sex]] with caution.  Drugs may provide a socially acceptable excuse for engaging in sexual behaviours in which people may want to engage but perhaps feel that they should not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Race|first1=Kane|title=Pleasure Consuming Medicine: The Queer Politics of Drugs|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822390884|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVuU9KmotYC&amp;&amp;pg=PA176|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual function ==
Some forms of sexual dysfunction such as [[erectile dysfunction]] can be treated with drugs. Because of their effects, erectile dysfunction drugs are sometimes used for recreational purposes.

Many [[drug]]s, both legal and illegal, some sold online, have side effects that affect the user's sexual function. Many drugs can cause [[loss of libido]] as a side effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=JR|last2=Ratamess|first2=NA|title=Medical issues associated with anabolic steroid use: are they exaggerated?|journal=Journal of sports science &amp; medicine|date=2006|volume=5|issue=2|pages=182-93|pmid=24259990|pmc=3827559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-male-enhancement-products-deliver-more-you-bargained-f1C8993189 | title = FDA: ‘Male enhancement’ products deliver more than you bargained for | publisher = NBC News | date  = 21 March 2013| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the partial cause of the [[Refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] is the inhibition of [[dopamine]] by an orgasm-induced [[secretion]] of [[prolactin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, etal | title = Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinology]] | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14656205 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such potent [[dopamine receptor]] [[agonist]]s as [[cabergoline]] may help achieve multiple [[orgasm]]s as well as the retention of sexual arousal for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, etal | title = Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinology]] | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14656205 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contraception and abortion == 
Drug-based contraception has been available since the development of the [[contraceptive pill]]. As well as their contraceptive effects, contraceptive drugs can also have adverse sexual and reproductive side-effects. Prior to the availability of effective contraceptives, some substances were also used as [[abortifacient]]s to terminate pregnancy; [[medical abortion]] exists as a modern medical practice.

[[Image:Parts of a note.svg|thumb|Parts of the note]]
[[File:Note stems.png|thumb|Musical stems may go either way upon the middle line; generally, lower than this they go up and the higher than this they go down.]]

In [[musical notation]], '''stems''' are the, "thin, vertical [[line (geometry)|lines]] that are directly connected to the [[notehead|[note] head]]&lt;!--the source spells "note head" as two words--&gt;."&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I'', p.14. Seventh Edition. McGraw Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stems may point up or down. Different-pointing stems indicate the [[voice (music)|voice]] for [[polyphonic]] music written on the same [[staff (music)|staff]]. Within one voice, the stems usually point down for notes on the middle line or higher, and up for those below. If the stem points up from a notehead, the stem originates from the right-hand side of the note, but if it points down, it originates from the left. There is an exception to this rule: if a [[chord (music)|chord]] contains a [[Interval number|second]], the stem runs between the two notes with the higher being placed on the right of the stem and the lower on the left. If the chord contains an odd numbered cluster of notes a second apart (such as C, D, E), the outer two will be on the correct side of the stem, while the middle note will be on the wrong side.

The length of a stem should be that of an octave on the staff,&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"/&gt; going to either an octave higher or lower than the notehead, depending on which way the stem is pointing. If a note head is on a [[ledger lines|ledger line]] more than an octave away from the middle line of a staff, the stem will be elongated to touch the middle line. In any polyphonic music in which two parts are written on the same staff, stems are typically shortened to keep the music visually centered upon the staff.

[[File:Music-tremolo.png|90px|right]]
Stems may be altered in various ways to alter the rhythm or other method of performance. For example, a note with diagonal slashes through its stem is played [[tremolo]].

'''The Sound Factory''' (also known as '''Sunset Sound Factory''') is a recording studio in [[Los Angeles, California]].

The Sound Factory was built in the 1960s on Selma Avenue in Hollywood.

Total Carbon is an analytical measurement for carbon content.  This measurement commonly found in environmental and pharmaceutical analysis. 

== Carbon Content Categories ==

A variety of different terms are used to identify the different types of carbon present at different levels of detail.

*'''Total Carbon (TC)''' – all the carbon in the sample, including both inorganic and organic carbon
*'''[[Total Inorganic Carbon]] (TIC)''' – often referred to as inorganic carbon (IC), [[carbonate]], [[bicarbonate]], and [[Solvation|dissolved]] [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
*'''[[Total Organic Carbon]] (TOC)''' – material derived from decaying vegetation, bacterial growth, and [[Metabolism|metabolic]] activities of living organisms or chemicals.
*'''Elemental Carbon (EC)''' – [[charcoal]], [[coal]], and [[soot]]. Resistant to analytical digestion and extraction, EC can be a fraction of either TIC or TOC depending on analytical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, B. A. (2002). [http://bcodata.whoi.edu/LaurentianGreatLakes_Chemistry/bs116.pdf "Methods for the Determination of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in Soils and Sediments"] Ecological Risk Assessment Support Center. US. Environmental Protection Agency 23p.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC)''' – commonly referred to as TOC; organic carbon remaining in an acidified sample after purging the sample with gas.
*'''Purgeable (volatile) Organic Compound (VOC)''' – organic carbon that has been removed from a [[pH|neutral]], or acidified sample by purging with an [[inert gas]]. These are the same compounds referred to as [[Volatile organic compound|Volatile Organic Compounds]] (VOC) and usually determined by Purge and Trap Gas [[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|Chromatography]].
*'''[[Dissolved Organic Carbon]] (DOC)''' – organic carbon remaining in a sample after filtering the sample, typically using a 0.45 [[Micrometre|micrometer]] filter.
*'''Suspended Organic Carbon''' – also called [[particulate]] organic carbon (POC); the carbon in particulate form that is too large to pass through a filter.

In [[computer science]], a '''typed assembly language''' ('''TAL''') is an [[assembly language]] that is extended to include a method of annotating the [[datatype]] of each value that is manipulated by the code. These annotations can then be used by a program (type checker) that processes the assembly language code in order to analyse how it will behave when it is executed.  Specifically, such a type checker can be used to prove the [[type safety]] of code that meets the criteria of some appropriate [[type system]].  

Typed assembly languages usually include a high-level memory management system based on [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]].

A typed assembly language with a suitably expressive type system can be used to enable the safe execution of untrusted code without using an intermediate representation like [[bytecode]], allowing features similar to those currently provided by virtual machine environments like [[Java platform|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1518">The observed '''X-ray background''' is thought to result from, at the "soft" end (below 0.3 keV), galactic [[X-ray]] emission, the "galactic" X-ray background, and, at the "hard" end (above 0.3keV), from a combination of many unresolved [[X-ray]] sources outside of the [[Milky Way]], the "cosmic" X-ray background (CXB).  

The galactic X-ray background is produced largely by emission from hot gas in the [[Local Bubble]] within 100 [[parsec]]s of the [[Sun]]. 

Deep surveys with X-ray telescopes, such as the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], have demonstrated that around 80% of the cosmic X-ray background is due to resolved extra-galactic X-ray sources, the bulk of which are unobscured ("type-1") and obscured ("type-2") [[active galactic nuclei]] (AGN).
