The '''Agência Paulista de Tecnologia dos Agronegócios''' ('''APTA''' – São Paulo’s Agency for Agribusiness Technology), linked to [[Secretaria de Agricultura e Abastecimento]] (Secretariat of Agriculture and Supplies), came about in 2001, in order to coordinate all agriculture and cattle raising research in the state of [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. Its main objective is to generate and transfer scientific and technological knowledge in [[agribusiness]], thereby harmonizing the socio-economic development with environmental balance. The main innovation in this reorganization was the creation of 15 regional poles of development, spread throughout the state.
APTA has guided itself by the prospects of technological demands, and does it regionally, as an instrument to guide the research of the entire agency.
In addition to the poles, APTA’s structure encompasses the six research bodies of the Secretaria da Agricultura and Abastecimento (SAA – Secretariat of Agriculture and Supplies) – the [[Instituto Agronômico de Campinas]] (IAC -Agronomical Institute), the [[Instituto Biológico]] (Biological Institute), the [[Instituto de Economia Agrícola]] (IEA -  Agricultural Economics Institute), the Instituto de Zootecnica (IZ - Zoo technical Institute), the Instituto de Pesca (Fisheries Institute) and the Instituto de Tecnologia de Alimentos (ITAL – Food Technology Institute). The agency centers its activities on four strategic programs: bioenergy, environmental sustainability, organization of the rural and outlying areas, and food safety.
As the second largest agribusiness technological research institution in Brazil and the Southern Hemisphere, APTA features 64 experimental units and 43 research laboratories.

== Early life and education ==
Townsend-Small was born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. She grew up in [[Holliston, Massachusetts]], and graduated from [[Holliston High School]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} While attending [[Skidmore College]] in 1997, Townsend-Small spent a semester at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]] as part of the Semester in Environmental Science program.&lt;!-- The source cited here only states that she attended Skidmore; it mentions nothing about the Marine Biological Laboratory --&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/ses/alumni/ses-alumni-list-by-college/|title=SES Alumni List by College|website=www.mbl.edu|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this semester she produced a research project investigating the use of [[nitrogen]] stable [[isotope]]s as tracers of wastewater inputs to groundwater, and has continued to work with isotopes and marine environments since.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1998, Townsend-Small graduated ''[[Magna cum Laude|magna cum laude]]'' from [[Skidmore College]], receiving a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's degree]] in both [[English literature]] and [[environmental biology]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; She received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Marine Science|marine science]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 2006, where she had done dissertation research investigating carbon cycling and its relationship with climate in the [[Amazon River]] headwaters of [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|others=|title=Carbon and nitrogen cycling in the Peruvian Andean Amazon|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/13069|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and research ==
Townsend-Small's dissertation research focused on examining the [[particulate organic matter]] (POM) carried downstream by rivers from the [[Andes|Andes Mountains]] in [[Peru]] to the [[Amazon River]], paying special attention to the elemental and isotopic compositions of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] in the POM.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; After receiving her PhD, Townsend-Small worked at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] as a Postdoctoral Researcher studying the connection between [[Climate change|changing climate]] and the export of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and dissolved nutrients in rivers of the [[Alaska]]n Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend-Small|first=Amy|last2=McClelland|first2=James W.|last3=Max Holmes|first3=R.|last4=Peterson|first4=Bruce J.|date=2010-05-09|title=Seasonal and hydrologic drivers of dissolved organic matter and nutrients in the upper Kuparuk River, Alaskan Arctic|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-010-9451-4|journal=Biogeochemistry|language=en|volume=103|issue=1-3|pages=109–124|doi=10.1007/s10533-010-9451-4|issn=0168-2563}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Townsend-Small began working as a Postdoctoral Scholar and Project Scientist in the Department of Earth System Science at the [[University of California, Irvine|University of California Irvine]], where she conducted research regarding urban [[greenhouse gas]] and water budgets in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend-Small|first=Amy|last2=Pataki|first2=Diane E.|last3=Czimczik|first3=Claudia I.|last4=Tyler|first4=Stanley C.|date=2011|title=Nitrous oxide emissions and isotopic composition in urban and agricultural systems in southern California|url=https://utah.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/nitrous-oxide-emissions-and-isotopic-composition-in-urban-and-agr|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences|language=English|volume=116|issue=1|pages=G01013|doi=10.1029/2010JG001494|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, Townsend-Small has been at the [[University of Cincinnati]], where she is now an Associate Professor in the Department of Geology and Geography as well as the director of the Environmental Studies Program.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Her current research at [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]] investigates [[Anthropogenic greenhouse gases|anthropogenic]] sources of [[methane]] and [[climate change]] feedbacks to the global [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Ramon A.|last2=Zavala-Araiza|first2=Daniel|last3=Lyon|first3=David R.|last4=Allen|first4=David T.|last5=Barkley|first5=Zachary R.|last6=Brandt|first6=Adam R.|last7=Davis|first7=Kenneth J.|last8=Herndon|first8=Scott C.|last9=Townsend-Small|first9=Amy|date=2018-06-21|title=Improved characterization of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain|url=https://www.nist.gov/publications/improved-characterization-methane-emissions-us-oil-and-gas-supply-chain|journal=Science Magazine|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

The center was mainly founded by the [[Fields Medal]]ist [[Shing-Tung Yau]] in August 2002. The first directors and advisors were [[mathematician]]s [[Su Buqing]] and [[Shiing-Shen Chern]], both of whom are [[Zhejiang Province|Zhejiang]] natives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.zju.edu.cn/news.asp?id=198&amp;ColumnName=people&lt;/ref&gt; The first academic director of the center is Shing-Tung Yau.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.zju.edu.cn/news.asp?id=1103&amp;ColumnName=integration&amp;Version=&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, Zhejiang University has one of the best traditions of mathematical research, which is known as the ''Zhe School'' (''of Mathematics'') and the ''Chen-Su School'' (''of Differential Geometry''; in memorial of mathematicians [[Su Buqing]] and [[Chen Jiangong]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2005-02/06/content_2557860.htm 中国为什么还不是数学强国？丘成桐直言教育弊端&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For continuing keeping and developing such excellent tradition, the center was founded, and coupled with the Department of Mathematics of Zhejiang University. 

Every year, many mathematicians and scientists from all over the world visit or do research at the center.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2094">'''Cranial evolutionary allometry''' ('''CREA''') is a scientific theory regarding trends in the shape of mammalian [[skulls]] during the course of evolution in accordance with body size (i.e., [[allometry]]).  Specifically, the theory posits that there is a propensity among closely related mammalian groups for the skulls of the smaller species to be short and those of the larger species to be long.  This propensity appears to hold true for placental as well as non-placental mammals, and is highly robust.  Examples of groups which exhibit this characteristic include [[antelope]]s,  [[fruit bat]]s,  [[mongoose]]s,  [[squirrel]]s  and  [[kangaroo]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing the cranial evolutionary allometric ‘rule’ in Galliformes|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5021629/|author=Marta Linde-Medina|date=September 2016|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|issue=29|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=96th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Mammalogists|url=https://www.mammalsociety.org/uploads/2016-ASM-Abstracts-2016.05.18.pdf|author=Andrea Cardini|date=2016|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardini, A., Polly, D., Dawson, R., Milne, N., 2015. Why the Long Face? Kangaroos and Wallabies Follow the Same ‘Rule’ of Cranial Evolutionary Allometry (CREA) as Placentals. Evol Biol 42, 169–176. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11692-015-9308-9&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[felid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tamagnini, D., Meloro, C., Cardini, A., 2017. Anyone with a Long-Face? Craniofacial Evolutionary Allometry (CREA) in a Family of Short-Faced Mammals, the Felidae. Evol Biol 44, 476–495. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11692-017-9421-z&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the reason for this trend has to do with size-related constraints on the formation and development of the mammalian skull.  Facial length is one of the best known examples of [[heterochrony]].&lt;ref&gt;Cardini, A., Polly, P.D., 2013. Larger mammals have longer faces because of size-related constraints on skull form.

The '''definition of religion''' is a controversial subject in [[religious studies]] with scholars failing to agree on any one definition. [[Oxford Dictionary]] defines [[religion]] as the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a [[personal God]] or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/religion|title=religion (English Oxford living Dictionaries)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]], have tried to correct a perceived Judeo-Christian and Western bias in the definition and study of religion. Thinkers such as Daniel Dubuisson{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007}} have doubted that the term religion has any meaning outside of western cultures, while others, such as Ernst Feil{{sfn|Feil|2000}} even doubt that it has any specific, universal meaning even there.

==Competing definitions==

Scholars have failed to agree on a definition of religion. There are however two general definition systems: the sociological/functional and the phenomenological/philosophical.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl.

* [[Emile Durkheim]] defined religion as "a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say things set apart and forbidden - beliefs and practises which unite into one single moral community called a church, all those who adhere to them."{{sfn|Taves|2009|page=176}}
* [[Max Lynn Stackhouse]], defined religion as "a comprehensive worldview or 'metaphysical moral vision' that is accepted as binding because it is held to be in itself basically true and just even if all dimensions of it cannot be either fully confirmed or refuted".{{sfn|Nelson|2010|page=xi}}

Some jurisdictions refuse to classify specific religions as religions, arguing that they are instead heresies, even if they are widely viewed as a religion in the academic world.{{sfn|Minahan|2002|page=234}}

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A. M. |date=2002 |title=Sociological definitions, language games, and the 'essence' of religion | journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | volume=14 | issue=1 | issn=0943-3058 | doi=10.1163/157006802760198776 | pages=61–83 |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf |access-date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wilfred Cantwell |date=1978 |title=The Meaning and End of Religion |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference USA]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=James |first1=Paul |last2=Mandaville |first2=Peter |year=2010 |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Globalization and Culture, Vol. 2: Globalizing Religions |url=https://www.academia.edu/4416072/Globalization_and_Culture_Vol._2_Globalizing_Religions_editor_with_Peter_Mandaville_Sage_Publications_London_2010 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;Hueston A. Finlay. "'Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited". ''Religious Studies'' 41.1 (2005), pp. 81–94. {{doi|10.1017/S0034412504007462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"&gt;Tillich, P. (1957) ''Dynamics of faith''. Harper Perennial; (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion.

==Religion as modern western construct==
[[File:Huxisanxiaotu.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]] are one'', a painting in the ''litang style'' portraying three men laughing by a river stream, 12th century, [[Song dynasty]]]]

A number of scholars have pointed out that the terminology used in the study of religion in the west derives from [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], and that the basic assumptions of religion as an analytical category are all Western in origin. This idea was first raised by Wilfred Cantwell Smith in his 1962 book, ''The Meaning and End of Religion''.{{sfn|Smith|1991}} Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], and Jason Ānanda Josephson. These [[social constructionist]]s argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

While few would dispute that the concept of religion does have a historical genealogy, there is some disagreement about what the Western origin of the term has meant historically. Some such as [[Tomoko Masuzawa]] have felt that the equation of religion with Christianity had the effect of diminishing other traditions, especially in the study of comparative religions as it developed during the high point of Western imperialism.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}} Others{{who|date=November 2017}} have felt that this sort of criticism overestimates the influence that Western academic thought had on the rest of the world.

Daniel Dubuisson, a French anthropologist, argues that the idea of religion has changed a lot over time and that one cannot fully understand its development by relying on consistent use of the term, which "tends to minimize or cancel out the role of history".{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} "What the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history."{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} He notes that [[St. Augustine]]'s definition of ''religio'' differed from the way we used the modern word religion.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}}

Dubuisson prefers the term "cosmographic formation" to religion. Dubuisson says that, with the emergence of religion as a category separate from culture and society, there arose [[religious studies]]. The initial purpose of religious studies was to demonstrate the superiority of the living or universal European world view to the dead or ethnic religions scattered throughout the rest of the world, expanding the teleological project of [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Tiele]] to a worldwide ideal religiousness.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007|p=792}} Due to shifting theological currents, this was eventually supplanted by a liberal-ecumenical interest in searching for Western-style universal truths in every cultural tradition.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}}

According to Fitzgerald, religion is not a universal feature of all cultures, but rather a particular idea that first developed in Europe under the influence of [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|p=45–46}} Fitzgerald argues that from about the 4th century CE Western Europe and the rest of the world diverged. As Christianity became commonplace, the [[charismatic authority]] identified by Augustine, a quality we might today call religiousness, exerted a commanding influence at the local level. As the Catholic Church lost its dominance during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and Christianity became closely tied to political structures, religion was recast as the basis of national [[sovereignty]], and religious identity gradually became a less universal sense of spirituality and more divisive, locally defined, and tied to nationality.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=194}} It was at this point that religion was dissociated from universal beliefs and moved closer to [[dogma]] in both meaning and practice. However, there was not yet the idea of dogma as a personal choice, only of [[established church]]es. With the Enlightenment religion lost its attachment to nationality, says Fitzgerald, but rather than becoming a universal social attitude, it now became a personal feeling or emotion.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=268}}

[[Talal Asad]] later refined this notion by showing that many assumptions about religion derive specifically from post-Enlightenment Christianity.{{sfn|Asad|2003}}
Asad argues that before the word religion came into common usage, Christianity was a ''disciplina'', a rule just like that of the Roman Empire. This idea can be found in the writings of [[St. Augustine]] (354–430). Christianity was then a power structure opposing and superseding human institutions, a literal Kingdom of Heaven. It was the discipline taught by one's family, school, church, and city authorities, rather than something calling one to self-discipline through symbols.{{sfn|Asad|1993|p=34-35}}

These ideas are developed by [[S. N. Balagangadhara]]. In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Balagangadhara argues that the idea of Christianity as the purest expression of spirituality was supplanted by the concept of religion as a worldwide practice.{{sfn|Balagangadhara|1994|p=159}} This caused such ideas as [[religious freedom]], a reexamination of classical [[philosophy]] as an alternative to Christian thought, and more radically [[Deism]] among intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]]. Much like Christianity, the idea of religious freedom was exported around the world as a civilizing technique, even to regions such as [[India]] that had never treated spirituality as a matter of political identity.{{sfn|Pennington|2005}}

More recently, in ''The Invention of Religion in Japan'', Josephson has argued that while the concept of religion was Christian in its early formulation, non-Europeans (such as the Japanese) did not just acquiesce and passively accept the term's meaning. Instead they worked to interpret religion (and its boundaries) strategically to meet their own agendas and staged these new meanings for a global audience.{{sfn|Josephson|2012}} In nineteenth century [[Japan]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] was radically transformed from a pre-modern philosophy of [[natural law]] into a religion, as Japanese leaders worked to address domestic and international political concerns. In summary, Josephson argues that the European encounter with other cultures has led to a partial de-Christianization of the category religion. Hence religion has come to refer to a confused collection of traditions with no possible coherent definition.{{sfn|Josephson|2012|p=257}}

[[George Lindbeck]], a [[Lutheran]] and a [[Postliberal theology|postliberal theologian]] (but not a social constructionist), says that religion does not refer to belief in [[God]] or a transcendent Absolute, but rather to "a kind of cultural and/or linguistic framework or medium that shapes the entirety of life and thought ... it is similar to an idiom that makes possible the description of realities, the formulation of beliefs, and the experiencing of inner attitudes, feelings, and sentiments."{{sfn|Lindbeck|1984|p=33}}

'''Discourse analysis''' ('''DA'''), or '''discourse studies''', is the approaches to analyze written, vocal, or sign language use, or any significant [[semiotic]] event.

The objects of discourse analysis ([[discourse]], writing, conversation, communicative [[symbolic interactionism|event]]) are variously defined in terms of coherent sequences of [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], [[proposition]]s, [[speech acts|speech]], or [[Conversation Analysis#Turn-taking organization|turns-at-talk]]. Contrary to much of traditional linguistics, discourse analysts not only study language use 'beyond the sentence boundary' but also prefer to analyze 'naturally occurring' language use, not invented examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Discourse Analysis – What Speakers Do in Conversation {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|url = http://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/discourse-analysis-what-speakers-do-conversation|website = www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Text linguistics]] is a closely related field. The essential difference between discourse analysis and text linguistics is that discourse analysis aims at revealing socio-psychological characteristics of a person/persons rather than text structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/integrational-discourse-analysis-conception.html Yatsko V.A. Integrational discourse analysis conception]&lt;/ref&gt;

Discourse analysis has been taken up in a variety of disciplines in the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s, including [[linguistics]], education, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[social work]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[area studies]], [[cultural studies]], [[international relations]], [[human geography]], [[communication studies]], [[biblical studies]], and [[translation studies]], each of which is subject to its own assumptions, dimensions of analysis, and methodologies.

===Political discourse===
Political discourse analysis is a field of discourse analysis which focuses on discourse in political forums (such as debates, speeches, and hearings) as the phenomenon of interest. [[Policy analysis]] requires discourse analysis to be effective from the [[post-positivist]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hult | first = F.M. | year = 2017 | contribution = Discursive approaches to policy | editor1-first = S.E.F. | editor1-last = Wortham | editor2-first = D | editor2-last = Kim | editor3-first = S | editor3-last = May | title = Discourse and education | pages = 111–21 | place = New York | publisher = Springer}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hult | first = F.M. | year = 2015 | URL =  https://books.google.com/books?id=lOc_CQAAQBAJ | contribution = Making policy connections across scales using nexus analysis | editor1-first = F.M. | editor1-last = Hult | editor2-first = D.C | editor2-last = Johnson | title = Research methods in language policy and planning: A practical guide | pages = 217–31 | place = Malden, MA | publisher = Wiley}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political discourse is the formal exchange of reasoned views as to which of several alternative courses of action should be taken to solve a societal problem.&lt;ref name= "co-operation.org"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Johnson | first1 = David W. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Roger T. | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.459.5411&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | title = Civil Political Discourse in a Democracy: The Contribution of Psychology | date = May 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an analysis of political discourse is Roffee's 2016 examination into speech acts surrounding the justification of the legislative processes concerning the Australian federal government's intervening in the Northern Territory Aboriginal communities.  The intervention was a hasty reaction to a social problem. Through this analysis, Roffee established that there was, in fact, an unwillingness to respond on behalf of the government, and the intervention was, in fact, no more than another attempt to control the Indigenous population. However, due to the political rhetoric used, this was largely unidentified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Rhetoric, Aboriginal Australians and the Northern Territory Intervention: A Socio-legal Investigation into Pre-legislative Argumentation | doi= 10.5204/ijcjsd.v5i1.285 | volume=5 | issue=1 | journal= International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy | page= 131 | year= 2016 | last1= Roffee | first1= James A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate discourse ===
Corporate discourse can be broadly defined as the language used by corporations. It encompasses a set of messages that a corporation sends out to the world  (the general public, the customers and other corporations) and the messages it uses to communicate within its own structures (the employees and other stakeholders).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Corporate discourse |last=Ruth |first= Breeze |isbn= 978-1-44112718-1 |location= London |oclc= 830837491 |date = 2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Globalize/US|date=December 2010}}

Although the ancient Greeks (among others) had much to say on discourse, some scholars{{Which|date=February 2011}} consider Austria-born [[Leo Spitzer]]'s ''Stilstudien'' (''Style Studies'') of 1928 the earliest example of ''discourse analysis'' (DA). [[Michel Foucault]] translated it into French.

However, the term first came into general use following the publication of a series of papers by [[Zellig Harris]] from 1952 reporting on work from which he developed [[transformational grammar]] in the late 1930s. Formal equivalence relations among the sentences of a coherent discourse are made explicit by using sentence transformations to put the text in a canonical form. Words and sentences with equivalent information then appear in the same column of an array. This work progressed over the next four decades (see references) into a science of [[sublanguage]] analysis (Kittredge &amp; Lehrberger 1982), culminating in a demonstration of the informational structures in texts of a sublanguage of science, that of Immunology, (Harris et al. 1989) and a fully articulated theory of linguistic informational content (Harris 1991). During this time, however, most linguists ignored such developments in favor of a succession of elaborate theories of sentence-level syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], then a colleague of Harris in Linguistics at University of Pennsylvania, summarized and critically examined the development of Harris’s thought on discourse through 1969 in lectures attended by Harris’ colleagues and students in Philadelphia and Cambridge. Corcoran, John, 1972. "Harris on the Structures of Language", in ''Transformationelle Analyse'', ed. Senta Plötz, Athenäum Verlag, Frankfurt, 275–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1953, a linguist working for the American Bible Society, [[James A. Lauriault|James A. Lauriault/Loriot]], needed to find answers to some fundamental errors in translating Quechua, in the Cuzco area of Peru. Following Harris's 1952 publications, he worked over the meaning and placement of each word in a collection of Quechua legends with a native speaker of Quechua and was able to formulate discourse rules that transcended the simple sentence structure. He then applied the process to Shipibo, another language of Eastern Peru. He taught the theory at the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Norman, Oklahoma, in the summers of 1956 and 1957 and entered the University of Pennsylvania to study with Harris in the interim year. He tried to publish a paper ''Shipibo Paragraph Structure'', but it was delayed until 1970 (Loriot &amp; Hollenbach 1970).{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} In the meantime, [[Kenneth Lee Pike]], a professor at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, taught the theory, and one of his students, [[Robert E. Longacre]] developed it in his writings.

Harris's methodology disclosing the correlation of form with meaning was developed into a system for the computer-aided analysis of natural language by a team led by [[Naomi Sager]] at [[NYU]], which has been applied to a number of sublanguage domains, most notably to medical informatics. The software for the [http://mlp-xml.sourceforge.net/ Medical Language Processor] is publicly available on [[SourceForge]].

In the late 1960s and 1970s, and without reference to this prior work, a variety of other approaches to a new cross-discipline of DA began to develop in most of the humanities and social sciences concurrently with, and related to, other disciplines, such as [[semiotics]], [[psycholinguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]], and [[pragmatics]]. Many of these approaches, especially those influenced by the social sciences, favor a more dynamic study of oral talk-in-interaction. An example is  "conversational analysis", which was influenced by the Sociologist Harold Garfinkel, the founder of [[Ethnomethodology]].

In Europe, [[Michel Foucault]] became one of the key theorists of the subject, especially of discourse, and wrote [[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]. In this context, the term 'discourse' no longer refers to formal linguistic aspects, but to institutionalized patterns of knowledge that become manifest in disciplinary structures and operate by the connection of knowledge and power. Since the 1970s, Foucault's works have had an increasing impact especially on discourse analysis in the social sciences. Thus, in modern European social sciences, one can find a wide range of different approaches working with Foucault's definition of discourse and his theoretical concepts. Apart from the original context in France, there is, at least since 2005, a broad discussion on socio-scientific discourse analysis in Germany. Here, for example, the [[sociologist]] [[Reiner Keller]] developed his widely recognized '[[Sociology of Knowledge Approach to Discourse (SKAD)]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Reiner (2011): [https://link.springer.com/10.1007%2Fs10746-011-9175-z?LI=true&amp;from=SL The Sociology of Knowledge Approach to Discourse] (SKAD), in: Human Studies 34 (1), 43–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[sociology of knowledge]] by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], Keller argues, that our sense of reality in everyday life and thus the meaning of every object, actions and events are the product of a permanent, routinized interaction. In this context, SKAD has been developed as a scientific perspective that is able to understand the processes of '[[The Social Construction of Reality]]' on all levels of social life by combining Michel Foucault's theories of discourse and power with the theory of knowledge by Berger/Luckmann. Whereas the latter primarily focus on the constitution and stabilisation of knowledge on the level of interaction, Foucault's perspective concentrates on institutional contexts of the production and integration of knowledge, where the subject mainly appears to be determined by knowledge and power. Therefore, the 'Sociology of Knowledge Approach to Discourse' can also be seen as an approach to deal with the vividly discussed [[micro–macro problem]] in sociology.{{Citation needed |date=November 2018}}

==Perspectives==
The following are some of the specific theoretical perspectives and analytical approaches used in linguistic discourse analysis:

*[[Applied linguistics]], an interdisciplinary perspective on linguistic analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What is applied linguistics?|journal = International Journal of Applied Linguistics|date = 1993-06-01 |issn = 1473-4192 |pages = 17–32|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1473-4192.1993.tb00041.x |first = Carl |last = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aron K.

*[[Cognitive psychology]], studying the production and comprehension of discourse.
*[[Conversation analysis]]
*[[Critical discourse analysis]]
*[[Discursive psychology]]
*[[Emergent grammar]]
*[[Ethnography |Ethnography of communication]]
*[[Functional theories of grammar|Functional grammar]]
*[[Interactional sociolinguistics]]
*[[Mediated Stylistics]]
*[[Pragmatics]]
*[[Response based therapy]] (counselling)
*[[Rhetoric]]
*[[Stylistics (linguistics)]]
*[[Sublanguage]] analysis
*[[Tagmemics]]
*[[Text linguistics]]
*[[Variation analysis]]

Although these approaches emphasize different aspects of language use, they all view language as social interaction and are concerned with the social contexts in which discourse is embedded.

Often a distinction is made between 'local' structures of discourse (such as relations among sentences, propositions, and turns) and 'global' structures, such as overall topics and the schematic organization of discourses and conversations. For instance, many types of discourse begin with some kind of global 'summary', in titles, headlines, leads, abstracts, and so on.

A problem for the discourse analyst is to decide when a particular feature is relevant to the specification is required. A question many linguists ask is: "Are there general principles which will determine the relevance or nature of the specification?"{{Citation needed |date=November 2018}}

'''Ecodesign''' is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle.  In a [[life cycle assessment]], the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.

Ecodesign is a growing responsibility and understanding of our [[ecological footprint]] on the planet. Green awareness, [[overpopulation]], [[industrialization]] and an increased environmental population have led to the questioning of consumer values. It is imperative to search for new building solutions that are [[environmentally friendly]] and lead to a reduction in the consumption of materials and [[energy consumption|energy]].

==Overview==
[[File:Stainless Steel Talbe with FSC Eucalyptus wood Ecodesign.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Stainless steel]] table with [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] Teca wood - [[Brazil]] ecodesign]]
As the whole product's life cycle should be regarded in an integrated perspective, representatives from advance development, design, production, marketing, purchasing, and project management should work together on the Ecodesign of a further developed or new product.  Together, they have the best chance to predict the holistic effects of changes of the product and their environmental impact.

An eco-design product has a [[cradle-to-cradle]] life cycle ensuring zero waste is created in the whole process. By mimicking life cycles in nature, eco-design is a fundamental concept in achieving a truly [[circular economy]].

Environmental aspects which ought to be analysed for every stage of the life cycle are:

* Consumption of resources (energy, materials, water or land area)
* Emissions to air, water, and the ground (our Earth) as being relevant for the environment and human health
* Miscellaneous (e.g. noise and vibration)

Waste (hazardous waste and other waste defined in environmental legislation) is only an intermediate step and the final emissions to the environment (e.g. methane and leaching from landfills) are inventoried. All consumables, materials and parts used in the life cycle phases are accounted for, and all indirect environmental aspects linked to their production.

The environmental aspects of the phases of the life cycle are evaluated according to their environmental impact on the basis of a number of parameters, such as extent of environmental impact, potential for improvement, or potential of change.

According to this ranking the recommended changes are carried out and reviewed after a certain time.

==Environmental effect analysis==
[[File:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Interior design|decoration]] [[fair]]. The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among [[designers]] in [[Brazil]].]]

One instrument to identify the factors that are important for the reduction of the environmental impact during all lifecycle stages is the environmental effect analysis (EEA).

For an EEA the following are taken into account:

* Customers' wishes
* Legal requirements, market requirements (competitors)
* Data concerning the product and the manufacturing process

==Applications in design==
Ecodesign concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design; the impact of [[global warming]] and an increase in CO₂ emissions have led companies to consider a more environmentally conscious approach to their design thinking and process.
In building design and construction, designers are taking on the concept of Ecodesign throughout the design process, from the choice of materials to the type of energy that is being consumed and the disposal of waste.

With respect to these concepts, [[online]] platforms dealing in only Ecodesign products are emerging, with the additional sustainable purpose of eliminating all unnecessary distribution steps between the designer and the final customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nupe.co.uk/an-interview-with-sustainable-design-company-moorbi/ Kamran Assadi for Nupè April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoMaterials''', such as the use of local raw materials, are less costly and reduce the environmental costs of shipping, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions generated from transportation. Certified green building materials, such as wood from sustainably managed forest plantations, with accreditations from companies such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), or the Pan-European Forest Certification Council (PEFCC), can be used.

Several other types of components and materials can be used in sustainable buildings. Recyclable and recycled materials are commonly used in construction, but it is important that they don’t generate any waste during manufacture or after their life cycle ends. Reclaimed materials such as timber at a construction site or junkyard can be given a second life by reusing them as support beams in a new building or as furniture. Stones from an excavation can be used in a retaining wall. The reuse of these items means that less energy is consumed in making new products and a new natural aesthetic quality is achieved.

'''[[Water recycling]]''' systems such as rainwater tanks that harvest water for multiple purposes. Reusing [[grey water]] generated by households are a useful way of not wasting drinking water.

'''Off-grid homes''' only use clean electric power. They are completely separated and disconnected from the conventional electricity grid and receive their power supply by harnessing active or passive energy systems.

==Active system==
These systems use the principle of harnessing the power generated from renewable and inexhaustible sources of energy, for example; solar, wind, thermal, biomass, and geothermal energy.

'''[[Solar power]]''' is a widely known and used renewable energy source. An increase in technology has allowed solar power to be used in a wide variety of applications. Two types of solar panels generate heat into electricity. Thermal solar panels reduce or eliminate the consumption of gas and diesel, and reduce CO₂ emissions. Photovoltaic panels convert solar radiation into an electric current which can power any appliance. However, this is a more complex technology and is generally more expensive to manufacture than thermal panels.

'''[[Biomass]]''' is the energy source created from organic materials generated through a forced or spontaneous biological process.

'''[[Geothermal energy]]''' is obtained by harnessing heat from the ground. This type of energy can be used to heat and cool homes. It eliminates dependence on external energy and generates minimum waste. It is also hidden from view as it is placed underground, making it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to incorporate in a design.

'''Wind turbines''' are a useful application for areas without immediate conventional power sources, e.g., rural areas with schools and hospitals that need more power. Wind turbines can provide up to 30% of the energy consumed by a household but they are subject to regulations and technical specifications, such as the maximum distance at which the facility is located from the place of consumption and the power required and permitted for each property.

==Passive systems==
Buildings that integrate passive energy systems ([[bioclimatic buildings]]) are heated using non-mechanical methods, thereby optimizing natural resources. The use of optimal daylight plays an integral role in passive energy systems. This involves the positioning and location of a building to allow and make use of sunlight throughout the whole year. By using the sun's rays, thermal mass is stored into the building materials such as concrete and can generate enough heat for a room.

A '''[[green roof]]''' is a roof partially or completely covered with plants or other vegetation. This creates insulation that helps regulate the building's temperature. It also retains water, providing a water recycling system. It also provides soundproofing.

==In art and decorating==
Recycling has been used in art since the early part of the 20th century, when cubist artist [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973) and [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963) created collages from newsprints, packaging and other found materials. The "Outside Art" movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form, and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them.  The same principle can be used inside the home, where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon.

There is a huge demand in Western countries to decorate homes in a "green" style. A lot of effort is placed into recycled product design and the creation of a natural look. This ideal is also a part of developing countries, although their use of recycled and natural products is often based in necessity and wanting to get maximum use out of materials.

'''Energy economics''' is a broad [[science|scientific]] subject area which includes topics related to [[energy supply|supply]] and [[energy demand|use]] of [[energy]] in [[society|societies]].&lt;ref&gt;Sickles, Robin (2008). "energy economics." ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000082&amp;q=energy%20&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to diversity of issues and methods applied and shared with a number of [[academic discipline]]s, energy economics does not present itself as a self-contained academic discipline, but it is an applied subdiscipline of [[economics]]. From the list of [[Scientific discipline#Economics|main topics of economics]], some relate strongly to energy economics:
* [[Computable general equilibrium]]
* [[Econometrics]]
* [[Environmental economics]]
* [[Finance]]
* [[Industrial organization]]
* [[Input–output model]]
* [[Microeconomics]]
* [[Macroeconomics]]
* [[Operations research]]
* [[Resource economics]]
Energy economics also draws heavily on results of energy [[engineering]], [[geology]], [[political sciences]], [[ecology]] etc. Recent focus of energy economics includes the following issues:
* [[Climate change]] and [[climate policy]]
* [[Demand response]]
* [[Elasticity (economics)|Elasticity]] of [[supply and demand]] in [[energy market]]
* Energy and [[economic growth]]
* [[Energy derivative]]s
* [[Energy elasticity]]
* [[Energy forecasting]]
* [[Energy market]]s and [[electricity market]]s  - [[liberalisation]], (de- or re-) [[regulation]]
* Economics of [[energy infrastructure]]

Some institutions of higher education ([[universities]]) recognise energy economics as a viable career opportunity, offering this as a [[curriculum]]. The [[University of Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit| Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]] are the top three research universities, and [[Resources for the Future]] the top research institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.ene.html IDEAS/RePEc]&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous other research departments, companies and professionals offering energy economics studies and consultations.

==History==
[[File:World energy prices 1991-2010.png|thumb|World prices for energy, 1991-2010. 2000=100.]]
Energy related issues have been actively present in economic literature since the [[1973 oil crisis]], but have their roots much further back in the history. As early as 1865, [[William Stanley Jevons|W.S. Jevons]] expressed his concern about the eventual depletion of coal resources in his book ''The Coal Question''. One of the best known early attempts to work on the economics of exhaustible resources (incl. fossil fuel) was made by [[Harold Hotelling|H. Hotelling]], who derived a price path for [[non-renewable resources]], known as [[Hotelling's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hotelling |first=H. |title=The Economics of Exhaustible Resources |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=39 |issue=2 |year=1931 |pages=137–175 |jstor=1822328 |doi=10.1086/254195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estate satire''' is a genre of writing from 14th Century, [[Medieval literature|Medieval literary]] works. The three Medieval estates were the Clergy (those who prayed), the [[Nobility]] (those who fought) and lastly the [[Peasantry]] (those who labored). These estates were the major [[social classes]] of the time and were typically gender specific to men, although the clergy also included nuns. Nevertheless, women were considered as a separate class in themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Jill. ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; the best-known example being [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[The Wife of Bath's Tale|Wife of Bath]]. Estates satire praised the glories and purity of each class in its ideal form, but was also used as a window to show how society had gotten out of hand. The ''Norton Anthology of [[English Literature]]'' describes the duty of estates satire: "They set forth the functions and duties of each estate and castigate the failure of the estates in the present world to live up to their divinely assigned social roles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estates Satire|work=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/middleages/topic_1/satire.htm|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|accessdate = 25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Estate, the Church, consisted of those who ran the Catholic church and part of the country. They were the recipients of the ''[[tithe]]'' or the 10% tax given to the Church.

The Second Estate, the Nobility, were royalty, not including the King. They were never taxed but could collect taxes from the Third Estate, and had other special privileges.

The Third Estate, the Commons, is the largest, consisting of around 96% of the population (UCL). The commons included everyone who did not belong to the first two estates, primarily rural [[peasants]] and the urban [[bourgeois]] or middle class. They had none of the privileges or luxuries that the first two estates enjoyed, although the [[History of capitalism|rise of capitalism]] in the late 14th Century resulted in the bourgeois having relatively more power.

Among 14th-century English authors, [[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and Chaucer were three of the most prominent writers of the time to include estates satire in their works. Although Gower was more aggressive in his approach, Chaucer was more subtle and more successful, making himself to be the fool of the joke and subverting may of the conventions of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Medieval authors used estates satire to express their disgust towards the hypocrisy of the three estates and their supposed virtuous ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">'''Ethnoornithology''' (also ethno-ornithology) is the study of the relationship between [[person|people]] and [[birds]] (from "[[Ethnology|ethno-]]" - relating to people and culture - and "[[ornithology]]" - the study of birds). It is a branch of [[ethnozoology]] and so of the wider field of [[ethnobiology]]. Ethnoornithology is an interdisciplinary subject and combines [[anthropology|anthropological]], [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] perspectives with [[natural science|natural scientific]] approaches to the description and interpretation of people's knowledge and use of birds. Like [[ethnomethodology|ethnoscience]] and other cognate terms, "ethnoornithology" is sometimes used narrowly to refer to people's practice rather than the study of that practice. The broader focus is on how birds are perceived, used and managed in [[human]] [[society|societies]], including their use for [[food]], [[medicine]] and personal [[beauty|adornment]], as well as their use in [[divination]] and [[ritual]]. Applied ethnoornithological research is also starting to play an increasingly important role in the development of [[conservation biology|conservation]] initiatives.

== History of ethnoornithology ==
The work of [[Ralph Bulmer]] in [[New Guinea]], culminating in his collaboration with Ian Saem Majnep in writing ''Birds of My Kalam Country'' (1977), set a new standard for ethnoornithological research, and this book has deservedly become a classic of modern ethnoornithology.

== Ethnoornithology and conservation ==
Like other branches of ethnozoology, ethnoornithology has been long undervalued as a resource for [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/biodiversity-and-linguistic-diversity/ conservation], though this is now beginning to change. Mark Bonta's ''Seven Names for the Bellbird'' (2003), which highlights the importance of local traditions and practices relating to birds for the future of biodiversity conservation in Honduras, and Ricardo Rozzi´s ''Multi-ethnic Bird Guide of the Subantarctic Forests of South America'' (2003), which focuses on the integration of traditional ornithological knowledge and environmental ethics in southern Chile, provide good examples of this trend. Soma (2015) pointed out that ethnoornithological knowledge of falconers contribute to conservation for local avifauna (especially focusing on Kazakh eagle masters). This realisation is the basis for founding the [http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/egi/research-at-the-egi/ethno-ornithology-world-archive-ewa/ Ethno-ornithology World Archive (EWA)], a collaborative project between Oxford University (linking the Department of Zoology and School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography) and [[BirdLife International]].

== Professional associations ==
The [http://ethnobiology.org Society of Ethnobiology], which publishes the ''Journal of Ethnobiology'', provides a general forum for ethnobiological - including ethnoornthological - research. In January 2006 the [http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/ethnoornithology/ Ethnoornithology Research &amp; Study Group (ERSG)] was established "to provide a clearinghouse, information source and discussion point for people interested in the study of, research about and application of indigenous bird knowledge".

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}
'''"Only one eye for one eye"'''{{Sfn | Plaut | 1945 | pp = 571ff}}, also known as '''"An eye for an eye"''' or '''"A tooth for a tooth"''', or the '''law of retaliation''', is the principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree, and the person inflicting such punishment should be the injured party. In softer interpretations, it means the victim receives the [estimated] value of the injury in compensation.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | p = 572}} The intent behind the principle was to ''restrict'' compensation to the value of the loss.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}

The principle is sometimes referred using the Latin term '''''lex talionis''''' or '''the law of talion'''. The English word talion (from the [[Latin]]'' [[wikt:talio#Noun 3|talio]]''{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}) means a retaliation authorized by law, in which the punishment corresponds in kind and degree to the injury.

==Definition and methods==
The term '''''lex talionis''''' does not always and only refer to literal eye-for-an-eye codes of justice (see rather [[mirror punishment]]) but applies to the broader class of legal systems that specify formulate penalties for specific crimes, which are thought to be fitting in their severity. Some propose that this was at least in part intended to prevent excessive punishment at the hands of either an avenging private party or the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Douglas A | last1 = Knight | first2 = Amy-Jill | last2 = Levine | year = 2011 | title = The Meaning of the Bible| publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn= 978-0-06-112175-3 |page = 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common expression of lex talionis is "an eye for an eye", but other interpretations have been given as well. Legal codes following the principle of ''lex talionis'' have one thing in common: prescribed 'fitting' counter punishment for a [[felony]]. In the famous legal [[Code of Hammurabi|code]] written by [[Hammurabi]], the principle of exact reciprocity is very clearly used. For example, if a person caused the death of another person, the killer would be put to death.{{Sfn | Hammurabi | 1780 BC | loc = §230}}

The simplest example is the "eye for an eye" principle.  In that case, the rule was that punishment must be exactly equal to the crime. Conversely, the twelve tables of Rome merely prescribed particular penalties for particular crimes. The Anglo-Saxon legal code substituted payment of [[wergild]] for direct retribution: a particular person's life had a fixed value, derived from his social position; any homicide was compensated by paying the appropriate wergild, regardless of intent. Under the British Common Law, successful plaintiffs were entitled to repayment equal to their loss (in monetary terms). In the modern [[tort]] law system, this has been extended to translate non-economic losses into money as well.  The meaning of the principle Eye for an Eye is that a person who has been injured by another person returns the offending action to the originator in compensation, or that an authority does so on behalf of the injured person. The exact Latin (lex talionis) to English translation of this phrase is "The law of retaliation." The root principle of this law is to provide equitable retribution.

==Antecedents==
Various ideas regarding the origins of ''lex talionis'' exist, but a common one is that it developed as early civilizations grew and a less well-established system for retribution of wrongs, [[feud]]s and [[Feud|vendettas]], threatened the social fabric. Despite having been replaced with newer modes of legal theory, ''lex talionis'' systems served a critical purpose in the development of social systems—the establishment of a body whose purpose was to enact the retaliation and ensure that this was the only punishment. This body was the state in one of its earliest forms.

The principle is found in [[Babylonian Law]].{{Sfn | Hammurabi | 1780 BC}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bond |first=Kenneth |year=1998 |quote=...Code of Hammurabi (1780 BC).  I used a translation by LW King with Commentary by Charles F. Horne (1915). My version was a 1996 electronically enhanced version of the 1910 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. |url=http://www.humboldt.edu/~kmb2/paper.html |title=Religious Beliefs as a Basis for Ethical Decision Making in the Workplace |publisher=[[Humboldt State University]] |accessdate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703102021/http://www.humboldt.edu/~kmb2/paper.html |archivedate=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If it is surmised that in societies not bound by the rule of law, if a person was hurt, then the injured person (or their relative) would take [[revenge|vengeful]] retribution on the person who caused the injury. The retribution might be worse than the crime, perhaps even death. Babylonian law put a limit on such actions, restricting the retribution to be no worse than the crime, as long as victim and offender occupied the same status in society.  As with [[blasphemy]] or [[lèse-majesté]] (crimes against a god or a monarch), crimes against one's social betters were punished more severely.

[[Roman law]] moved toward monetary compensation as a substitute for vengeance.  In cases of assault, fixed penalties were set for various injuries, although ''talio'' was still permitted if one person broke another's limb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507759/Roman-law/41328/Delict-and-contract#ref469137 | contribution = Roman law: Delict and contract | title = Encyclopædia Britannica}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
The principle was first referenced in the [[Code of Hammurabi]], which predates the Hebrew bible.  In the Hebrew Law, the "eye for eye" was to ''restrict'' compensation to the value of the loss. Thus, it might be better read 'only one eye for one eye'.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}  The idiomatic biblical phrase "an eye for an eye" in Exodus and Leviticus ({{Hebrew|עין תחת עין}}, ayin tachat ayin) literally means 'an eye under/(in place of) an eye' while a slightly different phrase (עַיִן בְּעַיִן שֵׁן בְּשֵׁן, literally  "eye for an eye; tooth for a tooth") is used in another passage (Deuteronomy) in the context of possible reciprocal court sentences for failed false witnesses.&lt;ref name=lev24&gt;{{bibleverse ||Lv|24:19–21|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ex21&gt;{{bibleverse ||Ex|21:22–25|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = deut19&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:16-21|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage in [[Leviticus]] states, "And a man who injures his countryman{{snd}}as he has done, so it shall be done to him [namely,] fracture under/for fracture, eye under/for eye, tooth under/for tooth. Just as another person has received injury from him, so it will be given to him." (Lev. 24:19–21)&lt;ref name="lev24" /&gt;. For an example of {{Hebrew|תחת}} being used in its regular sense of ''under'', see Lev. 22:27 "A bull, sheep or goat, when it is born shall remain under its mother, and from the eighth day..."

===Judaism===
Isaac Kalimi explains that the "lex talionis was humanized by the Rabbis who interpreted "an eye for an eye" to mean reasonable pecuniary compensation. As in the case of the Babylonian 'lex talionis', ethical Judaism and humane Jewish jurisprudence replaces the ''[[peshat]]'' (literal meaning) of the written Torah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Biblical interpretation in Judaism and Christianity |first1= Isaac |last1= Kalimi | first2= Peter J | last2 = Haas | author2-link = Peter Haas (rabbi) | publisher = Continuum | year = 2006 | page = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h6bSc6ksh0YC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Judaism+%22lex+talionis%22&amp;ei=daYBTeziHZKesQPx-_HjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20%22lex%20talionis%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasachoff and Littman point to the reinterpretation of the lex talionis as an example of the ability of Pharisaic Judaism to "adapt to changing social and intellectual ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A concise history of the Jewish people | first1 = Naomi E | last1 = Pasachoff | first2 = Robert J | last2 = Littman | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | year = 2005 | page = 64 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z4eaj09hscAC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Judaism+%22lex+talionis%22&amp;ei=pKoBTe_WDJO8sQPN1aD7CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20%22lex%20talionis%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Talmud====
The [[Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Nezikin|Bava Kamma]] | at = 83b–84a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; interprets the verses referring to "an eye for an eye" and similar expressions as mandating monetary compensation in [[tort]] cases and argues against the interpretations by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind, using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders. Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted in this manner.
{{Quote | The Oral Law explains, based upon the biblical verses, that the Bible mandates a sophisticated five-part monetary form of compensation, consisting of payment for "Damages, Pain, Medical Expenses, Incapacitation, and Mental Anguish" — which underlies many modern legal codes. Some rabbinic literature explains, moreover, that the expression, "An eye for an eye, etc." suggests that the perpetrator deserves to lose his own eye, but that biblical law treats him leniently. − Paraphrased from the [[Union of Orthodox Congregations]].&lt;ref name = "OU"&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/torah.htm | contribution = Torah | publisher = ou.org | title = About Judaism}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the Torah also discusses a form of direct reciprocal justice, where the phrase ''ayin tachat ayin'' makes another appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:16–21|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the Torah discusses false witnesses who conspire to testify against another person. The Torah requires the court to "do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother".&lt;ref name="bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP"&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the fulfillment of certain technical criteria (such as the sentencing of the accused whose punishment was not yet executed), wherever it is possible to punish the conspirators with exactly the same punishment through which they had planned to harm their fellow, the court carries out this direct reciprocal justice (including when the punishment constitutes the death penalty). Otherwise, the offenders receive lashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Nezikin|Makot]] | at = 1:1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Bab. Talmud | at = 2a}}, based on critical [[exegesis]] of {{bibleverse ||Dt|25:1–3|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there is no form of punishment in the Torah that calls for the maiming of an offender (punitary amputation) there is no case where a conspiratorial false witness could possibly be punished by the court injuring to his eye, tooth, hand, or foot.  There is one case where the Torah states "…and you shall cut off her hand…"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|25:11–12|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sages of the Talmud understood the literal meaning of this verse as referring to a case where the woman is attacking a man in potentially lethal manner.  This verse teaches that, although one must intervene to save the victim, one may not kill a lethal attacker if it is possible to neutralize that attacker through non-lethal injury.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sifrei]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = [[Maimonides]] | title = Yad}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Nezikin | last = Hillel | contribution = Rotze'ach u'Sh'mirat Nefesh | at = 1:7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, there is no verse that even appears to mandate injury to the eye, tooth, or foot.

{{bibleverse ||Numbers|35:9–30|JP}} discusses the only form of remotely reciprocal justice not carried out directly by the court, where, under very limited circumstances, someone found guilty of negligent manslaughter may be killed by a relative of the deceased who takes on the role of "redeemer of blood". In such cases, the court requires the guilty party to flee to a designated city of refuge. While the guilty party is there, the "redeemer of blood" may not kill him.  If, however, the guilty party illegally forgoes his exile, the "redeemer of blood", as an accessory of the court, may kill the guilty party. Nevertheless, the provision of the "redeemer of blood" does not serve as true reciprocal justice, because the redeemer only acts to penalize a negligent killer who forgoes his exile. Furthermore, intentional killing does not parallel negligent killing and thus cannot serve directly as a reciprocal punishment for manslaughter, but as a penalty for escaping punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Makot | at = 7a–13a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to traditional Jewish Law, application of these laws requires the presence and maintenance of the biblically designated cities of refuge, as well as a conviction in an eligible court of 23 judges as delineated by the Torah and Talmud.  The latter condition is also applicable for any capital punishment. These circumstances have not existed for approximately 2,000 years.

====Objective of reciprocal justice in Judaism====
The Talmud discusses the concept of justice as measure-for-measure retribution (''middah k'neged middah'') in the context of divinely implemented justice. Regarding reciprocal justice by court, however, the Torah states that punishments serve to remove dangerous elements from society ("…and you shall eliminate the evil from your midst"&lt;ref name="bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP"/&gt;) and to deter potential criminals from violating the law ("And the rest shall hear and be daunted, and they shall no longer commit anything like this evil deed in your midst"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:20|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). Additionally, reciprocal justice in tort cases serves to compensate the victim (see above).

The ideal of vengeance for the sake of assuaging the distress of the victim plays no role in the Torah's conception of court justice, as victims are cautioned against even hating or bearing a grudge against those who have harmed them. The Torah makes no distinction between whether the potential object of hatred or a grudge has been brought to justice, and all people are taught to love their fellow Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Lv|19:17–18|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social hierarchy and reciprocal justice====
In Exodus 21, as in the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the concept of reciprocal justice seemingly applies to social equals; the statement of reciprocal justice "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Ex|21:23–25|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is followed by an example of a different law: if a slave-owner blinds the eye or knocks out the tooth of a slave, the slave is freed but the owner pays no other consequence. On the other hand, the slave would probably be put to death for the injury of the eye of the slave-owner.&lt;ref name = "Coogan"&gt;{{cite book| last = Coogan | first = Michael D | authorlink = Michael Coogan | title = A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| location = New York| year = 2009| page = 112 | isbn = 978-0-19-533272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the reciprocal justice applies across social boundaries: the "eye for eye" principle is directly followed by the proclamation "You are to have one law for the alien and the citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse ||Lv|24:19–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This shows a much more meaningful principle for social justice, in that the marginalized in society were given the same rights under the social structure. In this context, the reciprocal justice in an ideal functioning setting, according to Michael Coogan,{{who|date=February 2015}} "to prevent people from taking the law into their own hands and exacting disproportionate vengeance for offenses committed against them."&lt;ref name = "Coogan" /&gt;

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]], [[Jesus]] urges his followers to [[turn the other cheek]]:

Some interpret this as an admonition not to seek legal steps for any compensation that corresponds in kind and degree to the injury.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | p = 572}} Others interpret it as Jesus simply teaching his followers not to take personal vengeance, rather than commenting on any legal practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Righteous Personal Conduct Interpretation of Turning the Other Cheek|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_the_other_cheek#Righteous_personal_conduct_interpretation|website=Wikepedia|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

[[Christian]] interpretation of the Biblical passage has been heavily influenced by the [[Church father]] [[Augustine of Hippo]].

But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy.  But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment." Muslim countries that use Islamic ''[[Sharia]]'' law, such as [[Iran]] or Saudi Arabia, apply the "eye for an eye" rule literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7754756.stm | title = Court orders Iranian man blinded | publisher = BBC | date = 28 November 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/14/acid-blinding-postponed-iran-outcry | title = Acid blinding sentence postponed by Iran after international outcry | newspaper = The Guardian | place = UK | date = 14 May 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerontology'''  is the study of the [[social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[Psychology|psychological]], [[cognitive]], and [[Biology|biological]] aspects of [[ageing]]. The word was coined by [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]] in 1903, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:γέρων|γέρων]], ''geron'', "old man" and -λογία, ''-logia'', "study of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aghe.org/resources/gerontology-geriatrics-descriptions|title=Gerontology/Geriatrics Definitions|last=Confluence|website=www.aghe.org|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is distinguished from [[geriatrics]], which is the branch of medicine that specializes in the treatment of existing disease in older adults. Gerontologists include researchers and practitioners in the fields of biology, nursing, medicine, criminology, dentistry, social work, physical and occupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, economics, political science, architecture, geography, pharmacy, public health, housing, and anthropology.&lt;ref name=Hooyman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hooyman |first1=N.R. |last2=Kiyak |first2=H.A. |title=Social gerontology: A multidisciplinary perspective |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston |year=2011 |isbn=978-0205763139 |edition=9th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multidisciplinary nature of gerontology means that there are a number of sub-fields which overlap with gerontology. There are policy issues, for example, involved in government planning and the operation of nursing homes, investigating the effects of an [[Population ageing|ageing population]] on society, and the design of residential spaces for older people that facilitate the development of a sense of place or home. Dr. Lawton, a behavioral psychologist at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, was among the first to recognize the need for living spaces designed to accommodate the elderly, especially those with Alzheimer's disease. As an academic discipline the field is relatively new. The USC Leonard Davis School created the first PhD, master's and bachelor's degree programs in gerontology in 1975.

==History==
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], several physicians wrote on issues related to Gerontology. [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1025) offered instruction for the care of the aged, including [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and remedies for problems including [[constipation]].&lt;ref name=Howell87&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=Trevor H.|title=Avicenna and His Regimen of Old Age|journal=Age and Ageing|year=1987|volume=16|pages=58–59|doi=10.1093/ageing/16.1.58|pmid=3551552|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic physician [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]] Al-Qayrawani (Algizar, c. 898–980) wrote on the aches and conditions of the elderly (Ammar 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ammar |first1= S |year= 1998 |title= Vesalius |journal= Official Journal of the International Society for the History of Medicine |volume= 4 |page= 48 |url= http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/ishm/vesalius/VESx1998x04x01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarly work covers [[sleep disorder]]s, [[Forgetting|forgetfulness]], how to strengthen [[memory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/bioI.html#jazzar |title=Ibn al-Jazzār, Abū Ja'far Ahmad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Abī Khālid (d. 979/369) |work=Islamic Medical Manuscripts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Geritt Bos, ''Ibn al-Jazzar'', ''Risala fi l-isyan'' (Treatise on forgetfulness), London, 1995 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and causes of [[Death|mortality]]&lt;ref name="Al Jazzar"&gt;[http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm Al Jazzar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706155736/http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ishaq ibn Hunayn]] (died 910) also wrote works on the treatments for forgetfulness (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_08.html |title=Specialized literature |work=Islamic culture and medical arts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of aged humans, and the [[life expectancy]], tended to increase in every century since the 14th, society tended to consider caring for an elderly relative as a family issue. It was not until the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] that ideas shifted in favor of a societal care-system. Some early pioneers, such as [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], who himself lived to be 102, believed that aging itself should be a science to be studied. [[Élie Metchnikoff]] coined the term "gerontology" {{circa}} 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gerontology Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern pioneers like [[James Birren]] began organizing gerontology as its own field in the 1940s, later being involved in starting a US government agency on aging &amp;ndash; the [[National Institute on Aging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the National Institute on Aging|url=https://www.nia.nih.gov/about|publisher=National Institute on Aging, US National Institutes of Health|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; programs in gerontology at the [[University of Southern California]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and as past president of the [[Gerontological Society of America]] (founded in 1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newcomb|first1=Beth|title=In memoriam: James E.

With the population of people over 60 years old expected to be some 22% of the world's population by 2050, assessment and treatment methods for age-related disease burden &amp;ndash; the term ''geroscience'' emerged in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4036419|year=2014|author1=Burch|first1=J.

==Aging demographics==
The world is forecast to undergo rapid [[aging population|population aging]] in the next several decades.  In 1900, there were 3.1 million people aged 65 years and older living in the [[United States]].  However, this population continued to grow throughout the 20th century and reached 31.2, 35, and 40.3 million people in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively.  Notably, in the United States and across the world, the [[Baby boomers|"baby boomer"]] generation began to turn 65 in 2011.  Recently, the population aged 65 years and older has grown at a faster rate than the total population in the United States.  The total population increased by 9.7%, from 281.4 million to 308.7 million, between 2000 and 2010.  However, the population aged 65 years and older increased by 15.1% during the same period.&lt;ref name="census.gov"&gt;{{cite web |author=Carrie A.

With the rapid growth of the aging population, social work education and training specialized in older adults and practitioners interested in working with older adults are increasingly in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Institute for Geriatric Social Work |publisher=Boston University |url=http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711073154/http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geriatric Social Work Initiative |url=http://www.gswi.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences with age ===

There has been a considerable disparity between the number of men and women in the older population in the United States.  In both 2000 and 2010, women outnumbered men in the older population at every single year of age (e.g., 65 to 100 years and over).  The [[sex ratio]], which is a measure used to indicate the balance of males to females in a population, is calculated by taking the number of males divided by the number of females, and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the sex ratio is the number of males per 100 females.  In 2010, there were 90.5 males per 100 females in the 65-year-old population.  However, this represented an increase from 1990 when there were 82.7 males per 100 females, and from 2000 when the sex ratio was 88.1. Although the gender gap between men and women has narrowed, women continue to have a greater life expectancy and lower mortality rates at older ages relative to men. For example, the [[2010 United States Census|Census 2010]] reported that there were approximately twice as many women as men living in the United States at 89 years of age (361,309 versus 176,689, respectively).&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

=== Geographic distribution of older adults ===
The number and percentage of older adults living in the United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census.  In 2010, the South contained the greatest number of people aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older.  However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest percentage of adults aged 65 years and older (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the [[Census 2000]], all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010.  Likewise, in the population aged 85 years and older, the West (42.8%) also showed the fastest growth and increased from 806,000 in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2010. It is worth highlighting that [[Rhode Island]] was the only state that experienced a reduction in the number of people aged 65 years and older, and declined from 152,402 in 2000 to 151,881 in 2010.  Conversely, all states exhibited an increase in the population of adults aged 85 years and older from 2000 to 2010.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

== Biogerontology ==
[[File:Altenpflege 02.jpg|thumb|The hand of an older adult]]
{{Main|Theories of aging}}
Biogerontology is the sub-field of gerontology concerned with the [[Senescence|biological aging process]], its evolutionary origins, and potential means to intervene in the process. It involves interdisciplinary research on biological aging's causes, effects, and mechanisms.  Conservative biogerontologists such as [[Leonard Hayflick]] have predicted that the human life expectancy will peak at about 92 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watts G |title=Leonard Hayflick and the limits of ageing |journal=Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9783 |page=2075 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21684371 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60908-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(11)60908-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others such as [[James Vaupel]] have predicted that in industrialized countries, life expectancies will reach 100 for children born after the year 2000.&lt;ref name=Christensen2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christensen|first1=L|last2=Doblhammer|first2=K|last3=Rau|first3=G|last4=Vaupel|first4=JW|title=Ageing populations: the challenges ahead|journal=Lancet|date=2009|volume=374|issue=9696|pages=1196–1208|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)61460-4|pmid=19801098|pmc=2810516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some surveyed biogerontologists have predicted life expectancies of two or more centuries.&lt;ref name=Richel2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richel|first1=Theo|title=Will human life expectancy quadruple in the next hundred years? Sixty gerontologists say public debate on life extension is necessary|journal=J Anti-Aging Med|date=December 2003|volume=6|issue=4|pages=309–314|doi=10.1089/109454503323028902|pmid=15142432}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Aubrey de Grey]] offering the "tentative timeframe" that with adequate funding of research to develop interventions in aging such as [[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]], "we have a 50/50 chance of developing technology within about 25 to 30 years from now that will, under reasonable assumptions about the rate of subsequent improvements in that technology, allow us to stop people from dying of aging at any age", leading to life expectancies of 1,000 years.&lt;ref name=deGreyRae2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Grey|first1=Aubrey D. N. J.|last2=Rae|first2=Michael|authorlink1=Aubrey de Grey|title=Ending Aging|date=October 14, 2008|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=978-0312367077|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biomedical gerontology]], also known as experimental gerontology and [[life extension]], is a sub-discipline of biogerontology that endeavors to slow, prevent, and even reverse aging in both humans and animals. Most "[[Anti-aging movement|life extensionists]]" believe the human life span can be increased within the next century, if not sooner. Biogerontologists vary in the degree to which they focus on the study of the aging process as a means of mitigating the [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] or extending lifespan, although most agree that extension of lifespan will necessarily flow from reductions in age-related disease and frailty, although some argue that [[maximum life span]] cannot be altered or that it is undesirable to try. Geroscience is a recently formulated interdisciplinary field that embraces biomedical gerontology as the center of preventing [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] through science.&lt;ref name="Lithgow2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lithgow|first1=Gordon J.|authorlink1=Gordon J. Lithgow|title=Origins of Geroscience|journal=Public Policy &amp; Aging Report|date=1 September 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=10–11|doi=10.1093/ppar/23.4.10|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with biogerontology, which aims to prevent age-related disease by intervening in aging processes, geriatrics is a field of medicine that studies the treatment of existing disease in aging people.

There are numerous theories of aging, and no one theory has been accepted. There is a wide spectrum of the types of theories for the causes of aging with programmed theories on one extreme and error theories on the other. Regardless of the theory, a commonality is that as humans age, functions of the body decline.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |first1=Albert W. |last1=Taylor |first2=Michel J. |last2=Johnson |title=Physiology of Exercise and Healthy Aging |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGtzfxkFhwC |year=2008 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-0-7360-5838-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stochastic theories ===
Stochastic theories of aging is the suggestion that aging is caused by small changes in the body over time and the body's failure to restore the system and mend the damages to the body. The cells and tissues are eventually injured due to the damage gathered over time. This causes the diminishes in an organ's function related to age. The notion of accumulated damage was first introduced by Weisman as the "wear and tear" theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipsky|first1=Martin S.|last2=King|first2=Mitch|title=Biological theories of aging|journal=Disease-a-Month|date=2015|volume=61|issue=11|pages=460–466|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2015.09.005|pmid=26490576|url=http://www.diseaseamonth.com/article/S0011-5029(15)00146-7/abstract|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wear and tear theory====

Wear and tear theories of aging suggest that as an individual ages, body parts such as cells and organs wear out from continued use. Wearing of the body can be attributable to internal or external causes that eventually lead to an accumulation of [[Insult (medical)|insults]] which surpasses the capacity for repair. Due to these internal and external insults, cells lose their ability to regenerate, which ultimately leads to mechanical and chemical exhaustion. Some insults include chemicals in the air, food, or smoke. Other insults may be things such as viruses, trauma, free radicals, cross-linking, and high body temperature.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

==== Accumulation ====
Accumulation theories of aging suggest that aging is bodily decline that results from an accumulation of elements, whether introduced to the body from the environment or resulting from cell metabolism.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt; An example of an accumulation theory is the Free Radical Theory of Aging.

==== Free radical theory ====
[[Free radicals]] are reactive molecules produced by cellular and environmental processes, and can damage the elements of the cell such as the [[cell membrane]] and [[DNA]] and cause irreversible damage. The [[free-radical theory of aging]] proposes that this damage cumulatively degrades the biological function of cells and impacts the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boniewska-Bernacka|first=Ewa|date=2016|title=Selected Theories of Ageing|url=https://depot.ceon.pl/bitstream/handle/123456789/11286/Boniewska.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Higher School's Pulse|volume=10|pages=36–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that free radicals are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenn|first=Rebecca|author2=Gilbert, DL, Nye, SW, Dwyer, P, and Fenn WO|title=Oxygen poisoning and x-irradiation: a mechanism in common|journal=Science|date=7 May 1954|volume=119|issue=3097|pages=623–626|pmid=13156638|bibcode=1954Sci...119..623G|doi=10.1126/science.119.3097.623 |last3=Nye|first3=Sylvanus W.|last4=Dwyer|first4=Peter|last5=Fenn|first5=Wallace O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but came to prominence in 1956, when [[Denham Harman]] proposed the free-radical theory of aging and even demonstrated that free radical reactions contribute to the degradation of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harman|first=D|title=The aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=November 1981|volume=78|issue=11|pages=7124–7128|pmid=6947277 |pmc=349208|doi=10.1073/pnas.78.11.7124 |bibcode=1981PNAS...78.7124H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagen|first=Bruce N|author2=MK Shigenaga |author3=TM Hagen |title=Oxidants, antioxidants, and the degenerative diseases of aging |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |date=September 1993 |volume=90 |issue=17|pages=7915–7922 |pmid=8367443|pmc=47258|bibcode=1993PNAS...90.7915A|doi=10.1073/pnas.90.17.7915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckman|first=KB|author2=Ames BN|title=The free radial theory of aging matures|journal=Physiol Rev|date=April 1998|volume=78|issue=2|pages=547–581|pmid=9562038 |doi=10.1152/physrev.1998.78.2.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common as humans grow older and include diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.

==== DNA damage theory ====

DNA damage has been one of the many causes in diseases related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by [[Gioacchino Failla]] in 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Failla|first=G|title=The aging process and cancerogenesis|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=30 September 1958|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1124–1140|pmid=13583876|bibcode=1958NYASA..71.1124F|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1958.tb46828.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist [[Leó Szilárd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szilard|first=Leo|title=On the nature of the aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=January 1959|volume=45|issue=1|pages=30–45|pmid=16590351|pmc=222509|doi=10.1073/pnas.45.1.30|bibcode=1959PNAS...45...30S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has changed over the years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freitas|first=AA|author2=de Magalhaes, JP|title=A review and appraisal of the DNA damage theory of ageing|journal=Mutat Res|date=Jul–Oct 2011|volume=728|issue=1–2|pages=12–22|pmid=21600302|doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cross-linking theory====

The cross-linking theory proposes that [[advanced glycation end-product]]s (stable bonds formed by the binding of glucose to proteins) and other aberrant [[cross-links]] accumulating in aging tissues is the cause of aging. The crosslinking of proteins disables their biological functions. The hardening of the connective tissue, kidney diseases, and enlargement of the heart are connected to the cross-linking of proteins. [[Crosslinking of DNA]] can induce replication errors, and this leads to deformed cells and increases the risk of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Genetic ===
Genetic theories of aging propose that aging is programmed within each individual's genes. According to this theory, genes dictate cellular longevity. Programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]], is determined by a "biological clock" via genetic information in the nucleus of the cell. Genes responsible for apoptosis provide an explanation for cell death, but are less applicable to death of an entire organism. An increase in cellular apoptosis may correlate to aging, but is not a 'cause of death'. Environmental factors and genetic mutations can influence gene expression and accelerate aging. More recently epigenetics have been explored as a contributing factor. The [[Biological clock (aging)|epigenetic clock]], which objectively measures the biological age of cells and tissues, may become useful for testing different biological aging theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Horvath S |title=

=== General imbalance ===
General imbalance theories of aging suggest that body systems, such as the [[Endocrine system|endocrine]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], and immune systems, gradually decline and ultimately fail to function. The rate of failure varies system by system.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt;

====Immunological theory====

The immunological theory of aging suggests that the immune system weakens as an organism ages. This makes the organism unable to fight infections and less able to destroy old and [[Neoplasm|neoplastic cells]]. This leads to aging and will eventually lead to death. This theory of aging was developed by Ray Walford, an American gerontologist. According to Walford, incorrect immunological procedures are the cause of the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Social gerontology ==
Social gerontology is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in [[social work]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[demography]], [[public health]], or other [[social science]] disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.

Because issues of life span and life extension need numbers to quantify them, there is an overlap with [[demography]]. Those who study the demography of the human life span differ from those who study the social demographics of aging.

=== Social theories of aging ===
Several theories of aging are developed to observe the aging process of older adults in society as well as how these processes are interpreted by men and women as they age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson&gt;{{cite book |first1=C. |last1=Phillipson |first2=J. |last2=Baars |chapter=Ch. 4: Social theory and social ageing |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C&amp;pg=PA68 |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=J. |editor2-last=Peace |editor2-first=S. M. |editor3-last=Dittmann-Kohli |editor3-first=F. |editor4-last=Westerhof |editor4-first=G. |title=Ageing in Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C |year=2007 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-4129-0020-1 |pages=68–84 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Activity theory ====
[[Activity theory (aging)|Activity theory]] was developed and elaborated by Cavan, Havighurst, and Albrecht. According to this theory, older adults' self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Activity is preferable to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, [[post-industrial society]], which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a desire to do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.&lt;ref name="allnurses-breakroom.com"&gt;VickyRN. (August 2, '09). Theories of Aging (Part 3) - Sociological Theories. Retrieved Friday, April 20, 2012, from http://allnurses-breakroom.com/showthread.php?t=412760&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disengagement theory ====
[[Disengagement theory]] was developed by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose "ego-energy" and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Gradual withdrawal from society and relationships preserves social equilibrium and promotes self-reflection for elders who are freed from societal roles. It furnishes an orderly means for the transfer of knowledge, capital, and power from the older generation to the young. It makes it possible for society to continue functioning after valuable older members die.

==== Continuity theory ====
[[Continuity theory]] is an elusive concept. On one hand,
to exhibit continuity can mean to remain the same, to
be uniform, homogeneous, unchanging, even humdrum.
This static view of continuity is not very applicable
to human aging. On the other hand, a dynamic
view of continuity starts with the idea of a basic
structure which persists over time, but it allows for a
variety of changes to occur within the context provided
by the basic structure. The basic structure is
coherent: It has an orderly or logical relation of parts
that is recognizably unique and that allows us to
differentiate that structure from others. With the
introduction of the concept of time, ideas such as
direction, sequence, character development, and
story line enter into the concept of continuity as it is
applied to the evolution of a human being. In this
theory, a dynamic concept of continuity is developed
and applied to the issue of adaptation to normal
aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Blalock, H.M. |title=Conceptualization and measurement in the social sciences |publisher=Sage |location=Beverly Hills |year=1982 |isbn=978-0803918047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central premise of continuity theory is that, in
making adaptive choices, middle-aged and older
adults attempt to preserve and maintain existing internal
and external structures and that they prefer to
accomplish this objective by using continuity (i.e.,
applying familiar strategies in familiar arenas of life).
In middle and later life, adults are drawn by the
weight of past experience to use continuity as a
primary adaptive strategy for dealing with changes
associated with normal aging. To the extent that
change builds upon, and has links to, the person's
past, change is a part of continuity. As a result of both
their own perceptions and pressures from the social
environment, individuals who are adapting to normal
aging are both predisposed and motivated
toward inner psychological continuity as well as outward
continuity of social behavior and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hage, J. |title=Techniques and problems of theory construction in sociology |publisher=Wiley Interscience |location=New York |year=1972 |isbn=978-0471338604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuity theory views both internal and
external continuity as robust adaptive strategies that
are supported by both individual preference and
social sanctions. Continuity theory consists of general
adaptive principles that people who are normally 
aging could be expected to follow, explanations of
how these principles work, and a specification of
general areas of life in which these principles could
be expected to apply. Accordingly, continuity theory
has enormous potential as a general theory of
adaptation to individual aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Abraham |last=Kaplan |title=The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ks8wuZHSKs8C |year=1964 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0448-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age stratification theory ====
According to this theory, older adults born during different time periods form [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s that define "age strata". There are two differences among strata: chronological age and historical experience. This theory makes two arguments. 1. Age is a mechanism for regulating behavior and as a result determines access to positions of power. 2. Birth cohorts play an influential role in the process of social change.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

==== Life course theory ====
According to this theory, which stems from the Life Course Perspective (Bengston and Allen, 1993),&lt;ref name=life&gt;Life Course Theory-Historical Development, Key Principles and Concepts, Selected Research Applications:http://family.jrank.org/pages/1074/Life-Course-Theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; aging occurs from birth to death. Aging involves social, psychological, and biological processes. Additionally, aging experiences are shaped by cohort and period effects.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Also reflecting the life course focus,
consider the implications for how societies might function when age-based
norms vanish—a consequence of the deinstitutionalization of the life course—
and suggest that these implications pose new challenges for theorizing aging
and the life course in postindustrial societies. Dramatic reductions in mortality,
morbidity, and fertility over the past several decades have so shaken up the
organization of the life course and the nature of educational, work, family, and
leisure experiences that it is now possible for individuals to become old in new
ways. The configurations and content of other life stages are being altered as
well, especially for women. In consequence, theories of age and aging will need
to be reconceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rowe, J.W. |author2=Kahn, R.L. |title=Successful aging |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=978-0375400452 }}&lt;br&gt;Webster, N. (2003). Webster's new American dictionary. New York: HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cumulative advantage/disadvantage theory ====
According to this theory, which was developed beginning in the 1960s by Derek Price and Robert Merton and elaborated on by several researchers such as Dale Dannefer,&lt;ref name=Dennefer&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dannefer D |title=Cumulative advantage/disadvantage and the life course: cross-fertilizing age and social science theory |journal=J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=S327–37 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14614120 |doi=10.1093/geronb/58.6.S327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inequalities have a tendency to become more pronounced throughout the aging process. A paradigm of this theory can be expressed in the adage "[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]". Advantages and disadvantages in early life stages have a profound effect throughout the life span. However, advantages and disadvantages in middle adulthood have a direct influence on economic and health status in later life.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

== Environmental gerontology ==
Environmental gerontology is a specialization within gerontology that seeks an understanding and interventions to optimize the relationship between aging persons and their physical and social environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sanchez-Gonzalez, D. |author2=Rodriguez-Rodriguez, V. |title=Environmental Gerontology in Europe and Latin America.

The field emerged in the 1930s during the first studies on behavioral and social gerontology. In the 1970s and 1980s, research confirmed the importance of the physical and social environment in understanding the aging population and improved the quality of life in old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wahl, H-W. |author2=Scheidt, R.J. |author3=Windley, P.G. |title=Annual Review of Gerontology and Geriatrics.

Some research indicates that the physical-social environment is related to the [[longevity]] and [[quality of life]] of the [[elderly]]. Precisely, the [[natural environment]] (such as natural therapeutic [[landscapes]], [[therapeutic garden]]) contributes to active and healthy aging in the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2015 |volume=60 |issue=60 | title=Physical-social environments and aging population from environmental gerontology and geography.

== Jurisprudential gerontology ==
Jurisprudential gerontology (sometimes referred to as "geriatric jurisprudence") is a specialization within gerontology that looks into the ways laws and legal structures interact with the aging experience. The field started from legal scholars in the field of [[elder law]], which found that looking into legal issues of older persons without a broader inter-disciplinary perspective does not provide the ideal legal outcome. Using theories such as [[therapeutic jurisprudence]], jurisprudential scholars critically examined existing legal institutions (e.g. adult guardianship, [[End-of-life care|end of life]] care, or [[Nursing home residents' rights|nursing homes]] regulations) and showed how law should look more closely to the social and psychological aspects of its real-life operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mlv15&amp;div=27&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Therapeutic Jurisprudence and End-of-Life Medical Care: Physician Perceptions of a Statute's Impact Medical Law 15 Medicine and Law 1996|pages=201–17|journal=Medicine and Law|volume=15|issue=2|access-date=2018-03-20|year=1996|last1=Kapp|first1=Marshall B.|pmid=8908972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other streams within jurisprudential gerontology also encouraged physicians and lawyers to try to improve their cooperation and better understand how laws and regulatory institutions affect health and well being of older persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doron|first=Israel|last2=Meenan|first2=Helen|date=2012|title=Time for Geriatric Jurisprudence|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/335324|journal=Gerontology|language=english|volume=58|issue=3|pages=193–6|doi=10.1159/000335324|pmid=22538767|issn=0304-324X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">[[File:Geheimer Regierungsrat Prof. Dr. Hermann Kretzschmar, 1912.png|thumb|(1912)]]

'''August Ferdinand Hermann Kretzschmar''' (19 January 1848&amp;nbsp;– 10 May 1924) was a [[Germany|German]] [[musicologist]] and writer, and is considered a founder of interpretation in musical study.

== Life and career ==
Born in [[Olbernhau]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], Kretzschmar was son of the organist and cantor Karl Dankegott Kretzschmar. He was from 1862 a student in the [[Kreuzschule]] in [[Dresden]], where from 1867–1868 he was twice Prefect of the [[Dresdner Kreuzchor]]. In addition, from 1870 he studied [[Philology]] at [[Leipzig University]] as well as Music at the [[Leipzig Conservatory]] and was awarded his doctorate there. From 1871 he was actively teaching in Theory, Composition, Piano and Organ at the Leipzig Conservatory, and acted as director/conductor for various musical societies. In 1876 he became theatre orchestra conductor in [[Metz]], and undertook research expeditions in England and Italy for the study of musical history; from 1877 to 1887 he was an academic and state music director in [[Rostock]].

From 1887 to 1904 he renewed his position in Leipzig as active University Music Director. From 1888-1898 he was Director of the [[Riedel]] Choral Society. In the year 1890 he was awarded an honorary professorship, and in 1890 he founded the Leipzig Academic Concerts which he conducted until 1895. In 1904 he was appointed as regular Professor of Music at the [[University of Berlin]]; from 1907–1922 he was Director of the Royal Institute for Church Music, and also (from 1909–1920) as successor to [[Joseph Joachim]] he was Director of the High School for Music founded in 1869 (i.e. the Berlin Hochschule). He was a government privy counsellor. One of his students was composer and musicologist [[Walter Niemann (composer)|Walter Niemann]]. {{See LMST|Hermann|Kretzschmar}}

Kretzschmar was from 1880 married to the British pianist [[Klara Meller]].
[[File:Friedhof Nikolassee - Grab Hermann Kretzschmar.jpg|right|thumb|Gravesite of Kretzschmar at the Friedhof Nikolassee in Berlin]] 
He died in [[Berlin]]-Schlachtensee in 1924, after which he was buried in a grave of honour in the Evangelic Nicholassee churchyard in Berlin.

== Literary allusion ==
In his novel ''[[Doktor Faustus]]'', [[Thomas Mann]] creates the character of Dr Wendell Kretschmar, the inspirational and eccentric musicologist, lecturer and teacher of the composer Adrian Leverkühn. The name is probably given in homage to his real-life contemporary Hermann Kretzschmar, whose essays in musical interpretation were widely read and appreciated around the turn of the twentieth century.

[[File:Digital home ap.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A mid-priced Panasonic Home Theatre in a Box package, which consists of the DVD player, which contains an integrated multi-channel [[power amplifier]], and a set of speakers. The consumer must buy the [[television]] and stand separately.]]
A "'''home theater in a box'''" (HTIB) is an integrated [[home cinema|home theater]] package which "bundles" together a combination  [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray]] player, a multi-channel amplifier (which includes a [[surround sound]] decoder, a [[radio tuner]], and other features), speaker wires, connection cables, a [[remote control]], a set of five or more surround sound speakers (or more rarely, just left and right speakers, a lower-price option known as "2.1") and a low-frequency [[subwoofer]] cabinet.
In 2016,
they are manufactured by most makers of [[consumer electronics]]. Budget HTIB's with generic or lower-price "house" brands (e.g., [[Best Buy]]'s ''Insignia'' line) may be a "2.1" system. Many, however, are a full "[[5.1]]" system and some higher-end packages even have a [[7.1]] system. Some popular manufacturers of HTIB's are [[RCA]], [[Philips]], [[Panasonic]], [[Sony]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[LG Corp|LG]] and [[Samsung]], all of which make a variety of mid-price range packages. [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] and [[Onkyo]] make higher-end, higher-priced HTIB packages.

==Market positioning==
HTIBs are marketed as an "all-in-one" way for consumers to enjoy the [[surround sound]] experience of home cinema, even if they do not want to-or do not have the electronics "know-how" to pick out all of the components one-by-one and connect the cables. If a consumer were to buy all of the items individually, they would have to have a basic knowledge of electronics, so they could, for example, ensure that the speakers were of compatible [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] and power-handling for the amplifier. As well, the consumer would have to ensure that they purchased all of the different connection cables, which could include [[HDMI cable]]s, optical connectors, speaker wire, and RCA connectors.

On the downside, most HTIBs lack the features and "tweakability" of [[home cinema|home theater]] components which are sold separately. For example, while a standalone home theater amplifier may offer extensive [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] options, a HTIB amplifier may simply provide a few factory-set EQ presets. As well, while a standalone home theatre subwoofer may contain a range of sound-shaping circuitry, such as a [[Audio crossover|crossover]] control, a phase inversion switch, and a [[parametric equalizer]], a HTIB subwoofer system usually has its crossover point set at the factory, which means that the user cannot change it. In some cases, the factory preset crossover point on an HTIB subwoofer may cause it to sound too "boomy" in a room.

==Features==
A typical HTIB generally consists of a central receiver unit which usually contains a DVD player (some systems separate the DVD player into a separate unit), a multi-channel [[power amplifier]] and a series of speakers for surround sound use, generally including a [[subwoofer]]. Some HTIB systems also have a [[radio tuner]] or an Internet-based streaming audio platform (e.g. [[Spotify]]). The least expensive systems usually have a passive subwoofer, which is amplified by the receiver unit. HTIB systems do not include a [[television set]] or [[video monitor|monitor]] with which to display the visual material or a stand to place the receiver unit on. Beside auxiliary inputs, many of them are equipped today with [[HDMI]] with ARC, optical and [[SPDIF]] inputs. Some HTIB systems are also equipped with a phono input, to allow the connection of a turntable with magnetic cartridge. However such systems are not suitable for vinyl playing as they are mainly focussed on movies and rarely for high fidelity. Some home theaters are just stereo or 2.1, but even so, they are not intended as hi fi, this is just a marketing strategy.

There are systems in this class that are sold without a [[DVD Video|DVD]] player and are designed to integrate with existing video setups where there is already one, such as a DVD recorder or a DVD/VCR combo unit. The speaker cabinets supplied with most systems in this class are generally fairly small compared to typical stereo speakers, and are meant for wall- or shelf-mounting in tight spaces. There are some systems in this class that are supplied with slim freestanding speakers that stand on the floor. This may be typical of higher-priced systems that are equipped with more powerful amplifiers or most of the "receiver-only" packages that do not come with a DVD player.

Some HTIBs use [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] connectors between components, sometimes even combining several different wires into one connector, to reduce cable clutter and increase the ease of installation.  However, this can impede interoperability between different audio/visual devices and makes upgrading certain parts impossible. This may also be used by [[manufacturer]]s to limit what a consumer can do with a low-end model and encourage them to upgrade should they want more autonomy.

A few manufacturers, notably Sony and Panasonic, have implemented wireless connection technology for the [[surround speakers]] in this class of equipment. This technology may be available as standard with some of the high-priced models or may be supplied as an aftermarket kit that only works with selected models in the manufacturer's range. It usually uses a line-level feed over a proprietary wireless link to a separate power amplifier used for the surround-sound channels. This link-receiver and power amplifier can be built into one of the surround speakers or housed in a black box that the surround speakers are connected to. Some higher-end HTIB models offer additional features such as 1080i or 4K ( mainly versions with Blu-ray) video resolution upscaling, a 5-disc platter, HDMI inputs, USB connectivity, Bluetooth support, Wi-fi support, Internet apps, DAB and DAB+, mirroring possibility, iPod dock and a hard disk for recording TV shows.

Some older HTIBs from the 1990s had a built-in VCR, besides a DVD, along with a TV tuner, and a [[hard disk]] for recording TV shows.

==Synopsis==
In 2010, Superintendent of Public Schools for Bertie County, Chip Zullinger (1951-2014) had been hired to address the school district's serious shortcomings.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;  After completing four large architectural projects with designer Emily Pilloton (author of the 2009 book ''Design Revolution'') and architect Matt Miller,&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Zullinger invited the two to create a high school curriculum.

Pilloton and Miller described the curriculum, ultimately named '''''Studio H''''', as [[Industrial arts|shop class]] for the 21st century, where the design process could address the community's problems and its own sense of possibility. Named after its focus on "humanity, habitats, health and happiness,"&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news

Pilloton and partner Miller, worked with 10 (initially 13)&lt;ref name="the.only"/&gt; high school students at Bertie Early College High School through the year-long,  full-scale design/build curriculum &amp;mdash; following six design rules: there is no design without critical action; we work 'with' not 'for;' we start locally and scale globally; create systems, not stuff; document, share and measure; and finally build.

The project team and the community had identified a new farmer's market as a viable and desirable community project, and under the leadership of Pilloton and Miller the students focused on developing design and construction skills: critical thinking, research (e.g., analyzing Buckminster Fuller's [[Dymaxion House]]), sketching, and drafting, along with welding and real-world construction trades. Pilloton and Miller in turn completed construction documents and specifications, worked with a structural engineer and filed for construction permits &amp;mdash; while also preparing and conducting three hours of daily classroom instruction.&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;{{cite news

Together the Project H team identified student Stevie Mizelle's preliminary concept model to develop further, subsequently completing construction of the farmer's market to approximately 75% before the school year ended.  The design features a large wood platform for vendor booths with vertical wood trusses supporting a rectilinear roofed canopy with wood slats designed to filter and control solar glare; a main floor at the same height above grade as a pickup truck bed, allowing vendors to back up to the "loading dock" at each vendor stall and walk their goods directly off their truck into their booth; and a long ramp at the front to allow pedestrian accessibility and to provide a symbolic front porch for visitors.&lt;ref name="studioh2"&gt;{{cite news

Early in the school year, Pilloton and Miller chose to continue with the project after Zullinger, their prime backer, was dismissed by the school board, and the board became unwilling to underwrite the curriculum and withdrew their offered salaries.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Pilloton and Miller continued to work with the students and subsequently completed construction of the farmer's market after the school year ended.  The Windsor Super Market opened in October 2011.

Students featured in ''Studio H'' were Erick Bowen, Rodecoe Dunlow, Kerron Hayes, Anthony Johnson, Stevie Mizelle, Cameron Perry, Cj Robertson, Jamesha Thompson, Colin White and Alexia Williams.  The film also features County Commissioner Ron Wesson as well as volunteer Eric Wandmacher (friend of Pilloton and Miller) and Superintendent of Public Schools, Chip Zullinger.&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;{{cite news

==Background==

{{quote box |quote =  
My goal in going in to Bertie County was not to go in and just design for them, but to really teach their kids about the design process and do something for the community with their high school students. That, in a way, transcends a lot of this social design movement stuff ... and hopefully [it's] the next phase of what that movement can be.|source= —Matthew Miller'' &lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;}}

Prior to one-year '''''Studio H''''' curriculum in Bertie County, Pilloton and Miller had completed four architectural projects with the school board, as backed by Superintendent Zullinger: four playgrounds, three computer labs, a weight room for the football team, and a county-wide graphic campaign.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Friction on the school board developed with another Zullinger-backed project, "Connect Bertie," a project to bring free county-wide internet connectivity by paying an outside entity, [[Century Link]], to provide the internet services at a cost of $2 million annually.  The tension culminated with Zullwinger's dismissal, followed a reversal of the dismissal and then acceptance of his resignation.  Without his support and the offered salaries, Zullwinger's departure directly threatened the Studio H project.&lt;ref name="zull"&gt;{{cite news

Other tensions arose, and in a 2013 interview, Pilloton identified a racially and politically charged context that surrounded the curriculum and the project &amp;mdash; describing Bertie County as a place where "hundreds of years of slavery and institutionalized racism is very much still alive and kicking."&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; On release of the film, Pilloton and Miller said "they said they still believe it was fear of change – not lack of money in a budget that topped $30 million – that ultimately led to the board's decision."&lt;ref name="fear of change"&gt;{{cite news

Pilloton had grown up near [[Mt. Tamalpais]], California, attributing the German toy ''Quadro'' with inspiring her interest in design.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;  She later studied at the [[College of Environmental Design, UC Berkeley]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], during a period when there was no curriculum but when there was a 100,000 sf shop class.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;

Matt Miller was born in [[West Virginia]] and has architecture degrees from the [[University of Tennessee]] and [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]].  He has taught architecture and design at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]], the [[College of Creative Studies]], and UC Berkeley &amp;mdash; and worked with [[Architecture for Humanity]].  Miller was the first student at the Cranbrook Academy to design and also build his thesis project (along with classmate Thomas Gardner): a 900 sf, two-story block infill house&lt;ref name="house"/&gt; at 2126 Pierce Street in [[Poletown East, Detroit|Poletown, Detroit]].  The house, ultimately abandoned,&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; had a construction budget of $60,000 and used all-volunteer labor along with carefully selected materials (e.g., concrete block and rubber membrane roofing) to keep costs down.&lt;ref name="house"/&gt;

==Reception==
As of mid-2014, the film had received a rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] of 81% favorable critic response and 100% favorable audience response.&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite news
  | title = If You Build It
  | publisher = Rottentomatoes.com
  | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/if_you_build_it/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Architectural Record]]'' called the film "A document of America at its most vulnerable."&lt;ref name="film82"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' reviewer Nicolas Rapold said "the movie's biggest weakness comes with its tendency to film people telling us what's going on rather than having us observe."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news

==Follow up==
Pilloton and Miller, who had been a couple, split up&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt; some time after the period depicted in the documentary.  Matthew Miller is now the lead design/build instructor at '''''(co)studio''''', a public high school program in [[Carbondale, Colorado]].  Pilloton continues to direct Studio H, which is now in its fourth year, at the at REALM Charter School in [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;

Studio H has grown to include more than 200 students,&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news

At a point early in the film, student Stevie Mizelle &amp;mdash; whose preliminary design for the farmer's market was ultimately selected by the team for design development &amp;mdash; joked: "school, I hate it, my dad hated it, my granddaddy hated it. I'm carrying on a tradition."  He currently studies animal behavior at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC, making Dean's List his freshman year.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;  He was the first male relative in his immediate family to graduate from high school, attributing his graduation to his work with Studio H.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;

The '''Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy''' (ISERP) is the research arm of the [[social sciences]] at [[Columbia University]], formerly known as the ''Paul F. Lazarsfeld Center for the Social Sciences''. ISERP works to produce pioneering social science research and to shape public policy by integrating knowledge and methods across the social scientific disciplines. ISERP organizes an active intellectual community at Columbia University through its Faculty Fellows program, research centers, projects, and training initiatives.

== History ==
ISERP is the direct descendant of the [[Bureau of Applied Social Research]] (BASR), established at [[Columbia University]] in 1944 by sociologist [[Paul F. Lazarsfeld]]. One of the first social science institutes in the nation, the Bureau made landmark contributions to communications research, public opinion polling, organizational studies, and social science methodology. BASR’s tradition was carried on by the  Paul F. Lazarsfeld Center for the Social Sciences, established in 1976 after Lazarsfeld’s death and later renamed to honor him. Under directors Harold Watts, Jonathan Cole, and Harrison White, the Lazarsfeld Center expanded its interdisciplinary reach and established particular strengths in the sociology of science and network analysis.

The Lazarsfeld Center for the Social Sciences was one of the centers incorporated into the Institute at its founding in 1999 as the Institute for Social and Economic Theory and Research (ISETR). Also joining ISETR were the Center for Urban Research and Policy, founded in 1992, and several new research centers.  In January 2001, ISETR merged with the Office of Sponsored Research to become the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/about/ |title=About ISERP |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=Columbia University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213054517/http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/about/ |archivedate=2008-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fellowship==
The fellowship of ISERP is drawn from faculty of the departments of Anthropology, Economics, History, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, and Statistics, as well as of [[Barnard College]], the Earth Institute, [[Teachers College]], the Mailman School of Public Health and the Schools of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, Business, International and Public Affairs, Law, and Social Work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/about/ |title=About ISERP |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=Columbia University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213054517/http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/about/ |archivedate=2008-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Front Entrance to ISAS.jpeg|200px|thumb|Entrance to the ISAS [[Sagamihara Campus]]]]
{{nihongo|'''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science'''|宇宙科学研究所|Uchū kagaku kenkyūjo}} (ISAS) is a [[Japan]]ese national research organization of [[astrophysics]] using [[rocket]]s, [[astronomy|astronomical]] satellites and [[interplanetary probe]]s which played a major role in [[Japan's space development]].  Since 2003, it is a division of [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JAXA History|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/about/history/index_e.html|publisher=JAXA Official Website (English)|accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ISAS originated as part of the [[Institute of Industrial Science]] of the [[University of Tokyo]], where [[Hideo Itokawa]] experimented with miniature [[solid-fuel rocket]]s ([[Pencil Rocket]] and [[Baby Rocket]]) in the 1950s.  This experimentation eventually led to the development of the [[Kappa_(rocket)|Κ (''Kappa'')]] [[sounding rocket]], which was used for observations during the [[International Geophysical Year]].  By 1960, the Κ-8 rocket had reached an altitude of 200 km.

In 1964, the rocket group and the ''Institute of Aeronautics'', along with [[high altitude balloon|scientific ballooning]] team&lt;!--from Kobe Univ?--&gt;, were merged to form {{nihongo|''Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science''|宇宙航空研究所|Uchū kōkū kenkyūjo}} within the University of Tokyo.  The rocket evolved into the [[Lambda (rocket)|L (''Lambda'')]] series, and, in 1970, L-4S-5 was launched as Japan's first artificial satellite [[Ohsumi (satellite)|Ohsumi]].

Although ''Lambda'' rockets were only sounding rockets, the next generation of [[Mu (rocket family)|M (''Mu'') rocket]]s was intended to be satellite launch vehicles from the start.  Beginning in 1971, ISAS launched a series of [[scientific satellites]] to observe the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]].  Since the launch of [[Hakucho]] in 1979, ISAS has had [[X-ray astronomy]] satellites consecutively in orbit, until it was briefly terminated by the launch failure of [[ASTRO-E]].

In 1981, as a part of university system reform, and for the mission expansion, ISAS was spun out from University of Tokyo as an inter-university national research organization, ''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science''.

In 2003, three national aerospace organizations including ISAS were merged to form [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA).  The English name ''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science'' is still used, although the Japanese name was changed to 宇宙科学研究本部, (literally, ''Space Science Research Division'', whereas the previous name's literal translation was ''Space Science Laboratory'').  In 2010, the name was changed back to the previous {{nihongo||宇宙科学研究所|Uchū kagaku kenkyūjo}}.

'''Jack Dangermond''' (born 1945) is an American [[billionaire]] businessman and [[environmental scientist]].   In 1969, he co-founded with his wife Laura the [[Environmental Systems Research Institute]] (ESRI), a privately held [[geographic information system]]s (GIS) software company.

Dangermond is the company's president, and works at its headquarters in [[Redlands, California]].  Dangermond founded ESRI to perform [[land use]] analysis; however, its focus evolved into GIS software development, highlighted by the release of [[ARC/INFO]] in the early 1980s; the development and marketing of [[ARC/INFO]] positioned ESRI with the dominant market share among GIS software developers.  Today ESRI is the largest GIS software developer in the world and its flagship product, [[ArcGIS]], traces its heritage to Dangermond's initial efforts in developing ARC/INFO.

==Early life and education==
Jack Dangermond was born in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ESRI.com/library/articles/mapping-the-future.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Redlands, California|Redlands]], California, the son of Dutch immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.nytimes.com/corner-office/interviews/teamwork/topic New York Times: "Corner Office – Conversations about leadership and management"] retrieved May 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  His parents owned a [[plant nursery]] in Redlands.&lt;ref name="howell"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=503454 |title=Jack Dangermond’s Digital Mapping Lays It All Out |last=Howell |first=Donna |work=Investor's Business Daily |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2009-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510064955/http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=503454 |archivedate=2010-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dangermond attended [[Redlands High School]].

Dangermond completed his undergraduate work at [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]] (Cal Poly Pomona), studying landscape architecture and environmental science.&lt;ref name="howell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alumnus Jack Dangermond to Earn Honorary Doctorate |url=http://polycentric.csupomona.edu/2005/02/alumnus_jack_dangermond_to_earn_honorary_doctorate |work=PolyCentric |accessdate=2008-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826211248/http://polycentric.csupomona.edu/2005/02/alumnus_jack_dangermond_to_earn_honorary_doctorate/ |archivedate=August 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then earned a Master of Architecture degree in Urban Planning from the [[University of Minnesota]], and a Master of Landscape Architecture degree from the [[Harvard University]] Graduate School of Design [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|GSD]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="howell"/&gt;  His early work in the school's Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis (LCGSA) led directly to the development of ESRI's [[ARC/INFO]] GIS software. He has been awarded 13 honorary doctoral degrees.

'''Jean-Pierre Pescatore '''(11 March 1793 - 9 December 1855)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fondation.lu/Fr/Fondation/textes--jean-pierre-pescatore-biographie-succinct|title=Jean-Pierre PESCATORE – Biographie succinct|website=www.fondation.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Luxembourgish-French businessman, banker, art collector, and philanthropist.

==Early life==
Born in [[Luxembourg City]] as the fourth child of Dominique Pescatore, a merchant in the city, and Marie-Madelaine Geschwind, he came from a family of colonial commodity traders, originally from [[Ticino]], who had settled in Luxembourg in 1736. In 1811, at the age of 18, he enlisted in the army of [[Napoleon]]. Promoted to ''[[Maréchal des logis]]'' in 1813, after several campaigns he deserted and returned to Luxembourg in 1814.

He then entered the world of business and took to selling tobacco like his father and grandfather. Together with his brother Antoine, he was the director from 1814 to 1816 and then again from 1822 to 1844 of the tobacco factory in the [[Fishmarket]] neighbourhood which had been founded by their grandfather Jules Joseph Antoine Pescatore.

==Marriages==
In 1816 he married Marguerite Beving,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and settled with her in Luxembourg City. She died of illness, and without children, in June 1821.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1837 Pescatore met the Swiss Anne-Cathérine Weber, with whom he lived together and whom he married in 1851 in the church (but not civilly), in order to render this relation acceptable to the public. Due to this confusion there were arguments after his death about the inheritance.

==Move to France==
In 1817 he received long-term permission from the French authorities to import Havana tobacco to France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pescatore's good relations with the ''Régie française des tabacs'', the Belgian annexation of the French-speaking part of Luxembourg in 1839, and Luxembourg's accession to the [[Zollverein]] (the German customs union), exposing Luxembourgish tobacco manufacturing to strong competition from abroad, were damaging to Pescatore's business interests in the Grand-Duchy. He therefore established himself in [[Paris]], in order to concentrate solely on the French markets, and would become a naturalised French citizen on 3 September 1846. In addition to trading in tobacco, he also dabbled in finance, founding the bank "J.P. Pescatore et Cie" on 27 December 1844 with the Austrian Frédéric Adolphe Grieninger.

==Property and hobbies==
On 11 August 1844 he bought the [[Chateau de la Celle Saint-Cloud|Château de la Celle Saint-Cloud]] from the Viscount de Morel-Vindé's heirs.&lt;nowiki/&gt; In 1849 he also bought a vineyard at [[Médoc]], near [[Giscours]]. In 1852 he became mayor of [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]], which he remained until his death.

Jean-Pierre Pescatore had various hobbies, including collecting works of art, rare plant specimens and breeding horses. He acquired paintings and drawings from prestigious backgrounds, such as the galleries of the [[King of the Netherlands]] and of [[Louis Philippe I]]. He amassed more than 800 plant specimens, including a collection of the first [[orchid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in France, with the help of [[Jean Linden]]. The latter named a publication with orchids from his collection, ''Pescatorea. ''[[Empress Eugénie]], and her husband [[Napoleon III]], came to see the collection twice. Pescatore renovated his château to house his fragile plants, constructing an orangery and three greenhouses. He became president of the horticultural society of Seine-et-Oise and of the floral society of Versailles. A recipient of the [[Légion d'honneur]], in 1852 he was also appointed Consul-General of the Netherlands. He died on 9 December 1855 at his Paris house, and was buried in [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]]. He left the considerable sum of 10 millions francs. Without a direct heir, his inheritance was the subject of a dispute between his partner, Anne Catherine Weber, and his other heirs.

Finally, the Château de La Celle was awarded to his niece, Elisabeth (Lily) Dutreux-Pescatore, with [[usufruct]] for life to Anne Catherine Weber. The heirs of Pescatore-Dutreux owned the château until 1951.

In 1940, [[Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg]] stopped at the Château de la Celle Saint-Cloud for a few days, while fleeing the German [[invasion of Luxembourg]]. The Germans then occupied the castle until August 1944. After the liberation of France, Auguste Dutreux regained his property. He donated the castle and its gardens, to the [[French Foreign Ministry]] on 7 February 1951, which still owns it today.

==Legacy==
In 1853 he donated half a million francs to Luxembourg City, in order to build an old people's home, the later ''Fondation Pescatore'', opened in 1892. The city also received his art collection, housed in the Musée Jean-Pierre Pescatore, on the first floor of the town hall. In 1953 it was moved to the [[Villa Vauban]].

In 2005 the Luxembourgish postal service put out a stamp commemorating his philanthropy in the Grand Duchy. Two streets are also named after him, one in La Celle Saint-Cloud and one in Luxembourg.

The '''Dr. John D. Cooper Archaeological and Paleontological Center''', or '''Cooper Center''', was established by OC Parks and [[California State University, Fullerton]] in order to conserve, archive and manage the Orange County [[Archaeology]] and [[Paleontology]] Collections, including six million fossils. The center opened in July 2011 and  is in [[Orange County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.ocregister.com/articles/fossils-644813-county-boxes.html|title=Orange County's fossils being cataloged and preserved|author=BRITTANY HANSON|date=10 December 2014|work=The Orange County Register|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory''' or KSO is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] affiliated with the Institute of Geophysics, Astrophysics and Meteorology out of the [[University of Graz]]. It is located near [[Villach]] on the southern border of [[Austria]].

Its Web page at http://www.kso.ac.at/ usually posts current images of the sun, especially in the hydrogen-alpha line that is the strongest visible-light line of hydrogen and that reveals the solar chromosphere.

==History==
Founded in 1941 by the German [[Luftwaffe]] to research the effects of the Sun on the Earth's [[ionosphere]], the KSO focuses on multispectral synoptic observations of the sun using several telescope on the same mount.

A '''laconic phrase''' or '''laconism''' is a concise or [[wikt:terse|terse]] statement, especially a [[wikt:blunt|blunt]] and [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|elliptical]] rejoinder.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms'', 1984, ''s.v.'' 'concise' [https://books.google.com/books?id=8N4UReTJYhUC&amp;pg=PA172 p. 172].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Percy Smith, ''Synonyms Discriminated'' (1904) [https://books.google.com/books?id=17sXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA541 p. 541].&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Laconia]], the region of Greece including the city of [[Sparta]], whose ancient inhabitants had a reputation for verbal austerity and were famous for their blunt and often [[wikt:pithy|pithy]] remarks.

==Uses==
A laconic phrase may be used for efficiency (as in [[military jargon]]), for emphasis, for philosophical reasons (especially among thinkers who believe in minimalism, such as [[Stoicism|Stoics]]), or to better deflate a pompous individual.

[[File:Philip-ii-of-macedon.jpg|thumb|138px|left|[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] ([[Hellenistic art#Later Roman copies|Roman copy]] of a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] bust)]]
A prominent example involves [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] of [[Macedon]]. After invading southern Greece and receiving the submission of other key [[city-state]]s, he turned his attention to Sparta and asked menacingly whether he should come as friend or foe. The reply was "''Neither''."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica,'' 233e [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/unknown.html 1] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2008.01.0198:chapter=69&amp;highlight=neither%2Cphilip 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

Losing patience, he sent the message: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are advised to submit without further delay, for if I bring my army into your land, I will destroy your farms, slay your people, and raze your city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5n4iLuNvHlcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0199766495&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikk--Mr6bXAhVJ7GMKHRt2BxEQ6AEIKDAA#v=snippet&amp;q=raze&amp;f=false ''The Animal Spirit Doctrine and the Origins of Neurophysiology''], C.U.M. Smith, ''et al., Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Spartan [[ephor]]s again replied with a single word: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''If.''&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De garrulitate'', 17 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0288%3Asection%3D17 1] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/De_garrulitate*.html 2] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20140804211840/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/49190/ 3].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Subsequently, neither Philip nor his son [[Alexander the Great]] attempted to capture the city.{{refn|group=note|Sparta then declined to participate in Macedon's [[Wars of Alexander the Great#Persia|invasion of the Persian Empire]], a fact memorialized in a proclamation Alexander sent to Athens with armor captured at the [[Battle of the Granicus]]: [[:wikiquote:Macedonia#Historians|"Alexander, son of Philip, and all the Greeks except the Lacedaemonians, present this offering from the spoils taken from the foreigners inhabiting Asia."]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'', I, 16, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{Clear}}

===In humor===
The Spartans were especially famous for their dry, understated wit,&lt;ref name="Stuttard2014"&gt;{{cite book|first= David|last= Stuttard|title=A History of Ancient Greece in Fifty Lives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VAc7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88&amp;q=laconic+wit|date=14 October 2014| publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn= 978-0-500-77221-8|page= 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now known as "laconic humor". This can be contrasted with the "[[Attic Greek|Attic]] salt" or "Attic wit" {{ndash}} the refined, poignant, delicate humour of Sparta's chief rival, [[Classical Athens|Athens]].&lt;ref name="Belfield1897"&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry H.|last= Belfield|title= Lord Chesterfield's letters to his son and godson|url=

Various more recent groups also have a reputation for laconic humor: Icelanders in the [[Icelandic Sagas|sagas]],&lt;ref name = "Hallberg1962"&gt;Peter Hallberg, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sq0Ku9yBDJwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=laconic_repartee The Icelandic Saga]'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Anglophone world, Australians (''cf.''

==History==
[[File:Chilon of Sparta.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chilon of Sparta]]]]
Spartans paid less attention than other [[ancient Greeks]] to the development of [[Education in ancient Greece|education]], [[Ancient Greek art|arts]], and [[Ancient Greek literature|literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Hippias Major]]'' 285b–d.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some view this as having contributed to the characteristically blunt Laconian speech. However, [[Socrates]], in [[Plato]]'s dialogue [[Protagoras (dialogue)|''Protagoras'']], appears to reject the idea that Spartans' economy with words was simply a consequence of poor literary education: "... they conceal their wisdom, and pretend to be blockheads, so that they may seem to be superior only because of their [[Spartan army|prowess in battle]] ... This is how you may know that I am speaking the truth and that the Spartans are the best educated in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy]] and [[rhetoric|speaking]]: if you talk to any ordinary Spartan, he seems to be stupid, but eventually, like an expert marksman, he shoots in some brief remark that proves you to be only a child".&lt;ref&gt;''Protagoras'' 342b, d–e, from the translation given at the end of the section on Lycurgus in [https://web.archive.org/web/20050207014704/http://www.e-classics.com/index.html e-classics.com].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|An alternative translation based on those by A. Beresford and R.E. Allen is as follows: "...they claim not to have any interest in [philosophy] and put on this big show of being morons...because...they want people to think that their superiority rests on fighting battles and being manly... You can tell that what I say is true, and that Spartans are the best educated in philosophy and argument, by this: if one associates with the most inferior Spartan, one at first finds him somewhat inferior in speech; but then at some chance point in the discussion he throws in a remark worthy of noticing, brief and terse, like a skilled marksman, so that the person he's talking to appears no better than a child."&lt;ref name = "Beresford2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, R.E.|title=The Dialogues of Plato| volume= 3: Ion, Hippias Minor, Laches, and Protagoras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7StRBqCrebwC&amp;pg=203|year=1984|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300074383|pages=202-203}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Socrates was known to have admired Spartan laws,&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Crito]]'' 52e.&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Laconophilia#Ancient Laconophilia|many other Athenians]],&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] 544c.&lt;/ref&gt; but modern scholars have doubted the seriousness of his attribution of a secret love of philosophy to Spartans.&lt;ref name = "Taylor1949"&gt;[[A.E. Taylor|Taylor, A.E.]], [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sb8KR_jVAy0C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Plato:  The Man and His Work''], Meridian Books, 6th ed., 1949; on [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sb8KR_jVAy0C&amp;pg=PA255 p. 255] Taylor suggests Socrates is mocking, in jest, other Greeks who affect a Spartan lifestyle as the epitome of rugged manliness for not realizing their models are closet intellectuals.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Taylor2002"&gt;Taylor, C.C.W., [https://books.google.com/books?id=mXkxAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=9780199555659&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+ordinary+Spartan ''Plato: Protagoras''], Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199555659}}, 2009; pp. 43, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Beresford2005"&gt;Beresford, A., [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5Uvfd2dixgMC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Plato: Protagoras and Meno''], Penguin Books 2005, p. 151.; see [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5Uvfd2dixgMC&amp;q=Contemporary%20readers#v=snippet&amp;q=Contemporary%20readers commentary] (click on "61" link).&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the Spartans [[Myson of Chenae]] and [[Chilon of Sparta]] have traditionally been counted among the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]; both were famous for many laconic sayings.{{refn|group=note|Examples include "We should not investigate facts by the light of arguments, but arguments by the light of facts" for Myson,&lt;ref name="laertius"&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]].

In general, however, Spartans were expected to be men of few words, to hold rhetoric in disdain, and to stick to the point. Loquacity was considered frivolous and unbecoming of sensible, down-to-earth [[Spartiate|Spartan peers]]. A Spartan youth was reportedly liable to have his thumb bitten as punishment for too verbose a response to a teacher's question.&lt;ref name="Cartledge2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Cartledge|title=Spartan Reflections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgFlxZ14hkoC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=2012-12-13|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23124-5|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A [[wit]]ticism attributed to [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]], the possibly legendary lawgiver of Sparta, was a response to a proposal to set up a [[democracy]] there: "Begin with your own family."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Lycurgus'' [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html 1] [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14033/14033-h/14033-h.htm#LIFE_OF_LYKURGUS 2] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lycurgus*.html 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
*On another occasion, Lycurgus was reportedly asked the reason for the less-than-extravagant size of Sparta's [[sacrifice]]s to the [[Religion in ancient Greece|gods]]. He replied, "So that we may always have something to offer."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt;
*When he was consulted on how Spartans might best forestall invasion of their homeland, Lycurgus advised, "By remaining poor, and each man not desiring to possess more than his fellow."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt;
*When asked whether it would be prudent to build a [[defensive wall]] enclosing the city, Lycurgus answered, "A city is well-fortified which has a wall of men instead of brick."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt; (When another Spartan was later shown an Asian city with impressive fortifications, he remarked, "Fine quarters for women!"&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica,'' 230c.&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Responding to a visitor who questioned why they put their fields in the hands of the [[helots]] rather than cultivate them themselves, [[Anaxandridas II|Anaxandridas]] explained, "It was by not taking care of the fields, but of ourselves, that we acquired those fields."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica'' (Sayings of Spartans), 217a. This work may or may not be by Plutarch himself, but is included among the ''[[Moralia]],'' a collection of works attributed to him but outside the collection of his most famous works, the ''[[Parallel Lives]].''&lt;/ref&gt;
*King [[Demaratus]], being pestered by someone with a question concerning who the most exemplary Spartan was, answered "He that is least like you."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt;
*On her husband [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]]'s departure for battle with the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] at [[Thermopylae]], [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta]] asked what she should do. He advised her: "Marry a good man and bear good children."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica,'' 225a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Lacaenarum Apophthegmata'' (Sayings of Spartan Women), 240e. This work may or may not be by Plutarch himself, but is included among the ''[[Moralia]],'' a collection of works attributed to him but outside the collection of his most famous works, the ''[[Parallel Lives]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

* When [[Ben-Hadad I]], king of [[Aram-Damascus]], attacked [[Ahab]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], he sent a message: "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if enough dust remains in [[Samaria]] to give each of my men a handful." Ahab replied, "One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off."&lt;ref&gt;[[I Kings]] 20:10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A traveler from [[Sybaris]], a city in southern Italy (which gave rise to the word ''[[:wikt:sybarite|sybarite]]'') infamous in the ancient world for its luxury and gluttony, was invited to eat in a Spartan [[Syssitia|mess hall]] and tasted their [[black broth]]. Disgusted, he remarked, "No wonder Spartans are the bravest of men.

From the beginning of the twenty first century, the term '''language coaching''' started to become used more and more in the field of [[Language_education|language teaching and language learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrios Thanasoulas (2002) 'The changing winds and shifting sands of the history of English Language Teaching' Online at EnglishClub.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Corballis (2006) 'White Paper' Online at Corballis Communication Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, language coaching encompasses the teaching and training of foreign languages but incorporates principles, models and competences from the field of [[life coaching]]. These principles, competences and models may originate from coaching organisations themselves such as the [http://www.coachfederation.org/ International Coach Federation] in the USA or from particular coaching models or practices such as [[GROW_model|GROW]].

Thus, the whole process behind life coaching, such as goal setting, action and strategy setting, reviewing goals and really getting coachees to focus on personal development and accomplish feats step by step is then transported into the language learning process. 

The development of language coaching in the language teaching world is on the rise and more and more language teachers appear to be calling themselves language coaches. It is often difficult to distinguish between unqualified language teachers, qualified language teachers, language teachers with a specialization such as ESP ([[English for Specific Purposes]]) and now language coaches. It is also not clear if so called language coaches have any coaching qualifications or experience as life coaches. 

'''Neurolanguage Coaching''' 

In 2012, Rachel Marie Paling from Efficient Language Coaching™ defined Neurolanguage Coaching as follows:

“''Neurolanguage Coaching™ is the efficient and fast transfer of language knowledge and skills from the Language Coach to the Language Coachee with sustainable effects facilitated by brain-based coaching and coaching principles and [[neuroscience]]''.” 
© 2012 Rachel M. Paling&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languagecoachingcertification.com/language-coaching&lt;/ref&gt; 

Paling wrote an article to distinguish the differences between language coaching and language teaching&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languagecoachingcertification.com/differences-language-teaching-and-language-coaching&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, and this was echoed in the article by Dimitris Zeppos in a table demonstrating the principal differences between language teaching and language coaching:

In the last two years, Paling has clarified and clearly delineated the field of Language Coaching and Neurolanguage Coaching and created a Language Coaching Certification for already qualified language teachers to enhance their expertise with coaching training and with the knowledge of neuroscience and how the brain likes to learn. A study regarding the profile of such neurolanguage coaches in the world has recently been conducted by Dimitris Zeppos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciedu.ca/wje World Journal of Education Vol. 4, No. 6; 2014 Published by Sciedu Press 30 ISSN 1925-0746 E-ISSN 1925-0754&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucretia Johanna van Winter''' (1785 – 1845) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] art collector.

Winter was born in [[Amsterdam]] as the oldest child of the wealthy merchant Pieter van Winter who received visitors to his art gallery that he had installed at the rear of his house ''Saxenburg'', [[Keizersgracht]] 244. He had purchased the house for the astronomical sum of Dfl. 100,000 from [[Jean de Neufville]]. In 1800 her mother died and in 1807 her father died, leaving the collection as it then was in the family home, the portraits of which became the property of Lucretia's brother. The rest of the paintings were to be divided between Lucretia and her younger sister [[Annewies van Winter|Anna Louisa]], who would later amass her own art collection.

After her brother's marriage Lucretia bought the house [[Herengracht]] 440 in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/WinterLucretia Lucretia Johanna van Winter] in [[1001 Vrouwen]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's art gallery remained available for viewing at her parent's home (now her brother's residence) and were to be split after the youngest sister Anna Louisa came of age. Anna Louisa took her portion of the collection when she married jonkheer Willem van Loon in 1815, but Lucretia had already made her first art purchases since 1810 with a view to forming her own art gallery and united her half of her father's collection with this modest collection of her own. She continued collecting in her own name until 1820, purchasing in total 71 paintings on her own. In 1822 at the age of 37 Lucretia married Hendrik Six van Hillegom (1790-1847) and the couple moved into his house at Herengracht 509-511. After that all art purchases were made in his name, but it is assumed that she remained an avid collector since there are no records of him making art purchases before his marriage. 

Among the most notable of the paintings Lucretia bought herself are Vermeer's ''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|Milkmaid]]'' and ''[[The Little Street]]''. After the death of Lucretia the collection went to her husband and on his death in 1847 it fell to their sons. In 1877 the heirs of Anna Louisa sold the Van Loon-Winter collection as a block to the Paris Rothschild family, which caused a stir in the Dutch papers (it included the ''[[Pendant portraits of Maerten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit]]'', among others). When Lucretia's children died her grandchildren also expected to sell the collection, but a large portion was acquired by the Rijksmuseum amidst debates about the value. They accepted an offer from the heirs for Vermeer's milkmaid plus 38 other paintings for Dfl. 750.000.

'''Mahavihara''' ({{IAST|Mahāvihāra}}) is the [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] term for a great [[vihara]] (Buddhist monastery) and is used to describe a monastic complex of viharas.

==Mahaviharas of India==
A range of monasteries grew up in ancient [[Magadha]] (modern [[Bihar]]) and [[Bengal]]. According to Tibetan sources, five great mahaviharas stood out during the [[Pala empire|Pāla]] period: Vikramashila, the premier university of the era; Nalanda, past its prime but still illustrious, Somapura, Odantapurā, and Jaggadala.&lt;ref&gt;Vajrayogini: Her Visualization, Rituals, and Forms by Elizabeth English. Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-329-X}} pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; The five monasteries formed a network; "all of them were under state supervision" and there existed "a system of co-ordination among them . . it seems from the evidence that the different seats of Buddhist learning that functioned in eastern India under the Pāla were regarded together as forming a network, an interlinked group of institutions," and it was common for great scholars to move easily from position to position among them.&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 352-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nalanda===
{{Main|Nalanda}}
The famous Nalanda Mahavihara was founded a few centuries earlier; [[Xuanzang]] speaks about its magnificence and grandeur. Reference to this monastery is found in Tibetan and Chinese sources. During the Pāla period, Nālānda was less singularly outstanding, as other Pālā establishments "must have drawn away a number of learned monks from Nālānda when all of the  . . came under the aegis of the Pālās."&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 344&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the fame of this monastery lingered even after the Pala period.

===Odantapura===
{{Main|Odantapura}}
Odantapuri, also called Odantapura or Uddandapura, was a Buddhist vihara in what is now Bihar, India. It was established by King Gopala of the Pala dynasty in the 7th century. It is considered the second oldest of India's universities and was situated in Magadh. Currently it is known as the Bihar Sharif city (Headquarters of Nalanda District). Acharya Sri Ganga of Vikramashila had been a student here. According to the Tibetan records there were about 12,000 students at Odantapuri. Odantpuri was situated at a mountain called Hiranya Prabhat Parvat and the bank of the river Panchanan.

===Vikramashila===
{{Main|Vikramashila}}
Reference to a monastery known as Vikramashila is found in Tibetan records. The Pala ruler Dharmapala was its founder. The exact site of this vihara is at Antichak, a small village in Bhagalpur district (Bihar). The monastery had 107 temples and 50 other institutions providing room for 108 monks. It attracted scholars from neighbouring countries.

==Mahaviharas of Bangladesh==

===Somapura===
{{Main|Somapura}}
Somapura Mahavihara was located at Paharpur, 46.5&amp;nbsp;km to the north-west of [[Mahasthangarh]] in [[Bangladesh]]. The available data suggests that the Pala ruler Dharmapala founded the vihara. It followed the traditional [[cruciform]] plan for the central shrine. There were 177 individual cells around the central courtyard. There were central blocks in the middle of the eastern, southern and western sides. These might have been subsidiary chapels. It was the premier vihara of its kind and its fame lingered till the 11th century CE.

===Jagaddala===
{{Main|Jagaddala}}
Jagaddala Mahavihara was a [[Buddhist]] monastery and seat of learning in [[Varendra]], a geographical unit in present north Bengal.&lt;ref name="India 1962. pg 377"&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 377&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded by the later kings of the [[Pāla dynasty]], probably [[Ramapala]] ({{circa|1077|1120}}), most likely at a site near the present village of Jagdal in [[Dhamoirhat Upazila]] in the north-west [[Bangladesh]] on the border with India,  near Paharapur.&lt;ref name="UNESCO World Heritage website"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1212/ UNESCO World Heritage website]&lt;/ref&gt;



===Shalban Vihara===
{{Main|Shalban Vihara}}
also known as Bhavadev Bihar is another large monastery which flourished between 7th to 12th centuries AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shalvan_Vihara |website=Banglapedia |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Located in Comilla, Bangladesh,it was established by King Bhava Deva in the Lalmai Hills Ridge.

==Mahavihara of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka==
{{Main|Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya}}
The '''Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya''' ([[Pāli|Pali]] for "Great Monastery") was an important monastery for [[Theravada Buddhism]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. It was founded by king [[Devanampiya Tissa]] (247–207 BCE) in his capital [[Anuradhapura]]. The Mahavihara was the place where the Mahavihara orthodoxy was established by monks such as [[Buddhaghosa]]. The traditional Theravadin account provided by the Mahavamsa stands in contrast to the writings of the [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] monk [[Faxian]] (Ch. 法顯), who journeyed to [[India]] and Sri Lanka in the early 5th century (between 399 and 414 CE). He recorded that the Mahavihara was not only intact, but housed 3000 monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter XXXIX: The Cremation of an Arhat |work=A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2124 |accessdate=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michel Callon''' (born 1945) is a professor of sociology at the [[École des mines de Paris]] and member of the [[Centre de sociologie de l'innovation]]. He is an influential author in the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]] and one of the leading proponents of [[actor–network theory]] (ANT) with [[Bruno Latour]].

== Recent career ==
In recent years (since the late 1990s), Michel Callon has spearheaded the movement of applying ANT approaches to study economic life (notably economic markets). This body of work interrogates the interrelation between the economy and economics, highlighting the ways in which economics (and economics-inspired disciplines such as marketing) shapes the economy (see Callon, 1998 and 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10241">'''Musical expression''' is the art of playing or singing with a personal response to the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|title=Expression|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpression}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a practical level, this means making appropriate use of [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[timbre]] and [[Articulation (music)|articulation]] to bring the music to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|title=Expression|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpression}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Composers may specify these aspects of expression to a greater or lesser extent in the [[musical notation|notation]] of their [[Full score|musical score]].

The nature of musical expression has also been discussed at a theoretical level throughout of the history of [[classical music]]. One common view is that music both expresses and evokes emotion, forming a conduit for emotional communication between the musician and the audience. This view has been present through most of musical history, though it was most clearly expressed in musical [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|title=Expression|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpression}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, emotion's role in music has been challenged on occasion by those like [[Igor Stravinsky]] who see music as a pure art form and expression as an irrelevant distraction.

==Mimesis and rhetoric==
In the [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]] and [[Classical (music)|Classical]] periods of music, music (and [[aesthetics]] as a whole) was strongly influenced by Aristotle's theory of ''[[Mimesis#Aristotle|mimesis]]''. Art represented the perfection and imitation of nature, speech and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kovaleff Baker|first1=Nancy|title=Expression - History before 1800 |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138#S09138.1.1|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpressionbefore1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As speech was taken as a model for music, composition and performance in the Baroque period were strongly influenced by [[rhetoric]]. According to what has become known as the [[Doctrine of the affections|theory of affect]], a musician was expected to stir feelings in his audience in much the same way as an orator making a speech in accordance with the rules of classical rhetoric. As a result, the aim of a piece of music was to produce a particular emotion, for instance joy, sadness, anger or calm. The harmony, melody, tonality, metre and structure of the music worked to this end, as did all the aspects under the performer's control such as articulation and dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buelow|first1=George|title=Rhetoric|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43166#S43166.1.4|website=Grove Music Online (subscriber only access)|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveRhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Johann Joachim Quantz]] wrote,
{{Quote|text=The orator and the musician have, at bottom, the same aim in regard to both the preparation and the final execution of their productions, namely to make themselves the masters of the hearts of their listeners, to arouse or still their passions, and to transport them now to this sentiment, now that.|author=Joseph Joachim Quantz|source=On Playing the Flute (trans E.R. Reilly), London &amp; New York, 1966 }}

Baroque composers used expressive markings relatively rarely,  so it can be a challenge for musicians today to interpret Baroque scores, in particular if they adopt a [[historically informed performance]] perspective and aim to recreate an approach that might have been recognised at the time. There are no universal rules in doing so, but there are some broad principles. Looking at the [[rhythm]] of a piece, slow rhythms tend to be serious while quick ones tend towards light and frivolous. In the melodic line, small intervals typically represented melancholy while large leaps were used to represent joy.&lt;ref name="Tarling4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarling|first1=Judy|title=Baroque String Playing for Ingenious Learners|date=2000|publisher=Corda Music|location=Tring|isbn=978-0-9528220-1-1|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In harmony, the choice of [[Dissonance (music)|dissonance]]s used had a significant effect on which emotion was intended (or produced), and Quantz recommended that the more extreme the dissonance, the louder it should be played. A [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] normally represented the end of a sentence.&lt;ref name="Tarling203"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarling|first1=Judy|title=Baroque String Playing for Ingenious Learners|date=2000|publisher=Corda Music|location=Tring|isbn=978-0-9528220-1-1|pages=203–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetorical approach to music begged the philosophical question of whether stirring the listener's passions in this manner was compatible with Aristotle's idea that art was only effective because it imitated nature. Some writers on music in the 18th century stayed closely true to Aristotle, with [[Charles Batteux]] writing that the sole unifying principle of taste and beauty was the reproduction of the ideal form that lay behind natural things. However, this view was challenged by others who felt that the role of music was to produce an emotional effect. For instance, [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] wrote in 1772 that: "‘it will appear, that the finest parts of poetry, musick, and painting, are expressive of the passions, and operate on our minds by sympathy; that the inferior parts of them are descriptive of natural objects, and affect us chiefly by substitution’".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kovaleff Baker|first1=Nancy|title=Expression - History before 1800 |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138#S09138.1.1|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpressionbefore1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785, [[Michel Paul Guy de Chabanon|Michel de Chabanon]] proposed that music was best understood as its own language, which then prompted an emotional response linked to but not limited by the musical expression. The same music could be associated with a wide range of emotional responses in the listener. Chabanon rejected the rhetorical approach to music, because he did not believe that there was a simple correspondence between musical characteristics and emotional affects. Much subsequent philosophy of music depended on Chabanon's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kovaleff Baker|first1=Nancy|title=Expression - History before 1800 |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138#S09138.1.1|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpressionbefore1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic era==
Around the start of the 19th Century, the idea of music as a kind of 'ultimate language of the emotions'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paddison|first1=Max|title=Expression: History -  After 1800|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09138#S09138.1.2|website=Grove Music Online (subscriber only access)|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 July 2017|ref=GroveExpressionAfter1800}}&lt;/ref&gt; gained currency.  The new aesthetic doctrine of [[Romanticism]] placed sublime, heightened emotion at the core of artistic experience, and communicating these emotions became the aim of musical performance. Music was expected to convey intense feelings, highly personal to the vision of the composer. As the 19th century developed, [[musical nationalism]] extended these emotions beyond the personal level to embodying the feelings of entire nations.&lt;ref name="ABRSMRomantic4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hugh Macdonald|authorlink1=Historical Background|editor1-last=Burton|editor1-first=Anthony|title=Performer's Guide to Music of the Romantic Period|date=2002|publisher=ABRSM|location=London|isbn=978 1 86096 194 6|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This emphasis on emotional communication was supported by an increasing confidence in using more complex [[harmony]], and by instruments and ensembles capable of greater extremes of [[dynamics (music)|dynamic]]. At the start of the 19th century, {{serif|pp}} and {{serif|ff}} were the most extreme dynamic markings commonly used, but by the late century {{serif|pppp}} and {{serif|ffff}}. Romantic composers also made increasingly detailed use of expressive markings like crescendos and diminuendos, accents and articulation markings.&lt;ref name="ABRSMRomantic16"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hugh Macdonald|authorlink1=Historical Background|editor1-last=Burton|editor1-first=Anthony|title=Performer's Guide to Music of the Romantic Period|date=2002|publisher=ABRSM|location=London|isbn=978 1 86096 194 6|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Against expression==
After the increasing dominance of expression and emotion in music during the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a backlash.

"Most people like music because it gives them certain emotions such as joy, grief, sadness, and image of nature, a subject for daydreams or – still better – oblivion from “everyday life”. They want a drug – dope -…. Music would not be worth much if it were reduced to such an end. When people have learned to love music for itself, when they listen with other ears, their enjoyment will be of a far higher and more potent order, and they will be able to judge it on a higher plane and realise its intrinsic value." - Igor Stravinsky &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stravinsky on expression in music |url=https://theoryofmusic.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/stravinsky-on-expression-in-music/|website=Theory of Music|accessdate=8 7 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National Solar Thermal Test Facility
During the late 1970s, rising fuel costs and the demand for a cleaner environment gave impetus to advance technology which used solar energy to create electricity.  Studies identified the central receiver concept as having high potential to generate electricity on a large scale.  The United States government initiated support through the [[National Science Foundation]] [[Research Applied to National Needs]] (RANN) program in 1972 which was eventually funded by the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]].  Six central receiver pilot plants were constructed including the 5 MW (thermal) test facility at [[Sandia National Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz, Patricia Falcone, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, "A Handbook for Solar Central Receiver Design." SAND 86-8009 Unlimited Release. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility overview==

===Heliostat field===
[[Image:NSTTF heliostat field.jpg|thumb|right|The [[heliostat]] field at Sandia National. Labs.]]
The heliostat field has 218 individual heliostats. This capability directly supports the SunShot goals by providing flux levels of greater than 250 W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and total power in excess of 6 MWt. Each heliostat has two motors and two drives (one azimuth and one elevation), one 480 V power box, one electronics box, and one control box and associated cabling. The total reflective area on each heliostat is 37 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reflectivity on the recently replaced facets is 96%.

===Solar tower===
[[Image:NSTTF SolarTower Sandia National Labs.jpg|thumb|right|The [[solar power tower]] field at Sandia National. Labs.]]
The tower is a 61&amp;nbsp;m (200&amp;nbsp;ft) high concrete structure with three test locations on the north side and the top of the tower. The tower can support testing for CSP experiments and large-scale, high-flux materials samples. The equipment in the tower includes a 100-ton capacity elevating module for lifting experiments to the top of the tower, internal cranes for receiver fabrication, water glycol cooling systems and air coolers to provide heat removal from experiments, air compressors, control valves, generators, uninterruptible power supplies, piping systems, and pressure-relief valves.

===Molten salt test loop===
The molten salt test loop directly supports the SunShot goals by providing development for thermal energy storage costs ≤$15/kWhth and by allowing greater collection efficiencies and higher-temperature operation for linear Fresnel and trough systems through utilization of molten salt HTF. The facility also provides a means of performing accelerated lifetime testing on components, thus reducing the risk of the technology. Though operating below 600&amp;nbsp;°C, many of the lessons learned at this facility will be directly applicable to molten salt systems operating in the SunShot temperature range ≥ 650&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11934 |title=Sandia National Laboratories: Molten Salt Test Loop |publisher=Energy.sandia.gov |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2012-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218180903/http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11934 |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dish test facility===
This area of the site allows industry partners to install full-scale solar dishes for long-term reliability testing and evaluation. There are currently ten dishes from [[Stirling Energy Systems]] and six [[Infinia]] dishes at this location. The site also includes two SNL-developed solar dishes that are available for research. Solar dishes can be used for the high-temperature portions of the SunShot goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11958 |title=Sandia National Laboratories: Dish Test Facility |publisher=Energy.sandia.gov |date=2012-09-26 |accessdate=2012-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218181207/http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11958 |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giotto di Bondone - Navicella - WGA09363.jpg|thumb|300px|The 1628 full-size copy in oil in the Vatican]]
[[File:Parri spinelli, copia della navicella di giotto, metropolitan museum.jpg|thumb|300px|Drawing of the lost mosaic by [[Parri Spinelli]], about 1420, once owned by [[Vasari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/90005191 Parri Spinelli, "Free Copy of Giotto's Navicella"], Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''''Navicella''''' (literally "little ship") of [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, was a large and famous [[mosaic]] by [[Giotto di Bondone]] that occupied a large part of the wall above the entrance arcade, facing the main facade of the basilica across the courtyard. It depicted the version from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (Matthew 14:24–32) of [[Jesus' walk on water|Christ walking on the water]], the only one of the three gospel accounts where [[Saint Peter]] is summoned to join him.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts of the miracle appear in three Gospels: [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:22|Matthew 14:22–33]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:45|Mark 6:45–52]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#6:16|John 6:16–21]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was almost entirely destroyed during the construction of the new [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in the 17th century, but fragments were preserved from the sides of the composition, and what is effectively a new work, incorporating some original fragments, was restored to a position at the centre of the portico of the new building in 1675.&lt;ref&gt;"St Peter's"; Lubbock, 158; Tomei, 31; Nicholls, 162; [http://www.bridgemanart.com/asset/279736/Giotto-di-Bondone-c.1266-1337-after/The-Navicella-of-St.-Peter-mosaic-bw-photo?search_context={%22url%22%3A%22\%2Fsearch\%2Flocation\%2FSt.-Peter%27s-Vatican-City\%2F3734%22%2C%22num_results%22%3A17%2C%22search_type%22%3A%22location_assets%22%2C%22sort_order%22%3A%22asset_id%22%2C%22location_id%22%3A%223734%22%2C%22item_index%22%3A16} Present image], from Bridgeman Art Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosaic, designed to be seen from a distance, was extremely large. A full-scale copy in oil, commissioned by the Vatican from [[Francesco Berretta]] in 1628, after much of the work had already been lost round the edges, measures {{convert|7.4|x|9.9|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/html/g/giotto/zz_misc/y_mosaic/11navice.html WGA]&lt;/ref&gt; The full mosaic was probably about {{convert|9.4|x|13|m|ft}}, with an inscription in Latin verse running below the image.&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 34; Tomei, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The mosaic was commissioned in 1298 by [[Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi]], canon of St. Peter's, whose [[donor portrait]] was to the right of Christ's feet.&lt;ref&gt;Hösl, Ignaz, "Kardinal Jacobus Gaietani Stefaneschi: Ein Beitrag zur Literatur- und Kirchengeschichte des beginnenden vierzehnten Jahrhunderts," Berlin, 1908. &lt;/ref&gt; Giotto's mosaic therefore belonged to the preparations of St. Peters for the [[holy year]] in 1300. The date of the commission is attested by a document copied in the 17th century. There are no indications of a later dating, nor are there indications that Giotto's mosaic replaced an older one. &lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Leben: mit einer Sammlung der Urkunden und Texte bis Vasari (Giottus Pictor I) Wien: Böhlau, 2004. Pg. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Stefaneschi's obituary of 1347, the work cost 2,200 [[florin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tomei, 30&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to an official document from 1298,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Leben: mit einer Sammlung der Urkunden und Texte bis Vasari (Giottus Pictor I) Wien: Böhlau, 2004. Pg. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt; references to the work as by Giotto are found in a Vatican [[necrology]] entry for Cardinal Stefaneschi recording his death in 1343, and then the Latin chronicle of Giotto's home city [[Florence]] written in the late 14th century by [[Filippo Villani]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

It was rectangular, and positioned so that those leaving the basilica saw it across the courtyard outside the church, and passed under it if they left by the main route.&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 34; [http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lookandlearn-preview/M/M098/M098735.jpg Later print of the original location]&lt;/ref&gt;  A figure of a man fishing on the shore to the left was thought to be a self-portrait of Giotto, as [[Vasari]]'s ''Life'' records.  The composition was dominated by the fishing boat with its large sail, which represented a metaphor of the "Ship of the Church", whose "captain" on earth was Saint Peter and his successors as [[Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;St Peter's&lt;/ref&gt;  It was commissioned at a very difficult time for the Papacy, who were unable even to control the gangsterish nobility of Rome, and had therefore left the city, but the image promised that both church and Papacy were, with the help of Christ, "unsinkable".&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 36; Paoletti &amp; Radke, 65&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the eleven figures still in the boat, it has been suggested that the one holding the [[tiller]] is (anachronistically in terms of the Gospels) [[Saint Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, 164, reporting Köhren-Jansen, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In the sky, two almost naked classical style "wind god" figures blow through horns or funnels, one from each side, below pairs of haloed male figures.&lt;!-- who? anyone? The 4 Evangelists? --&gt;  Giotto would have produced drawings for specialist mosaic workers to recreate on the wall; whether he had any further involvement as the work was created is unknown.

The subject is depicted elsewhere in [[medieval art]] of the period, and later works like [[fresco]]s in the "Spanish Chapel" of [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella#Spanish Chapel|Santa Maria Novella]] in Florence, and in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] by [[Masaccio]] (or perhaps his colleague [[Masolino]]), and one of the [[bronze]] relief panels on [[Ghiberti]]'s north doors of the [[Florence Baptistery]].&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, 158–160&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used on Papal coins and medals, though usually with Peter in the boat, often as the only figure.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, 163; [http://www.coinarchives.com/w/results.php?search=Navicella&amp;s=0&amp;results=100 Examples from www.coinarchives.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the only modern (post-classical) work described in [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s ''[[De Pictura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, 199; Lubbock, 158&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a large depiction of a maritime scene was unprecedented in [[marine art]], at least since classical times.

The arcade across the courtyard and its mosaic was at first unaffected by the protracted and complicated rebuilding of the main basilica, but in the 17th century the mosaic underwent a complicated series of four moves and restorations or remodellings in 1610, 1618, 1629 and 1674/75 which finally took it to its present size, condition and location above the main door inside the portico of the new church.&lt;ref&gt;See Kleinhenz 749, Capresi 36, Tomei, 31, though none give a coherent account of the process.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragments==
Only two bust-length figures of angels in [[roundel]]s survive from the original;&lt;ref&gt;Tomei, 31;  Moioli et al., 244&lt;/ref&gt; one remains in the Vatican, while the other was given to the church of San Pietro Ispano in [[Boville Ernica]] in 1610, when the mosaic was first removed from its original place. The former is considerably restored (in 1924, 1950 and 1975–80), and was discovered underneath later work in 1911 (or 1924). The Boville Ernica fragment consisted of little original substance and was completely restored between 1888 and 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Werke (Giottus Pictor II) Wien: Böhlau, 2008, Pg. 262-263.
[[File:Bilder-50617-15704-original.tif|thumb|Fragment in Boville Ernica, before restoration.]]
&lt;/ref&gt; Despite none of the copies of the original including these figures it is thought they were part of the original, probably in a border.&lt;ref&gt;Papacy, 6–7; Tomei, 31; Moioli et al., who give the date of discovery of the Vatican fragment as 1924, and the dates of subsequent work&lt;/ref&gt;  There are thought to be some patches of original work remaining in the mosaic still in St Peter's, which is now semi-circular with a straight bottom edge to fit into a [[lunette]]. Areas where original work seems to survive are in "the gilded edge of the ship, the sail blown by the wind, various sections of some apostles".&lt;ref&gt;Vatican&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The style of the work can now only be judged from the two angel fragments, restored as they are. Vasari's description emphasized the varied reactions of the figures in the boat as they saw Peter sinking below the waves, and the patient expression on the face of the fisherman on the shore, who, like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s ploughman in ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'' seems to ignore the dramatic scene on the water in concentrating on his own task.  But, as [[Svetlana Alpers]] has shown, these were the terms in which Vasari tended to describe large [[history painting]]s he admired, though [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s description in ''[[De pictura]]'' also "treats ...[the work] as a psychological narrative".&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, 190–192, 199 (quoted); Lubbock, 158 quotes from Alberti&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars, working from the fragments, emphasize the influence of the major Roman artist of the day, [[Pietro Cavallini]], who was also patronized by Cardinal Stefanesci, and of the Late Antique and Early Medieval works to be seen in Rome.  According to [[John White (art historian)|John White]]: "The relatively schematic, linear quality of much late-thirteenth- and early-fourteenth-century work is wholly absent.  The impressionistic technique and range of colour both derive from the fifth century. It is impossible to say how much this technique reflects the ideas of Giotto himself and how much those of the skilled mosaicists working under him. The two heads are, however, closely related both to the work of Cavallini, whose art still dominated the Roman scene, and to the basic type of physiognomy developed on the walls of the [[Arena Chapel]]."&lt;ref&gt;White, 332 (quoted); see also Calvesi, 40, and Paoletti &amp; Radke, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies==
There are a number of records of the original design in drawings and prints—at least 17 are recorded.  The earliest are a number of drawings attributed to the Florentine artist [[Parri Spinelli]] (c. 1387–1453), of which the most detailed is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and others are in [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and [[Bayonne]]. However, the variations between these, and other drawings by Spinelli of surviving works, show that he was in the habit of making rather loose interpretations of works that he recorded in drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Bean, no. 2 (New York); Dunbar, 104–110 (Cleveland)&lt;/ref&gt; Most later copies date from after parts of the mosaic were already lost, and none form a complete record of the full design. Some prints, like an [[engraving]] by [[Nicolas Beatrizet]] of about 1559, are reversed (mirror-image) copies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/24364447@N05/6559941119/ image on flickr] of the Beatrizet; [http://www2.printsanddrawings.hu/search/prints/8875/ Unreversed print of 1567] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130702063243/http://www2.printsanddrawings.hu/search/prints/8875/ |date=2013-07-02 }}, by Mario Labacco, from Budapest.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gospel account==
Only in the account in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:22|Matthew 14:24–33]] does Peter also leave the boat to walk on the waves:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea.
And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.
But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters.
And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.
And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.
And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vision of St Catherine of Siena==
On the evening of January 29, 1380, at the time of [[Vespers]], Saint [[Catherine of Siena]], who had been contemplating the mosaic for some hours, suddenly felt as if "the ship had fallen off and landed on her shoulders" with "unbearable weight".  She apparently never walked again, and died three months later.&lt;ref&gt;Papetros, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Age''' is a term applied to a range of [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices that developed in [[Western culture|Western nations]] during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the New Age differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly [[eclecticism|eclectic]] structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of '''spiritual''' or '''Mind, Body, Spirit''' and rarely use the term "New Age" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the '''New Age movement''', although others contest this term and suggest that it is better seen as a [[milieu]] or [[zeitgeist]].

&lt;!--History of the New Age--&gt;
As a form of [[Western esotericism]], the New Age drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and [[Franz Mesmer]], as well as the ideas of [[Spiritualism]], [[New Thought]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the [[UFO religions]] of the 1950s, the [[Counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[Human Potential Movement]], also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age. The exact origins of the phenomenon remain contested, but there is general agreement that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. By the start of the 21st century, the term "New Age" was increasingly rejected within this milieu, with some scholars arguing that the New Age phenomenon had ended.  

&lt;!--Core Beliefs--&gt;
Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age have been identified. [[Theology|Theologically]], the New Age typically adopts a belief in a [[Holism|holistic]] form of divinity that imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as [[angel]]s and [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|masters]], with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of [[Mediumship#Channeling|channeling]]. Typically viewing human history as being divided into a series of distinct ages, a common New Age belief is that whereas once humanity lived in an age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom, it has entered a period of spiritual degeneracy, which will be remedied through the establishment of a coming [[Age of Aquarius]], from which the milieu gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of [[alternative medicine]], and an emphasis on a New Age "science" that seeks to unite science and spirituality.

&lt;!--Sociological factors--&gt;
Centred primarily in Western countries, those involved in the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous communities]]. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of [[religious studies]].

==Definitions==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="One of the few things on which all scholars agree concerning New Age is that it is difficult to define. Often, the definition given actually reflects the background of the scholar giving the definition. Thus, the New Ager views New Age as a revolutionary period of history dictated by the stars; the Christian apologist has often defined new age as a cult; the historian of ideas understands it as a manifestation of the perennial tradition; the philosopher sees New Age as a monistic or holistic worldview; the sociologist describes New Age as a new religious movement (NRM); while the psychologist describes it as a form of narcissism."|source=— Scholar of religion Daren Kemp, 2004.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=1}} }}

The New Age phenomenon has proved difficult to define,{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=2001|1p=363|2a1=Kemp|2y=2004|2p=1|3a1=Granholm|3y=2013|3p=59}} with much scholarly disagreement as to its scope.{{sfn|Granholm|2013|p=59}} The scholars Steven J. Sutcliffe and Ingvild Sælid Gilhus have even suggested that it remains "among the most disputed of categories in the study of religion".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=1}}

The scholar of religion [[Paul Heelas]] characterised the New Age as "...an eclectic hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, and ways of life" that can be identified as a singular phenomenon through their use of "...the same (or very similar) ''[[lingua franca]]'' to do with the human (and planetary) condition and how it can be [[Spiritual transformation| transformed]]."{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=1–2}} Similarly, the historian of religion [[Olav Hammer]] termed it "a common denominator for a variety of quite divergent contemporary popular practices and beliefs" that have emerged since the late 1970s and are "largely united by historical links, a shared discourse and an ''air de famille''".{{sfn|Hammer|2006|p=855}} According to Hammer, this New Age was a "fluid and fuzzy [[cult]]ic milieu".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=14}} The [[Sociology of religion|sociologist of religion]] [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] described the New Age as "...an umbrella term that includes a great variety of groups and identities" that are united by their "...expectation of a major and universal change being primarily founded on the individual and collective development of human potential."{{sfn|York|1995|pp=1–2}}

The scholar of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] adopted a different approach by asserting that "New Age" was "a ''label'' attached indiscriminately to whatever seems to fit it" and that as a result it "means very different things to different people".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=1}} He thus argued against the idea that the New Age could be considered "a unified ideology or ''[[World view|Weltanschauung]]''",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=515}} although he believed that it could be considered a "more or less unified 'movement'."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=522}} Conversely, various other scholars have suggested that the New Age is insufficiently homogenous to be regarded as a singular ''movement''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bruce|1y=1998|1p=24|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=9|3a1= Chryssides|3y=2007|3p=22}} As a replacement term, the sociologist of religion Steven Bruce suggested that New Age was better seen as a [[milieu]],{{sfn|Bruce|1998|p=24}} while scholar of religion [[George D. Chryssides]] suggested that it could be understood as "a counter-cultural ''Zeitgeist''".{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=22}}

There is no central authority within the New Age phenomenon that can determine what counts as New Age and what does not.{{sfn|York|2001|p=364}}
Many of those groups and individuals who could analytically be categorised as part of the New Age reject the term "New Age" in reference to themselves.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1992|1pp=1–2|2a1= Heelas|2y=1996|2p=17|3a1=York|3y=2001|3p=364|4a1= Sutcliffe|4y=2003a|4p=200|5a1=Partridge|5y=2004|5p=2|6a1=MacKian|6y=2012|6p=5}} Some even express active hostility to the term.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=177}} Rather than terming themselves "New Agers", those involved in this milieu commonly describe themselves as spiritual "seekers",{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=200}} and some self-identify as a member of a different religious group, such as Christianity, Judaism, or Buddhism.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=25}} In 2003 Sutcliffe observed that the use of the term "New Age" was "optional, episodic and declining overall", adding that among the very few individuals who did use it, they usually did so with qualification, for instance by placing it in quotation marks.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=197}} Other academics, such as Sara MacKian, have argued that the sheer diversity of the New Age renders the term too problematic for scholars to use.{{sfnm|1a1=Chryssides|1y=2007|1p=10|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=7}} MacKian proposed "everyday spirituality" as an alternate term.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=12}}

While acknowledging that "New Age" was a problematic term, the scholar of religion  [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] stated that it remained a useful [[etic]] category for scholars to use because, "There exists no comparable term which covers all aspects of the movement."{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=2}} Similarly, Chryssides argued that the fact that "New Age" is a "theoretical concept" does not "undermine its usefulness or employability"; he drew comparisons with "[[Hinduism]]", a similar "western etic piece of vocabulary" that scholars of religion used despite its problems.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=13}}

===Religion, spirituality, and esotericism===

In discussing the New Age, academics have varyingly referred to "New Age spirituality" and "New Age religion".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=1}} Those involved in the New Age rarely consider it to be "religion"—negatively associating that term solely with [[organized religion]]—and instead describe their practices as "spirituality".{{sfnm|1a1=Sutcliffe|1y=2003a|1pp=214–215|2a1= Partridge|2y=2004|2p=48}} Religious studies scholars, however, have repeatedly referred to the New Age milieu as a "religion".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=243|2a1= Partridge|2y=2004|2p=38}} York described the New Age as a [[new religious movement]] (NRM).{{sfn|York|1995|p=2}} Conversely, both Heelas and Sutcliffe rejected this categorisation;{{sfnm|1a1= Heelas|1y=1996|1p=9|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=200}} Heelas believed that while elements of the New Age represented NRMs, this did not apply to every New Age group.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=9}} Similarly, Chryssides stated that the New Age could not be seen as "a religion" in itself.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=19}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="The New Age movement is the cultic milieu having become conscious of itself, in the later 1970s, as constituting a more or less unified "movement". All manifestations of this movement are characterized by a popular western culture criticism expressed in terms of a secularized esotericism."|source=— Scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff, 1996.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=522}} }}

The New Age is also a form of [[Western esotericism]].{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=33|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=400|3a1=Hammer|3y=2001|3p=9}} Hanegraaff regarded the New Age as a form of "popular culture criticism", in that it represented a reaction against the dominant Western values of [[Judeo-Christian]] religion and rationalism,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=331}} adding that "New Age religion formulates such criticism not at random, but falls back on" the ideas of earlier Western esoteric groups.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=515}}

The New Age has also been identified by various scholars of religion as part of the [[cultic milieu]].{{sfnm|1a1= Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=522|2a1= Hammer|2y=2001|2p=28|3a1= Chryssides|3y=2007|3p=17}} This concept, developed by the sociologist [[Colin Campbell (sociologist)|Colin Campbell]], refers to a social network of marginalised ideas. Through their shared marginalisation within a given society, these disparate ideas interact and create new syntheses.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=28–29}}

Hammer identified much of the New Age as corresponding to the concept of "[[folk religions]]" in that it seeks to deal with [[existential]] questions regarding subjects like death and disease in "an unsystematic fashion, often through a process of [[bricolage]] from already available narratives and rituals".{{sfn|Hammer|2006|p=855}} York also heuristically divides the New Age into three broad trends. The first, the ''social camp'', represents groups that primarily seek to bring about social change, while the second, the ''occult camp'', instead focus on contact with spirit entities and channeling. York's third group, the ''spiritual camp'', represents a middle ground between these two camps that focuses largely on [[self-development | individual development]].{{sfn|York|1995|pp=36–37}}

===Terminology===

The term ''new age'', along with related terms like ''new era'' and ''new world'', long predate the emergence of the New Age movement, and have widely been used to assert that a better way of life for humanity is dawning.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=15}} It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the [[Great Seal of the United States]], designed in 1782, proclaims a "new order of ages", while in the 1980s the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] proclaimed that "all mankind is entering a new age".{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=15}} The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=25}}  In 1864 the American [[Swedenborgian]] [[Warren Felt Evans]] published ''The New Age and its Message'', while in 1907 [[Alfred Orage]] and [[Holbrook Jackson]] began editing a weekly journal of [[Liberal Christianity|Christian liberalism]] and [[socialism]] titled ''[[The New Age]]''.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=17}} The concept of a coming "new age" that would be inaugurated by the [[Second Coming | return to Earth]] of [[Jesus Christ]] was a theme in the poetry of [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]] and [[Johanna Brandt]],{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=26}} and then also appeared in the work of the American Theosophist [[Alice Bailey]], who used the term prominently in such titles as ''Disciplineship in the New Age'' (1944) and ''Education in the New Age'' (1954).{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=26}}

Between the 1930s and 1960s a small number of groups and individuals became preoccupied with the concept of a coming "New Age" and prominently used the term accordingly.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=55}} The term had thus become a recurring motif in the esoteric spirituality milieu.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=99}}
Sutcliffe therefore expressed the view that while the term "New Age" had originally been an "apocalyptic emblem", it would only be later that it became "a tag or codeword for a 'spiritual' idiom".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=29}}

==History==

===Antecedents===
{{double image|right|Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.jpg|141|CGJung.jpg|140|Prominent esoteric thinkers who influenced the New Age include [[Helena Blavatsky]] (left) and [[Carl Jung]] (right)}}

According to scholar [[Nevill Drury]], the New Age has a "tangible history",{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=10}} although Hanegraaff expressed the view that most New Agers were "surprisingly ignorant about the actual historical roots of their beliefs".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=323}} Similarly, Hammer thought that "source amnesia" was a "building block of a New Age worldview", with New Agers typically adopting ideas with no awareness of where those ideas originated.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=180}}

As a form of Western esotericism,{{sfn|York|1995|p=33}} the New Age has antecedents that stretch back to southern Europe in [[Late Antiquity]].{{sfn|Ellwood|1992|p=59}} Following the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed in response to the development of scientific rationality. Scholars call this new esoteric trend ''[[occultism]]'', and this occultism was a key factor in the development of the worldview from which the New Age emerged.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=406–407}}

One of the earliest influences on the New Age was the Swedish 18th century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who professed the ability to communicate with angels, demons, and spirits. Swedenborg's attempt to unite science and religion and his prediction of a coming era in particular have been cited as ways that he prefigured the New Age.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=424–429|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=42}} Another early influence was the late 18th and early 19th century German physician and [[hypnotist]] [[Franz Mesmer]], who claimed the existence of a force known as "[[animal magnetism]]" running through the human body.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=430–435|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=41}} The establishment of [[Spiritualism]], an occult religion influenced by both Swedenborgianism and Mesmerism, in the U.S. during the 1840s has also been identified as a precursor to the New Age, in particular through its rejection of established Christianity, its claims to representing a scientific approach to religion, and its emphasis on channeling spirit entities.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=435|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=24|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=37}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="Most of the beliefs which characterise the New Age were already present by the end of the 19th century, even to such an extent that one may legitimately wonder whether the New Age brings anything new at all."|source=— Historian of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]], 1996.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=482–483}} }}

A further major influence on the New Age was the [[Theosophical Society]], an occult group co-founded by the Russian [[Helena Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. In her books ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877) and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), Blavatsky claimed that her Society was conveying the essence of all world religions, and it thus emphasized a focus on [[comparative religion]].{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=448–455|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=24|4a1=Kemp|4y=2004|4p=39}} Serving as a partial bridge between Theosophical ideas and those of the New Age was the American esotericist [[Edgar Cayce]], who founded the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]].{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=60|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2p=66}} Another influence was [[New Thought]], which developed in late nineteenth century [[New England]] as a Christian-oriented healing movement before spreading throughout the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=35|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=455–462|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=38}} Another prominent influence was the psychologist [[Carl Jung]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=46–47|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2pp=69–70}} 
Drury also identified as an important influence upon the New Age the Indian [[Swami Vivekananda]], an adherent of the philosophy of [[Vedanta]] who first brought Hinduism to the West in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Drury|2004|pp=27–28}}

Hanegraaff believed that the New Age's direct antecedents could be found in the [[UFO religion]]s of the 1950s, which he termed a "proto-New Age movement".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=95–96}} Many of these new religious movements had strong apocalyptic beliefs regarding a coming new age, which they typically asserted would be brought about by contact with extraterrestrials.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=95–96|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=72}} Examples of such groups included the [[Aetherius Society]], founded in the UK in 1955, and the [[Heralds of the New Age]], established in New Zealand in 1956.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=72, 74}}

=== 1960s ===
From a historical perspective, the New Age phenomenon is rooted in the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=11|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=15}} Although not common throughout the counterculture, usage of the terms "New Age" and "Age of Aquarius" – used in reference to a coming era – were found within it,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=108–109}} for instance appearing on adverts for the [[Woodstock]] festival of 1969,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=109}} and in the lyrics of "[[Aquarius (song)|Aquarius]]", the opening song of the 1967 musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=10|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=109|3a1=Sutcliffe|3a2=Gilhus|3y=2013|3p=4}}
This decade also witnessed the emergence of a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the [[San Francisco Zen Center]], [[Transcendental Meditation]], [[Soka Gakkai]], the [[Inner Peace Movement]], the [[Church of All Worlds]], and the [[Church of Satan]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=53–54}} Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century,{{sfn|Brown|1992|pp=88–89}} many of these new developments were variants of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sufism]], which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the [[Asian Exclusion Act]] in 1965.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=54–55}} In 1962 the [[Esalen Institute]] was established in [[Big Sur]], [[California]].{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1pp=36–37|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3pp=38–39|4a1=Heelas|4y=1996|4p=51}} Esalen and similar personal growth centers had developed links to [[humanistic psychology]], and from this, the [[human potential movement]] emerged, strongly influenced the New Age.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1pp=36, 41–43|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=8|3a1=Heelas|3y=1996|3p=53}}

In Britain, a number of small religious groups that came to be identified as the "light" movement had begun declaring the existence of a coming new age, influenced strongly by the Theosophical ideas of Blavatsky and Bailey.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=20}} The most prominent of these groups was the [[Findhorn Foundation]], which founded the Findhorn Ecovillage in the Scottish area of [[Findhorn]], [[Moray]] in 1962.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3pp=38–39|4a1=Heelas|4y=1996|4p=51|5a1=Chryssides|5y=2007|5p=8}} Although its founders were from an older generation, Findhorn attracted increasing numbers of countercultural baby boomers during the 1960s, to the extent that its population had grown sixfold to circa 120 residents by 1972.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=118}} In October 1965, the founder of Findhorn, [[Peter Caddy]], attended a meeting of various prominent figures within Britain's esoteric milieu; titled "The Significance of the Group in the New Age", it was held at [[Attingham Park]] over the course of a weekend.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=83–84}}

All of these groups created the backdrop from which the New Age movement emerged. As James R. Lewis and [[J. Gordon Melton]] point out, the New Age phenomenon represents "a synthesis of many different preexisting movements and strands of thought".{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=xi}} Nevertheless, York asserted that while the New Age bore many similarities with both earlier forms of Western esotericism and Asian religion, it remained "distinct from its predecessors in its own self-consciousness as a new way of thinking".{{sfn|York|1995|p=1}}

===Emergence and development: c. 1970–2000===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The late 1950s saw the first stirrings within the cultic milieu of a belief in a coming new age. A variety of small movements arose, revolving around revealed messages from beings in space and presenting a synthesis of post-Theosophical and other esoteric doctrines. These movements might have remained marginal, had it not been for the explosion of the counterculture in the 1960s and early 1970s. Various historical threads... began to converge: nineteenth century doctrinal elements such as Theosophy and post-Theosophical esotericism as well as harmonious or positive thinking were now eclectically combined with... religious psychologies: transpersonal psychology, Jungianism and a variety of Eastern teachings. It became perfectly feasible for the same individuals to consult the I Ching, practice Jungian astrology, read Abraham Maslow's writings on peak experiences, etc. The reason for the ready incorporation of such disparate sources was a similar goal of exploring an individualized and largely non-Christian religiosity."|source=— Scholar of esotericism Olav Hammer, 2001.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=73}} }}

By the early 1970s, use of the term "New Age" was increasingly common within the cultic milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=73}} This was because—according to Sutcliffe—the "emblem" of the "New Age" had been passed from the "subcultural pioneers" in groups like Findhorn to the wider array of "countercultural baby boomers" between ''circa'' 1967 and 1974. He noted that as this happened, the meaning of the term "New Age" changed; whereas it had once referred specifically to a coming era, at this point it came to be used in a wider sense to refer to a variety of spiritual activities and practices.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=112}} In the latter part of the 1970s, the New Age expanded to cover a wide variety of alternative spiritual and religious beliefs and practices, not all of which explicitly held to the belief in the Age of Aquarius, but were nevertheless widely recognised as broadly similar in their search for "alternatives" to mainstream society.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97}} In doing so, the "New Age" became a banner under which to bring together the wider "cultic milieu" of American society.{{sfn|York|1995|p=33}}

The counterculture of the 1960s had rapidly declined by the start of the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the [[commune]] movement,{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=54}} but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and [[hippie]] subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=xi}}
The exact origins of the New Age movement remain an issue of debate; Melton asserted that it emerged in the early 1970s,{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=18}} whereas Hanegraaff instead traced its emergence to the latter 1970s, adding that it then entered its full development in the 1980s.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=12}} This early form of the movement was based largely in Britain and exhibited a strong influence from Theosophy and [[Anthroposophy]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97}} Hanegraaff termed this early core of the movement the ''New Age sensu stricto'', or "New Age in the strict sense".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=97|2a1=Sutcliffe|2a2=Gilhus|2y=2013|2p=4}}

Hanegraaff terms the broader development the ''New Age sensu lato'', or "New Age in the wider sense".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=97|2a1=Sutcliffe|2a2=Gilhus|2y=2013|2p=4}} Stores that came to be known as "New Age shops" opened up, selling related books, magazines, jewellery, and crystals, and they were typified by the playing of New Age music and the smell of incense.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=126–127}}This probably influenced several thousand small metaphysical book- and gift-stores that increasingly defined themselves as "New Age bookstores",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Fifty Years Among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms, 1941–1991|first1=John|last1=Algeo|first2=Adele S. |last2=Algeo|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=234|isbn=978-0-521-44971-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while New Age titles came to be increasingly available from mainstream bookstores and then websites like [[Amazon.com]].{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}}

Not everyone who came to be associated with the New Age phenomenon openly embraced the term "New Age", although it was popularised in books like [[David Spangler]]'s 1977 work ''Revelation: The Birth of a New Age'' and [[Mark Satin]]'s 1979 book ''New Age Politics: Healing Self and Society''.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=124}} [[Marilyn Ferguson]]'s 1982 book ''[[The Aquarian Conspiracy]]'' has also been regarded as a landmark work in the development of the New Age, promoting the idea that a new era was emerging.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=9}} Other terms that were employed synonymously with "New Age" in this milieu included "Green", "Holistic", "Alternative", and "Spiritual".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=128}}

1971 witnessed the foundation of [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] by [[Werner H. Erhard]], a transformational training course that became a prominent part of the early movement.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=58–60}} Melton suggested that the 1970s witnessed the growth of a relationship between the New Age movement and the older New Thought movement, as evidenced by the widespread use of [[Helen Schucman]]'s ''[[A Course in Miracles]]'' (1975), New Age music, and crystal healing in New Thought churches.{{sfn|Melton|1992|pp=25–26}} Some figures in the New Thought movement were sceptical, challenging the compatibility of New Age and New Thought perspectives.{{sfn|Melton|1992|pp=26–27}} During these decades, Findhorn had become a site of [[pilgrimage]] for many New Agers, and greatly expanded in size as people joined the community, with workshops and conferences being held there that brought together New Age thinkers from across the world.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=29}}

[[File:New Age Shrine Glastonbury - geograph.org.uk - 167848.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A new age shrine. |New Age shrine in [[Glastonbury]], England]]

Several key events occurred, which raised public awareness of the New Age subculture: publication of [[Linda Goodman]]'s best-selling astrology books ''Sun Signs'' (1968) and ''Love Signs'' (1978); the release of [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s book ''[[Out on a Limb (Shirley MacLaine book)|Out on a Limb]]'' (1983), later adapted into a television mini-series with the same name (1987); and the "[[Harmonic Convergence]]" [[planetary alignment]] on August 16 and 17, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[José Argüelles]] in [[Sedona, Arizona]]. The Convergence attracted more people to the movement than any other single event.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=ix}} Heelas suggested that the movement was influenced by the "enterprise culture" encouraged by the U.S. and U.K. governments during the 1980s onward, with its emphasis on initiative and self-reliance resonating with any New Age ideas.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=168}}

Knight]] ([[Ramtha]]), [[Neale Donald Walsch]] (''[[Conversations with God]]'') (note that Walsch denies being a "channeler" and his books make it obvious that he is not one, though the text emerged through a dialogue with a deeper part of himself in a process comparable to [[automatic writing]]) contributed to the movement's growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Drury|2004 | pp=133–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant exponent of the New Age movement in the U.S. has been cited as [[Ram Dass]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kyle|1y=1995|1pp=66–67|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35}} Core works in the propagating New Age ideas included Jane Roberts's Seth series, published from 1972 onward,{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}} Helen Schucman's 1975 publication ''A Course in Miracles'',{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1pp=35–36|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=16}} and [[James Redfield]]'s 1993 work ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutcliffe|1y=2003a|1p=127|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=16}} A variety of these books were [[best seller]]s, with the Seth book series for instance selling over a million copies.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}} Supplementing these books were videos, audiotapes, compact discs and websites.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=17}} The development of the internet in particular further popularized New Age ideas and made them more widely accessible.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=18}}

New Age ideas influenced the development of [[rave]] culture in the late 1980s and 1990s.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=168}} In Britain during the 1980s, the term "[[New Age Travellers]]" came into use,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=129}} although York characterised this term as "a misnomer created by the media".{{sfn|York|2001|p=370}} These New Age Travellers had little to do with the New Age as the term was used more widely,{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=8}} with scholar of religion Daren Kemp observing that "New Age spirituality is not an essential part of New Age Traveller culture, although there are similarities between the two worldviews".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=34}} The term "New Age" came to be used increasingly widely by the popular media in the 1990s.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=129}}

===Decline or transformation?: 1990–present===

By the late 1980s, some publishers dropped the term "New Age" as a marketing device.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=35}} In 1994, the scholar of religion [[Gordon J. Melton]] presented a conference paper in which he argued that, given that he knew of nobody describing their practices as "New Age" anymore, the New Age had died.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=178}} In 2001, Hammer observed that the term "New Age" had increasingly been rejected as either pejorative or meaningless by individuals within the Western cultic milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}} He also noted that within this milieu it was not being replaced by any alternative, and that as such a sense of collective identity was being lost.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}}

Other scholars disagreed with Melton's idea; in 2004 Daren Kemp stated that "New Age is still very much alive".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=179}} Hammer himself stated that "the New Age ''movement'' may be on the wane, but the wider New Age ''religiosity''... shows no sign of disappearing".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=75}} MacKian suggested that the New Age "movement" had been replaced by a wider "New Age sentiment" which had come to pervade "the socio-cultural landscape" of Western countries.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=7}} Its diffusion into the mainstream may have been influenced by the adoption of New Age concepts by high profile figures: U.S. First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] consulted an astrologer, British [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] visited spirit mediums, and Norwegian Princess [[Princess Märtha Louise of Norway|Märtha Louise]] established a school devoted to communicating with angels.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=146}} 
New Age shops continued to operate, although many have been remarketed as "Mind, Body, Spirit".{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=17}} 

In 2015, the scholar of religion [[Hugh Urban]] argued that New Age spirituality is growing in the United States and can be expected to become more visible: "According to many recent surveys of religious affiliation, the 'spiritual but not religious' category is one of the fastest-growing trends in American culture, so the New Age attitude of spiritual individualism and eclecticism may well be an increasingly visible one in the decades to come".{{sfn|Urban|2015|p=11}}

==Beliefs and practices==
{{Main article|Spiritual but not religious|List of New Age topics}}

===Eclecticism and self-spirituality===

The New Age places strong emphasis on the idea that the individual and their own experiences are the primary source of authority on spiritual matters.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=201–202|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=21–23|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=26}} It exhibits what Heelas termed "unmediated individualism",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=21–23}} and reflects a world-view that is "radically democratic".{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=124}} It places an emphasis on the freedom and autonomy of the individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=26–27|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=119}} This emphasis has led to ethical disagreements; some New Agers believe helping others is beneficial, although another view is that doing so encourages dependency and conflicts with a reliance on the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=25}} Nevertheless, within the New Age, there are differences in the role accorded to voices of authority outside of the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=34}} Hammer stated that "a belief in the existence of a core or true Self" is a "recurring theme" in New Age texts.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=11}} The concept of "[[personal growth]]" is also greatly emphasised among New Agers,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=46|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=188}} while Heelas noted that "for participants spirituality ''is'' life-itself".{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=27}}

New Age religiosity is typified by its eclecticism.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=163}} Generally believing that there is no one true way to pursue spirituality,{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=118–119}} New Agers develop their own worldview "by combining bits and pieces to form their own individual mix",{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=28}} seeking what Drury called "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas".{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=8}} The anthropologist David J. Hess noted that in his experience, a common attitude among New Agers was that "any alternative spiritual path is good because it is spiritual and alternative".{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=36}} This approach that has generated a common jibe that New Age represents "supermarket spirituality".{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=32}} York suggested that this eclecticism stemmed from the New Age's origins within [[late modernity|late modern]] capitalism, with New Agers subscribing to a belief in a free market of spiritual ideas as a parallel to a free market in economics.{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} 

As part of its eclecticism, the New Age draws ideas from many different cultural and spiritual traditions from across the world, often legitimising this approach by reference to "a very vague claim" about underlying global unity.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=139}} Certain societies are more usually chosen over others;{{sfnm|1a1=Hammer|1y=2001|1p=199|2a1=Kemp|2y=2004|2p=49}} examples include the ancient Celts, ancient Egyptians, the [[Essenes]], [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], and ancient extra-terrestrials.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=47}} As noted by Hammer: "to put it bluntly, no significant spokespersons within the New Age community claim to represent ancient Albanian wisdom, simply because beliefs regarding ancient Albanians are not part of our cultural stereotypes".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=199}} According to Hess, these ancient or foreign societies represent an exotic "Other" for New Agers, who are predominantly white Westerners.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=48}}

===Theology, cosmogony, and cosmology===

[[File:Snoqualmie Moondance meditation 02.jpg|thumb|right|New Age meditation group at the Snoqualmie Moondance festival, 1992]]

A belief in [[divinity]] is integral to New Age ideas, although understandings of this divinity vary.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=182–183}} New Age [[theology]] exhibits an inclusive and universalistic approach that accepts all personal perspectives on the divine as equally valid.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=185}} This intentional vagueness as to the nature of divinity also reflects the New Age idea that divinity cannot be comprehended by the human mind or language.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=186}} New Age literature nevertheless displays recurring traits in its depiction of the divine: the first is the idea that it is [[Holism|holistic]], thus frequently being described with such terms as an "Ocean of Oneness", "Infinite Spirit", "Primal Stream", "One Essence", and "Universal Principle".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=186}} A second trait is the characterisation of divinity as "Mind", "Consciousness", and "Intelligence",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=186–187}} while a third is the description of divinity as a form of "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=187}} A fourth trait is the characterisation of divinity as a "life force", the essence of which is creativity, while a fifth is the concept that divinity consists of [[love]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=187–188}}

Most New Age groups believe in an Ultimate Source from which all things originate, which is usually conflated with the divine.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=120}} Various [[creation myths]] have been articulated in New Age publications outlining how this Ultimate Source created the universe and everything in it.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=122–123}} In contrast, some New Agers emphasise the idea of a universal inter-relatedness that is not always emanating from a single source.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=128}} The New Age worldview emphasises holism and the idea that everything in existence is intricately connected as part of a single whole,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=119|2a1=Drury|2y=2004|2p=11}} in doing so rejecting both the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of Judeo-Christian thought and the [[reductionism]] of Cartesian science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=119}} A number of New Agers have linked this holistic interpretation of the universe to the [[Gaia hypothesis]] of [[James Lovelock]].{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=23}} The idea of holistic divinity results in a common New Age belief that humans themselves are divine in essence, a concept described using such terms as "droplet of divinity", "inner Godhead", and "divine self".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=204}} Influenced by Theosophical and Anthroposophical ideas regarding '[[subtle bodies]]',{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=222–223}} a common New Age idea holds to the existence of a "Higher Self" that is a part of the human but connects with the divine essence of the universe, and which can advise the human mind through [[intuition]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=211–212}}

Cosmogonical creation stories are common in New Age sources,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=304}} with these accounts reflecting the movement's holistic framework by describing an original, primal oneness from which all things in the universe emanated.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=305}} An additional common theme is that human souls – once living in a spiritual world – then descended into a world of matter.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=307–308}}
The New Age movement typically views the material universe as a meaningful illusion, which humans should try to use constructively rather than focus on escaping into other spiritual realms.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=115}} This physical world is hence seen as "a domain for learning and growth" after which the human soul might pass on to higher levels of existence.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=116–117}} There is thus a widespread belief that reality is engaged in an ongoing process of evolution; rather than [[Darwinian evolution]], this is typically seen as either a teleological evolution which assumes a process headed to a specific goal, or an open-ended, creative evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=158–160}}

===Spirit and channeling===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="In the flood of channeled material which has been published or delivered to "live" audiences in the last two decades, there is much indeed that is trivial, contradictory, and confusing. The authors of much of this material make claims that, while not necessarily untrue or fraudulent, are difficult or impossible for the reader to verify. A number of other channeled documents address issues more immediately relevant to the human condition. The best of these writings are not only coherent and plausible, but eloquently persuasive and sometimes disarmingly moving."|source=— Academic Suzanne Riordan, 1992.{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=107}} }}

MacKian argued that a central, but often overlooked, element of the phenomenon was an emphasis on "[[spirit]]", and in particular participants' desire for a relationship with spirit.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=51, 117}} Many practitioners in her UK-focused study described themselves as "workers ''for'' spirit", expressing the desire to help people learn about spirit.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=145}} They understood various material signs as marking the presence of spirit, for instance the unexpected appearance of a feather.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=142–143}} New Agers often call upon this spirit to assist them in everyday situations, for instance to ease the traffic flow on their way to work.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=84, 143}}  

New Age literature often refers to benevolent non-human spirit-beings who are interested in humanity's spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, [[guardian angel]]s, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=197, 198}} New Age angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=198}} The figure of Jesus Christ is often mentioned within New Age literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an exemplar of a spiritually advanced human being.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=189–190}}

Although not present in every New Age group,{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=105}} a core belief within the milieu is in [[mediumship|channeling]].{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=23|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=24}} This is the idea that humans beings, sometimes (although not always) in a state of [[trance]], can act "as a channel of information from sources other than their normal selves".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=23–24}} These sources are varyingly described as being [[God]], [[gods]] and [[goddesses]], [[ascended masters]], [[spirit guide]]s, [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]], [[angel]]s, [[Deva (New Age)|devas]], historical figures, the [[collective unconscious]], [[elemental]]s, or [[nature spirit]]s.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=23–24}} Hanegraaff described channeling as a form of "articulated revelation",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=24}} and identified four forms: trance channeling, automatisms, clairaudient channeling, and open channeling.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=27–28}}

Prominent examples of New Age channeling include Jane Roberts' claims that she was contacted by an entity called Seth, and Helen Schucman's claims to have channeled Jesus Christ.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=22|2a1=Riordan|2y=1992|2pp=108–110|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=28}} The academic Suzanne Riordan examined a variety of these New Age channeled messages, noting that they typically "echoed each other in tone and content", offering an analysis of the human condition and giving instructions or advice for how humanity can discover its true destiny.{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=110}}
For many New Agers, these channeled messages rival the scriptures of the main world religions as sources of spiritual authority,{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=108}} although often New Agers describe historical religious revelations as forms of "channeling" as well, thus attempting to legitimate and authenticate their own contemporary practices.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=26–27}} Although the concept of channeling from discarnate spirit entities has links to [[Spiritualism]] and [[psychical research]], the New Age does not feature Spiritualism's emphasis on proving the existence of life after death, nor psychical research's focus of testing mediums for consistency.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=23}}

===Astrological cycles and the Age of Aquarius===

New Age thought typically envisions the world as developing through cosmological cycles that can be identified [[astrology|astrologically]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=102, 302}} It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=303}} New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived in an age of spiritual wisdom.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=302}} In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on [[Lost lands|lost continents]] such as Atlantis, [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], and [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of [[Ancient Egypt]] were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=309–314}}
New Age literature often posits that the ancient period of spiritual wisdom gave way to an age of spiritual decline, sometimes termed the [[Age of Pisces]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=302}} Although characterised as being a negative period for humanity, New Age literature views the Age of Pisces as an important learning experience for the species.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=320}} 
Hanegraaff stated that New Age perceptions of history were "extremely sketchy" in their use of description,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=320}} reflecting little interest in [[historiography]] and conflating history with [[myth]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=324}} He also noted that they were highly [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] in placing [[Western world|Western civilization]] at the centre of historical development.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=303}}

[[File:Venice ast sm.jpg|thumb|left|Astrological ideas hold a central place in the New Age]]

A common belief among the New Age is that humanity has entered, or is coming to enter, a new period known as the [[Age of Aquarius]],{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=94}} which Melton has characterised as a "New Age of love, joy, peace, abundance, and harmony[...] the Golden Age heretofore only dreamed about."{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=19}} In accepting this belief in a coming new age, the milieu has been described as "highly positive, celebratory, [and] utopian",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=28}} and has also been cited as an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic movement]].{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=24}} Opinions about the nature of the coming Age of Aquarius differ among New Agers.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=333}} There are for instance differences in belief about its commencement; New Age author David Spangler claimed that it began in 1967,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=334–335}} others placed its beginning with the Harmonic Convergence of 1987,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=335}} author José Argüelles predicted its start [[2012 phenomenon|in 2012]],{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=72}} and some believe that it will not begin until several centuries into the third millennium.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=335–336}}

There are also differences in how this new age is envisioned.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=336}} Those adhering to what Hanegraaff termed the "moderate" perspective believed that it would be marked by an improvement to current society, which affected both New Age concerns—through the convergence of science and mysticism and the global embrace of alternative medicine—to more general concerns, including an end to violence, crime and war, a healthier environment, and international co-operation.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=339–340}} Other New Agers adopt a fully utopian vision, believing that the world will be wholly transformed into an "Age of Light", with humans evolving into totally spiritual beings and experiencing unlimited love, bliss, and happiness.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=341—343}} Rather than conceiving of the Age of Aquarius as an indefinite period, many believe that it would last for around two thousand years before being replaced by a further age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=102}} 

There are various beliefs within the milieu as to how this new age will come about, but most emphasise the idea that it will be established through [[human agency]]; others assert that it will be established with the aid of non-human forces such as spirits or extra-terrestrials.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=74}} Ferguson for instance claimed that there was a vanguard of humans known as the "Aquarian conspiracy" who were helping to bring the Age of Aquarius forth through their actions.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=70}} Participants in the New Age typically express the view that their own spiritual actions are helping to bring about the Age of Aquarius,{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=19|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=75–76}} with writers like Ferguson and Argüelles presenting themselves as prophets ushering forth this future era.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=73}}

===Healing and alternative medicine===

Another recurring element of New Age is an emphasis on healing and [[alternative medicine]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ellwood|1y=1992|1p=60|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=37|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3p=42|4a1=Sutcliffe|4y=2003a|4p=174}}&lt;ref name="Butler 2007"&gt;Butler, Jenny and Maria Tighe, "Holistic Health and New Age in the British Isles". 415-34 in Kemp, Daren and Lewis, James R., ed. (2007), Handbook of New Age, Boston, Massachusetts, US: Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-04-15355-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The general New Age ethos is that health is the natural state for the human being and that illness is a disruption of that natural balance.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=46–47}} Hence, New Age therapies seek to heal "[[illness]]" as a general concept that includes physical, mental, and spiritual aspects; in doing so it critiques mainstream Western medicine for simply attempting to cure [[disease]], and thus has an affinity with most forms of [[traditional medicine]].{{sfnm|1a1=Albanese|1y=1992|1pp=81–82|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=42–43|3a1=Sutcliffe|3y=2003a|3p=176}} Its focus of self-spirituality has led to the emphasis of self-healing,{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=82–87|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2pp=176, 178|3a1=MacKian|3y=2012|3p=160}} although also present are ideas on healing both others and the Earth itself.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=82–87|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=160}}

[[File:Siete chakras.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Reiki]] is one of the alternative therapies commonly found in the New Age movement.]]

The healing elements of the movement are difficult to classify given that a variety of terms are used, with some New Age authors using different terms to refer to the same trends, while others use the same term to refer to different things.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=48}} However, Hanegraaff developed a set of categories into which the forms of New Age healing could be roughly categorised. The first of these was the [[Human Potential Movement]], which argues that contemporary Western society suppresses much human potential, and accordingly professes to offer a path through which individuals can access those parts of themselves that they have alienated and suppressed, thus enabling them to reach their full potential and live a meaningful life.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=48–49}} Hanegraaff described [[transpersonal psychology]] as the "theoretical wing" of this Human Potential Movement; in contrast to other schools of psychological thought, transpersonal psychology takes religious and mystical experiences seriously by exploring the uses of [[altered states of consciousness]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=50–51}} Closely connected to this is the [[Neoshamanism|shamanic consciousness]] current, which argues that the [[shamanism|shaman]] was a specialist in altered states of consciousness and seeks to adopt and imitate traditional shamanic techniques as a form of personal healing and growth.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=52}}

Hanegraaff identified the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being [[holistic health]]. This emerged in the 1970s out of the [[free clinic]] movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=53–54}} It emphasises the idea that the human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=54}} A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, with some of the most common including [[acupuncture]], reiki, [[biofeedback]], [[chiropractic]], [[yoga]], [[kinesiology]], [[homeopathy]], [[aromatherapy]] [[iridology]], [[massage]] and other forms of [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], [[meditation]] and [[Visual perception|visualisation]], nutritional therapy, [[psychic healing]], [[herbal medicine]], [[crystal healing|healing using crystals]], metals, music, [[chromotherapy]], and reincarnation therapy.{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=37|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=54–55|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=30}} The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age;{{sfn|Albanese|1992|p=79}} this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=162}}
The mainstreaming of the Holistic Health movement in the UK is discussed by Maria Tighe. The inter-relation of holistic health with the New Age movement is illustrated in Jenny Butler's ethnographic description of "Angel therapy" in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Butler 2007"/&gt;

==="New Age science"===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The New Age is essentially about the search for spiritual and philosophical perspectives that will help transform humanity and the world. New Agers are willing to absorb wisdom teachings wherever they can find them, whether from an Indian guru, a renegade Christian priest, an itinerant Buddhist monk, an experiential psychotherapist or a Native American shaman. They are eager to explore their own inner potential with a view to becoming part of a broader process of social transformation. Their journey is towards totality of being."|source=— New Ager [[Nevill Drury]], 2004.{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=11}} }}

According to Drury, the New Age attempts to create "a worldview that includes both science and spirituality",{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=10}} while Hess noted how New Agers have "a penchant for bringing together the technical and the spiritual, the scientific and the religious".{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=4}}
Although New Agers typically reject [[rationalism]], the [[scientific method]], and the academic establishment, they employ terminology and concepts borrowed from science and particularly from the [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|New Physics]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}} Moreover, a number of prominent influences on New Age, such as [[David Bohm]] and [[Ilya Prigogine]], had backgrounds as professional scientists.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=63}} Hanegraaff identified "New Age science" as a form of ''[[Naturphilosophie]]''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=64}} 

In this, the milieu is interested in developing unified world views to discover the nature of the divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=63}} Figures in the New Age movement—most notably [[Fritjof Capra]] in his ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of [[mysticism]], thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=128–129}} Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=155–156|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2p=86}}

Despite New Agers' appeals to science, most of the academic and scientific establishments dismiss "New Age science" as [[pseudo-science]], or at best existing in part on the fringes of genuine scientific research.{{sfnm|1a1=Hess|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}} This is an attitude also shared by many active in the field of [[parapsychology]].{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=11}} In turn, New Agers often accuse the scientific establishment of pursuing a dogmatic and outmoded approach to scientific enquiry,{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=68}} believing that their own understandings of the universe will replace those of the academic establishment in a [[paradigm shift]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}}

===Ethics and afterlife===

There is no ethical cohesion within the New Age phenomenon,{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=35}} although Hanegraaff argued that the central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=281}} Given that the movement's holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic [[good and evil]],{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=277}} negative events that happen are interpreted not as the result of evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=236–237, 278}}
It rejects the Christian emphasis on [[sin]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=294–295}} It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing that if an individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=293}} Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=240}} Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=240—241}} and the visualisation of a white light.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=242}}

According to Hanegraaff, the question of death and afterlife is not a "pressing problem requiring an answer" in the New Age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=258}} A belief in [[reincarnation]] is very common, where it often viewed as being part of an individual's progressive spiritual evolution toward realisation of their own divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=262|2a1=York|2y=2001|2p=364|3a1=MacKian|3y=2012|3p=109}} In New Age literature, the reality of reincarnation is usually treated as self-evident, with no explanation as to why practitioners embrace this afterlife belief over others,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=263}} although New Agers endorse it in the belief that it ensures cosmic justice.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=264}} Many New Agers believe in [[karma]], treating it as a law of cause and effect that assures cosmic balance, although in some cases they stress that it is not a system that enforces punishment for past actions.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=286}}
In much New Age literature on reincarnation, it is claimed that part of the human soul, that which carries the personality, perishes with the death of the body, while the Higher Self – that which connects with divinity – survives in order to be reborn into another body.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=266}} It is believed that the Higher Self chooses the body and circumstances into which it will be born, in order to use it as a vessel through which to learn new lessons and thus advance its own spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=262}} Prominent New Age writers like [[Shakti Gawain]] and [[Louise Hay]] therefore express the view that humans are responsible for the events that happen to them during their life, an idea that many New Agers regard as empowering.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=234}} At times, past life regression are employed within the New Age in order to reveal a Higher Soul's previous incarnations, usually with an explicit healing purpose.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=271–275}} Some practitioners espouse the idea of a "soul group" or "soul family", a group of connected souls who reincarnate together as family of friendship units.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=109}} Rather than reincarnation, another afterlife belief found among New Agers holds that an individual's soul returns to a "universal energy" on bodily death.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=109}}

==Demographics==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=By the early twenty-first century... [the New Age phenomenon] has an almost entirely white, middle-class demography largely made up of professional, managerial, arts, and entrepreneurial occupations.|source=— Religious studies scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=223}} }}

In the mid-1990s, the New Age was found primarily in the United States and Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand.{{sfn|York|1995|p=42}} The fact that most individuals engaging in New Age activity do not describe themselves as "New Agers" renders it difficult to determine how many practitioners there are.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=2}} Heelas highlighted the range of attempts to establish the number of New Age participants in the U.S. during this period, noting that estimates ranged from 20,000 to 6 million; he believed that the higher ranges of these estimates were greatly inflated by, for instance, an erroneous assumption that all Americans who believed in reincarnation were part of the movement.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=112}} He nevertheless suggested that over 10 million people in the U.S. had had some contact with New Age practices or ideas.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=120}} In 2006, Heelas stated that New Age practices had grown to such an extent that they were "increasingly rivalling the sway of Christianity in western settings".{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=4}}

Sociological investigation indicates that certain sectors of society are more likely to engage in New Age practices than others.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=223–224}} The majority of participants are from the middle and upper-middle classes of Western society.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=121|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=53}} Sutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=220–221}} approximately two-thirds of its participants were female.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=220}}
The movement is strongly gendered; sociologist Ciara O'Connor argues that it shows a tension between commodification and women's empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Ciara, "Becoming whole: an exploration of women's choices in the holistic and New Age movement in Ireland". 220–39 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), Ireland's new religious movements. Cambridge Scholars, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe described the "typical" participant in the New Age milieu as being "a religious individualist, mixing and matching cultural resources in an animated spiritual quest".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=200}}

[[File:Rave in the Henge 2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Stonehenge at night, with revellers inside|[[Stonehenge]] is a site visited by New Age pilgrims, as seen in this midsummer rave]]

In the United States, the first people to embrace the New Age belonged to the [[baby boomer]] generation, those born between 1946 and 1964.{{sfn|Brown|1992|p=90}} 
Heelas added that within that broad demographic, the movement had nevertheless attracted a diverse clientele.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=136}} He typified the typical New Ager as someone who was well-educated yet disenchanted with mainstream society, thus arguing that the movement catered to those who believe that [[modernity]] is in crisis.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=137–138}} He suggested that the movement appealed to many former practitioners of the 1960s counter-culture because while they came to feel that they were unable to change society, they were nonetheless interested in changing the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=142}} He believed that many individuals had been "culturally primed for what the New Age has to offer",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=172}} with the New Age attracting "expressive" people who were already comfortable with the ideals and outlooks of the movement's self-spirituality focus.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=161–162}} It could be particularly appealing because the New Age suited the needs of the individual, whereas traditional religious options that are available primarily catered for the needs of a community.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=173}} He believed that although the adoption of New Age beliefs and practices by some fitted the model of [[religious conversion]],{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=186}} others who adopted some of its practices could not easily be considered to have converted to the religion.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=183}}

The degree to which individuals are involved in the New Age varies.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=117}} Heelas argued that those involved could be divided into three broad groups; the first comprised those who were completely dedicated to it and its ideals, often working in professions that furthered those goals. The second consisted of "serious part-timers" who worked in unrelated fields but who nevertheless spent much of their free time involved in movement activities. The third was that of "casual part-timers" who occasionally involved themselves in New Age activities but for whom the movement was not a central aspect of their life.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=118–119}} MacKian instead suggested that involvement could be seen as being layered like an onion; at the core are "consultative" practitioners who devote their life to New Age practices, around that are "serious" practitioners who still invest considerable effort into New Age activities, and on the periphery are "non-practitioner consumers", individuals affected by he general dissemination of New Age ideas but who do not devote themselves more fully to them.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=73–74}} Many New Age practices have filtered into wider Western society, with a 2000 poll for instance revealing that 39% of the UK population had tried alternative therapies.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=52}}

In 1995, Kyle stated that on the whole, New Agers in the United States preferred the values of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] over those of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He added that most New Agers "soundly rejected" the agenda of former Republican President [[Ronald Reagan]].{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=846}}

===Social communities===

MacKian suggested that this phenomenon was "an inherently ''social'' mode of spirituality", one which cultivated a sense of belonging among its participants and encouraged relations both with other humans and with non-human, otherworldly spirit entities.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=136}}
MacKian suggested that these communities "may look very different" from those of traditional religious groups.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=135}}

Online connections were one of the ways that interested individuals met new contacts and established networks.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=131}}

==Commercial aspects==

[[File:New Age shop and Healing centre, St Albans, Hertfordshire.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|alt=New Age store along stone street with bicycles parked out front and large crystals behind display windows|Isis, a New Age shop named after the [[Isis|Ancient Egyptian goddess]] that is located in St Albans, southern England]]

Some New Agers advocate living in a [[simple living|simple]] and [[sustainable living|sustainable]] manner to reduce humanity's impact on the [[natural resource]]s of Earth; and they shun [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=74–75}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Spring|first=Joel H.|title=How Educational Ideologies Are Shaping Global Society: Intergovernmental Organizations, NGO's, and the Decline of the Nation-state|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, New Jersey, US|year=2004|edition=illustrated|page=119|chapter=Chapter 4: Love the Biosphere: Environmental Ideologies Shaping Global Society|isbn=978-0-8058-4915-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8Xssc9_3FPgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Sustainable+living%22+new+agers#PPA119,M1|archiveurl=https://books.google.com/?id=8Xssc9_3FPgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Sustainable+living%22+new+agers#PPA119,M1|accessdate=2009-03-27|archivedate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Age movement has been centered around rebuilding a [[sense of community]] to counter [[social disintegration]]; this has been attempted through the formation of [[intentional communities]], where individuals come together to live and work in a communal lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=200–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce argued that in seeking to "denying the validity of externally imposed controls and privileging the divine within", the New Age sought to dismantle pre-existing social order, but that it failed to present anything adequate in its place.{{sfn|Bruce|1998|pp=32–33}} Heelas however cautioned that Bruce had arrived at this conclusion based on "flimsy evidence".{{sfn|Heelas|1998|p=258}}

New Age centres have been set up in various parts of the world, representing an institutionalised form of the movement.{{sfn|York|1995|pp=40–41}} Notable examples include the [[Naropa Institute]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], [[Holly Hock Farm]] near to [[Vancouver]], the [[Wrekin Trust]] in [[West Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]], and the [[Skyros Centre]] in [[Skyros]].{{sfn|York|1995|p=41}}

Criticising mainstream Western education as counterproductive to the ethos of the movement, many New Age groups have established their own schools for the education of children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=77–78}}

===Fairs and festivals===

New Age spirituality has led to a wide array of literature on the subject and an active niche market, with books, music, crafts, and services in alternative medicine available at New Age stores, [[fair]]s, and [[festival]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
New Age fairs – sometimes known as "Mind, Body, Spirit fairs", "psychic fairs", or "alternative health fairs" – are spaces in which a variety of goods and services are displayed by different vendors, including forms of alternative medicine and esoteric practices such as palmistry or tarot card reading.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=181–183}} A prominent example is the [[Mind Body Spirit Festival]], held annually in the United Kingdom,{{sfnm|1a1=Partridge|1y=2004|1p=65|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=24}} at which – the religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge noted – one could encounter "a wide range of beliefs and practices from crystal healing to ... Kirlian photography to psychic art, from angels to past-life therapy, from Theosophy to UFO religion, and from New Age music to the vegetarianism of Suma Chign Hai."{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=65}} Similar festivals are held across Europe and in Australia and the United States.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=24}}

===Approaches to financial prosperity and business===

A number of New Age proponents have emphasised the use of spiritual techniques as a tool for attaining financial prosperity, thus moving the movement away from its counter-cultural origins.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=60–62}} Commenting on this "New Age capitalism", Hess observed that it was largely small-scale and entrepreneurial, focused around small companies run by members of the [[petty bourgeoisie]], rather than being dominated by large scale multinational corporations.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=38}} The links between New Age and commercial products have resulted in the accusation that New Age itself is little more than a manifestation of [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=6}} This idea is generally rejected by New Age participants, who often reject any link between their practices and consumerist activities.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=85}}

Embracing this attitude, various books have been published espousing such an ethos, established New Age centres have held spiritual retreats and classes aimed specifically at business people, and New Age groups have developed specialised training for businesses.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=62–65}} During the 1980s, many prominent U.S. corporations—among them [[IBM]], [[AT&amp;T]], and [[General Motors]]—embraced New Age seminars, hoping that they could increase productivity and efficiency among their work force,{{sfn|Rupert|1992|p=127}} although in several cases this resulted in employees bringing legal action against their employers, claiming that such seminars had infringed on their religious beliefs or damaged their psychological health.{{sfn|Rupert|1992|p=133}} However, the use of spiritual techniques as a method for attaining [[Profit (economics)|profit]] has been an issue of major dispute within the wider New Age movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=23|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2p=86}} with prominent New Agers such as Spangler and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]] criticising what they see as trends within the community that are narcissistic and lack a social conscience.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=358–361}} In particular, the movement's commercial elements have caused problems given that they often conflict with its general economically-egalitarian ethos; as York highlighted, "a tension exists in New Age between socialistic egalitarianism and capitalistic private enterprise".{{sfn|York|1995|p=40}}

Given that it encourages individuals to choose spiritual practices on the grounds of personal preference and thus encourages them to behave as a consumer, the New Age has been considered to be well suited to modern society.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=34}}

===Music===
{{See also|List of new-age music artists|List of ambient artists}}
The term "[[New Age music]]" is applied, sometimes in a derogative manner, to forms of [[ambient music]], a genre that developed in the 1960s and was popularised in the 1970s, particularly with the work of [[Brian Eno]].{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=175}} The genre's relaxing nature resulted in it becoming popular within New Age circles,{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=175}} with some forms of the genre having a specifically New Age orientation.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}
Studies have determined that new-age music can be an effective component of [[stress management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Principles and Practice of Stress Management, Third Edition |editor-last=Lehrer |editor-first=Paul M. |editor2=Robert L. Woolfolk |editor3=Wesley E. Sime |year=2007|pages=46–47|isbn=978-1-59385-000-5|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style began in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups recording on the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] label; such as [[Oregon (band)|Oregon]], the [[Paul Winter Consort]], and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno, classical avant-garde musician [[Daniel Kobialka]],&lt;ref name=Birosik&gt;Birosik, Patti Jean (1989).

New-age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic [[space music]] using [[synthesizer]]s and acoustic instrumentals using [[Native American flute]]s and [[drum]]s, [[singing bowl]]s, Australian [[didgeredoo]]s and [[world music]] sounds to spiritual [[chant]]ing from other cultures.&lt;ref name=Birosik /&gt;&lt;ref name=Werkhoven /&gt;

==Politics==

While many commentators have focused on the spiritual and cultural aspects of the New Age movement, it also has a political component. The New Age political movement became visible in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, Richard (1995).  ''The New Age Movement in American Culture''.  University Press of America, Chap.&amp;nbsp;8 ("The New Age Reaches Out: Politics and Economics").  {{ISBN|978-0-7618-0010-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist of religion Steven Bruce noted that the New Age provides ideas on how to deal with "our socio-psychological problems".{{sfn|Bruce|1998|p=23}}  Scholar of religion James R. Lewis observed that, despite the common caricature of New Agers as narcissistic, "significant numbers" of them were "trying to make the planet a better place on which to live," {{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=11}} and scholar J. Gordon Melton's ''New Age Encyclopedia'' (1990) included an entry called "New Age politics". {{sfn|Melton|1990| pp=323–325}}  Some New Agers have entered the political system in an attempt to advocate for the societal transformation that the New Age promotes.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}}

===Ideas===

Although New Age activists have been motivated by New Age concepts like holism, interconnectedness, monism, and environmentalism, their political ideas are diverse,{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} ranging from [[far right politics|far-right]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] through to [[liberalism|liberal]], [[socialism|socialist]], and [[libertarianism|libertarian]].{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} Accordingly, Kyle stated that "New Age politics is difficult to describe and categorize. The standard political labels—left or right, liberal or conservative–miss the mark."{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} MacKian suggested that the New Age operated as a form of "world-realigning infrapolitics" that undermines the [[disenchantment]] of modern Western society.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=154}}

{{double image|left|Mark Satin in 2011.jpg
|141|BENJAMIN CREME 2006.jpg|139|Writers who have espoused political ideas influenced by New Age perspectives included [[Mark Satin]] (left) and [[Benjamin Creme]] (right).}}

The extent to which New Age spokespeople mix religion and politics varies.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=837}} New Agers are often critical of the established political order, regarding it as "fragmented, unjust, hierarchical, patriarchal, and obsolete".{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} The New Ager [[Mark Satin]] for instance spoke of "New Age politics" as a politically radical "third force" that was "neither left nor right". He believed that in contrast to the conventional political focus on the "institutional and economic symptoms" of society's problems, his "New Age politics" would focus on "psychocultural roots" of these issues.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=833}} Ferguson regarded New Age politics as "a kind of Radical Centre", one that was "not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road."{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|pp=832–833}} Fritjof Capra argued that Western societies have become sclerotic because of their adherence to an outdated and mechanistic view of reality, which he calls the ''Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=107}}  In Capra's view, the West needs to develop an organic and ecological "systems view" of reality in order to successfully address its social and political issues.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=107}} [[Corinne McLaughlin]] argued that politics need not connote endless power struggles, that a new "spiritual politics" could attempt to synthesize opposing views on issues into higher levels of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne, Alan J. (1999).  ''From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms''.  Praeger Publishers / Greenwood Publishing Group, p.&amp;nbsp;179.  {{ISBN|978-0-275-96151-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many New Agers advocate [[globalisation]] and [[Glocalization|localisation]], but reject [[nationalism]] and the role of the [[nation-state]].{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=842}} Some New Age spokespeople have called for greater decentralisation and global unity, but are vague about how this might be achieved; others call for a global, centralised government.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|pp=842–843}} Satin for example argued for a move away from the nation-state and towards self-governing regions that, through improved global communication networks, would help engender world unity.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=843}} [[Benjamin Creme]] conversely argued that "the Christ," a great [[Avatar]], Maitreya, the [[World Teacher]], expected by all the major religions as their "Awaited One," would return to the world and establish a strong, centralised global government in the form of the [[United Nations]]; this would be politically re-organised along a spiritual hierarchy.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=845}} Kyle observed that New Agers often speak favourably of [[democracy]] and citizens' involvement in policy making but are critical of [[representative democracy]] and [[majority rule]], thus displaying elitist ideas to their thinking.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=846}}

===Groups===

[[File:New World Alliance 1980.jpg|thumb |220px| right |alt=Twenty people sitting in a circle |The [[New World Alliance]] was one of several New Age political groups in the 1970s and 1980s.]]

It advocated a change in consciousness – in "basic underlying assumptions" –  in order to come to grips with global crises.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=108–109}}  Kyle said that the New York City-based Planetary Citizens organization, headed by United Nations consultant and ''Earth at Omega'' author Donald Keys, sought to implement New Age political ideas.{{sfn|Kyle|1995|p=67}}

Scholar J. Gordon Melton and colleagues focused on the New World Alliance, a Washington, DC-based organization founded in 1979 by Mark Satin and others.  According to Melton et al., the Alliance tried to combine left- and right-wing ideas as well as personal growth work and political activities.  Group decision-making was facilitated by short periods of silence.{{sfn|Melton|1990|p=324}}  Sponsors of the Alliance's national political newsletter included Willis Harman and John Vasconcellos.&lt;ref&gt;Stein,  Arthur (1985).

Lewis counted "Green politics" as one of the New Age's more visible activities.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=11}}  One academic book claims that the [[History of the Green Party of the United States|U.S. Green Party movement]] began as an initiative of a handful of activists including [[Charlene Spretnak]], co-author of a "'new age' interpretation" of the German Green movement (Capra and Spretnak's ''Green Politics''), and Mark Satin, author of ''New Age Politics''.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, John (1998).

===In the 21st century===

==Reception==

===Popular media===

Mainstream periodicals tended to be less than sympathetic; sociologist Paul Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson discussed in their 2000 book ''[[The Cultural Creatives]]'', what they called the media's "zest for attacking" New Age ideas, and offered the example of a 1996 [[Lance Morrow]] essay in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} Nearly a decade earlier, ''Time'' had run a long cover story critical of New Age culture; the cover featured a head shot of a famous actress beside the headline, "'''Om....''' THE NEW AGE starring Shirley MacLaine, faith healers, channelers, space travelers, and crystals galore".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (7 December 1987), vol. 130, issue no. 23, front cover.&lt;/ref&gt;  The story itself, by former ''[[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]'' editor [[Otto Friedrich]], was sub-titled, "A Strange Mix of Spirituality and Superstition Is Sweeping Across the Country".&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, Otto (7 December 1987).  "New Age Harmonies".  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, vol. 130, issue no. 23, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, the magazine ''[[The New Republic]]'' ran a four-page critique of New Age culture and politics by journalist [[Richard Bradley (writer)|Richard Blow]] entitled simply, "Moronic Convergence".&lt;ref&gt;Blow, Richard (25 January 1988).  "Moronic Convergence".  ''[[The New Republic]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some New Agers and New Age sympathizers responded to such criticisms.  For example, sympathizers Ray and Anderson said that much of it was an attempt to "stereotype" the movement for idealistic and spiritual change, and to cut back on its popularity.{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} New Age theoretician David Spangler tried to distance himself from what he called the "New Age glamour" of crystals, talk-show channelers, and other easily commercialized phenomena, and sought to underscore his commitment to the New Age as a vision of genuine social transformation.{{sfnp|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=104–105}}

===Academia===
[[File:Wouter Hanegraaff 2006 Alchemy Conference.jpg|thumb|right|One of the first academics to study the New Age was Wouter Hanegraaff]]

Initially, academic interest in the New Age was minimal.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} The earliest academic studies of the New Age phenomenon were performed by specialists in the study of new religious movements such as [[Robert Ellwood]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1992|1p=6|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=3}} This research was often scanty because many scholars regarded the New Age as an insignificant cultural fad.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=x}} Having been influenced by the U.S. [[anti-cult movement]], much of it was also largely negative and critical of New Age groups.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=15}} The "first truly scholarly study" of the phenomenon was an [[edited volume]] put together by James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton in 1992.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} From that point on, the number of published academic studies steadily increased.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}}

In 1994, [[Christoph Bochinger]] published his study of the New Age in Germany, ''"New Age" und moderne Religion''.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} This was followed by Michael York's sociological study in 1995 and Richard Kyle's U.S.-focused work in 1995.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=21}} In 1996, Paul Heelas published a sociological study of the movement in Britain, being the first to discuss its relationship with business.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2pp=21–22}} That same year, Wouter Hanegraaff published ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', a historical analysis of New Age texts;{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=4–6}} Hammer later described it as having "a well-deserved reputation as the standard reference work on the New Age".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=22}} Most of these early studies were based on a textual analysis of New Age publications, rather than on an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] analysis of its practitioners.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=13}}

Sutcliffe and Gilhus argued that 'New Age studies' could be seen as having experienced two waves; in the first, scholars focused on "macro-level analyses of the content and boundaries" of the "movement", while the second wave featured "more variegated and contextualized studies of particular beliefs and practices".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=6}} Sutcliffe and Gilhus have also expressed concern that, as of 2013, 'New Age studies' has yet to formulate a set of research questions scholars can pursue.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=6}}
The New Age has proved a challenge for scholars of religion operating under more formative models of what "religion" is.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=5}} By 2006, Heelas noted that the New Age was so vast and diverse that no scholar of the subject could hope to keep up with all of it.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=15}}

===Christian perspectives===

Mainstream Christianity has typically rejected the ideas of the New Age.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=21}} Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist wing]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=201}} In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that came to influence British evangelical groups.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=152}} During that decade, evangelical writers such as [[Constance Cumbey]], [[Dave Hunt (Christian apologist)|Dave Hunt]], [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], and [[Douglas Groothuis]] published books criticising the New Age from their Christian perspective; a number of them have been characterised as propagating [[conspiracy theories]] regarding the origin and purpose of the movement.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=154}} The most successful such publication however was [[Frank E. Peretti]]'s 1986 novel ''[[This Present Darkness]]'', which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with [[feminism]] and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=156}}

Official responses to the New Age have been produced by major Christian organisations like the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Church of England]], and [[Methodist Church]].{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=21}}
The Roman Catholic Church published ''[[A Christian reflection on the New Age]]'' in 2003, following a six-year study; the 90-page document criticizes New Age practices such as yoga, meditation, [[feng shui]], and crystal healing.&lt;ref name="BBC Vatican"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2722743.stm|title=Vatican sounds New Age alert|date=2003-02-04|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of vocational psychology'' by W. Bruce Walsh, Mark Savickas. 2005. p. 358. {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4517-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Vatican, euphoric states attained through New Age practices should not be confused with prayer or viewed as signs of God's presence.&lt;ref name="NY Times Vatican"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1D61531F934A35752C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=|title=Trying to Reconcile the Ways of the Vatican and the East |last=Steinfels|first=Peter|date=1990-01-07|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Paul Poupard]], then-president of the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]], said the "New Age is a misleading answer to the oldest hopes of man".&lt;ref name="BBC Vatican" /&gt; Monsignor [[Michael L. Fitzgerald|Michael Fitzgerald]], then-president of the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]], stated at the Vatican conference on the document: the "Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age".&lt;ref name="Holy See"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_press-conf-new-age_en.html |title=Presentations of Holy See's Document on "New Age" |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Michael L. |last2=Poupard |first2=Paul |year=2003 |work=Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of Life: a Christian Reflection on the "New Age" |publisher=Roman Catholic Church |accessdate=2010-11-06 |location=Vatican City}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are other Christian groups that have adopted a more positive view of the New Age, among them the [[New Age Catholics]], [[Christaquarians]], and [[Christians Awakening to a New Awareness]], all of which believe that New Age ideas can enhance a person's Christian faith.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|pp=21–22}}

===Contemporary Pagan perspectives===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="Neopagan practices highlight the centrality of the relationship between humans and nature and reinvent religions of the past, while New Agers are more interested in transforming individual consciousness and shaping the future."|source=— Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=18}} }}

An issue of academic debate has been regarding the connection between the New Age movement and contemporary [[Paganism]], or [[Modern Paganism|Neo-Paganism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1y=2004|1p=10|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} The two phenomena have often being confused and conflated, particularly in Christian critiques.{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike asserted that there was a "significant overlap" between the two religious movements,{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=vii}} while [[Aidan A. Kelly]] stated that Paganism "parallels the New Age movement in some ways, differs sharply from it in others, and overlaps it in some minor ways".{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=136}} Other scholars have identified them as distinct phenomena that share overlap and commonalities.{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=2001|1pp=364–365|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=9}} Hanegraaff suggested that whereas various forms of contemporary Paganism were not part of the New Age movement – particularly those that pre-dated the movement – other Pagan religions and practices could be identified as New Age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=78}} Partridge portrayed both Paganism and the New Age as different streams of [[occulture]] ([[occult]] culture) that merge at points.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=78}}

Various differences between the two movements have been highlighted; the New Age movement focuses on an improved future, whereas the focus of Paganism is on the pre-Christian past.{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=138}} Similarly, the New Age movement typically propounds a [[Universalism|universalist]] message that sees all religions as fundamentally the same, whereas Paganism stresses the difference between [[Monotheism|monotheistic religions]] and those embracing a [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] or [[Animism|animistic]] theology.{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=138}} While the New Age emphasises a light-centred image, Paganism acknowledges both light and dark, life and death, and recognises the savage side of the natural world.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=79}} Many Pagans have sought to distance themselves from the New Age movement, even using "New Age" as an insult within their community, while conversely many involved in the New Age have expressed criticism of Paganism for emphasizing the material world over the spiritual.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=9}}
Many Pagans have expressed criticism of the high fees charged by New Age teachers, something not typically present in the Pagan movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=1992|1p=139|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} with some Pagans pronouncing the word "newage" to rhyme with "[[sewage]]".{{sfn|Blain|Wallis|2007|p=6}}

===Non-Western and indigenous responses===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="In the case of New Age, its solipsism, coupled with its advocacy of free market principles, opens the world's spiritual arena as an opportunity for spiritual exploitation and even capitalistic imperialism. Not only does it encourage a paradoxical homogenizing to the cultural standards of North Atlantic civilization, exemplified in its affirmation that 'we are all one', but it also carries an implicit judgement of inferior status for non-hegemonic cultures, inasmuch as they are not considered to be the ones who decide what is to be shared and what is not."|source=— Sociologist Michael York.{{sfn|York|2001|pp=367–368}} }}

One of the most contentious aspects of the New Age has been its adoption of spiritual ideas and practises from other, particularly non-Western cultures.{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} Its belief that all traditions are free for anyone to use, rather than the [[private property]] of particular communities, has resulted in New Agers adopting and marketing the practices of [[Third World]] societies.{{sfn|York|2001|p=368}} These have included "Hawaiian [[Kahuna]] magic, Australian Aboriginal dream-working, South American Amerindian ''[[ayahuasca]]'' and ''San Pedro'' ceremony, Hindu Ayurveda and yoga, and Chinese Feng Shui, [[Qigong|Qi Gong]], and [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]]".{{sfn|York|2001|p=368}}

The New Age has been accused of [[cultural imperialism]], [[cultural appropriation|misappropriating]] the sacred ceremonies, and abuse of the intellectual and cultural property of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"&gt;Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (June 10, 1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/ladecwar.htm Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality]."

===Political writers and activists===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="New Age politics might be seen not as a wayward, pathological creature of the New Left's imagination, but as a political innocent in candid, questioning dialogue with the unclaimed mainstream territory of progressive, rather than atomistic, individualism.  Indeed, if we were to examine some of the social and political threads that run through the aery fabric of New Age thinking, we would find certain themes that resonate with the necessary conditions for a left version of progressive individualism.  Generally speaking, New Age addresses its adherents as active participants, with a measure of control over their everyday lives. ...  The New Age 'person' is also in many respects an individual whose personal growth is indissociable from the environment; a link fleshed out in a variety of ecotopian stories and romances.  So, too, the small-scale imperative of New Age's cooperative communitarianism brings with it a host of potentially critical positions. ..."|source=— Scholar of cultural studies [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]], 1991.{{sfn|Ross|1991|p=69}} }}

Toward the end of the 20th century, some social and political analysts and activists were arguing that the New Age political perspective had something to offer mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;Gerzon, Mark (1996).  ''A House Divided: Six Belief Systems Struggling for America's Soul''.  A Jeremy P. Tarcher Putnam Book / G. P. Putnam's Sons, Chap. 5 ("Gaia: The Transformation State").  {{ISBN|978-0-87477-823-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayne (1999), cited above, Chap. 11 ("Spiritual Politics").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray and Anderson (2000), cited above, Chap. 7 ("A Great Current of Change").&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, some political scientists launched the "Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics" of the [[American Political Science Association]],&lt;ref&gt;"Preface: Paths to Transformational Politics".  In Woolpert, Stephen; Slaton, Christa Daryl; and Schwerin, Edward W., eds. (1998).  ''Transformational Politics: Theory, Study, and Practice''.  State University of New York Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;ix–xi.  {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3945-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and an academic book prepared by three of them stated that the "transformational politics" concept was meant to subsume such terms as ''new age'' and ''new paradigm''.&lt;ref&gt;Slaton, Christa Daryl; Woolpert, Stephen; Schwerin, Ed.  "Introduction: What Is Transformational Politics?"   In Woolpert et al. (1998), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;xix.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, scholar of cultural studies [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]] suggested that New Age political ideas – however muddled and naïve – could help [[Progressivism in the United States#Progressivism in the 21st century|progressives]] construct an appealing alternative to both atomistic individualism and self-denying collectivism. {{sfn|Ross|1991|pp=65–72 ("New Age politics" sub-chapter)}}  In 2005, British researcher Stuart Rose urged scholars of alternative religions to pay more attention to the New Age's interest in such topics as "new socio-political thinking" and "New Economics",{{sfn|Rose|2005b|p=165}} topics Rose discussed in his book ''Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus'', issued by a European academic publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Stuart (2005).

Other political thinkers and activists saw New Age politics less positively.  On the political right, author [[George Weigel]] argued that New Age politics was just a retooled and pastel-colored version of leftism.&lt;ref&gt;Weigel, George (March 1989).  "No Options".  ''American Purpose'', vol. 3, no. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative evangelical writer Douglas Groothuis, discussed by scholars Hexham{{sfn|Hexham|1992| p=54}} and Kemp,{{sfn|Kemp|2004| p=52}} warned that New Age politics could lead to an oppressive world government.&lt;ref&gt;Groothuis, Douglas (1987).

Revell Company / Baker Publishing Group, pp.&amp;nbsp;92–93 and 103–105.  {{ISBN|978-0-8007-5257-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics was an oxymoron: that personal growth has little or nothing to do with political change.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, Andrew (2001).  ''The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation''.  Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;169.  {{ISBN|978-0-521-79252-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek, Slavoj]] (2000).  ''The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology''.  Verso Books, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2 and 70.  {{ISBN|978-1-85984-291-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  One political scientist said New Age politics fails to recognize the reality of economic and political power.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, Carl (2000).  ''The End of Politics: Corporate Power and the Decline of the Public Sphere''.  Guilford Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–72.  {{ISBN|978-1-57230-504-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another academic, [[Dana L. Cloud]], wrote a lengthy critique of New Age politics as a political ideology;&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, Dana L. (1998). ''Control and Consolation in American Culture and Politics: Rhetorics of Therapy''. Sage Publications, Chap. 6 ("The New Age of Post-Marxism").  {{ISBN|978-0-7619-0506-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; she faulted it for not being opposed to the [[capitalist system]], or to liberal individualism.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud (1998), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;144, 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of New Age often made by leftists is that its focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=8}} This perspective regards New Age as a manifestation of consumerism that promotes [[elitism]] and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|pp=6–7}}  New Agers who do engage in socio-political activism have also been criticized.  Journalist [[Harvey Wasserman]] suggested that New Age activists were too averse to social conflict to be effective politically.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Harvey (31 August 1985). "The New Age Movement: The Politics of Transcendence".  ''[[The Nation]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;147 (discussing the ideas of activist Shelly Kellman).&lt;/ref&gt; Melton et al. found that New Age activists' commitment to the often frustrating process of consensus decision-making led to "extended meetings and minimal results",{{sfn|Melton|1990| p=324}} and a pair of futurists concluded that one once-promising New Age activist group had been both "too visionary and too vague" to last.&lt;ref&gt;Lipnack, Jessica; Stamps, Jeffrey (1982).

'''Oral tradition''', or '''oral lore''', is a form of human [[communication]] wherein knowledge, art, ideas and cultural material is received, preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to another.&lt;ref name = "Vansina"&gt;[[Jan Vansina|Vansina, Jan]]: ''Oral Tradition as History'' (1985), reported statements from present generation which "specifies that the message must be oral statements spoken, sung or called out on musical instruments only"; "There must be transmission by word of mouth over at least a generation". He points out, "Our definition is a working definition for the use of historians. Sociologists, linguists or scholars of the verbal arts propose their own, which in, e.g., sociology, stresses common knowledge. In linguistics, features that distinguish the language from common dialogue (linguists), and in the verbal arts features of form and content that define art (folklorists)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannicaot/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ki-Zerbo"&gt;Ki-Zerbo, Joseph: "Methodology and African Prehistory", 1990, ''UNESCO International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa''; James Currey Publishers, {{ISBN|0-85255-091-X}}, 9780852550915; see Ch. 7; "Oral tradition and its methodology" at pages 54-61; at page 54: "Oral tradition may be defined as being a testimony transmitted verbally from one generation to another.  Its special characteristics are that it is verbal and the manner in which it is transmitted."&lt;/ref&gt; The transmission is through speech or song and may include folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verses. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit [[oral history]], [[oral literature]], [[oral law]] and other knowledge across generations without a [[writing system]], or in parallel to a writing system. Religions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], for example, have used an oral tradition, in parallel to a writing system, to transmit their canonical scriptures, secular knowledge such as [[Sushruta Samhita]], hymns and mythologies from one generation to the next.&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Goody |title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TepXQMN6lfUC |year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=978-0-521-33794-6 |pages=110–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=witzel68/&gt;&lt;ref name=lopez1995p21&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donald S.

Oral tradition is information, memories and knowledge held in common by a group of people, over many generations, and it is not same as [[testimony]] or [[oral history]].&lt;ref name = "Vansina"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Henige|Henige, David]]. "Oral, but Oral What? The Nomenclatures of Orality and Their Implications" ''Oral Tradition'', 3/1-2 (1988): 229-38. p 232; Henige cites Jan Vansina (1985). Oral tradition as history. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press&lt;/ref&gt; In a general sense, "oral tradition" refers to the recall and transmission of a specific, preserved textual and [[culture|cultural]] knowledge through vocal utterance.&lt;ref name=britannicaot&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/oral-tradition Oral Tradition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809191457/https://www.britannica.com/topic/oral-tradition |date=2016-08-09 }}, Encyclopædia Britannica, John Miles Foley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacKay1999p1"/&gt; As an [[academic discipline]], it refers both to a set of objects of study and a [[Scientific method|method]] by which they are studied.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, Alan, "Editor's Introduction" to ''The Theory of Oral Composition'', [[John Miles Foley]]. Bloomington, IUP, 1988, pp. ix-xii&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to John Foley, oral tradition has been an ancient human tradition found in "all corners of the world".&lt;ref name="MacKay1999p1"/&gt; Modern archaeology has been unveiling evidence of the human efforts to preserve and transmit arts and knowledge that depended completely or partially on an oral tradition, across various cultures:

{{Quote|
The Judeo-Christian Bible reveals its oral traditional roots; medieval European manuscripts are penned by performing scribes; geometric vases from archaic Greece mirror Homer's oral style. (...) Indeed, if these final decades of the millennium have taught us anything, it must be that oral tradition never was the other we accused it of being; it never was the primitive, preliminary technology of communication we thought it to be. Rather, if the whole truth is told, oral tradition stands out as the single most dominant communicative technology of our species as both a historical fact and, in many areas still, a contemporary reality.

In Asia, the transmission of folklore, mythologies as well as scriptures in ancient India, in different Indian religions, was by oral tradition, preserved with precision with the help of elaborate [[Vedic chant|mnemonic techniques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donald S.

==Transmission==
[[File:Helsinki-Folk-singer-statue-1750.JPG|thumb|The legendary Finnish storyteller [[Väinämöinen]] with his [[kantele]]]]
Oral traditions face the challenge of accurate transmission and verifiability of the accurate version, particularly when the culture lacks written language or has limited access to writing tools. Oral cultures have employed various strategies that achieve this without writing. For example, a heavily rhythmic speech filled with [[mnemonic device]]s enhances memory and recall. A few useful mnemonic devices include [[alliteration]], repetition, [[assonance]], and proverbial sayings. In addition, the verse is often metrically composed with an exact number of syllables or [[morae]] - such as with Greek and Latin prosody and in [[Sanskrit prosody|Chandas]] found in Hindu and Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan2013p228"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Scharf|editor=Keith Allan|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQfDosHckzEC|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-164344-6|pages=228–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verses of the epic or text are typically designed wherein the long and short syllables are repeated by certain rules, so that if an error or inadvertent change is made, an internal examination of the verse reveals the problem.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatyana J.

| The law itself in oral cultures is enshrined in formulaic sayings, proverbs, which are not mere jurisprudential decorations, but themselves constitute the law. A judge in an oral culture is often called on to articulate sets of relevant proverbs out of which he can produce equitable decisions in the cases under formal litigation before him.&lt;ref name="Longman Publishers USA"/&gt;
|}

[[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[The Jungle Book]] provides an excellent demonstration of oral governance in the [[Law of the Jungle]]. Not only does grounding rules in oral proverbs allow for simple transmission and understanding, but it also legitimizes new rulings by allowing extrapolation. These stories, traditions, and proverbs are not static, but are often altered upon each transmission barring the overall meaning remains intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=Erin|title=Oral Traditions|url=http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/culture/oral-traditions.html|website=Indigenous Foundations|accessdate=5 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082618/http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/culture/oral-traditions.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the rules that govern the people are modified by the whole and not authored by a single entity.

===Indian religions===
Ancient texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] were preserved and transmitted by an oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe |title=Handbook of Oriental Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7s19sZFRxCUC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-12556-6 |pages=24–29, 226–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lopez |title=Buddhist Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pd-2IIzip4C |year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-190937-0 |pages=xi–xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[śruti]]s of Hinduism called the [[Veda]]s, the oldest of which trace back to the second millennium BCE. [[Michael Witzel]] explains this oral tradition as follows:&lt;ref name=witzel68/&gt;

{{quote|The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on.  This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a ''tape-recording''... Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present.|Michael Witzel&lt;ref name=witzel68&gt;M Witzel, "Vedas and Upaniṣads", in Flood, Gavin, ed. (2003), The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|1-4051-3251-5}}, pages 68-71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ancient Indians developed techniques for listening, memorization and recitation of their knowledge, in schools called [[Guru]]kul, while maintaining exceptional accuracy of their knowledge across the generations.&lt;ref name=scharfe28&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe |title=Handbook of Oriental Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7s19sZFRxCUC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-12556-6 |pages=24–29, 226–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of recitation or ''paths'' were designed to aid accuracy in recitation and the transmission of the ''[[Veda]]s'' and other knowledge texts from one generation to the next. All hymns in each Veda were recited in this way; for example, all 1,028 hymns with 10,600 verses of the Rigveda was preserved in this way; as were all other Vedas including the [[Principal Upanishads]], as well as the Vedangas. Each text was recited in a number of ways, to ensure that the different methods of recitation acted as a cross check on the other. Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat summarizes this as follows:&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139/&gt;
* ''Samhita-patha'': continuous recitation of Sanskrit words bound by the phonetic rules of euphonic combination;
* ''Pada-patha'': a recitation marked by a conscious pause after every word, and after any special grammatical codes embedded inside the text; this method suppresses euphonic combination and restores each word in its original intended form;
* ''Krama-patha'': a step-by-step recitation where euphonically-combined words are paired successively and sequentially and then recited; for example, a hymn "word1 word2 word3 word4...", would be recited as "word1word2 word2word3 word3word4 ...."; this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Gargya and Sakarya in the Hindu tradition and mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini (dated to pre-Buddhism period);
* ''Krama-patha'' modified: the same step-by-step recitation as above, but without euphonic-combinations (or free form of each word); this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Babhravya and Galava in the Hindu tradition, and is also mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini;
* ''{{IAST|Jata-pāṭha}}'', ''{{IAST|dhvaja-pāṭha}}'' and ''{{IAST|ghana-pāṭha}}'' are methods of recitation of a text and its oral transmission that developed after 5th century BCE, that is after the start of Buddhism and Jainism; these methods use more complicated rules of combination and were less used.

These extraordinary retention techniques guaranteed an accurate Śruti, fixed across the generations, not just in terms of unaltered word order but also in terms of sound.&lt;ref name=scharfe28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilke, Annette and Moebus, Oliver.

===Chronology===
[[File:Filip Visnjic guslar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Filip Višnjić]] (1767&amp;ndash;1834), [[Serbia]]n blind [[gusle|guslar]]]]
The following overview draws upon ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography'', (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985, 1986, 1989); additional material is summarized from the overlapping prefaces to the following volumes: ''The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology'', (Indiana University Press, 1988, 1992); ''Immanent Art: From Structure to Meaning in Traditional Oral Epic'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991); ''The Singer of Tales in Performance'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1995) and ''Comparative Research on Oral Traditions: A Memorial for Milman Parry'' (Columbus, Ohio: Slavica Publishers, 1987). in the work of the Serb scholar [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] (1787–1864), a contemporary and friend of the [[Brothers Grimm]]. Vuk pursued similar projects of "salvage folklore" (similar to [[rescue archaeology]]) in the [[cognate]] traditions of the Southern [[Slavs|Slavic]] regions which would later be gathered into [[Yugoslavia]], and with the same admixture of [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[nationalistic]] interests (he considered all those speaking the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] as Serbs). Somewhat later, but as part of the same scholarly enterprise of nationalist studies in folklore,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/5i/5_radloff.pdf "Early Scholarship on Oral Traditions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529035828/http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/5i/5_radloff.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}: Radloff, Jousse and Murko ''Oral Tradition'' 5:1 (1990) 73-90&lt;/ref&gt; the [[turcology|turcologist]] [[Vasily Radlov]] (1837–1918) would study the songs of the [[Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast|Kara-Kirghiz]] in what would later become the Soviet Union; Karadzic and Radloff would provide models for the work of Parry.

===Walter Ong===
In a separate development, the [[media theory|media theorist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] (1911–1980) would begin to focus attention on the ways that [[communication|communicative]] [[Mass media|media]] shape the nature of the content conveyed.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Marshall McLuhan, ''The Gutenberg Galaxy:  The Making of Typographic Man''.  University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; He would serve as mentor to the [[Jesuit]], [[Walter Ong]] (1912–2003), whose interests in [[cultural history]], [[psychology]] and [[rhetoric]] would result in ''Orality and Literacy'' (Methuen, 1980) and the important but less-known ''Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality and Consciousness'' (Cornell, 1981)&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Fighting for Life:  Context, Sexuality, and Consciousness''.  Cornell University Press, Ithaca &amp; London, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; These two works articulated the contrasts between cultures defined by [[Orality#Primary orality|primary orality]], writing, print, and the [[secondary orality]] of the electronic age.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, pp. 57 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

| I style the morality of a culture totally untouched by any knowledge of writing or print, 'primary orality'.  It is 'primary' by contrast with the 'secondary orality' of present-day high technology culture, in which a new orality is sustained by telephone, radio, television and other electronic devices that depend for their existence and functioning on writing and print.  Today primary culture in the strict sense hardly exists, since every culture knows of writing and has some experience of its effects.  Still, to varying degrees many cultures and sub-cultures, even in a high-technology ambiance, preserve much of the mind-set of primary orality.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Orality and Literacy'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Ong's works also made possible an integrated theory of oral tradition which accounted for both production of content (the chief concern of Parry-Lord theory) and its reception.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; This approach, like McLuhan's, kept the field open not just to the study of aesthetic culture but to the way physical and behavioral artifacts of oral societies are used to store, manage and transmit knowledge, so that oral tradition provides methods for investigation of cultural differences, other than the purely verbal, between oral and literate societies.

The most-often studied section of ''Orality and Literacy'' concerns the "[[psychodynamics]] of orality" This chapter seeks to define the fundamental characteristics of 'primary' orality and summarizes a series of descriptors (including but not limited to verbal aspects of culture) which might be used to index the relative orality or literacy of a given text or society.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Orality and literacy:  the technologizing of the word'', pp. 31-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Miles Foley===
In advance of Ong's synthesis, [[John Miles Foley]] began a series of papers based on his own fieldwork on South Slavic oral genres, emphasizing the dynamics of performers and audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Foley effectively consolidated oral tradition as an academic field [http://illumination.missouri.edu/spr05/fol1.htm] when he compiled ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research'' in 1985. The bibliography gives a summary of the progress scholars made in evaluating the oral tradition up to that point, and includes a list of all relevant scholarly articles relating to the theory of [[Oral-Formulaic Composition]]. He also both established both the journal ''Oral Tradition'' and founded the ''Center for Studies in Oral Tradition'' (1986) at the [[University of Missouri]]. Foley developed Oral Theory beyond the somewhat mechanistic notions presented in earlier versions of Oral-Formulaic Theory, by extending Ong's interest in cultural features of oral societies beyond the verbal, by drawing attention to the agency of the [[bard]] and by describing how oral traditions bear meaning.

The bibliography  would establish a clear underlying methodology which accounted for the findings of scholars working in the separate [[Linguistics]] fields (primarily [[Ancient Greek]], Anglo-Saxon and Serbo-Croatian).  Perhaps more importantly, it would stimulate conversation among these specialties, so that a network of independent but allied investigations and investigators could be established.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Oral Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. NY: Garland, 1985. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, pp. 64-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foley's key works include ''The Theory of Oral Composition'' (1988);&lt;ref&gt;John Miles Foley.  ''The Theory of Oral Composition:  History and Methodology''.  Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Immanent Art'' (1991); ''Traditional Oral Epic: The Odyssey, Beowulf and the Serbo-Croatian Return-Song'' (1993); ''The Singer of Tales in Performance'' (1995); ''Teaching Oral Traditions'' (1998); ''How to Read an Oral Poem'' (2002). His [http://www.pathwaysproject.org/pathways/show/HomePage Pathways Project] (2005-2012) draws parallels between the media dynamics of oral traditions and the [[Internet]].

===Acceptance and further elaboration===
The theory of oral tradition would undergo elaboration and development as it grew in acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. "Oral Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography." NY: Garland, 1985. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; While the number of formulas documented for various traditions proliferated,&lt;ref&gt;A. Orchard, 'Oral Tradition', ''Reading Old English Texts'', ed. K O'Brien O'Keeffe (Cambridge, 1997), pp. 101-23&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of the formula remained lexically-bound. However, numerous innovations appeared, such as the "formulaic system"&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Donald K. "Old English Formulas and Systems" ''English Studies'' 48 (1967):193-204. responds to what was known, pejoratively, in Greek studies as the "hard Parryist" position, in which the formula was defined in terms of verbatim lexical repetition (see Rosenmyer, Thomas G. "The Formula in Early Greek Poetry" ''Arion'' 4 (1965):295-311). Fry's model proposes underlying generative templates which provide for variation and even artistic creativity within the constraints of strict metrical requirements and extempore composition-in-performance&lt;/ref&gt; with structural "substitution slots" for [[syntax|syntactic]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[narrative]] necessity (as well as for artistic invention).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Adam Brooke "Verba volent, scripta manent: Oral Tradition and the Non-Narrative Genres of Old English Poetry."  Diss. Univ. of Missouri at Columbia.  DAI 52A (1991), 2137  pp. 202, 205&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated models such as Foley's "word-type placement rules" followed.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. Immanent Art: From Structure to Meaning in Traditional Oral Epic. Bloomington: IUP, 1991. 30, 31, 202n22, 207 n36, 211n43&lt;/ref&gt; Higher levels of formulaic composition were defined over the years, such as "[[ring composition]]",&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. "The Singer of Tales in Performance. Bloomington: IUP, 1995. 55, 60, 89 108, 122n40&lt;/ref&gt; "responsion"&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Alexandra Hennessey. "Oral -Formulaic Research in Old English Studies:II" ''Oral Tradition'' 3:1-2 (1988) 138-90, p. 165) Olsen cites Foley's "Hybrid Prosody and Old English Half-Lines" in ''Neophilologus'' 64:284-89 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; and the "[[type-scene]]" (also called a "theme" or "typical scene"&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Singer of Tales in Performance''. Bloomington: IUP, 1995. 2, 7, 8n15, 17 et passim.&lt;/ref&gt;). Examples include the "Beasts of Battle"&lt;ref&gt;Magoun, Francis P.  "The Oral-Formulaic Character of Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poetry."  ''Speculum'' 28 (1953):  446-67&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Cliffs of Death".&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Donald K. "The Cliff of Death in Old English Poetry." In ''Comparative Research in Oral Traditions:  A Memorial for Milman Parry'', ed. John Miles Foley.  Columbus:  Slavica, 1987, 213-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these characteristic patterns of narrative details, (like "the arming sequence;"&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Zumthor|Zumthor, Paul]] "The Text and the Voice." Transl. Marilyn C. Englehardt. ''New Literary History'' 16 (1984):67-92&lt;/ref&gt; "the hero on the beach";&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Crowne, "The Hero on the Beach: An Example of Composition by Theme in Anglo-Saxon Poetry", ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 61 (1960), 371.&lt;/ref&gt; "the traveler recognizes his goal")&lt;ref&gt;Clark, George. "The Traveller Recognizes His Goal." ''Journal of English and Germanic Philolog''y, 64 (1965):645-59.&lt;/ref&gt; would show evidence of global distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, James I.  "The Arming Motif in the Iliad".  ''The American Journal of Philology'', Vol. 79, No. 4. (1958), pp. 337-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the fairly rigid division between oral and literate was replaced by recognition of transitional and compartmentalized texts and societies, including models of [[diglossia]] ([[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]].

A study of the AG oral mentality that assumes (1) the existence of composition and thinking that took shape under the aegis of oral patterns, (2) the educational apparatus as an oral system, and (3) the origins of philosophy as we know it in the abstract intellectual reaction against the oral mentality. The opening section on historical background covers developments in archaeology and textual criticism (including Parry's work) since the late nineteenth century, with descriptions of and comments on formulaic and thematic structure. In "The Technique of the Oral Poet" (14-22), he sketches both a synchronic picture of the singer weaving his narrative and a diachronic view of the tradition developing over time. In the third part, on the psychology of performance, he discusses "the prevalence of rhythmic speech over prose; the prevalence of the event' over the abstraction'; and the prevalence of the paratactic arrangement of parts... over alternative schema possible in other styles" (23). In sympathy with Havelock (1963), he interprets Plato's reaction against the poets as one against the oral mentality and its educative process.&lt;/ref&gt; [[communication theory]],&lt;ref&gt;"Review: Communication Studies as American Studies" Daniel Czitrom  ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 42, No. 4 (Dec., 1990), pp. 678-683&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semiotics]],&lt;ref&gt;Nimis, Stephen A.

This paper has to do with the challenges of globalization in modern Nigeria and the process of "culture education," a terminology used to emphasize the peculiar means and methods of instruction by which a society imparts its body of values and mores in the pursuance and attainment of the society's collective vision, aspirations, and goals. Within this framework, this paper examines the legacies of imperialism and colonization within the Nigerian educational system––particularly in reference to the teaching of folklore and oral tradition––including the destruction of indigenous knowledge systems and the continuing lack of adequate resources in African universities. The paper concludes by offering suggestions for a more fully synthesized indigenous and formal Nigerian educational system as a method of addressing postcolonial rupture.

==Criticism and debates==
The theory of oral tradition encountered early resistance from scholars who perceived it as potentially supporting either one side or another in the controversy between what were known as [[Homeric question|"unitarians" and "analysts"]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, scholars who believed [[Homer]] to have been a single, historical figure, and those who saw him as a conceptual "author function," a convenient name to assign to what was essentially a repertoire of traditional narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick M. Combellack]],  "Milman Parry and Homeric Artistry" ''Comparative Literature'', Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer, 1959), pp. 193-208 . p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; A much more general dismissal of the theory and its implications simply described it as "unprovable"&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, R.B. Homer: Odyssey Books XIX &amp; XX,, Cambridge UP 1992 remarks on oral-formulaic diction, pp. 47-49&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, mainly outside the field of oral tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Botstein, Leon. "Hearing Is Seeing: Thoughts on the History of Music and the Imagination." ''The Musical Quarterly'' 1995 79(4):581-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_folklore_research/v043/43.3oring.html Elliot Oring cites Bruchac, Joe Storytelling: Oral History or Game of 'Telephone'?"] ''American Folklore Society Newsletter'' 19/2:3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christopherbutler.wordpress.com/2006/04/28/scriptural-transmission-inspiration-and-inerrancy/ |title=Christopher Butler cites Bart Ehrman, ‘Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why’ |publisher=Christopherbutler.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105051417/http://christopherbutler.wordpress.com/2006/04/28/scriptural-transmission-inspiration-and-inerrancy/ |archivedate=2012-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valdosta.edu/folkwriting/pdf/chapter4.PDF |title=chapter4.DOC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082630/http://www.valdosta.edu/folkwriting/pdf/chapter4.PDF |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; represent (either dismissively or with approval) this body of theoretical work as reducing the great [[Epic poetry|epics]] to children's party games like "[[telephone (game)|telephone]]" or "[[Chinese whispers]]".  While games provide amusement by showing how messages distort content via uncontextualized transmission, Parry's supporters argue that the theory of oral tradition reveals how oral methods optimized the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and thus improved the quality, stability and [[integrity]] of content transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''The God Delusion''. Great Britain: Bantam, 2006 p. 118 -- Dawkins contradicts this view, however, on p. 227)&lt;/ref&gt;

There were disputes concerning particular findings of the theory. For example, those trying to support or refute Crowne's hypothesis found the "Hero on the Beach" formula in numerous Old English poems. Similarly, it was also discovered in other works of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] origin, [[Middle English poetry]], and even an [[Iceland]]ic prose [[saga]]. J.A. Dane, in an article&lt;ref&gt;Dane, J.A. "Finnsburh and Iliad IX: A Greek Survival of the Medieval Germanic Oral-Formulaic Theme  The Hero on the Beach." ''Neophilologus'' 66:443-449&lt;/ref&gt; characterized as "polemics without rigor"&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography'', (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the appearance of the theme in [[Ancient Greek]] poetry, a tradition without known connection to the Germanic, invalidated the notion of "an autonomous theme in the baggage of an oral poet."

Within Homeric studies specifically, Lord's ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', which focused on problems and questions that arise in conjunction with applying oral-formulaic theory to problematic texts such as the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]'', and even ''[[Beowulf]]'', influenced nearly all of the articles written on [[Homer]] and oral-formulaic composition thereafter. However, in response to Lord, Geoffrey Kirk published ''The Songs of Homer'', questioning Lord's extension of the oral-formulaic nature of Serbian and Croatian literature (the area from which the theory was first developed) to Homeric epic. Kirk argues that Homeric poems differ from those traditions in their "metrical strictness", "formular system[s]", and creativity. In other words, Kirk argued that Homeric poems were recited under a system that gave the reciter much more freedom to choose words and passages to get to the same end than the Serbo-Croatian poet, who was merely "reproductive".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Geoffrey S. ''The Songs of Homer.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. pp88 - 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Eric Havelock's ''Preface to Plato'' revolutionized how scholars looked at Homeric epic by arguing not only that it was the product of an oral tradition, but also that the oral-formulas contained therein served as a way for ancient Greeks to preserve cultural knowledge across many different generations.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Parry]], in his 1966 work "Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?", theorized the existence of the most fully developed oral poet to his time, a person who could (at his discretion) creatively and intellectually create nuanced characters in the context of the accepted, traditional story. In fact, he discounted the Serbo-Croatian tradition to an "unfortunate" extent, choosing to elevate the Greek model of oral-tradition above all others.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. pp. 36, 505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Adam. "Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?"''Yale Classical Studies.''20 (1966), pp.. 177-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord reacted to Kirk's and Parry's essays with "Homer as Oral Poet", published in 1968, which reaffirmed Lord's belief in the relevance of Yugoslav poetry and its similarities to Homer and downplayed the intellectual and literary role of the reciters of Homeric epic.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. pp. 40, 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the criticisms of the theory have been absorbed into the evolving field as useful refinements and modifications. For example, in what Foley called a "pivotal" contribution, [[Larry Benson]] introduced the concept of "written-formulaic" to describe the status of some Anglo-Saxon poetry which, while demonstrably written, contains evidence of oral influences, including heavy reliance on formulas and themes&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc. 1985. p. 42.; Foley cites "The Literary Character of Anglo-Saxon Formulaic Poetry" Publications of the Modern Language Association 81 (1966):, 334-41&lt;/ref&gt; A number of individual scholars in many areas continue to have misgivings about the applicability of the theory or the aptness of the South Slavic comparison,&lt;ref&gt;George E. Dimock. "From Homer to Novi Pazar and B ack." ''Arion'', 2, iv:40-57. Reacts against the Parry-Lord hypothesis of an oral Homer, claiming that, although Lord demonstrated that the oral poet thinks in verse and offered many explanations of the various facets of the Homeric Question by recourse to the Yugoslav analogy, the difference between Homer and other, literate poets is one of degree rather than kind. Wants to rescue Homer's art from what he sees as the dangers inherent in the oral theory model.&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly what they regard as its implications for the creativity which may legitimately be attributed to the individual artist.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the most prominent and steadfast opponent of oral traditional theory on these grounds was [[Arthur Brodeur]], in, e.g., ''The Art of Beowulf''. Berkeley: University of California Press. 3rd printing 1969; "A Study of Diction and Style in Three Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poems." In ''Nordica et Anglica''. Ed. Allan H. Orrick. The Hague: Mouton. pp. 97-114; "Beowulf: One Poem or Three?" In ''Medieval Literature and Folklore Studies in Honor of Francis Lee Utley''. Ed. Jerome Mandel and Bruce A. Rosenberg. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press. pp. 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at present, there seems to be little systematic or theoretically coordinated challenge to the fundamental tenets of the theory; as Foley put it, ""there have been numerous suggestions for revisions or modifications of the theory, but the majority of controversies have generated further understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology''. Bloomington:IUP, 1988." p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">'''Penguin Composition Rules''' were the guidelines written by typographer [[Jan Tschichold]] for use in composing the pages and typography of [[Penguin Books]]. The rules were embodied in a four-page booklet of typographic instructions for editors and compositors. The booklet includes headings for various aspects of composition: Text Composition; Indenting of Paragraphs; Punctuation Marks and Spelling; Capitals, Small Capitals, and Italics; References and Footnotes; Folios; The Printing of Plays; The Printing of Poetry; Make-up.

Beyond this specific set of guidelines, Tschichold made further changes to Penguin's graphic standards. Penguin is well known for its standardized book covers and formats, as well as the diversity of the standards.&lt;ref&gt;The seeming contradiction between standardization and diversity is explained by the vast numbers of books produced by Penguin over many years.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jan Tschichold and Penguin==
Penguin Books was founded by Allen Lane in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152710/http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic look of Penguin was established before Lane brought Tschichold to Penguin in the late 1940s as head of typography and production. Tschichold was in England at Penguin between 1947 and 1949 before returning to Switzerland.

Tschichold's standardization of Penguin covers essentially took existing elements and refined them visually and refined their arrangement. Under Tschichold the covers included the use of [[Eric Gill|Eric Gill's]] [[Gill Sans]] typeface, which he was careful to have spaced evenly. According to Tschichold establishing this quality was not immediately embraced by the compositors; “Every day I had to wade through miles of corrections (often ten books daily).

'''Pickup artists''' ('''PUA''') – also known as '''pick-up artists''', '''seduction community''', or '''pickup community''' – is a movement of men whose goal is [[seduction]] and [[sexual selection|sexual success]] with and access to women. Members of the community are often referred to as pickup artists (PUA). The community exists through Internet [[newsletter]]s and [[weblog]]s, marketing (e.g. [[banner ad]]s, seminars, one-on-one coaching), forums and groups, as well as over a hundred local clubs, known as "lairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/winging-it/2007/01/28/1169919210771.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=Winging it |author= |date=29 January 2007 |work=The Age  |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The modern seduction movement dates to 1970, with the publication of ''How To Pick Up Girls!'' by [[Eric Weber (director)|Eric Weber]], credited as the first modern pickup artist.{{sfn|Strauss|2005|page=430}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Weber | first=Eric | title=How to Pick Up Girls!: Discover Exactly how to Meet Beautiful Women. In Bars, Buses, Trains — even on the Street! The Fool Proof Guide to Meeting Women without a Formal Introduction
|publisher=Symphony Press, Incorporated | year=1970 | isbn=978-0-91409400-5 |pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one self-described "picker-upper of women" preceding Weber was rational emotive psychotherapist [[Albert Ellis]], who wrote ''The Art of Erotic Seduction'', a how-to guide for men that encouraged them to meet women through the "pickup", with Roger Conway in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Albert|last2=Conway|first2=Roger|title=The art of erotic seduction|date=1967|publisher=Lyle Stuart|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis claimed he had been practicing seducing female strangers since he overcame his fear of approaching them through "in-vivo desensitization" in Bronx Botanical Garden in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Albert|last2=Joffe-Ellis|first2=Debbie|title=All out! : an autobiography|date=2010|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=9781591024521}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970s and 1980s saw independent authors and teachers, but no organized community.

The seduction community itself originated with [[Ross Jeffries]] and his students. In the late 1980s, Jeffries taught workshops, promoted a collection of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP) techniques called "speed seduction" (SS), and published a short book of his techniques, ''How to Get the Women You Desire into Bed''.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots"&gt;{{cite news|title=He Aims!

In 1994, Lewis De Payne, then a student of Jeffries, founded the [[newsgroup]] [[alt.* hierarchy|alt]].seduction.fast (ASF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastseduction.com/asf-faq.shtml|title=alt.seduction.fast FAQ and history|author=Jay Valens|date=3 March 2002|accessdate=16 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524223047/http://www.fastseduction.com/asf-faq.shtml|archivedate=24 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which marked the birth of the community per se.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots" /&gt; This then spawned a network of other Internet discussion forums, email lists, blogs, and sites where seduction techniques could be exchanged.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/02.08.06/nlp-0606.html |title=Working Overtime on the Seduction Line |author=Bill Forman |date=8 February 2006 |work=Metroactive |publisher=Metro Publishing Inc |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original alt.seduction.fast became overwhelmed with [[spam (electronic)|spam]], and a group called "Learn the Skills Corporation" developed a moderated alternative known as "Moderated ASF" (commonly "mASF").{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} During the same period, in the late 1990s, Clifford Lee began his ''Cliff's List Seduction Letter'' as a central independent voice of the community.&lt;ref name="Toronto Sun"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2008/12/31/7891486.html |title=Disgraced doctor is T.O's seduction guru |author=Jenny Yuen |date=13 April 2008 |work=Toronto Sun |publisher=Sun Media |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other seduction teachers emerged with competing methods, and became known within this community as "seduction gurus" or "gurus".&lt;ref name="Sex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/071405/news2.html |title=Seduction for Dummies |author=Kristian Gravenor |date=14 July 2005 |work=Montreal Mirror |publisher=Communications Gratte-Ciel Ltée |accessdate=26 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050716235052/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/071405/news2.html |archivedate=16 July 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially successful seduction/pick up book was a manual by [[Tariq Nasheed]] (also known as King Flex) entitled ''The Art Of Mackin'', which was released in 2000. Tariq Nasheed went on to write several other seduction/dating books such as ''The Mack Within: The Holy Book Of Game''  and ''The Elite Way:10 Rules Men Must Know In Order To Deal With Women''.

The community was brought to greater mainstream awareness with the 1999 drama film ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', in which [[Tom Cruise]] portrayed a charismatic yet embittered and emotionally troubled pickup guru who was loosely modeled on Ross Jeffries.&lt;ref&gt;Konow, David (January/February 2000). "PTA Meeting: An Interview with Paul Thomas Anderson". ''Creative Screenwriting''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, journalist [[Neil Strauss]] wrote ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists]]'', an exposé of the seduction community. ''The Game'' reached the [[New York Times Bestseller List]], and made known pickup and seduction techniques to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2008-04-09/news/cock-and-awe-st-louis-pickup-artists-rule-the-roost/3 |title=Cock and Awe |author=Aimee Levitt |date=9 April 2008 |work=Riverfront Times |publisher= |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community was further publicized with the television show ''[[The Pick-up Artist (TV series)|The Pick Up Artist]]'' (2007–2008) on [[VH1]].

Within the community, ''seduction lairs'' are underground meeting groups for men devoted to the study of [[seduction]] as it is taught in the seduction community. Lairs first began as study groups soon after Ross Jeffries released his first products and began teaching sometime in the early 90s.&lt;ref name="eyeweekly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/city/features/article/22843 |title=Portrait of a Pickup Artist |author=Alex Molotkow |date=2 April 2008 |work=Eye Weekly |publisher=Star Media Group |accessdate=26 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207223645/http://www.eyeweekly.com/city/features/article/22843 |archivedate=7 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of lairs now exist worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dallaspua.com/lairs.htm |title=Lair List |author= |date= |work=Lair List |publisher=Dallas PUA Society |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "lair" typically involves two elements: an online forum and group meetings. These elements are used as resources for men who want to learn to become well-versed in how to successfully attract women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5jofAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=adAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5923,3535197&amp;dq=seduction-community+lairs&amp;hl=en |title=From Chump to Pickup Artist via 'The Community' |author=Neil Strauss |date=25 January 2004 |work= |publisher=Herald-Journal |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==
Supporters of this community typically believe that the conventional dating advice for men is flawed. For example, they reject the notion that men should attempt to woo women by spending money on them (e.g. buying drinks, presents, jewelry), calling it ''[[supplication]]''.

Many members of the seduction community work on their "game" (seduction skills) by improving their understanding of psychology, their confidence and self-esteem (termed "inner game"), and their social skills and physical appearance (physical fitness, fashion sense, grooming) ("outer game"). Many members of the community believe that one's "game" is refined through regular practice,&lt;ref name="macleans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/article.jsp?content=20050829_111329_111329 |title=Q&amp;A with Author Neil Strauss |author=George Lianne |date=29 August 2005 |work=Maclean's |publisher=Kenneth Whyte |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619125551/http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/article.jsp?content=20050829_111329_111329 |archivedate=19 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the idea that the abilities needed to interact in this way with women can be improved.

The seduction community has a unique set of [[acronym]]s and [[jargon]] for describing male–female dynamics and social interaction.&lt;ref name="Sex" /&gt;  For example, "average frustrated chump" (AFC) is a term coined by Ross Jeffries to describe males who are typically clueless and incompetent with women.&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots" /&gt; "Alpha-Male Of the Group" (AMOG) is a reference to a competing male, who is usually either befriended by the PUA, or, if necessary, ridiculed.

The community claims that these concepts derive from scientific disciplines, such as the concept of [[social proof]] from the psychology of [[Social influence|influence]], and various concepts from [[sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]] (such as the term "[[Alpha (biology)|alpha male]]").

== Pickup artist==
A pickup artist (commonly abbreviated PUA) is a person who practices finding, attracting, and [[seduction|seducing]] sexual partners. Such a person purportedly abides by a certain system deemed effective by that community in their attempts to seduce partners.

The use of ''pickup'' in this context, [[slang]] for making a casual acquaintance with a stranger in anticipation of sexual relations, was popularized by the 1970 book ''How to Pick Up Girls'' by Eric Weber,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | edition = 1st | title = How to Pick Up Girls | first = Eric | last = Weber | publisher = Symphony Press | place = Tenafly, NJ, USA | year = 1970}},&lt;/ref&gt; and by ''Pick-Up Times'', a short-lived 1970s magazine, and the 1987 semi-autobiographical romantic comedy ''[[The Pick-up Artist (film)|The Pick-up Artist]]'', written and directed by [[James Toback]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss (2005), pp. 124, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent works of pickup artist culture include [[Neil Strauss]]'s book, ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists]]'', and the 2007 [[VH1]] [[reality television]] series, ''[[The Pickup Artist (TV series)|The Pickup Artist]]'', starring the pickup artist [[Erik von Markovik|Mystery]]. The pickup artist [[Roosh V]] has self-published 14 books describing techniques for seducing women.&lt;ref name="citypaper"&gt;Jule Banville, [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/08/12/blogger-stud-living-in-dads-basement-writing-second-book-on-how-to-get-laid/ "Blogger Stud Living in Dad’s Basement, Writing Second Book on How to Get Laid"], "Washington City Paper", 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', such books are the "cash cow" of the pickup industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lu |first=Peter |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/09/20/greatest_pickup_artists_of_their_generation/ |title=Simple Pickup: Are these the greatest pickup artists of all time? |publisher=Salon.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term pickup artist is also associated with the seduction community, a [[heterosexual]] male [[subculture]] which strives to improve sexual and romantic abilities with women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-game-and-real-social-dynamics-is-the-seduction-community-pushing-the-idea-that-no-just-means-not-8463333.html|title=The Game and Real Social dynamics: Is the seduction community pushing the idea that ‘no’ just means ‘not yet’?|last=Bloodworth|first=James|date=2013-01-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Routines and gambits are developed to stimulate purported "attraction switches", often combined with techniques derived from an alleged form of hypnosis called [[neuro-linguistic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/relationships/6987982/Pick-up-artists-online-seduction-and-dating-tips.html |title=Pick-up artists, online seduction and dating tips |author=Tom Chivers |date=14 January 2010 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location = UK | accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members aim to improve their seductive capabilities through the development of various lifestyles. The culture surrounding pickup has spawned an entire industry servicing those who want to improve their social and seduction skills with consultations and in-field training.&lt;ref&gt;Mountford, J. B. "Topic Modeling The Red Pill." Social Sciences 7.3 (2018): 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickup artists receive mixed to negative responses from the press and general public, with many regarding both the practice and theory as immoral, sexist and ineffective. In 2014, following widely supported public petitions, U.S.-based PUA speaker and instructor [[Julien Blanc]] was denied entry to both the United Kingdom and Australia after he published YouTube videos explaining and demonstrating behaviors such as grabbing women by the throat, and forcing their heads towards his crotch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Gail|title='Dating coach' Julien Blanc kicked out of Australia for crude 'pick-up' schtick|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/10/dating-coach-julien-blanc-kicked-out-of-australia-for-his-controversial-tactics/|accessdate=10 October 2015|work=Washington Post|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julien Blanc: UK denies visa to 'pick-up artist'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30119100|accessdate=10 October 2015|work=BBC News|date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibson|first1=Megan|title=Is This the Most Hated Man in the World?|url=http://time.com/3578387/julien-blanc-feminism-real-social-dynamics/|accessdate=10 October 2015|work=Time|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickup artists have also been parodied, as in the March 2011 ''[[The Scott Mills Show]]''. [[BBC Radio 1]] debated [[Neil Strauss]]' ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'' on many shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = The BBC | title = Radio 1 | location = UK |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gq42l}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickup is often divided into different styles, referred to as "outer game", "inner game", "direct game", and "indirect game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postmasculine.com/pickup-artist|title=My Life as a Pickup Artist|date=28 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140127012818/http://postmasculine.com/pickup-artist|archivedate=27 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Petra Boynton has stated that there is "no evidence of effectiveness" for any claims of pickup artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/6987982/Pick-up-artists-online-seduction-and-dating-tips.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Tom | last=Chivers | title=Pick-up artists, online seduction and dating tips | date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research by Nathan Oesch of the [[University of Oxford]] Department of Experimental Psychology, however, confirmed attraction and seduction principles, as described in Strauss' books on the subject, do have a factual basis in social, physiological and evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref name="epjournal.net"&gt;Oesch, Nathan, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130404041916/http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/EP10899909.pdf The Dating Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Emerging Science of Human Courtship]", ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]'', 2012. 10(5): 899-909&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite primarily being a male movement, there are also female pick-up artists who use similar techniques to seduce men.&lt;ref name="femaleartist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/it-happened-to-me-i-was-a-female-pick-up-artist|title=It Happened To Me: I'm A Female Pick-Up Artist Who Studied Under Neil Strauss and Mystery|date=November 21, 2012|author=Leigh, Arden|work=xoJane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==

There are a variety of PUA "schools of thought" which promote numerous different methods. These range from approaches that are very indirect, and which stress starting with casual conversation before building into a flirt, to methods in which attraction is communicated very openly and directly. Most PUAs acknowledge the distinction between so-called "inner game" and "outer game", where the former relates to techniques directed towards increasing one's self-confidence and mindset, whilst the latter are about actual interaction with real people. Inner game may involve taking greater care in one's looks and presentation, identifying and neutralising self-defeating mental habits (also known as "limiting beliefs"), and developing mental routines to build confidence. Outer game involves actual interaction with individuals and groups of people, from body language to conversation. The pick-up artist may frequent a self-help group and converse with MRA's (men's rights activists), incels (involuntary celibates), and other PUA's to discuss seduction tips.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.avclub.com/the-matrix-couldn-t-dream-up-the-internet-of-2018-1822353087&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'', [[Neil Strauss]] documents various practices that occur in the seduction community.  Members of the community believe in achieving success with women through putatively scientific and [[Empiricism|empirical]] means, rather than by relying on good looks or intuitive instinct, or by following societal courtship conventions. The practice of going out with the purpose of meeting women is known as "sarging", a term coined by [[Ross Jeffries]], after his cat "Sarge". A pickup artist can "sarge" alone, or with a [[Wingman (social)|wingman]].&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/07/pickup-artists-the-girliest-of-men/59578/ |title=Pickup Artists: The Girliest of Men |author=Megan McArdle |date=12 July 2010|work=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffries employed [[Neuro-linguistic_programming]] techniques for the purposes of seduction, although Strauss claims in ''The Game'' that NLP was quickly rendered obsolete by the rise of techniques based on social dynamics, particularly [[Erik von Markovik]]'s "Mystery Method". The Mystery Method describes seduction as a linear process involving three stages (establishing attraction, building comfort, and seduction) each of which involves a variety of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Erik von Markovik, "The Mystery Method: How to get beautiful women into bed", St Martin's Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Negging]]", one of von Markovik's most famous and controversial techniques, has been described as the practice of giving a woman a backhanded compliment such as "nice nails – are they real?", to weaken her confidence and therefore render her more vulnerable to seduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/cockblocked-by-redistribution|title = Cockblocked by Redistribution: A Pick-up Artist in Denmark|last = Baker|first = Katie J.M.|date = Fall 2013|work = Dissent Magazine|accessdate = 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that depriving a woman of obsequious validation and attention will influence her to seek it from the man who negs her.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap, S. G. "[http://thepointmag.com/2010/examined-life/love-in-the-age-of-the-pickup-artist Love in the Age of the Pickup Artist]", ''The Point'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss refers to negs as "disqualifiers" in his book [[Rules of the Game]], emphasizing that the primary purpose of using a neg is not to put a woman down, but for a man to disqualify himself as a potential suitor, thereby allowing for interaction to start on less loaded terms. [[Conor Friedersdorf]] lambasted the use of negging by pick-up artists, but admitted that, based on his observations, negging did appear to be effective at generating attraction from some women.&lt;ref name="Some I Insult, Some I Let Go"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conor Friedersdorf|Friedersdorf, Conor]], "[https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/07/dating-and-deception/198480/ Dating and Deception]", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conor Friedersdorf|Friedersdorf, Conor]], "[https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/07/-the-neg-contd/198419/ "The Neg" Cont'd]", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 24 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conor Friedersdorf|Friedersdorf, Conor]], "[http://theamericanscene.com/2009/08/08/stop-negging-them-on#comment Stop Negging Them On!]", ''The American Scene'', 8 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

"Pawning" is trading or discarding an unwanted woman as proof of the PUA's own social value, and "going caveman" is escalating physical contact while reducing verbal contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/world/elliot-rodger-and-the-creepy-world-of-the-pickup-artist-20140528-zrqg1.html|title = Elliot Rodger and the creepy world of the pick-up artist|last = Koziol|first = Michael|date = 28 May 2014|work = Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One constellation of PUA techniques, called "Last Minute Resistance" tactics (LMR tactics), is designed to convince a woman to have sex after she has indicated that she doesn't want to. This includes tactics from those which are mutually beneficial – such as being okay with the woman being on her period – to "callous manipulation" and rape.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/201206/interview-pickup-artist-chaser-clarisse-thorn|title = Interview with Pickup Artist Chaser Clarisse Thorn|last = Kaufman|first = Scott Barry|date = 1 June 2012|work = Psychology Today|accessdate = 9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaching and opening ===
Pickup artists generally assume the mindset that men should lead and initiate contacts and plans in general in order to be more attractive, and that women will not generally initiate contact although they want men to, requiring men to begin any interaction by ''approaching'' them, but many have also cultivated a sensitivity to direct and indirect signals of [[Proteans|possible sexual interest]].

Members of the seduction community often practice approaching and opening repetitively; some have done thousands of approaches. Strauss describes a pickup artist who did 125 approaches in one day.&lt;ref name=TheGame298&gt;Strauss, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Mystery Method"&lt;ref&gt;Erik von Markovik, "The Mystery Method: How to get beautiful women into bed", St Martin's Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; encourages approaching groups of strangers, starting indirect conversations, and giving attention to all members of the group without initiating conversation with the "target" until attraction has been established.

Feminist [[BDSM]] writer and activist Clarisse Thorn, author of ''Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser|Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser: Long Interviews with Hideous Men'', criticizes the PUA community as frequently "absurd and sexist", "pushy and problematic" and encouraging adversarial gender roles. However, she also argues that PUA tactics are worth understanding because they are not unique to the PUA community, but instead represent society-wide beliefs and patterns and strategies of human sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other dating coaches, such as Sebastian Harris, publicly speak against the misogynistic tendencies of the seduction community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalseducer.com/dear-woman-hater/|title=Dear Woman Hater|last=Harris|first=Sebastian|date=1 May 2016|website=Global Seducer|publisher=Sebastian Harris|access-date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UCLA Center for the Study of Women]] argues that PUA culture is misogynist, and exists on a continuum of sexist behaviours and attitudes that includes rape and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5tw6h8nk|title = From Misogyny to Murder: Everyday Sexism and Femicide in Cross-Cultural Context|last = Rodríguez|first = Gilda|date = December 2010|journal = CSW Update|accessdate = 9 June 2014|doi = |publisher = UCLA Center for the Study of Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional [[dating coach]], radio personality and [[self help]] book author [[Alan Roger Currie (American author)|Alan Roger Currie]] has frequently criticized the seduction community and many of the misleading and manipulative tactics espoused by many of the more popular pickup artists.  Currie is specifically critical of men giving women the misleading impression that they are interested in engaging in a long-term, emotionally profound, monogamous romantic relationship when those men know in reality that they are really seeking to engage in some form of short-term, non-monogamous, [[casual sex]] with these same women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/modeone/2012/07/13/pros-cons-of-approaching-women-directly-vs-indirectly | title=The Pros and Cons of approaching women using 'direct game' vs. 'indirect game'| website=[[BlogTalkRadio]] | publisher=Mode One Multimedia, Inc. | host=Upfront &amp; Straightforward | date=12 July 2012 | time=| access-date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage==
The seduction community has received increased media attention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/lifestyle/cl-et-game31aug31,0,1782296.story |title=Danger: pickup artists ahead |author=Deborah Netburn |date=31 August 2005 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="operation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20029-1766167,00.html |title=Operation pick-up |author=Hugo Rifkind |date=3 September 2005 |work=The Sunday Times |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dark arts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=1923372005 |title=Revealed: the dark arts of the ladykiller |author=Liese Spencer |date=12 September 2005 |work=The Scotsman |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014155702/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=1923372005 |archivedate=14 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ganahl"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ganahl |first=Jane |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/09/25/LVGPHEQA941.DTL |title=Ahead of the game |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=25 November 2005 |accessdate=22 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the publication of [[Neil Strauss]]' article on the community in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="Aims Shoots"/&gt; and his memoir ''The Game''. Response to the seduction community has been varied; it has been called [[misogyny|misogynistic]], and a review of ''The Game'' in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' characterized the community as "a puerile cult of sexual conquest", and calls its tactics "sinister" and "pathetic".&lt;ref name="Ganahl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,1577189,00.html |title=Girls, if you see this man, run a mile |author=Rafael Behr |date=25 September 2005 |work=The Observer |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the review, "if women in the book are sometimes treated as a commodity, they come out looking better than the men, who can be downright loathsome—and show themselves eventually to be pretty sad, dysfunctional characters".

[[Feminists]] tend to be critical of the seduction community. [[Beatrix Campbell]] has stated that ''The Game'' "sexually objectifies women", arguing that "Nowhere from its description do you get a sense of men being helped to be human in an easy and agreeable way...it's not about having any rapport or relationship... the only thing that will help them in relationships is [[empathy]] and liking women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Andrew |url=http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/books/news/article308631.ece |title=Passing on 'foolproof' pick-up tips.

According to an article in ''[[Eye Weekly]]'', some feminists believe that pickup "isn't just cheesy; it's offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Dave |url=http://eye.net/eye/issue/issue_10.13.05/arts/artsweek.html |title=Get laid, get fucked |work=[[Eye Weekly]] |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=22 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626123314/http://eye.net/eye/issue/issue_10.13.05/arts/artsweek.html |archivedate=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article cites a proposal put forward by a feministblogs.org writer as an alternative to the formula used by expert PUAs: "Shake my hand. [Say] 'Hi, my name is ...' Treat me like a human being. Avoid seeing women as conquests and men as competition."

An article in the ''[[Houston Press]]'' claimed that the seduction community "isn't the lechfest it might sound like". The article quotes the webmaster of confidentup.com defending the community: "It's no more [[deception|deceptive]] than [[push-up bra]]s or [[Stiletto heel|heels]] or going to the gym to work out...This isn't just a game of words and seduction, it's an overall life improvement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Craig |last=Malisow |title=Keeping Score |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2005-06-02/news/keeping-score/2 |work=[[Houston Press]] |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss says, "I really think all of these routines and manipulations are just a way for a guy to get his foot in the door so that if a woman connects with him, she can still choose him," and that seduction techniques "can be used for good or evil!"&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dark arts"/&gt; He argues that "women are incredibly intuitive—the creepy guys with bad intentions don't do nearly as well as the guys who love and respect women".&lt;ref name="Ganahl"/&gt;

Several writers describe observing men in the seduction community first-hand. Some women recount experiences with men they believed to be pickup artists who tried to "pick them up", and some men recount trying out pickup techniques. Catherine Townsend, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', describes a negative experience with a man she believed was a pickup artist and used a lot of "negs" on her: "The problem is that some guys clearly don't know when to quit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Townsend |first=Catherine |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article354165.ece |title=Sleeping Around |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 March 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2006 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205064115/http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article354165.ece |archivedate=5 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''[[San Francisco Magazine]]'' recounts the experience the blogger "Dolly", who is the author of the popular sex blog ''The Truth about Cocks and Dolls'', had with the seduction community. According to the article, Dolly was:

{{quote|[...] put off by PUAs at first. But after she met more, including two from San Francisco, she wrote a letter to the ''Village Voice'' defending them, in response to the paper’s negative article on the subject in March. “PUAs try to create a fun, positive, and exciting experience for the woman,” Dolly wrote. “The credo many follow is ‘Leave her better than you found her.’ What’s so bad about that? That they want to get laid, too? Guess what? Guys have always wanted sex and will continue to want sex. You can’t fault them for finally discovering methods that are successful.|&lt;ref name="Yogis"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yogis |first=Jaimal |url=http://www.sanfranmag.com/archives/view_story/1306/ |title=What does it take to get a date in this town? |work=[[San Francisco Magazine]] |year=2006 |accessdate=22 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021021508/http://www.sanfranmag.com/archives/view_story/1306/ |archivedate=21 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After spending three days immersed in a Mystery Method Corp (now Love Systems) seminar, [[Gene Weingarten]] expressed his uneasiness about "a step by step tutorial for men in how to pick up women, make them comfortable in your presence, and bed them, ideally within seven hours of your first meeting" and wondered aloud, "Is there something inherently wrong with the notion of seduction as a classroom-taught skill, complete with a long hierarchy of 'lines' that work, seemingly spontaneous topics of conversation that are anything but spontaneous, tricks for seeming 'vulnerable', and tips on how to behave so as to deliver subtle but effective nonverbal inducements to intimacy?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/community/groups/index.html?plckForumPage=ForumDiscussion&amp;plckDiscussionId=Cat:a70e3396-6663-4a8d-ba19-e44939d3c44fForum:a8bc6fd8-cf9f-43ca-99a4-05fdb4342697Discussion:86aaac5a-5b7f-4a26-9cb9-03b94121ca42 |title=The Gene Pool: Sex and Deceit |author=Gene Weingarten |date=5 March 2008 |work=The Washington Post |publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an article for the ''Times Online'', [[Hugo Rifkind]] participated in a seminar by Neil Strauss. Rifkind describes initially struggling with seduction techniques, eventually learning to attract women's interest, and then feeling guilty. Rifkind writes, "After a little more practice, my 'game' is improving dramatically. I can open with fluency, and there's an injection of confidence which comes from knowing exactly what you are going to say next." When he attracts a woman's attention, "she is—quite honestly—looking at me like I'm the most fascinating person she's ever met. As a human being and, perhaps more crucially, as somebody with a girlfriend, I feel like absolute scum."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Commercialization ==
The media attention and rapid growth of the seduction community has led to commercialization and competition.  Teachers of seduction tactics sell workshops, books, [[e-books]], [[DVDs]], and CDs over the internet.  In ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'', Strauss describes the competition between seduction gurus.  In The Journal, teaching of these seduction methods is shown by way of 50+ examples.

==Academic research==
An academic paper on the community, published in 2012 by Eric C. Hendriks in the journal ''[[International Society for Ethnology and Folklore|Cultural Analysis]]'', details the value system guiding successful members of the seduction community based on an international study including participant observation of bootcamp and "lair" meetings in Germany. The article argues that the values of successful practitioners of the "Venusian arts" are informed by an intertwining of "hedonistic goals and diffused forms of [[Inner-worldly asceticism|innerworldly asceticism]]". According to Hendricks, the hedonistic goal of sexual satisfaction interacts in a complex fashion with a set of "disciplinarian and ascetic values", and the author stresses that these disciplinarian and ascetic values are central to the value system of performant practitioners, even though the marketing of seduction gurus often promises an easy, effortless "quick fix".&lt;ref name="socrates.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~culturalanalysis/volume11/vol11_Hendriks.html|title=Cultural Analysis, Volume 11, 2012: Ascetic Hedonism / Eric C. Hendriks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Nathan Oesch of the [[University of Oxford]] Department of Experimental Psychology confirmed attraction and seduction principles, as described in Strauss' books on the subject, do have a factual basis in social, physiological and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name="epjournal.net"/&gt;

Andrew King's cultural history of the pickup artist in the journal ''Sexuality &amp; Culture'' argues that, as a genre, the growth of PUA philosophy parallels the rise of feminism in academic and popular culture—and in some ways can be seen as a critique of its limitations, particularly the idea of gender egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Andrew Stephen |title=Feminism’s Flip Side: A Cultural History of the Pickup Artist |journal=Sexuality &amp; Culture |date=2 November 2017 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=299–315 |doi=10.1007/s12119-017-9468-0 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-017-9468-0 |accessdate=26 June 2018 |language=en |issn=1095-5143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rational emotive behavior therapy''' ('''REBT'''), previously called '''rational therapy''' and '''rational emotive therapy''', is an active-directive, [[philosophy|philosophically]] and [[empirical]]ly based [[psychotherapy]], the aim of which is to resolve [[emotion]]al and [[behavior]]al problems and disturbances and to help people to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A. (1994) Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy:  Comprehensive Method of Treating Human Disturbances : Revised and Updated. New York, NY: Citadel Press&lt;/ref&gt; REBT was created and developed by the [[United States|American]] [[psychotherapist]] and [[psychologist]] [[Albert Ellis]], who was inspired by many of the teachings of [[Asia]]n, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and modern philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A. (2004) Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me—It Can Work for You. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, J., &amp;d Vernon, A. (2010) Albert Ellis: Evolution of a Revolution: Selections from the Writings of Albert Ellis, Ph.D. Fort Lee, NJ: Barricade Books.&lt;/ref&gt; REBT is the first form of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and was first expounded by Ellis in the mid-1950s; development continued until his death in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A.

Sarasota, FL: Professional Resource Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis became synonymous with the highly influential therapy. [[Psychology Today]] noted, "No individual — not even Freud himself — has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, R. (2001). "The Prince of Reason". Psychology Today.&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) is both a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] system of theory and practices and a school of thought established by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]]. Ellis first presented his ideas at a conference of the American Psychological Association in 1956&lt;ref&gt;[ELLIS, A. Rational Psychotherapy. Paper read at Amer. Psychol. Ass. Chicago, August, 1956. Also J. gen. Psychol., in press]&lt;/ref&gt; then published a seminal article in 1957 entitled "Rational psychotherapy and individual psychology", in which he set the foundation for what he was calling Rational Therapy (RT) and carefully responded to questions from [[Rudolf Dreikurs]] and others about the similarities and differences with [[Alfred Adler]]'s [[Individual psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-about-psychology.com/rational-psychotherapy.html Rational Psychotherapy and Individual Psychology.] Ellis, Albert. 1957.  Journal of Individual Psychology 13: 38-44.&lt;/ref&gt; This was around a decade before psychiatrist [[Aaron Beck]] first set forth his "[[cognitive therapy]]", after Ellis had contacted him in the mid 1960s. Ellis' own approach was renamed to ''Rational Emotive Therapy'' in 1959, then to the current term in 1992.

Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy have been identified in ancient philosophical traditions, particularly [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first major book on rational therapy, Ellis wrote that the central principle of his approach, that people are rarely emotionally affected by external events but rather by their thinking about such events, "was originally discovered and stated by the ancient Stoic philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Ellis, A. | title=Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy| year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis illustrates this with a quote from the [[Enchiridion of Epictetus|''Enchiridion'']] of [[Epictetus]]: "Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them."  Ellis noted that [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] expressed a similar thought in ''[[Hamlet]]'': "There's nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert  (1962) Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis also acknowledges early 20th century therapists, particularly [[Paul Charles Dubois]], though he only read his work several years after developing his therapy.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Theoretical assumptions &lt;!--This section is linked from [[Cognitive therapy]]: do not rename without including an anchor to previous name ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt; ==
{{See also|Cognitive therapy#Cognitive model}}
A fundamental premise of REBT is humans do not get emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others.&lt;ref name="ellis1"&gt;Ellis, Albert (2001). Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors: New Directions for Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. [[Prometheus Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been attributed as far back as the Roman philosopher [[Epictetus]], who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/epictetus.htm|title=Quotes for Therapy|author=|date=|website=www.getselfhelp.co.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the ''A-B-C''-''D-E-F'' model of [[psychological]] disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an ''A'', ''a''dversity (or ''a''ctivating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral ''C''s, ''c''onsequences, but also what people ''B'', irrationally ''b''elieve about the ''A'', ''a''dversity. ''A'', ''a''dversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.&lt;ref name="dryden1"&gt;Dryden W., &amp; Neenan M. (2003). Essential Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the following letters represent the following meanings in this model

A-	The adversity

B-	The developed belief in the person of the A Adversity

C-	The consequences but the consequences of that person's Beliefs ie B

D-	The person's disputes of A B and C. In latter thought.

E-	The effective new philosophy or belief that develops in that person through the occurrence of D in their minds of A and B

F-	The developed feelings of ones self either at point and after point C or at point after point E.


The ''B''s, irrational beliefs that are most important in the ''A-B-C'' model are explicit and implicit philosophical meanings and assumptions about events, personal desires, and preferences. The ''B''s, ''b''eliefs that are most significant are highly evaluative and consist of interrelated and integrated cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects and dimensions. According to REBT, if a person's evaluative ''B'', ''b''elief about the ''A'', ''a''ctivating event is rigid, absolutistic, fictional and dysfunctional, the ''C'', the emotional and behavioral ''c''onsequence, is likely to be self-defeating and destructive. Alternatively, if a person's belief is preferential, flexible and constructive, the ''C'', the emotional and behavioral ''c''onsequence is likely to be self-helping and constructive.

Through REBT, by understanding the role of their mediating, evaluative and philosophically based illogical, unrealistic and self-defeating meanings, interpretations and assumptions in disturbance, individuals can learn to identify them, then go to ''D'', ''d''isputing and questioning the evidence for them. At ''E, e''ffective new philosophy, they can recognize and reinforce the notion no evidence exists for any psychopathological ''must'', ''ought'' or ''should'' and distinguish them from healthy constructs, and subscribe to more constructive and self-helping philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert. (1994). Reason and Emotion In Psychotherapy, Revised and Updated. Secaucus, NJ: Carol Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt; This new reasonable perspective leads to ''F'', new ''f''eelings and behaviors appropriate to the ''A'' they are addressing in the exercise.

The REBT framework assumes that humans have both innate rational (meaning self-helping, socially helping, and constructive) and irrational (meaning self-defeating, socially defeating, and unhelpful) tendencies and leanings. REBT claims that people to a large degree consciously and unconsciously construct emotional difficulties such as [[self-blame]], [[self-pity]], clinical anger, hurt, guilt, shame, [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[anxiety]], and behaviors and behavior tendencies like [[procrastination]], compulsiveness, avoidance, [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]] by the means of their irrational and self-defeating thinking, [[emotion|emoting]] and behaving.&lt;ref name="ellis3"&gt;Ellis, A. (2001). Feeling better, getting better, staying better. Impact Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; REBT is then applied as an [[education]]al process in which the therapist often active-directively teaches the client how to identify irrational and self-defeating beliefs and philosophies which in nature are rigid, extreme, unrealistic, illogical and absolutist, and then to forcefully and actively question and dispute them and replace them with more rational and self-helping ones. By using different cognitive, emotive and behavioral [[Methodology|methods]] and activities, the client, together with help from the therapist and in [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]] exercises, can gain a more rational, self-helping and constructive rational way of thinking, emoting and behaving. One of the main [[Goal|objective]]s in REBT is to show the client that whenever unpleasant and unfortunate activating events occur in people's lives, they have a [[choice]] of making themselves feel healthily and self-helpingly sorry, disappointed, frustrated, and annoyed, or making themselves feel unhealthily and self-defeatingly horrified, terrified, panicked, depressed, self-hating and self-pitying.&lt;ref name="ellis2"&gt;Ellis, Albert (2003). Early theories and practices of rational emotive behavior theory and how they have been augmented and revised during the last three decades. Journal of Rational-Emotive &amp; Cognitive-Behavior Therapy, 21(3/4)&lt;/ref&gt; By attaining and ingraining a more rational and self-constructive philosophy of themselves, others and the world, people often are more likely to behave and [[emotion|emote]] in more life-serving and adaptive ways.

Albert Ellis&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt; posits three major insights of REBT:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 1''' – People seeing and accepting the reality that their emotional disturbances at point C are only partially caused by the activating events or adversities at point A that precede C. Although A contributes to C, and although disturbed Cs (such as feelings of [[panic]] and [[clinical depression|depression]]) are much more likely to follow strong negative As (such as being assaulted or raped), than they are to follow weak As (such as being disliked by a stranger), the main or more direct cores of extreme and dysfunctional emotional disturbances (Cs) are people’s irrational beliefs — the "absolutistic" (inflexible) "musts" and their accompanying inferences and attributions that people strongly believe about the activating event.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 2''' – No matter how, when, and why people acquire self-defeating or irrational beliefs (i.e. beliefs that are the main cause of their dysfunctional emotional-behavioral consequences), if they are disturbed in the present, they tend to keep holding these irrational beliefs and continue upsetting themselves with these thoughts. They do so not because they held them in the past, but because they still actively hold them in the present (often unconsciously), while continuing to reaffirm their beliefs and act as if they are still valid. In their minds and hearts, the troubled people still follow the core "musturbatory" philosophies they adopted or invented long ago, or ones they recently accepted or constructed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 3''' – No matter how well they have gained insights 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. They may feel better when they know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But it is unlikely that people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that ''there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs''; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute "musts" (rigid requirements about how things should be) with more flexible ''preferences''; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional [[fears]] and [[compulsive behavior|compulsions]]. Only by a combined cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, as well as a quite persistent and forceful attack on one's serious emotional problems, is one likely to significantly ameliorate or remove them, and keep them removed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Insight 4 – That in order for point D to occur in ones life often circumstances need to occur or transpire in order for the dispute in ones self and ones own emotions to happen. This way the dispute is reinforced by actions taken by the self if the action is strong enough. However if this is not executed by others with the person in affect not aware of what is going on the situation could become dangerous or life threatening by the person being treated.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding cognitive-affective-behavioral [[cognitive processes|process]]es in mental functioning and dysfunctioning, originator Albert Ellis explains:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"REBT assumes that human thinking, emotion, and action are not really separate or disparate processes, but that they all significantly overlap and are rarely experienced in a pure state. Much of what we call emotion is nothing more nor less than a certain kind — a biased, prejudiced, or strongly evaluative kind — of thought. But emotions and behaviors significantly influence and affect thinking, just as thinking influences emotions and behaviors. Evaluating is a fundamental characteristic of human [[organisms]] and seems to work in a kind of closed [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] with a [[feedback mechanism]]: First, [[perception]] [[bias]]es response, and then response tends to bias subsequent perception. Also, prior perceptions appear to bias subsequent [[perception]]s, and prior responses appear to bias subsequent responses. What we call feelings almost always have a pronounced evaluating or appraisal element."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

REBT then generally proposes that many of these self-defeating cognitive, emotive and behavioral tendencies are both innately [[biology|biological]] and [[indoctrination|indoctrinated]] early in and during life, and further grow stronger as a person continually revisits, clings and acts on them. Ellis alludes to similarities between REBT and the [[general semantics]] when explaining the role of irrational beliefs in self-defeating tendencies, citing [[Alfred Korzybski]] as a significant modern influence on this thinking.&lt;ref&gt;"REBT particularly follows Korzybski in this respect..." Albert Ellis in ''The Albert Ellis reader: A guide to well-being using rational emotive behavior therapy'', p. 306. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LorJYkPSQOwC&amp;vq Google Books preview] retrieved August 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

REBT differs from other clinical approaches like [[psychoanalysis]] in that it places little emphasis on exploring the past, but instead focuses on changing the current evaluations and philosophical thinking-emoting and behaving in relation to themselves, others and the conditions under which people live.

== Psychological dysfunction ==
One of the main pillars of REBT is that irrational and dysfunctional ways and patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving are contributing to much, though hardly all, human disturbance and emotional and behavioral self-defeatism and social defeatism. REBT generally teaches that when people turn flexible preferences, desires and wishes into grandiose, absolutistic and fatalistic dictates, this tends to contribute to disturbance and upset. These dysfunctional patterns are examples of [[cognitive distortions]].

===Core beliefs that disturb humans===
Albert Ellis has suggested three core beliefs or philosophies that humans tend to disturb themselves through:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ''"I absolutely MUST, under practically all conditions and at all times, perform well (or outstandingly well) and win the approval (or complete love) of significant others. If I fail in these important—and sacred—respects, that is awful and I am a bad, incompetent, unworthy person, who will probably always fail and deserves to suffer."''
| ''"Other people with whom I relate or associate, absolutely MUST, under practically all conditions and at all times, treat me nicely, considerately and fairly. Otherwise, it is terrible and they are rotten, bad, unworthy people who will always treat me badly and do not deserve a good life and should be severely punished for acting so abominably to me."''
| ''"The conditions under which I live absolutely MUST, at practically all times, be favorable, safe, hassle-free, and quickly and easily enjoyable, and if they are not that way it's awful and horrible and I can't bear it. I can't ever enjoy myself at all. My life is impossible and hardly worth living."''
|-
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to feelings of [[anxiety]], [[panic]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], and worthlessness.
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to feelings of anger, rage, fury, and vindictiveness.
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to [[frustration]] and discomfort, [[Toleration|intolerance]], self-pity, [[anger]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and to behaviors such as [[procrastination]], [[avoidance coping|avoidance]], addictive behaviors and inaction.
|}

===Rigid demands that humans make===
REBT commonly posits that at the core of irrational beliefs there often are explicit or implicit rigid demands and commands, and that extreme [[derivative]]s like awfulizing, frustration [[Toleration|intolerance]], people [[deprecation]] and over-generalizations are accompanied by these.&lt;ref name="dryden1"/&gt; According to REBT the core dysfunctional philosophies in a person's evaluative emotional and behavioral belief system, are also very likely to contribute to unrealistic, arbitrary and crooked inferences and distortions in thinking. REBT therefore first teaches that when people in an insensible and devout way overuse absolutistic, [[dogma]]tic and rigid "shoulds", "musts", and "oughts", they tend to disturb and upset themselves.

===Over-generalization===
Further REBT generally posits that disturbed evaluations to a large degree occur through over-generalization, wherein people exaggerate and globalize events or traits, usually unwanted events or traits or behavior, out of context, while almost always ignoring the positive events or traits or behaviors. For example, awfulizing is partly [[mind|mental]] [[magnification]] of the importance of an unwanted situation to a [[Disaster|catastrophe]] or [[Horror and terror|horror]], elevating the rating of something from bad to worse than it should be, to beyond totally bad, worse than bad to the intolerable and to a "[[holocaust]]". The same exaggeration and overgeneralizing occurs with human rating, wherein humans come to be arbitrarily and [[axiom]]atically [[definition|defined]] by their [[perceive]]d flaws or misdeeds. Frustration intolerance then occurs when a person perceives something to be too difficult, painful or tedious, and by doing so exaggerates these qualities beyond one's ability to cope with them.

===Secondary disturbances===
Essential to REBT theory is also the concept of secondary disturbances which people sometimes construct on top of their primary disturbance. As Ellis emphasizes:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Because of their self-consciousness and their ability to think about their thinking, they can very easily disturb themselves about their disturbances and can also disturb themselves about their ineffective attempts to overcome their emotional disturbances.''"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mental wellness ==
As would be expected, REBT argues that [[mind|mental]] wellness and [[mental health]] to a large degree results from an adequate amount of self-helping, flexible, logico-empirical ways of thinking, emoting and behaving.&lt;ref name="ellis3"/&gt; When a perceived undesired and stressful activating event occurs, and the individual is interpreting, evaluating and reacting to the situation rationally and self-helpingly, then the resulting consequence is, according to REBT, likely to be more healthy, constructive and functional. This does not by any means mean that a relatively un-disturbed person never experiences negative feelings, but REBT does hope to keep debilitating and un-healthy emotions and subsequent self-defeating behavior to a minimum. To do this, REBT generally promotes a flexible, un-dogmatic, self-helping and efficient belief system and constructive life philosophy about adversities and human desires and preferences.

REBT clearly acknowledges that people, in addition to disturbing themselves, also are innately [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivists]]. Because they largely upset themselves with their beliefs, emotions and behaviors, they can be helped to, in a [[multimodal therapy|multimodal]] manner, dispute and question these and develop a more workable, more self-helping set of constructs.

REBT generally teaches and promotes:
* That the concepts and philosophies of life of unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance, and life-acceptance are effective philosophies of life in achieving mental wellness and [[mental health]].
* That human beings are inherently fallible and imperfect and that they are better served by accepting their and other human being's totality and humanity, while at the same time they may not like some of their behaviors and characteristics. That they are better off not measuring their entire self or their "being" and give up the narrow, grandiose and ultimately destructive notion to give themselves any global rating or report card. This is partly because all humans are continually evolving and are far too complex to accurately rate; all humans do both self-defeating / socially defeating and self-helping / socially helping deeds, and have both beneficial and un-beneficial attributes and traits at certain times and in certain conditions. REBT holds that [[idea]]s and feelings about self-worth are largely definitional and are not empirically confirmable or [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]].
* That people had better accept life with its hassles and difficulties not always in accordance with their wants, while trying to change what they can change and live as elegantly as possible with what they cannot change.

==REBT intervention==
As explained, REBT is a therapeutic system of both theory and practice; generally one of the goals of REBT is to help clients see the ways in which they have learned how they often needlessly upset themselves, teach them how to "un-upset" themselves and then how to [[empowerment|empower]] themselves to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt; The emphasis in therapy is generally to establish a successful collaborative therapeutic working alliance based on the REBT educational model. Although REBT teaches that the therapist or counsellor is better served by demonstrating unconditional other-acceptance or unconditional positive regard, the therapist is not necessarily always encouraged to build a warm and caring relationship with the client. The tasks of the therapist or counselor include understanding the client’s concerns from his point of reference and work as a facilitator, teacher and encourager.

In traditional REBT, the client together with the therapist, in a structured active-directive manner, often work through a set of target problems and establish a set of therapeutic goals. In these target problems, situational dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and beliefs are [[Psychological assessment|assessed]] in regards to the client's [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[goal]]s. After working through these problems, the client learns to generalize insights to other relevant situations. In many cases after going through a client's different target problems, the therapist is interested in examining possible core beliefs and more deep rooted philosophical evaluations and schemas that might account for a wider array of problematic emotions and behaviors.&lt;ref name="dryden1"/&gt; Although REBT much of the time is used as a brief therapy, in deeper and more complex problems, longer therapy is promoted.

In therapy, the first step often is that the client acknowledges the problems, accepts emotional responsibility for these and has willingness and determination to change. This normally requires a considerable amount of insight, but as originator [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]]&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt; explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Humans, unlike just about all the other animals on earth, create fairly sophisticated [[languages]] which not only enable them to think about their feeling, their actions, and the results they get from doing and not doing certain things, but they also are able to think about their thinking and even [[metacognition|think about thinking about their thinking]]."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Through the therapeutic process, REBT employs a wide array of forceful and active, meaning [[multimodal therapy|multimodal]] and disputing, [[methodology|methodologies]]. Central through these methods and techniques is the intent to help the client challenge, dispute and question their destructive and self-defeating cognitions, emotions and behaviors. The methods and techniques incorporate cognitive-philosophic, emotive-evocative-dramatic, and behavioral methods for disputation of the client's irrational and self-defeating constructs and helps the client come up with more rational and self-constructive ones. REBT seeks to acknowledge that understanding and insight are not enough; in order for clients to significantly change, they need to pinpoint their irrational and self-defeating [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence|constructs]] and work forcefully and actively at changing them to more functional and self-helping ones.

REBT posits that the client must work hard to get better, and in therapy this normally includes a wide array of homework exercises in day-to-day life assigned by the therapist. The [[assignment (education)|assignment]]s may for example include [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] tasks, i.e., by having the client confront the very thing he or she is afraid of. By doing so, the client is actively acting against the belief that often is contributing significantly to the disturbance.

Another factor contributing to the brevity of REBT is that the therapist seeks to empower the client to help himself through future adversities. REBT only promotes temporary solutions if more fundamental solutions are not found. An ideal successful [[collaboration]] between the REBT therapist and a client results in changes to the client's philosophical way of evaluating himself or herself, others, and his or her life, which will likely yield effective results. The client then moves toward unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance and life-acceptance while striving to live a more self-fulfilling and happier life.

== Efficacy ==
REBT and CBT in general have a substantial and strong [[research]] base to verify and support both their psychotherapeutic efficiency and their theoretical underpinnings. A great quantity of scientific empirical studies has proven REBT to be an effective and efficient treatment for many kinds of psychopathology, conditions and problems.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, L. C., &amp; Woods, P. J. (1991). The efficacy of rational-emotive therapy: A quantitative review of the outcome research. Clinical Psychology Review, 11, 357–369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="feltham"&gt;Colin Feltham (ed) (1997). Which Psychotherapy?: Leading Exponents Explain Their Differences. SAGE, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper M. (2008). Essential Research Findings in Counselling and Psychotherapy. Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; A vast amount of outcome and experimental studies support the effectiveness of REBT and CBT.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy in Psychotherapy: [http://www.intuition.org/txt/ellis.htm Albert Ellis interview by Jeffrey Mishlove]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Psychotherapy.net: [http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Albert_Ellis Albert Ellis Behavioral Therapy Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225020622/http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Albert_Ellis |date=2008-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, REBT randomized clinical trials have offered a positive view on the efficacy of REBT.&lt;ref name="david"&gt;David D. et al. (2005). A synopsis of rational-emotive behavior therapy: Fundamental and applied research. Journal of rational-emotive and cognitive-behavior therapy 2005, vol. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In general REBT is arguably one of the most investigated [[theory|theories]] in the field of psychotherapy and a large amount of clinical experience and a substantial body of modern psychological research have validated and substantiated many of REBTs theoretical assumptions on [[Personality psychology|personality]] and psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"&gt;Ellis A., Abrams M. &amp; Abrams L. (2008). Theories of Personality. Sage Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and critique ==
{{See also|Cognitive behavioral therapy#Criticisms|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
The clinical research on REBT has been criticized both from within and by others. For instance, originator [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] has on occasions emphasized the difficulty and complexity of measuring psychotherapeutic effectiveness, because many studies only tend to [[Psychometrics|measure]] whether clients merely feel better after therapy instead of them getting better and staying better.&lt;ref name="ellis3"/&gt; Ellis has also criticized studies for having limited focus primarily to [[cognitive restructuring]] aspects, as opposed to the combination of cognitive, emotive and behavioral aspects of REBT.&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt; As REBT has been subject to criticisms during its existence, especially in its early years, REBT theorists have a long history of publishing and addressing those concerns. It has also been argued by Ellis and by other clinicians that REBT theory on numerous occasions has been misunderstood and misconstrued both in research and in general.&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;

Some have criticized REBT for being harsh, formulaic and failing to address deep underlying problems.&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; REBT theorists have argued in reply that a careful study of REBT shows that it is both philosophically deep, humanistic and individualized collaboratively working on the basis of the client’s point of reference.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; They have further argued that REBT utilizes an integrated and interrelated methodology of cognitive, emotive-experiential and behavioral interventions.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt; Others have questioned REBTs view of rationality, both radical constructivists who have claimed that reason and logic are subjective properties and those who believe that reason can be objectively determined.&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; REBT theorists have argued in reply that REBT raises objections to clients' irrational choices and conclusions as a working hypothesis and through collaborative efforts demonstrate the irrationality on practical, functional and social consensual grounds.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; In 1998 when asked what the main criticism on REBT was, Albert Ellis replied that it was the claim that it was too rational and not dealing sufficiently enough with emotions. He repudiated the claim by saying that REBT on the contrary emphasizes that thinking, feeling, and behaving are interrelated and integrated, and that it includes a vast amount of both emotional and behavioural methods in addition to cognitive ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ask Dr. Ellis Achieve (1996–2001). Albert Ellis Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis has himself in very direct terms criticized opposing approaches such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[transpersonal psychology]] and abreactive psychotherapies in addition to on several occasions questioning some of the [[doctrine]]s in certain religious systems, [[spiritualism]] and [[mysticism]]. Many, including REBT practitioners, have warned against [[dogma]]tizing and sanctifying REBT as a supposedly perfect psychological [[panacea]]. Prominent REBTers have promoted the importance of high quality and programmatic research, including originator Ellis, a self-proclaimed "passionate skeptic". He has on many occasions been open to challenges and acknowledged errors and inefficiencies in his approach and concurrently revised his theories and practices.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; In general, with regard to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies' [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]]s, others have pointed out that as about 30–40% of people are still unresponsive to interventions, that REBT could be a platform of reinvigorating empirical studies on the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral models of psychopathology and human functioning.&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;

REBT has been developed, revised and augmented through the years as understanding and knowledge of psychology and psychotherapy have progressed. This includes its theoretical concepts, practices and methodology. The teaching of scientific thinking, reasonableness and [[Dogma|un-dogmatism]] has been inherent in REBT as an approach, and these ways of thinking are an inextricable part of REBT's [[empiricism|empirical]] and [[skepticism|skeptical]] nature.

==Applications and interfaces==
Applications and interfaces of REBT are used with a broad range of clinical problems in traditional psychotherapeutic settings such as individual-, [[Group psychotherapy|group]]- and [[family therapy]]. It is used as a general treatment for a vast number of different conditions and psychological problems normally associated with [[psychotherapy]].

In addition, REBT is used with non-clinical problems and problems of living through [[counselling]], consultation and coaching settings dealing with problems including relationships, social skills, career changes, [[stress management]], assertiveness training, grief, problems with aging, money, weight control etc.

REBT also has many interfaces and applications through self-help resources, phone and internet counseling, workshops &amp; seminars, workplace and educational programmes, etc. This includes Rational Emotive Education (REE) where REBT is applied in education settings, Rational Effectiveness Training in business and work-settings and [[SMART Recovery]] (Self Management And Recovery Training) in supporting those in addiction recovery, in addition to a wide variety of specialized treatment strategies and applications.

'''Regional geography''' is a major branch of [[geography]]. It focuses on the interaction of different cultural and natural geofactors in a specific land or landscape, while its counterpart, systematic geography, concentrates on a specific geofactor at the global level. 

== Basics ==
Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as natural elements, human elements, and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] which covers the techniques of delineating space into [[region]]s. Rooted in the tradition of the German speaking countries, the two pillars of regional geography are the idiographic study of ''Länder'' or spatial individuals (specific places, countries, continents) and the typological study of ''Landschaften'' or spatial types (landscapes such as coastal regions, mountain regions, border regions, etc.).

== Approach ==
Regional geography is also a certain approach to geographical study, comparable to [[quantitative revolution|quantitative geography]] or [[critical geography]]. This approach prevailed during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a period when then regional geography paradigm was central within the geographical sciences. It was later criticised for its descriptiveness and the lack of theory. Strong criticism was leveled against it in particular during the 1950s and the [[quantitative revolution]]. Main critics were G. H. T. Kimble&lt;ref&gt;Kimble, G.H.T. (1951): ''The Inadequacy of the Regional Concept'', London Essays in Geography, edd. L.D. Stamp and S.W. Wooldridge, pp. 492-512.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred K. Schaefer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, F.K. (1953): ''Exceptionalism in Geography: A Methodological Examination'', [[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]], vol. 43, pp. 226-245.&lt;/ref&gt; The regional geography paradigm has influenced many other geographical sciences, including [[economic geography]] and [[geomorphology]]. Regional geography is still taught in some universities as a study of the major regions of the world, such as Northern and Latin America, Europe, and Asia and their countries. In addition, the notion of a city-region approach to the study of geography, underlining urban-rural interactions, gained credence since the mid-1980s. Some geographers have also attempted to reintroduce a certain amount of regionalism since the 1980s. This involves a complex definition of regions and their interactions with other [[scale (spatial)|scale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, G. and Jones, M. (2001): ''Renewing The Geography of Regions'', Environment and Planning D, 16(9), pp. 669-695.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable figures ==
Notable figures in regional geography were [[Alfred Hettner]] in Germany, with his concept of [[chorology]]; [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] in France, with the [[Possibilism (geography)|possibilism]] approach (possibilism being a softer notion than [[environmental determinism]]); and, in the United States, [[Richard Hartshorne]] with his concept of areal differentiation. The school of [[Carl O. Sauer]], strongly influenced by  Alfred Hettner and Paul Vidal de la Blache, is also seen as regional geography in its broadest sense.

The term '''regulatory capitalism''' suggests that the operation maintenance and development of the [[International political economy|global political economy]] increasingly depends on administrative rules outside the legislatures and the courts.

The general trend despite and beyond the process of [[liberalization]] is that of growth rather than decline of [[regulation]]. [[Deregulation]] may represent trends in some industries (notably finance), but more regulation is the general trend beyond that characterize modern and post-modern capitalism alike.&lt;ref&gt;[[Levi-Faur, David]], ''The Global Diffusion of Regulatory Capitalism'', The ANNALS of the [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]], March 2005, vol. 598, no. 1, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation in this interpretation is an instrument of organizations—states, business, civil and hybrid and is carried at all political arenas and levels.

The concept of regulatory capitalism serves as an alternative to concepts like [[financial capitalism]], [[welfare capitalism]], [[Casino Capitalism|casino capitalism]], [[developmental capitalism]], [[risk capitalism]], [[state capitalism]] and [[crony capitalism]] in an attempt to shed more light on capitalism as a polymorphous order.

'''Sociography''' is writing on society, societal sub-divisions and societal patterns, done without first conducting the in-depth study typically required in the academic field of sociology. The term was coined by the Dutch sociologist [[Sebald Rudolf Steinmetz]] in 1913.

Sociography typically takes the form of loose commentary, although it may also be found as portions of novels that depict life in a given society. Much of the sociography currently in print focuses on society sub-groups, such as ethnic, neighborhood or occupational-geographic groupings.

==Conflict on scope of the field==
Some sociographers, such as Patrick Geddes, contend that sociography is more properly considered only as the limited combination of sociology and geography.&lt;ref&gt;John Clark, [http://library.nothingness.org/articles/anar/en/display_printable/303 "A Social Ecology"], (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether this would also apply where the sub-society under study is not geographically limited.

==Recent history==
Sociography has taken on increasing importance in recent years, as many authors have begun to speak out on issues of race and culture. Although their writing is done without benefit of academic study, it is still considered a valid explication of a given cultural regime.

Within social science departments in many universities, sociography is now considered a meta-discipline, combining the study of literature, sociology, politics of culture, and economics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3447">'''Spatial econometrics''' is the field where [[spatial analysis]] and [[econometrics]] intersect. The term “spatial econometrics” was introduced for the first time by the Belgian economist Jean Paelinck (universally recognised as the father of the discipline) in the general address he delivered to the annual meeting of the Dutch Statistical Association in May 1974 (Paelinck and Klaassen, 1979).
In general, econometrics differs from other branches of statistics in focusing on theoretical models, whose parameters are estimated using [[regression analysis]]. Spatial econometrics is a refinement of this, where either the theoretical model involves interactions between different entities, or the data observations are not truly independent. Thus, models incorporating [[spatial auto-correlation]] or [[neighborhood effects]] can be estimated using spatial econometric methods. Such models are common in [[regional science]], [[real estate economics]], [[education economics]], [[housing market]] and many others. Adopting a more general view, in the by-law of the [[Spatial Econometrics Association]], the discipline is defined as the set of “models and theoretical instruments of spatial statistics and spatial data analysis to analyse various economic effects such as externalities, interactions, spatial concentration and many others” (Spatial Econometrics Association, 2006). Recent developments tend to include also methods and models from [[social network]] econometrics.

==History==
The first general text in the field was the 1979 book by Paelinck and Klaasen.

'''Structural competency''' is a term used in American [[health professional education]] to describe the ability of health care providers and trainees to appreciate how [[symptoms]], clinical problems, [[diseases]] and attitudes toward patients, populations and health systems are influenced by 'upstream' [[social determinants of health]].

The creators of this term Jonathan Metzl and Helena Hansen proposed a 5-point model [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953613003778].
* Recognition of "structures that shape clinical interactions"
* Development of "an extraclinical language of structure"
* Rearticulation of "'cultural' presentations in structural terms"
* Observation and imagination of "structural intervention"
* Development of "structural humility"

The concept of structural competency is framed in the language of [[competency based medical education]] and is proposed as a new iteration of [[Cultural competence in healthcare|cultural competency]] which is a defined competency in American medical, nursing and public health education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4143">The '''teach-back method''', also called the '''"show-me" method''', is a communication confirmation method used by healthcare providers to confirm whether a patient (or care takers) understands what is being explained to them. If a patient understands, they are able to "teach-back" the information accurately. This is a communication method intended to improve [[health literacy]].

There can be a significant gap in the perception of how much a patient needs information, or how effective a provider's communication is.&lt;ref name="In Focus"&gt;Teach Back: A tool for improving provider-patient communication. The Ethics Center. 2006. Retrieved from http://www.ethics.va.gov/docs/infocus/InFocus_20060401_Teach_Back.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can be due to various reasons such as a patient not understanding medical terminology, not feeling comfortable asking questions or even cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name="In Focus" /&gt; Not only does the teach-back method help providers understand the patient's needs in understanding their care, it also allows providers to evaluate their communication skills.&lt;ref name="In Focus" /&gt; Case studies led by the [[National Quality Forum]] on the informed consent processes of various hospitals found that those that effectively used the teach-back method benefited in areas of quality, patient safety, risk management and cost/efficiency.&lt;ref name="NQF"&gt;Implementing a National Voluntary Consensus Standard for Informed Consent: A User's Guide for Healthcare Professionals. National Quality Forum. 2005. Retrieved from http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2005/09/Implementing_a_National_Voluntary_Consensus_Standard_for_Informed_Consent__A_User’s_Guide_for_Healthcare_Professionals.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== The method ==
The [[National Quality Forum]] describes the practice as follows:&lt;ref name="NQF"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Who''' should use the method→ Any healthcare providers. E.g. physicians, nurses, healthcare professionals&lt;br /&gt;
'''What''' should patients teach-back→Information about their diagnosis, treatment plan, medications, risks and benefit of treatment, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
'''When''' to ask for teach-back→ Early in the care process&lt;br /&gt;
'''Why''' is it important→Many patients have difficulty understanding medical information.&lt;br /&gt;
'''How'''→When asked to teach-back, patients should be able to clearly describe or explain the information provided to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the patient's successful or unsuccessful teach-back, the provider will clarify or modify the information and reassess the teach-back to confirm the patient's comprehension and understanding.&lt;ref name="Heiges"&gt;The Teach Back Method. SurroundHealth. 2012. Retrieved from www.surroundhealth.net&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge retention ==
The cycle of reassessing and teaching back to confirm comprehension has been found to improve knowledge retention and lower readmission rates in heart failure patients.&lt;ref name="White, Garbez, Carroll, Brinker &amp; Howie-Esquivel"&gt;Is "teach back" associated with knowledge retention and [[Hospital Readmission|hospital readmission]] in hospitalized heart failure patients? The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing. 2013 Mar-Apr;28(2):137-46. doi: 10.1097/JCN.0b013e31824987bd&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond healthcare literacy, the teach-back method can be utilized in academic and professional settings as well. Teachers often create [[feedback loops]]  in which the instructor asks the student to share what they heard, and promote peer to peer coaching  where students explain what they just learned to other students. Retention is also most positively impacted in [[participatory learning]] environments, when students participate in group discussions, practice by doing, and teaching others.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Teaching Methods and Retention. 2002. Retrieved from http://www.simulations.co.uk/pyramid.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3148">'''The Global 100''' Index is a ranking of the world's most [[sustainable]] corporations. The list is compiled by Toronto-based media and investment advisory firm, [[Corporate Knights]] (CK).

Each year, the latest iteration of the index is announced at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland.

As at December 31, 2013 the Global 100 has outperformed its benchmark, the [[MSCI]] All Country World Index by 3.21%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corporateknights.com/article/corporate-knights-announces-latest-additions-its-widely-followed-global-100-index-world-econ&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Global 100 was created by Corporate Knights Magazine in 2005. The goal of creating the index was to devise a methodology to quantitatively compare and rank the world’s largest public companies.

==Methodology==

The Global 100 uses a purely quantitative methodology to determine inclusion in the ranking. The Global 100 starting universe automatically considers all firms with a market capitalization of at least US$2 billion. The firms are then put through numerous screenings to test for key information, including; overall sustainability disclosure rate and sustainability disclosure rate versus [[Global Industry Classification Standard|GICS]] sector peers, a financially based Piotroski [[F-score]] to ensure financial stability, and fines, penalties or settlements paid out by the company for sustainability related violations. Companies in the GICS sub-industry categories of tobacco and those engaged primarily in defence are eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;http://global100.org/methodology/&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial screening process culminates in the Global 100 shortlist. At this point, companies are compared on priority key performance indicators (KPIs), according to GICS sector. Priority indicators are chosen based on the percentage of firms in the sector who disclose the indicator. If less than 10% disclose, than the indicator will not be considered a priority KPI for that sector. There are a maximum of 12 KPIs used in the ranking, they are:

* Energy Productivity
* Carbon Productivity
* Water Productivity
* Waste Productivity
* Innovation Capacity
* Percentage Tax Paid
* CEO to Average Worker Pay
* Pension Fund Status
* Safety Performance
* Employee Turnover
* Leadership Diversity
* Clean Capitalism Pay Link

Each KPI is weighted equally and companies are given an overall percentage score. Failure to disclose a priority KPI will result in a zero, thus severely punishing firms for [[non-disclosure]].

==Accolades==
The Global 100 Index has been recognized as a leader in transparency and industry best practices for sustainability rankings, according to SustainAbility’s Rate the Raters project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainability.com/projects/rate-the-raters#projtab-6&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">'''''The Sackbut''''' was a British music journal published from 1920 to 1934 by the [[Curwen Press]]. It published general articles on mainly contemporary, both British and foreign, music as well as reports on performances and records. It was founded by the composer critics [[Cecil Gray (composer)|Cecil Gray]] and [[Peter_Warlock|Philip Heseltine]] (aka Peter Warlock).

The journal's editions ran from May 1920 (Vol. 1, no. 1) to February 1934 (Vol. 14, no. 7) and was published roughly speaking as a monthly, with exceptions in the first two years and last few years. Noted contributors included [[Harry Farjeon]], [[William G. Whittaker]], [[Aylmer Maude]], [[Rutland Boughton]], [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Owen Rutter]].&lt;ref&gt;ProQuest - Publication formation

[[File:Xanadu-House-in-Kissimmee-Florida-1990.jpg|thumb|250px|Exterior of Xanadu House in [[Kissimmee, Florida]], 1990|alt=Exterior of the Xanadu House in Kissimmee, Florida in 1990.]]

The '''Xanadu Houses''' were a series of [[experimental home]]s built to showcase examples of [[computer]]s and [[automation]] in the home in the [[United States]]. The architectural project began in 1979, and during the early 1980s three houses were built in different parts of the US: one each in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]], [[Florida]]; [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin|Wisconsin Dells]], [[Wisconsin]]; and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], [[Tennessee]]. The houses included novel construction and design techniques, and became popular [[tourist attraction]]s during the 1980s.

The Xanadu Houses were notable for being built with [[polyurethane]] insulation foam rather than [[concrete]], for easy, fast, and cost-effective construction. They were [[ergonomics|ergonomically]] designed, and contained some of the earliest [[home automation]] systems. The Kissimmee Xanadu, designed by [[Roy Mason (architect)|Roy Mason]], was the most popular, and at its peak was attracting 1000&amp;nbsp;visitors every day. The Wisconsin Dells and Gatlinburg houses were closed and demolished in the early 1990s; the Kissimmee Xanadu House was closed in 1996 and demolished in October 2005.

==History==

=== Early development ===
Bob Masters was an early pioneer of houses built of rigid insulation. Before conceiving the Xanadu House concept, Masters designed and created inflatable balloons to be used in the construction of houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|title=Xanadu: The Computerized Home of Tomorrow and How It Can Be Yours Today!
|year=1983
|last = Mason
|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inspired by architect Stan Nord Connolly's Kesinger House in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], one of the earliest homes built from insulation. Masters built his first balloon-constructed house exterior in 1969 in less than three days during a turbulent snowstorm, using the same methods later used to build the Xanadu houses.&lt;ref name="bob earlydev"&gt;{{Citation
|title=Xanadu: The Computerized Home of Tomorrow and How It Can Be Yours Today!
|year=1983
|last = Mason
|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masters was convinced that these dome-shaped homes built of foam could work for others, so he decided to create a series of show homes in the United States. Masters's business partner Tom Gussel chose the name "Xanadu" for the homes, a reference to [[Shangdu|Xanadu]], the summer capital of [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], which is prominently featured in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s famous poem ''[[Kubla Khan]]''.&lt;ref name="firstxanadu"&gt;{{Citation
|title=Xanadu: The Computerized Home of Tomorrow and How It Can Be Yours Today!
|year=1983
|last = Mason
|pages=126–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Xanadu House opened in [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin|Wisconsin Dells]], [[Wisconsin]]. It was designed by architect Stewart Gordon and constructed by Masters in 1979.&lt;ref name="firstxanadu"/&gt; It was {{convert|4000|sqft|m2}} in area, and featured a geodesic greenhouse. 100,000 people visited the new attraction in its first summer.&lt;ref name="firstxanadu"/&gt;

Mason had worked on a similar project prior to his involvement in the creation of the Kissimmee Xanadu House &amp;mdash; an "experimental school" on a hill in [[Virginia]] which was also a foam structure. Both Mason and Masters were influenced by other experimental houses and building concepts which emphasized ergonomics, usability, and energy efficiency. These included apartments designed by architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]] featuring detachable building modules and more significant designs including a floating habitat made of fiberglass designed by Jacques Beufs for living on water surfaces, concepts for living underwater by architect Jacques Rougerie and the [[Don Metz house]] built in the 1970s which took advantage of the earth as insulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No one's really looked at the house as a total organic system", said Mason, who was also the architecture editor of ''The Futurist'' magazine. "The house can have intelligence and each room can have intelligence." The estimated cost of construction for one home was $300,000.&lt;ref name="commodore"/&gt; Roy Mason also planned a low cost version which would cost $80,000, to show that homes using computers do not have to be expensive. The low cost Xanadu was never built.  Approximately 1,000 homes were built using this type of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Time Passes Xanadu By: What Now? |publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |last1=Tin |first1=Annie |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-06-10/news/9406100679_1_xanadu-osceola-county-water-scooters |date=June 10, 1994 |accessdate=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It eventually opened in 1983, after several years of research into the concepts Xanadu would use. It was over {{convert|6000|sqft|m2}} in size, considerably larger than the average house because it was built as a showcase. At its peak in the 1980s, under the management of Wolter, more than 1,000 people visited the new Kissimmee attraction every day. A third Xanadu House was built in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Schlocky Gatlinburg antithesis of Smokies | publication-date=June 1, 1986 | periodical=[[Houston Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the Xanadu Houses were built and opened as visitor attractions, tourism companies began to advertise them as the "home of the future" in brochures encouraging people to visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It was consequently put up for sale in 1997 and was sold for office and storage use. By 2001, the Kissimmee house had suffered greatly from mold and mildew throughout the interior due to a lack of maintenance since being used as a visitor attraction, it was put up for sale again for an asking price of US$2 million. By October 2005, the last of the Xanadu houses had been demolished, following years of abandonment and use by the homeless. The Kissimmee house was also featured in the 2007 movie "[[Urban Explorers (film)|Urban Explorers: Into the Darkness]]". It showed the house in disrepair with doors wide open, mold growing everywhere and a homeless man living inside.  The "explorers" walked through the house filming the decay firsthand as the homeless man slept in a chair on the main floor.  At the end of the segment, the man wakes up and threatens the "explorers" telling them to leave his home.

==Design==

=== Construction ===
Construction of the Xanadu house in [[Kissimmee, Florida]], began with the pouring of a concrete slab base and the erection of a tension ring {{convert|40|ft|m}} in diameter to anchor the domed roof of what would become the "Great Room" of the house. A pre-shaped vinyl balloon was formed and attached to the ring, and then inflated by air pressure from large fans. Once the form was fully inflated, its surface was sprayed with quick-hardening polyurethane plastic foam.  The foam, produced by the sudden mixture of two chemicals that expand on contact to 30 times their original volume, hardened almost instantly. Repeated spraying produced a five-to-six-inch-thick structurally sound shell within a few hours. Once the foam cured, the plastic balloon form was removed to be used again. Once the second dome was completed and the balloon form removed, the two rooms were joined together by wire mesh which was also sprayed with foam to form a connecting gallery or hall. This process was repeated until the house was complete. Window, skylight, and door openings were cut and the frames foamed into place. Finally, the interior of the entire structure was sprayed with a 3/4&amp;nbsp;inch (1.9&amp;nbsp;cm) coating of fireproof material that also provided a smooth, easy-to-clean finish for walls and ceilings. The exterior was given a coat of white elastomeric paint as the final touch.&lt;ref name="centerpages"&gt;{{Citation

=== Interior ===
A Xanadu House was ergonomically designed, with future occupants in mind. It used curved walls, painted concrete floors rather than carpets, a light color scheme featuring cool colors throughout, and an open-floor plan linking rooms together without the use of doors. It had at least two entrances, and large porthole-type windows. The interior of the house was cave-like, featuring cramped rooms and low ceilings, although it is not clear whether these accounts describe the same Xanadu House with a thirty-foot dome. The interiors used a cream color for the walls, and a pale green for the floor.

The Xanadu house in Kissimmee, Florida used an [[automation|automated]] system controlled by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[microcomputer]]s.&lt;ref name="commodore"/&gt; The house had fifteen rooms; of these the kitchen, party room, health spa, and bedrooms all used computers and other electronic equipment heavily in their design.&lt;ref name="dayatxanadu"&gt;{{Citation

The Xanadu Houses aimed to bring the original concepts into a finished and working implementation. Inside the house, there was an electronic [[tour guide]] for the benefit of visitors, and the family room featured video screens that displayed computer-graphics art. These art displays were constantly changing, being displayed on video screens as opposed to static mediums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

At the center of the house was the "great room", the largest in the house. It featured a large false tree supporting the roof, and also acted as part of the built-in heating system. The great room also included a [[fountain]], small television set, and a [[video projector]]. Nearby was the dining room, featuring a glass table with a curved seat surrounding it; behind the seats was a large [[window covering]] the entire wall. The family room featured walls covered with television monitors and other [[Electronics|electronic]] equipment.&lt;ref name="computers_amazing_machines_pg92-93"/&gt; The [[entertainment center]] in the family room was described as an "electronic hearth" by the home's builders.&lt;ref name="computers_amazing_machines_pg92-93"/&gt; It was planned as a gathering place for family members and relatives along the same lines as a traditional hearth with a [[fireplace]].&lt;ref name="centerpages"/&gt;&lt;ref name="computers_amazing_machines_pg92-93"/&gt;

If new food was required, it could either be obtained via tele-shopping through the computer system or from Xanadu's own greenhouse. The kitchen's computer terminal could also be used for the household calendar, records, and home bookkeeping.&lt;ref name="centerpages"/&gt;

The Xanadu homes also suggested a way to do [[business]] at home with the [[office]] room and the use of computers for electronic mail, access to stock and commodities trading, and news services.

Computers in the master bedroom allowed for other parts of the house to be controlled. This eliminated chores such as having to go downstairs to turn off the coffee pot after one had gone to bed. The children's bedroom featured the latest in teaching microcomputers and "videotexture" windows, whose realistic computer-generated landscapes could shift in a flash from scenes of real places anywhere in the world to imaginary scenes. The beds at the right of the room retreated into the wall to save space and cut down on clutter; the study niches were just the right size for curling up all alone with a pocket computer game or a book.&lt;ref name="centerpages" /&gt;

In the spa, people could relax in a whirlpool, sun sauna, and environmentally-controlled habitat, and exercise with the assistance of spa monitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Concerns over energy consumption ===
An initial concern was that electricity costs would be excessive, since several computers would be operating continuously.&lt;ref name="commodore"/&gt; Mason figured that a central computer could control the energy consumption of all the other computers in the house.&lt;ref name="commodore"/&gt;
