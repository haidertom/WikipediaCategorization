An '''acting coach''' or '''drama coach''' is a [[teacher]] who trains performers–typically film, television, theatre and, [[musical theatre]] [[actor]]s–and gives them advice and [[mentoring]] to enable them to improve their acting and dramatic performances, prepare for [[audition]]s and prepare better for roles.
==Qualifications and roles==
Acting coaches need to have a "talent...for reading people, all their utterances and [[body language]]."&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;Eric Liu. "The People Whisperers:What a Hollywood acting coach taught me about teaching" in Slate. http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/teachings/2005/01/the_people_whisperers.html&lt;/ref&gt; Acting coaches have been called "people whisperers", a reference to "[[horse whisperer]]s" who help to train animals.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Acting coach [[Ivana Chubbuck]] states that one of her roles is to ensure that "every actor...must know what the character's objective is in a scene—to win someone's love, respect, sympathy, whatever—and then must have a ruthlessness about achieving the objective."&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Chubbuck works with actors to help them to connect with the emotion inside the character.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Acting coaches also "...help [drama] students audition for college".&lt;ref name=mcmahon&gt;Regan McMahon. "THEATER Acting coach preps drama students for college auditions" in ''The Chronicle'' Saturday, January 22, 2011 http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Acting-coaches-help-students-audition-for-college-2478509.php&lt;/ref&gt; Acting coach and actor Woodell-Mascall is "...skilled at zeroing in on what young actors need to do to improve their performance." Woodell-Mascall tells one student actor to "...really think about who [the character] is and what she's feeling. It's got to be real.&lt;ref name=mcmahon /&gt; She provides [[constructive criticism]] to students. Woodell-Mascall has helped students to get into drama programs at schools "...including NYU, Juilliard, Rutgers and UCLA".&lt;ref name=mcmahon /&gt; Some acting coaches use an "...approach and technique of acting training [that] are considered established, proven methods of creating the [dramatic] work", such as using the "...methodology of [[Constantin Stanislavski]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Uta Hagen]], [[Lee Strasberg]], and [[Sanford Meisner]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://kimtobinactingstudio.com/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some acting coaches provide students with a DVD or SD card recording of their acting, for the student to review their progress.

==Notable individuals==
Major acting coaches include: [[Larry Moss (acting coach)|Larry Moss]], [[Ivana Chubbuck]], [[Michelle Danner]], [[Terry Schreiber]], [[David Mamet]], [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Michael Woolson]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Chambers Stevens]], and [[Sanford Meisner]].

==Working conditions==
Acting coaches may be freelancers who are hired for an hourly or daily rate, or they may be hired on a longer-term basis by a [[film studio]], [[production company]] or [[theatre company]]. Some acting coaches have developed their own unique methods and founded their own acting schools. Acting coaches' income varies a great deal from one coach to another. For example, an acting coach providing training to a community theatre troupe or a high school musical earns much less than an acting coach training top [[Hollywood]] celebrities. Acting classes are often provided in person; however, with the widespread availability of high-speed Internet, some coaches offer mentoring online over [[Skype]] or other video linkups. Acting coaches may offer private coaching, group sessions or a combination of both.

==Other roles==
In some cases, acting coaches are hired to train [[singer]]s in acting skills. Popular music singers may need to learn acting skills for their live concert shows, which sometimes include staged sequences, and for performing in [[music video]]s. For example, Goth-rocker [[Amy Lee]] was provided with an acting coach by her record label. In [[Classical music]], singers performing staged [[opera]]s may get help from an acting coach to prepare them for their roles. Sometimes CEOs and other leaders hire acting coaches to help them improve their performance of speeches and other general communications activities. While most acting coaches mentor actors, some also coach directors on how to improve their direction of actors. Some acting coaches offer introductions to the acting industry, to help new actors learn about auditions, the casting process, the role of agents, key acting terminology (e.g., "[[wikt:callback|callback]]" auditions), and about important industry organizations.

[[Image:Anal beads.jpg|thumb|Rigid beads]]

'''Anal beads''' are a [[sex toy]] consisting of multiple spheres or balls attached together in series which are continuously inserted through the [[anus]] into the [[rectum]] and then removed with varying speeds depending on the desired effect (commonly at [[orgasm]] to enhance climax). Anal bead users enjoy the pleasurable feeling of the ball passing through the narrow [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|sphincter]] of the anus.

== Design ==
Anal beads are available in many sizes, with individual beads measuring from 25 mm in diameter to 125 mm diameter or larger. Most users enjoy beads of approximately 45 mm, but most will become more adventurous with experience, and try larger sizes.  Anal beads are commonly made of [[silicone]], [[plastic]], [[rubber]], [[latex]], [[glass]] or [[metal]] and end with a ring or similar handle designed for pulling. The purpose of this ring is to prevent the beads from becoming fully lodged in the rectum, and to ease removal. The beads may either be joined flexibly, requiring individual insertion, or by a semi-rigid thin shaft, allowing anal insertion in a single motion. Both arrangements are forms of the sexual art of "beading off".

The many nerve endings of the sphincter provide arousal both during insertion and removal, and larger beads may create feelings of pressure while in the rectum.

Some anal beads are enhanced with vibration technology to enhance pleasure.

== Use ==
[[File:Illustration of anal bead use.svg|thumb|Illustration of anal bead use]]
Anal beads can be incorporated into many fetishes that involve [[anal sex]], [[Body worship|ass worship]], [[Erotic spanking|spanking]], [[enema]]s or anything involving the buttocks, anus, or the anal area.

As with all anal sexual activity, the anal beads and the rectum should be well-lubricated with a [[sexual lubricant]] intended for  anal sex.  It is important to do this as the rectum can be easily ripped, torn or injured. Anal sex toys should be well washed with warm soapy water and left to dry naturally after use.  Alternatively, they can be placed inside a [[condom]], which is recommended if they are shared with a partner.

Care must also be taken to count the beads before and after use to ensure they are all removed from the anus. String have reportedly broken during intense rectal movements.  If a bead gets stuck in the rectum and cannot be expelled naturally, medical intervention may be necessary.

== Safety ==
If the beads are threaded onto a string, which is a porous material, they cannot be fully disinfected. They should not be shared between partners without using a physical barrier such as a latex or neoprene condom to prevent the transfer of [[faeces]]. Sharing unsterilized anal toys can expose users to various [[sexually transmitted diseases]].

'''Anthony Charles Thiselton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 1937) is an English [[Anglican]] priest, [[theologian]], and academic. He has written a number of books and articles on a range of topics in [[Christian]] [[theology]], [[biblical studies]], and the [[philosophy of religion]].  He has served on the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]], appointed by the [[Minister of Health]].

He was educated at [[City of London School]], with degrees from [[King's College London]] (BD, MTh) the [[University of Sheffield]] (PhD) and the [[University of Durham]] (DD). He received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Chester]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chester University profile|url=http://www.chester.ac.uk/node/12797|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2012.  Thiselton is an Honorary Fellow of [[Cranmer Hall, Durham]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cranmer Hall - Honorary Fellows|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/st-johns.college/cranmer/cranmer_staff/honorary-fellows/|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; fellow of Kings College London and fellow of the British Academy.

Thiselton is a former head of theology at the [[University of Nottingham]] and was also [[Principal (academia)|principal]] of both [[St John's College, Nottingham]] (1986 to 1988) and [[St John's College, Durham]] (1988 to 1992).&lt;ref name="Crockford"&gt;{{Crockford| surname = Thiselton | forenames = Anthony Charles | id = 19906 | accessed = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a priest and canon in the [[Church of England]], in which he represents the Diocese of Southwell on the church's [[General Synod]]. He is an associate priest in the parish of St Mary the Virgin, Attenborough, Nottingham. On 25 June 2002, he was presented with a [[Lambeth Degree]] of Doctorate of Divinity by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, [[George Carey]].

He was visiting Professor at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena; Calvin College, Grand Rapids; Regent College, Vancouver; North Park, Seminary, Chicago; the University of Utrecht, Netherlands; several seminaries in South Korea; Senior Lecturer in the University of Sheffield; and Professor of Theology in the University of Chester.

He served on the Church of England General Synod membership, and its Commissions and Committees:  Crown Nominations Commission, 2000-2010); Appointments Committee (2008–13); and Theological Education and Training Committee (1999-2005).  Outside Synod he remained on the Doctrine Commission for nearly 30 years: Church of England Doctrine Commission (1976-2006); Acting Chairman, (1987); Church of England Faith and Order Group (1979–89); Theological Education in the Anglican Communion (2003–06).

His main published work has been in the areas of [[hermeneutics]] (especially hermeneutical theory and its relationship to biblical interpretation), Christian doctrine (including eschatology and pneumatology), and biblical studies, in particular with two substantial commentaries on [[1 Corinthians]]. He is unusual in academic theology for publishing research-level works across such a broad range of topics.

He received a ''[[Festschrift|festschrift]]'', edited by Stanley Porter and Matthew Malcolm, entitled ''Horizons in Hermeneutics'' (Eerdmans) in April 2013. In June 2012 he was also the subject of a one-day conference in his honour, at the University of Nottingham, at which he presented a response paper to several contributors who spoke in light of his work. Proceedings from this conference were published by Paternoster (in the UK) and IVP (in the US) as ''The Future of Biblical Interpretation'' (2013). St John's College, Nottingham, inaugurated a series of "Thiselton lectures" in 2013 to honour his work in hermeneutics. He gave the first of these himself, in June 2013.

'''The Begin–Sadat Center for Strategic Studies''' ('''BESA Center''') is an independent, non-partisan Israeli [[think tank]] conducting policy-relevant research on Middle Eastern and global strategic affairs, particularly as they relate to the national security and [[foreign policy of Israel]] and regional peace and stability. The center's mission is to contribute to promoting peace and security in the [[Middle East]], through policy-oriented researches on national security in the Middle East. It is located at the Social Sciences Faculty of [[Bar-Ilan University]]. The center was founded by Thomas Hecht, a Canadian Jewish leader, and was dedicated to [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Anwar El Sadat|Anwar Sadat]], who signed the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]], the first peace agreement ever signed between [[Israel]] and an [[Arab]] country.

==About the BESA Center==
===BESA according to BESA===
Prof Efraim Inbar describes the center's mission as follows: "Over the years, we have been the first to successfully place on the public agenda issues such as the problematic aspects of Palestinian statehood, the danger of Arab chemical and biological weapons and missile stocks, Israel’s relations with key countries such as Turkey and India, and the abuse of international institutions in the attempt to delegitimize Israel. Today, the Center leads an attempt to introduce creative thinking about alternatives to the entrenched two-state paradigm in Israeli-Palestinian peace diplomacy, and an initiative to nourish U.S.-Israeli relations."&lt;ref&gt;"American Friends of Bar-Ilan University: Strengthening Jewish and Zionist Values 'The BESA Center Ranked as One of the Three Top Middle East Think Tanks'"http://www.afbiu.org/about-afbiu/besa-center-top-ranked&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center is staffed with strategic thinkers, academic experts and "military men."&lt;ref&gt;"BESA profile 2003" http://davidmweinberg.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Begin-Sadat-Center-for-Strategic-Studies-Corporate-Profile-2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; BESA Center publications and policy recommendations are directed at senior Israeli decision-makers in military and civilian life, the defense and foreign affairs establishments in Israel and abroad, the diplomatic corps, the press, the academic community, leaders of Jewish communities around the world, and the educated public. The center sponsors conferences, lectures, and briefings for international and local audiences, bringing together leading experts from academia and public life, from Israel and abroad. The center has developed cooperative relations with leading strategic research institutes throughout the world, from Ankara to Washington and from London to Seoul. The Center conducts specialized research on contract to the Israeli foreign affairs and defense establishment, and for NATO.

===Criticism===
According to ''Haaretz'', BESA is traditionally regarded as a mostly right-wing organization that usually espouses pro-military views. In 2009, Inbar's paper "The Rise and Fall of the 'Two States for Two Peoples' Paradigm" said the best solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict would be to repartition the country with Egypt governing Gaza, Jordan governing the West Bank, and Israel withdrawing from isolated settlements.&lt;ref&gt;"Benn, Aluf 'Head of right-wing think tank: Settlements must be evacuated; Prof. Efraim Inbar calls for repartition of Israel, with Egypt resuming control of the Gaza Strip.' (27 Jan 2009) Haaretz" http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/head-of-right-wing-think-tank-settlements-must-be-evacuated-1.268922&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact and status===
BESA is one of approximately 35 think tanks in Israel, which, according to Hannah Elka Meyers, typically have little impact on politics or policymaking despite their numbers. She notes in her study that even the heads of Israeli think tanks concede their lack of impact on politics, and quotes Inbar as saying, "We should be modest in our evaluation of the impact of think tanks." Issues that keep Israeli think tanks from being as influential as those in the U.S. include their more academic focus, lack of funding, the nation's political structure, and Israeli citizens' attitudes about government. While BESA staff includes numerous "military men," Meyers notes that the IDF has similar, if not independent research and strategy facilities but with access to classified information.&lt;ref&gt;" Hannah Elka Meyers 'Does Israel need Think Tanks' Middle East Quarterly Winter 2009, pp. 37-46"http://www.meforum.org/2061/does-israel-need-think-tanks&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s ''2014 Global Go To Think Tanks Report'', the center was ranked the ninth best think thank in the Middle East and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2014 Global Go To Think Tank Index|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|date=2015-02-04|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=think_tanks|accessdate=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biblical studies''' is the academic application of a set of diverse [[Discipline (specialism)|disciplines]] to the study of the [[Bible]] (the [[Hebrew Bible|Tanakh]] and the [[New Testament]]).&lt;ref name=Oxf17/&gt;&lt;ref name=Steve11&gt;''Introduction to Biblical Studies, Second Edition'' by Steve Moyise (Oct 27, 2004) {{ISBN|0567083977}} pages 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; For its theory and methods, the field draws on disciplines ranging from [[archaeology]], [[ancient history]], cultural backgrounds, [[textual criticism]], [[literary criticism]], historical backgrounds, [[philology]], and [[social science]].&lt;ref name=Oxf17/&gt;

Many secular as well as religious universities and colleges offer courses in biblical studies, usually in departments of [[religious studies]], [[theology]], [[Judaic studies]], history, or [[comparative literature]]. Biblical scholars do not necessarily have a [[faith]] commitment to the texts they study, but many do.

==Definition==
The ''Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies'' defines the field as a set of various, and in some cases independent disciplines for the study of the collection of ancient texts generally known as the Bible.&lt;ref name=Oxf17&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies'' by J. W. Rogerson and Judith M. Lieu (May 18, 2006) {{ISBN|0199254257}} page xvii&lt;/ref&gt; These disciplines include but are not limited to [[archaeology]], [[Egyptology]], [[textual criticism]], [[linguistics]], [[history]], [[sociology]] and [[theology]]&lt;ref name=Oxf17/&gt;, [[patristics#Key persons|patristics]] and related [[Thomism#Thomistic philosophy|thomistic philosophy]].

==Academic societies==
Several academic associations and societies promote research in the field. The largest is the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] (SBL) with around 8,500 members in more than 80 countries. It publishes many books and journals in the biblical studies, including its flagship, the [[Journal of Biblical Literature]]. SBL hosts one academic conference in North America and another international conference each year, as well as smaller regional meetings.

==Biblical criticism==
{{main article|Biblical criticism}}
Biblical criticism is the scholarly "study and investigation of biblical writings that seeks to make discerning judgments about these writings".&lt;ref name="harpers"&gt;[[Harper's Bible Dictionary]], 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing biblical texts as being ordinary pieces of literature, rather than set apart from other literature, as in the traditional view, it asks when and where a particular text originated; how, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced; what influences were at work in its production; what sources were used in its composition; and what message it was intended to convey. It will vary slightly depending on whether the focus is on the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Old Testament]], the letters of [[New Testament]] or the [[canonical gospels]]. It also plays an important role in the quest for a [[historical Jesus]].

It also addresses the physical text, including the meaning of the words and the way in which they are used, its preservation, history and integrity. Biblical criticism draws upon a wide range of scholarly disciplines including [[Biblical archaeology|archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[folklore]], linguistics, [[Christian Oral Tradition|Oral Tradition]] studies, and historical and religious studies.

==Textual criticism==
{{Main|Textual criticism}}
Textual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification and removal of transcription errors in texts, both manuscripts and printed books. Ancient scribes made errors or alterations when copying manuscripts by hand. Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic seeks to reconstruct the original text (the [[Urtext (Biblical studies)|urtext]], [[Archetype (textual criticism)|archetype]] or [[autograph]]) as closely as possible. The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate editions, or recensions, of a document's transcription history. The ultimate objective of the textual critic's work is the production of a "critical edition" containing a text most closely approximating the original.

There are three fundamental approaches to textual criticism: eclecticism, stemmatics, and copy-text editing. Techniques from the biological discipline of cladistics are currently also being used to determine the relationships between manuscripts.

The phrase "lower criticism" is used to describe the contrast between textual criticism and "[[Historical criticism|higher criticism]]", which is the endeavor to establish the authorship, date, and place of composition of the original text.

==History of the Bible==
Historical research has often dominated modern biblical studies. Biblical scholars usually try to interpret a particular text within its original historical context and use whatever information is available to reconstruct that setting. [[Historical criticism]] aims to determine the [[provenance]], authorship, and process by which ancient texts were composed. Famous theories of historical criticism include the [[documentary hypothesis]], which suggests that the [[Pentateuch]] was compiled from four different written sources, and different reconstructions of "the historical Jesus", which are based primarily on the differences between the canonical Gospels.

==Original languages==
Most of the Hebrew Bible, the [[Tanakh]], which is the basis of the Christian [[Old Testament]], was written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], though a few chapters were written in [[Biblical Aramaic]]. The [[New Testament]] was written in [[Koine Greek]], with possible [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic undertones]], as was the first translation of the Hebrew Bible known as the [[Septuagint]] or Greek Old Testament. Therefore, Hebrew, Greek and sometimes Aramaic continue to be taught in most universities, colleges and seminaries with strong programs in biblical studies.

'''Cartographic generalization''', or map generalization, is a method for deriving a [[scale (map)|smaller-scale]] [[map]] from a larger scale map or map data&lt;ref name="Li 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Zhilin|title=Digital Map Generalization at the Age of the Enlightenment: A review of the First Forty Years|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=February 2007|volume=44|issue=1|pages=80–93|accessdate=|doi=10.1179/000870407x173913}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Whether done manually by a [[cartographer]] or by a computer or set of [[algorithms]], [[generalization]] seeks to abstract [[geospatial information|spatial information]] at a high level of detail to information that can be rendered on a map at a lower level of detail. For example, we might have the outlines of all of the thousands of buildings in a region, but we wish to make a map of the whole city no more than a few inches wide. Instead of throwing out the building information, or trying to render it all at once, we could generalize the data into some sort of outline of the [[urban area|urbanized area]] of the region.

The cartographer has license to adjust the content within their maps to create a suitable and useful map that conveys spatial information, while striking the right balance between the map's purpose and the precise detail of the subject being mapped. Well generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way.

==Methods==
There are many cartographic techniques that may fall into the broad category of generalization.&lt;ref name="Li 2007" /&gt; Here are brief descriptions of some of the more common methods:

===Selection===

Map generalization is designed to reduce the complexities of the [[reality|real world]] by strategically reducing ancillary and unnecessary details. One way that [[geospatial]] data can be reduced is through the selection process.&lt;ref name="Topfer 1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Topfer|first1=F|last2=Pillwizer|first2=W|title=The Principles of Selection|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=1966|pages=10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartographer can select and retain certain elements that he/she deems the most necessary or appropriate. In this method, the most important elements stand out while lesser elements are left out entirely. For example, a directional map between two points may have lesser and un-traveled roadways omitted as not to confuse the map-reader. The selection of the most direct and uncomplicated route between the two points is the most important data, and the cartographer may choose to emphasize this.

===Simplification===
Generalization is not a process that only removes and selects data, but also a process that simplifies or abstracts it as well. Simplification is a technique where the general shapes of features are retained, while eliminating unnecessary detail. Generally, smaller scale maps have more simplified features than larger scale maps. The [[Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm]] is one of the earliest and still most common techniques for line simplification.

Simplification can be achieved in different ways: by eliminating parts of and giving an area a more familiar shape, by removing unimportant points off a shape - usually performed by a software, by eliminating small features such as islands, or by smoothing "rough" features such as straightening curvy lines to highlight their trend.&lt;ref name="Stern, Hurni, Werner, Wiesmann 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=08–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combination===

Simplification also takes on other roles when considering the role of combination.  Overall data reduction techniques can also mean that in addition to generalizing elements of particular features, features can also be combined when their separation is irrelevant to the map focus.  A mountain chain may be isolated into several smaller ridges and peaks with intermittent forest in the natural environment, but shown as a continuous chain on the map, as determined by scale.  The map reader has to, again remember, that because of scale limitations combined elements are not concise depictions of natural or manmade features.

===Smoothing===

[[Smoothing]] is also a process that the map maker can employ to reduce the angularity of line work.  Smoothing is yet another way of simplifying the map features, but involves several other characteristics of generalization that lead into feature displacement and locational shifting.  The purpose of smoothing is to exhibit linework in a much less complicated and a less visually jarring way.  An example of smoothing would be for a jagged roadway, cut through a mountain, to be smoothed out so that the angular turns and transitions appear much more fluid and natural.

===Enhancement===

Enhancement is also a method that can be employed by the cartographer to illuminate specific elements that aid in map reading.  As many of the aforementioned generalizing methods focus on the reduction and omission of detail, the enhancement method concentrates on the addition of detail.  Enhancement can be used to show the true character of the feature being represented and is often used by the cartographer to highlight specific details about his or her specific knowledge, that would otherwise be left out.  An example includes enhancing the detail about specific river rapids so that the map reader may know the facets of traversing the most difficult sections beforehand.  Enhancement can be a valuable tool in aiding the map reader to elements that carry significant weight to the map’s intent.

===Displacement===

Displacement can be employed when 2 objects are so close to each other that they would overlap at smaller scales. A common place where this would occur is the cities Brazzaville and Kinshasa on either side of the Congo river in Africa. They are both the capital city of their country and on overview maps they would be displayed with a slightly larger symbol than other cities. Depending on the scale of the map the symbols would overlap. By displacing both of them away from the river (and away from their true location) the symbol overlap can be avoided. Another common case is when a road and a railroad run parallel to each other. this is mostly adopted using the azimuthal projection method.

===Exaggeration===

Exaggeration is the selection of map [[symbol]]s that make features appear larger than they really are to make them more visible, recognizable, or higher in the [[visual hierarchy]]. For example, in a small-scale map, highways, rivers, and railroads may be drawn as thick lines that would be miles wide if measured according to the scale. Exaggeration often necessitates a subsequent displacement operation because wide lines representing features located near each other will overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggregation===

Aggregation is the merger of multiple features into a new composite feature. The new feature is of a type different than the original individuals, because it conceptualizes the group. For example, a multitude of buildings can be turned into a single region representing an "urban area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GIS and automated generalization==
As [[geographic information systems|GIS]] developed from about the late 1960s onward, the need for automatic, algorithmic generalization techniques became clear. Ideally, agencies responsible for collecting and maintaining spatial data should try to keep only one canonical representation of a given feature, at the highest possible level of detail. That way there is only one record to update when that feature changes in the real world.&lt;ref name="Li 2007" /&gt; From this large-scale data, it should ideally be possible, through automated generalization, to produce maps and other data products at any scale required. The alternative is to maintain separate databases each at the scale required for a given set of mapping projects, each of which requires attention when something changes in the real world.

Several broad approaches to generalization were developed around this time:

* The ''representation-oriented'' view focuses on the representation of data on different scales, which is related to the field of Multi-Representation [[Database]]s (MRDB).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''process-oriented'' view focuses on the process of generalization.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''ladder-approach'' is a stepwise generalization, in which each derived dataset is based on the other database of the next larger scale.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''star-approach'' is the derived data on all scales is based on a single (large-scale) data base.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Scaling law==
There are far more small geographic features than large ones in the Earth's surface, or far more small things than large ones in maps. This notion of far more small things than large ones is also called spatial heterogeneity, which has been formulated as scaling law.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Geospatial analysis requires a different way of thinking: The problem of spatial heterogeneity|journal=GeoJournal|date=2015a|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1007/s10708-014-9537-y|arxiv=1401.5889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartographic generalization or any mapping practices in general is essentially to retain the underlying scaling of numerous smallest, a very few largest, and some in between the smallest and largest.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=The fractal nature of maps and mapping|journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science|date=2015b|volume=29|issue=1|pages=159–174|doi=10.1080/13658816.2014.953165|arxiv=1406.5410}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mapping process can be efficiently and effectively achieved by '''[[Head/tail Breaks|head/tail breaks]]''',&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015c"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Head/tail breaks for visualization of city structure and dynamics|journal=Cities|date=2015c|volume=43|issue=3|pages=69–77|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2014.11.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Head/tail breaks: A new classification scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution|journal=The Professional Geographer|date=2013|volume=65|pages=482–494|doi=10.1080/00330124.2012.700499}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new classification scheme or visualization tool for data with a heavy tailed distribution. Scaling law is likely to replace Töpfer's radical law to be a universal law for various mapping practices. What underlies scaling law is something of paradigm shift from Euclidean geometry to fractal, from non-recursive thinking to recursive thinking.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Scaling as a design principle for cartography|journal=Annals of GIS|date=2017|volume=23|issue=1|pages=67–69|doi=10.1080/19475683.2016.1251491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 'Baltimore Phenomenon'==
The Baltimore Phenomenon{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} is the tendency for a city (or other object) to be omitted from maps due to space constraints while smaller cities are included on the same map simply because space is available to display them. This phenomenon owes its name to the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], which tends to be omitted on maps due to the presence of larger cities in close proximity within the Mid-Atlantic United States. As larger cities near Baltimore appear on maps, smaller and lesser known cities may also appear at the same scale simply because there is enough space for them on the map.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Although the Baltimore Phenomenon occurs more frequently on automated mapping sites, it does not occur at every scale. Popular mapping sites like Google Maps, Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Yahoo Maps will only begin displaying Baltimore at certain zoom levels: 5th, 6th, 7th, etc.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The '''Center for Security Studies''' ('''CSS''') is a  center at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich]], which focuses on Swiss and international security.&lt;ref name=AboutUs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/center.html |title=About Us |website= css.ethz.ch| publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OSCENetwork&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osce-network.net/members/institutions/center-for-security-studies-css-eth-zuerich/ |title=OSCE Network |website=osce-network.net| publisher= OSCE Network, OSCE Network of Think Tanks and Academic Institutions |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The center was founded by Prof. Dr. Kurt Spillmann in 1986 and has been led by Prof. Dr. Andreas Wenger since 2002. It also constitutes as part of the [[Center for Comparative and International Studies]] (CIS) along with the political science professorships at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and the [[University of Zurich]].&lt;ref name=AboutUs /&gt;

The mission of the CSS is to examine the challenges surrounding security policy development and how to deal with them. It does this by performing research on security-related issues and by training researchers and practitioners. The center also includes an independent think tank, which focuses on Swiss and international security policy as well as furthering peace. Another key aim of the CSS is to serve as a link between academia, practitioners and the public on security matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/center/mission-statement.html |title=Mission Statement |publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) |website= css.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Projects which have been supported by the CSS include the [[Parallel History Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/about/imprint/index.html |title=Imprint − Parallel History Project |website= ethz.ch |date= | publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich)| accessdate= 2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; an online project which collected together and analyzed declassified and other government documents relating to the [[Cold War]], as well as the [[International Relations and Security Network]], an online information service that provided a range of open access products and resources on [[international relations]]. While the International Relations and Security Network was closed in 2016, its extensive [[digital library]] as well as other products have been integrated into the CSS and transformed into a new project, CSS Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services.html |title=Resources | publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich)|website= css.ethz.ch |date= 2016-10-10 |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities''' ('''CRASSH''') is an interdisciplinary research centre within the [[University of Cambridge]] for collaboration between researchers from the [[arts]], [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]].  The Centre is independent of any university department but works with both the School of Arts and Humanities, and the School of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Founded in 2001, CRASSH celebrated its 10th anniversary by welcoming professor [[Simon Goldhill]] as its new director and moving from Mill Lane, to the Alison Richard Building at 7 West Road, as well as inaugurating a new series of public lectures, which in 2011 were on [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1804/ The Idea of the University] and in 2012 [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/11 Understanding Society].

==New Building: 7 West Road==
At beginning of 2012, CRASSH moved into the new [[Alison Richard]] building at the West Road gateway to the University’s [[Sidgwick Site]], the main base for humanities and social science teaching and research at Cambridge. The building was designed by [[Nicholas Hare Architects]] and received a commendation at the 2013 [[Civic Trust Awards]]. The move into [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/page/1006/new-building.htm 7 West Road]  provides in-house space for larger conferences, but also creates greater interaction with old and new constituencies. The Centre’s relocation puts CRASSH alongside the major regional studies centres and POLIS, the Department of Politics and International Studies. The building is also home to [[Edmund de Waal]]'s first piece of public sculpture, A Local History, a commission of three vitrines filled with porcelain and sunk into the pavement outside the building.

==Graduate/faculty research groups==
The graduate/ faculty programme supports students and faculty working together around shared interdisciplinary research interests. The groups act as a barometer for disciplinary development and curriculum change. This programme is funded by the Isaac Newton Trust and the Andrew W Mellon.

==Conferences==

The conference support programme functions as a showcase for arts, social sciences and humanities research in action. It provides the opportunity for Cambridge scholars to broker local and international collaborations. Recent and upcoming conferences include [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1321/ The Future University], [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1700/ Migration in Legal and Political Theory], [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1703/ Art, Memory and Dictatorship in Latin America], [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1705/ Languages of Citizenship in Translation], [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1707/ Still Architecture] and [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1711/ Medieval Church Screens].

==Fellowships and postdoctoral researchers==

The Centre offers a number of programmes to bring scholars from all over the world to CRASSH: the fellowship schemes allow a community of scholars – from postdoctoral and early career researchers to more established visiting fellows – to interact in an interdisciplinary research environment.

==Media and outreach==
The Centre reaches out globally through its Facebook site and through making available recordings of an increasing number of events online, in our Media Gallery and via the Cambridge YouTube and iTunesU channels:

'''Chandavaram Buddhist site''' is an ancient [[Buddhist]] site in [[Chandavaram]] village in [[Prakasam district]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About Chandavaram Excavation Site"&gt;{{cite news|title=About Chandavaram Excavation Site|publisher=Holidayiq.com|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://www.holidayiq.com/Chandavaram-Excavation-Site-Ongole-Sightseeing-857-18953.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated on the bank of [[Gundlakamma River]], the site is {{convert|10|km|mi}} northwest of [[Donakonda railway station]].&lt;ref name="Chandavaram monastic cluster"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chandavaram monastic cluster|publisher=Monastic Asia|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://monastic-asia.wikidot.com/chandavaram}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chandavaram Buddhist site was built between the 2nd century [[Before Christ|BCE]] and the 2nd century [[Common Era|CE]] during the [[Satavahana dynasty]] and was discovered by [[Dr. (title)|Dr.]] Veluri Venkata Krishna Sastry in 1964.&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"&gt;{{cite news|title=Easy pickings|work=[[India Today]]|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/series-of-robberies-at-remote-buddhist-sites-in-andhra-pradesh-exposes-neglect-of-excavated-treasures/1/230807.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandavaram Buddhist site"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chandavaram Buddhist site|publisher=Discovered India|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://www.discoveredindia.com/andhra-pradesh/attractions/buddhist-centers/chandavaram-buddhist-site.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first of its kind in the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]], the Chandavaram Buddhist site was constructed between the 2nd century [[Before Christ|BCE]] and the 2nd century [[Common Era|CE]]. It was an active center for [[Buddhist]] religious activities, and was also inhabited at the time.&lt;ref name="About Chandavaram Excavation Site"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandavaram Buddhist site"/&gt; The age of the site was determined by the [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]] of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] discovered during [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. The sculptural panels in the site are of the [[Amarāvatī mahācetiya#Amaravati School|Amaravati school]] which also suggests that the site was built between the 2nd century [[Before Christ|BCE]] and the 2nd century [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt; The Chandavaram Buddhist site was used as a resting place by [[Buddhist monk]]s traveling from [[Varanasi|Kashi]] to [[Kanchipuram|Kanchi]].&lt;ref name="Chandavaram Buddhist site"/&gt; Discovered in 1964, the site was constructed during the [[Satavahana dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"/&gt; [[Ayaka pillars]] are absent from the site, indicating that the [[Hinayana]] form of [[Buddhism]] was prevalent in [[Chandavaram]].&lt;ref name="Chandavaram, Andhra Pradesh"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chandavaram, Andhra Pradesh|publisher=Buddhist tourism|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/chandavaram-andhra-pradesh.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923195013/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/chandavaram-andhra-pradesh.html#|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site houses a double terraced [[Stupa|MahaStupa]] on a hilltop which is next in importance only to [[Sanchi Stupa]]. The hill on which the MahaStupa is located is called Singarakonda.&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandavaram, Andhra Pradesh"/&gt;

==Construction and structure==
Constructed during the [[Satavahana dynasty]], the Chandavaram Buddhist site houses a double terraced [[Stupa|MahaStupa]] built on an elevated platform situated on a hilltop.&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About Chandavaram Excavation Site"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandavaram, Andhra Pradesh"/&gt; The MahaStupa exhibits the characteristics of stupas built under the [[Hinayana]] form of [[Buddhism]]. The main dome (MahaStupa) is {{convert|120|ft|m}} in circumference and {{convert|30|ft|m}} high. It has carved panels that portray the [[Dharmachakra]] (the wheel of ''[[Dharma]]'', one of the [[Ashtamangala]] of [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]). Apart from the main stupa, the site also houses several [[Vihara]]s, [[Brahmi script|Brahmi inscriptions]] and other stupas. In the MahaStupa, there is a [[Chaitya|Maha Chaitya]] which is {{convert|1.6|m|feet}} high and {{convert|60|cm|feet}} wide.&lt;ref name="About Chandavaram Excavation Site"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandavaram Buddhist site"/&gt;

The MahaStupa resembles the [[Dharmarajika|Dharmarajika stupa]] in [[Taxila]], [[Pakistan]]. The panels on the MahaStupa are made of [[limestone]]. The panels and the drum sections of the MahaStupa exhibit the [[Buddha footprint]], Stupas, [[Bodhi tree]]s and also narratives in the form of [[Jataka tales]] along with other stories. Since 1964, the Chandavaram Buddhist site has been excavated four times, and fifteen regular-sized and approximately one hundred small [[stupa]]s have been discovered. The site comprises the following:&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt;

===Monolith statue of Buddha===
In 1985, a project called the "Buddha Poornima Project" was proposed. Under this project, the world's tallest standing [[monolith]] statue of [[Buddha]] was to be erected on the site. Made out of [[granite]], the statue was carved by 200 sculptors in two years and on completion it weighed 440 tonnes with an overall height of {{convert|17|m|feet}}. However, the [[Buddha Statue of Hyderabad|Buddha statue]] was transported to city of [[Hyderabad]] in 1988 instead, where it was erected in 1992 in the [[Hussain sagar lake]] and stands today.&lt;ref name="Chandavaram – Foothold of Buddhist Mahastupa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buddha of the lake bottom"&gt;{{cite news|title=Buddha of the lake bottom|work=Washington Post|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/04/09/buddha-of-the-lake-bottom/342902b7-7025-41d3-a856-c14c1fac3815/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buddha statue consecrated"&gt;{{cite news|title=Buddha statue consecrated|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=Dec 2015|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/article3234728.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeological findings==
One [[Stupa|MahaStupa]], fifteen regular-sized and approximately one hundred small [[Stupa]]s have been discovered in the Chandavaram Buddhist site. Apart from the [[Chaitya|Maha Chaitya]], Silamandapa, [[Vihara]] and the [[Votive offering|Votive Stupas]], more than two dozen "Buddhist slabs" (decorated with designs and inscriptions) have also been discovered.&lt;ref name="Chandavaram Buddhist site"/&gt;

==Pilferage==
Pilferage of artifacts has been reported at the Chandavaram Buddhist site since the year 2000. In Oct 2000, two {{convert|9|feet}} long panels, with engravings of the [[Bodhi tree]] and of the Chaitra were uprooted from a cement platform and stolen from the site's museum.&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"/&gt; In February 2001, three pillars, each measuring {{convert|9|feet}} long and including one in which the [[Buddha]] was represented as fire were stolen.&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"/&gt; In March 2001, three more ornate pillars and a lotus [[medallion]] were stolen.&lt;ref name="Easy pickings"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4656">{{Tort law}}
'''Comparative responsibility''' (known as '''comparative fault''' in some jurisdictions) is a doctrine of [[tort law]] that compares the fault of each party in a lawsuit for a single injury. Comparative responsibility may apply to [[intentional torts]] as well as [[negligence]] and encompasses the doctrine of [[comparative negligence]].

Comparative responsibility divides the fault among parties by percentages, and then accordingly divides the money awarded to the [[plaintiff]].  The plaintiff may only recover the percentage of the damages he is not at fault for.  If a plaintiff is found to be 25% at fault, he can recover only 75% of his damages.

There are several circumstances that make comparative responsibility intricate: when the plaintiff shares in fault for the damages, when a defendant who has a share of the fault cannot be included in the suit, when one of the defendants can not pay, and when there are charges of both [[negligence]] and [[intentional torts]] in the same action.

==United States==
Currently, only Alabama will not allow a plaintiff to recover if it is proven to be in any way at fault.  This rule is called [[contributory negligence]], a doctrine perceived to be overly "harsh", which "has caused all but a few States to substitute the doctrine of comparative negligence".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mann, Barry Roberts, ''Smith and Roberson's Business Law'' (2008), p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states will follow one of three solutions to the problem:
#Allow the plaintiff to recover the amount of total damages to him, reduced by the percentage of fault he is assigned.
#Allow the plaintiff to recover only if he was an equal or lower percentage at fault than each defendant.  Plaintiff's recovery is reduced as in (a.)
#Allow the plaintiff to recover only if he was less at fault than each of the defendants. Plaintiff's recovery again reduced as above.

Another situation is where a defendant apportioned some fault can not pay his portion of the damages.  States will cover this situation differently. There are four options:
# The plaintiff will not recover from this defendant, and the other defendants will be responsible only for their share. Thirteen states follow this approach.
#: The next three options involve the doctrine of [[joint and several liability]]:
# Any of the other defendants can be held responsible for the unpaid share.  Fifteen states follow this approach (10 contributory responsibility, five which still follow [[contributory negligence]].
# The unpaid share will be reapportioned among the other defendants, according to their percentages.  Some states hold that only defendants above a specific percentage will share. 
# The unpaid share will be reapportioned among the defendants AND plaintiff according to each party's percentage share.

Third, is the issue of when one defendant is not present, the same options as above are present.  However there is the initial question of whether to allow the fault of an absent defendant to be considered.  States, again, are split on these issues.

Lastly, there is the issue of [[negligence]] and [[intentional torts]] in a single lawsuit. Courts, in the majority, do not apply comparative responsibility to intentional torts.  However, some courts apply comparative responsibility to intentional torts.  The law and academia on this issue is very complex, but typically support holding intentional tortfeasors in a suit subject to [[joint and several liability]].  Further, any negligent tortfeasor who negligently failed to protect the plaintiff from the intentional tortfeaser will be jointly and severally liable for the portion of the intentional tortfeasor's fault.  This view is supported by the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability Section 1.

Even more complicated is the issue of whether comparative fault should be allowed in [[strict liability]] actions.  Most jurisdictions, starting with California (which also pioneered strict liability for defective products), have held that the jury should be allowed to apportion fault between plaintiffs and defendants even in strict products liability actions.&lt;ref&gt;''Daly v. General Motors Corp.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/20C3d725.htm 20 Cal. 3d 725] (1978) (affirming defendant's right to introduce evidence that plaintiff was intoxicated and not using safety devices at time of accident in allegedly defective vehicle).&lt;/ref&gt; The Restatement (Third) of Torts (section 25) reflects the current majority view that comparative negligence applies to the strict liability of defendant.

A '''concept of operations''' (abbreviated '''CONOPS''', '''CONOPs''',&lt;ref name="hhsde"/&gt; or '''ConOps'''&lt;ref name="hhs"/&gt;) is a document describing the characteristics of a proposed [[system]] from the viewpoint of an individual who will use that system like a [[Business requirements|business requirements specification]] or [[stakeholder requirements specification (StRS)]]. It is used to communicate the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] and [[qualitative property|qualitative]] system characteristics to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s.&lt;ref name="hhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/ConOps.pdf|title=Concept of Operations (ConOps)|publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2008-06-22|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611232934/http://www3.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/ConOps.pdf|archive-date=2009-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CONOPS are widely used in the military, governmental services and other fields.

A CONOPS generally evolves from a [[concept]] and is a description of how a set of [[capability (systems engineering)|capabilities]] may be employed to achieve desired [[objective (goal)|objective]]s or [[End States|end state]].&lt;ref name="hhsde"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/disasters/discussion/planners/conops.html |title=CONOPS |publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services |accessdate=2008-06-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408092628/http://www.hhs.gov/disasters/discussion/planners/conops.html |archivedate=2008-04-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first standard was ''1362-1998 - IEEE Guide for Information Technology - System Definition - Concept of Operations (ConOps) Document'' that was superseded by the document ''29148-2011 - ISO/IEC/IEEE International Standard - Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle processes --Requirements engineering''.
Then came the 2012 AIAA revision proposal ''Guide: Guide to the Preparation of Operational Concept Documents (ANSI/AIAA G-043A-2012) (Revision of G-043-1992)'', and today we have ''ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 Systems and software engineering -- System life cycle processes''.

In the field of joint [[military operations]], a CONOPS in [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] terminology is a verbal or graphic statement that clearly and concisely expresses what the joint force commander intends to accomplish and how it will be done using available resources.&lt;ref name="JP5-0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp5_0.pdf|title=Joint Publication 5-0; Joint Operation Planning|accessdate=2012-08-14|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903220959/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp5_0.pdf|archive-date=2012-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JP1-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf|title=Joint Publication 1-02; Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms|accessdate=2012-08-14|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CONOPS may also be used or summarized in system acquisition [[DODAF]] descriptions such as the [[Operational_View#High-Level_Operational_Concept_Graphic|OV-1 High Level Operational Concept Graphic]]&lt;ref name="dodaf slides"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/DODAF/DoD_EA_Conf_SAR_DoDAF_in_Action.ppt|title=DODAF in Action|format=PPT}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description==
Concept of Operations documents can be developed in many different ways, but usually share the same properties. In general, a CONOPS will include the following:&lt;ref name="carnegie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/productlines/ppl/concept_of_operations.html|title=Concept of Operations|year=2008|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Statement of the [[goal]]s and [[objective (goal)|objective]]s of the system
* [[Strategy|Strategies]], tactics, [[policy|policies]], and constraints affecting the system
* [[Organization]]s, activities, and interactions among participants and stakeholders
* Clear statement of [[Professional responsibility|responsibilities]] and [[authority|authorities]] delegated
* Specific [[Business operations|operational]] [[Business process|process]]es for fielding the system
* Processes for initiating, developing, maintaining, and retiring the system

A CONOPS should relate a [[narrative]] of the process to be followed in [[Implementation|implementing]] a system. It should define the roles of the stakeholders involved throughout the process. Ideally it offers clear [[methodology]] to realize the goals and objectives for the system, while not intending to be an implementation or transition plan itself.&lt;ref name="carnegie"/&gt;

A CONOPS Standard is available to guide the development of a CONOPS document.&lt;ref name="ieeestd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/1362-1998_desc.html|title=IEEE Std 1362-1998 IEEE Guide for Information Technology—System Definition—Concept of Operations (ConOps) Document|publisher=IEEE Standards Association|accessdate=2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=5966380
|title=IEEE Std 29148-2011 - Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle processes --Requirements engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) Standard is structured around [[information systems]], but the standard may be applied to other complex systems as well.

'''Lobegott Friedrich Constantin (von) Tischendorf''' (18 January 1815 &amp;ndash; 7 December 1874) was a world-leading [[biblical]] scholar in his time. In 1844{{citation needed|reason=should be 1859, see text below|date=February 2017}} he discovered the world's oldest and most complete Bible dating from 325{{citation needed|reason=the exact date is unknown, 330 to 350 would be acceptable|date=February 2017}}, with the complete New Testament not discovered before. This Bible is called [[Codex Sinaiticus]], after the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery|St. Catherine's Monastery]] at [[Mount Sinai|Mt. Sinai]], where Tischendorf discovered it.

== The Codex Sinaiticus ==

The ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'' contains a 4th-century manuscript of New Testament texts. Two other Bibles of similar age exist, though they are less complete: [[Codex Vaticanus]] in the [[Vatican Library]] and  [[Codex Alexandrinus]], currently owned by the British Library. The Codex Sinaiticus is deemed by some{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be the most authoritative surviving New Testament manuscript, as no older document is as complete as the Codex.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csntm.org/manuscript/View/GA_01&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the "oldest Bible of the world"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} (as it is more complete than [[Codex Alexandrinus]] or [[Codex Vaticanus]]) has been digitised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140225213856/http://www.codexsinaiticus.net/en/ Codex Sinaiticus. Experience the oldest Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tischendorf's motivation ==

Throughout his life Tischendorf sought old biblical manuscripts, as he saw it as his task to give theology a Greek New Testament which was based on the oldest possible scriptures. He intended to be as close as possible to the original sources. Tischendorf's greatest discovery was in the monastery of Saint Catherine on the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which he visited in May 1844, and again in 1853 and 1859 (as Russian envoy).

In 1862 Tischendorf published the text of the Codex Sinaiticus for the 1000th Anniversary of the Russian Monarchy in both an illustrious four-volume facsimile edition and in a less costly text edition, to enable all scholars to have access to the Codex.

Tischendorf pursued a constant course of editorial labours, mainly on the New Testament, until he was broken down by overwork in 1873. His motive, as explained in a publication on Tischendorf's Letter by Prof. Christfried Boettrich (Leibzig University, Prof. of Theology), was to prove scientifically that the words of the Bible were trustfully transmitted over centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Christfried Böttrich]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Codex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus (title).JPG|thumb|right|220px|Title page from facsimile edition of codex Sinaiticus]]

Tischendorf was born in [[Lengenfeld]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], near [[Plauen]], the son of a physician. Beginning in 1834, he spent his scholarly career at the [[University of Leipzig]] where he was mainly influenced by [[Georg Benedikt Winer|JGB Winer]], and he began to take special interest in [[New Testament]] [[textual criticism|criticism]]. Winer's influence gave him the desire to use the oldest manuscripts in order to compile the text of the New Testament as close to the original as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Panning, Armin J. [http://www.wlsessays.net/files/PanningTischendorf.pdf Home Tischendorf and the History of the Greek New Testament Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130095538/http://wlsessays.net/files/PanningTischendorf.pdf |date=2010-11-30 }}, Milwaukee: Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838 he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, then became master at a school near [[Leipzig]].

After a journey through southern Germany and [[Switzerland]], and a visit to [[Strassburg]], he returned to Leipzig, and set to work upon a critical study of the New Testament text. In 1840 he qualified as university lecturer in theology with a dissertation on the [[recension]]s of the New Testament text — the main part of which reappeared the following year in the prolegomena to his first edition of the Greek New Testament. His critical apparatus included variant readings from earlier scholars — [[Elsevier]], [[Georg Christian Knapp]], [[Johann Martin Augustin Scholz]], and as recent as [[Karl Lachmann]] — whereby his researches were emboldened to depart from the [[received text]] as used in churches.

These early textual studies convinced him of the absolute necessity of new and more exact [[collation]]s of manuscripts. From October 1840 until January 1843 he was in Paris, busy with the treasures of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]], eking out his scanty means by making collations for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, [[Firmin Didot]], several editions of the Greek New Testament — one of them exhibiting the form of the text corresponding most closely to the [[Vulgate]]. His second edition retracted the more precarious readings of the first, and included a statement of critical principles that is a landmark for evolving critical studies of Biblical texts.&lt;ref name = "Bible Researcher"&gt;[http://www.bible-researcher.com/bib-t.html Bible Researcher].&lt;/ref&gt;

A great triumph of these laborious months was the decipherment of the [[palimpsest]] ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus|Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus]]'', of which the New Testament part was printed before he left Paris, and the [[Old Testament]] in 1845. His success in dealing with a manuscript that, having been over-written with other works of [[Ephrem the Syrian]], had been mostly illegible to earlier collators, made him more well known, and gained support for more extended critical expeditions. He now became ''professor extraordinarius'' at Leipzig, and where he was married in 1845. He also began to publish ''Reise in den Orient'', an account of his travels in the east (in 2 vols., 1845–46, translated as ''Travels in the East'' in 1847). Even though he was an expert in reading the text of a palimpsest (this is a document where the original writing has been removed and new writing added), he was not able to identify the value or meaning of the "Archimedes Palimpsest", which he donated to Cambridge.

From Paris, he had paid short visits to the [[Netherlands]] (1841) and England (1842). In 1843 he visited Italy, and after a stay of thirteen months, went on to [[Egypt]], [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]], and the [[Levant]], returning via [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].

=== Discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus Bible manuscripts ===

In 1844 Tischendorf travelled the first time to [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] at the foot of [[Mount Sinai]] in Egypt, where he found the oldest complete known Bible. Of the many pages which were contained in an old wicker basket (the kind that the monastery hauled in its visitors as customary in unsafe territories) he was given 43 pages as a present. He donated those 43 pages to King [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] (reigned 1836-1854), to honour him and to recognise his patronage as the funder of Tischenforf's journey. (Tischendorf held a position as Theological Professor at [[Leipzig University]], also under the patronage of Frederick Augustus II.) Leipzig University put 2 of the leaves on display in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tischendorf- Search for the oldest Bible of the world|url= http://www.ub.uni-leipzig.de/tischendorf/home.html|publisher=University Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Kholodiuk|first1= Anatoly|title= Tischendorf in search of the oldest Bible of the world - Leibzig Exhibition 2011|url=http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/44856.htm|website=pravoslavie.ru/english/44856.htm|publisher=Pravoslavie|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tischendorf reported in his 1865 book ''Wann Wurden Unsere Evangelen Verfasst'', translated to English in 1866 as  ''When Were Our Gospels Written'' in the section "The Discovery of the Sinaitic Manuscript" that he found, in a trash basket, forty-three sheets of parchment of an ancient copy of the Greek Old Testament, reporting that the monks were using the trash to start fires. And Tischendorf, horrified, asked if he could have them. He deposited them at the [[Leipzig University Library|University of Leipzig]], under the title of the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus|Codex Friderico-Augustanus]]'', a name given in honour of his patron, [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]], king of Saxony. The fragments were published in 1846, although Tischendorf kept the place of discovery a secret.

Many have expressed skepticism at the historical accuracy of this report of saving a 1500-year-old parchment from the flames. [[J. Rendel Harris]] referred to the story as a ''myth''.&lt;ref&gt;"What a run this myth has had, of a convent stove fed with parchment! unhappily for the statement, the basket is still there, a regular part of the library furniture, and not a suggestion can be found that it was ever used to carry vellum books to the kitchen for burning. But any story will be believed against the Sinaitic monks, even that they made fires with parchment." [https://books.google.com/books?id=u6gQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA140 Dr Gregory and the Canon and Text of the New Testament, ''Expositor'', 1908, p. 140]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tischendorf Lesebuch (see References) quotes that the Librarian Kyrillos mentioned to Tischendorf that the contents of the basket had already twice been submitted to the fire. The contents of the baskets were damaged scriptures, the third filling apparently, so cited by Tischendorf himself.[see Tischendorf Lesebuch, Tischendorf's own account]. 
In 1853 Tischendorf made a second trip to the Syrian monastery but made no new discoveries. He returned a third time in January 1859 under the patronage of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] with the active aid of the Russian government to find more of the ''Codex Frederico-Augustanus'' or similar ancient Biblical texts. On February 4, the last day of his visit, he was shown a text which he recognized as significant — the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'' — a Greek manuscript of the complete New Testament and parts of the Old Testament dating to the 4th century.

Tischendorf persuaded the monks to present the manuscript to [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]], at the cost of the Tsar it was published in 1862 (in four folio volumes). Those{{who|date=November 2014}} ignorant of the details of his discovery of the ''Codex Sinaiticus'' accused Tischendorf of buying manuscripts from ignorant [[monastery]] librarians at low prices. Indeed, he was never rich, but he staunchly defended the rights of the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery when he persuaded them eventually to send the manuscript to the Tsar. This took approximately 10 years because the abbot of St Catherines had to be re-elected and confirmed in office in Cairo and in Jerusalem, and during those 10 years no one in the monastery had the authority to hand over any documents. However the documents were handed over in due course following a signed and sealed letter to the Tsar Alexander II (Schenkungsurkunde). Even so, the monks of Mt. Sinai still display a receipt-letter from Tischendorf promising to return the manuscript to them in the case that the donation can not be done. This token-letter had to be destroyed, following the late issue of a "Schenkungsurkunde". This donation act regulated the Codex exchange with the Tsar, against 9000 Rubels and Rumanian estate protection. The Tsar was seen as the protector of Greek-Orthodox Christians. Thought lost since the Russian revolution, the document (Schenkungsurkunde) has now resurfaced in St Petersburg 2003, and has also been long before commented upon by other scholars like Kurt Aland. The monastery has disputed the existence of the gift certificate (Schenkungsurkunde) since the British Library was named as the new owner of the Codex. Now following the late find of the gift certificate by the [[National Library of Russia|National Russian Library]] the existence cannot be disputed in earnest.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlr.ru/eng/exib/CodexSinaiticus/zah/|title=A.V. Zakharova. The History of the Acquisition of the Sinai Bible by the Russian Government in the Context of Recent Findings in Russian Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869 the Tsar awarded Tischendorf the style of "von" Tischendorf as a Russian noble. 327 facsimile editions of the Codex were printed in Leipzig for the Tsar (instead of a salary for the three-year work of Tischendorf the Tsar gave him 100 copies for reselling) in order to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the traditional foundation of the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] state in 862 with the publication of this most amazing find. Supporting the production of the facsimile, all made with special print characters for each of the 4 scribes of the Codex Sinaiticus, was shift work and contributed to Tischendorf's early demise due to exhausting work for months also during nights. Thus the Codex found its way to the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"/&gt;

When the 4-volume luxury edition of the Sinai Bible was completed in 1862, C. Tischendorf presented the original ancient manuscript to Emperor Alexander II. Meanwhile, the question of transferring the manuscript to the full possession of the Russian Sovereign remained unresolved for some years. In 1869, the new Archbishop of Sinai, Callistratus, and the monastic community, signed the official certificate presenting the manuscript to the Tsar. The Russian Government, in turn, bestowed the Monastery with 9000 rubles and decorated the Archbishop and some of the brethren with orders. In 1933 the Soviet Government sold the Codex Sinaiticus for 100,000 pounds to the [[British Museum]] in London, England. The official certificate with signatures in Russian/ French/ Greek sections has been refound in St Petersburg.&lt;ref name="nlr.ru"/&gt;

=== Novum Testamentum Graece - publication with 21 editions ===

In the winter of 1849 the first edition of his great work now titled ''Novum Testamentum Graece. Ad antiquos testes recensuit. Apparatum criticum multis modis'' appeared (translated as ''Greek New Testament. The ancient witnesses reviewed. Preparations critical in many ways''), containing [[wiktionary:canon|canon]]s of criticism, adding examples of their application that are applicable to students today:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Basic rule: "The text is only to be sought from ancient evidence, and especially from Greek manuscripts, but without neglecting the testimonies of versions and [[Fathers of the Church|fathers]]."
#"A reading altogether peculiar to one or another ancient document is suspicious; as also is any, even if supported by a class of documents, which seems to evince that it has originated in the revision of a learned man."
#"Readings, however well supported by evidence, are to be rejected, when it is manifest (or very probable) that they have proceeded from the errors of copyists."
#"In parallel passages, whether of the New or Old Testament, especially in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], which ancient copyists continually brought into increased accordance, those testimonies are preferable, in which precise accordance of such parallel passages is not found; unless, indeed, there are important reasons to the contrary."
#"In discrepant readings, that should be preferred which may have given occasion to the rest, or which appears to comprise the elements of the others."
#"Those readings must be maintained which accord with [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]], or with the particular style of each individual writer."&lt;ref name = "Bible Researcher" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These were partly the result of the tireless travels he had begun in 1839 in search of unread manuscripts of the New Testament, "to clear up in this way," he wrote, "the history of the sacred text, and to recover if possible the genuine [[Twelve apostles|apostolic]] text which is the foundation of our faith."

In 1850 appeared his edition of the ''[[Codex Amiatinus]]'' (in 1854 corrected)&lt;ref&gt;Constantinus Tischendorf, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=pl&amp;id=x0opAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=NOVUM_TESTAMENTUM_LATINE#v= ''Codex Amiatinus. Novum Testamentum Latine interpreter Hieronymo''], (Lipsiae 1854).&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Septuagint]] version of the Old Testament (7th ed., 1887); in 1852, amongst other works, his edition of the ''[[Codex Claromontanus]]''.

Meanwhile, also in 1859, he had been made ''professor ordinarius'' of theology and of Biblical [[paleography]], this latter professorship being specially created for him; and another book of travel, ''Aus dem heiligen Lande'', appeared in 1862. Tischendorf's Eastern journeys were rich enough in other discoveries to merit the highest praise.

Besides his fame as a scholar, he was a friend of both [[Robert Schumann]], with whom he corresponded, and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], who dedicated a song to him. His text critical colleague [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]] wrote warmly of their mutual interest in textual scholarship. His personal library, purchased after his death, eventually came to the [[University of Glasgow]],&lt;ref name = "Univ Glasgow"&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/collection/tischendorf.html Tischendorf] at the [[University of Glasgow]], Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; where a commemorative exhibition of books from his library was held in 1974 and can be accessed by the public.

He died in [[Leipzig]].

==Works==
[[File:Codex Ephraemi Mt 26,52-69.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Matthew 26:52-69 in Tischendorf's facsimile edition (1843)]]
His ''magnum opus'' was the "Critical Edition of the New Testament."

The great edition, of which the text and apparatus appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself ''editio viii''; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints from [[stereotype]] plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869–72 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, the testimony of the Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]].

Of relatively lesser importance was Tischendorf's work on the Greek Old Testament. His edition of the Roman text, with the variants of the Alexandrian manuscript, the ''[[Codex Ephraemi]]'', and the ''Friderico-Augustanus'', was of service when it appeared in 1850, but, being stereotyped, was not greatly improved in subsequent issues. Its imperfections, even within the limited field it covers, may be judged by the aid of [[Eberhard Nestle]]'s appendix to the 6th issue (1880).

Besides this may be mentioned editions of the [[New Testament apocrypha]], ''De Evangeliorum apocryphorum origine et usu'' (1851); ''Acta Apostolorum apocrypha'' (1851); ''Evangelia apocrypha'' (1853; 2nd ed., 1876); ''Apocalypses apocryphae'' (1866), and various minor writings, partly of an apologetic character, such as ''Wann wurden unsere Evangelien verfasst?'' (''When Were Our Gospels Written?''; 1865; 4th ed., 1866, digitized by Google and available for e-readers), ''Haben wir den echten Schrifttext der Evangelisten und Apostel?'' (1873), and ''Synopsis evangelica'' (7th ed., 1898).

[[File:Cool tropics paradox.svg|260px|thumb|The cool tropics paradox. The geological evidence appeared to constrain temperatures to the red/blue band, whereas models produced the brown line taking just continental configuration into account, and the blue line when they included increased atmospheric {{co2}}. Vertical axis: Temperature; horizontal:latitude.]]
The '''cool tropics paradox''' refers to an apparent difference between modeled estimates of [[tropics|tropical]] [[temperature]]s during warm, ice-free periods of the [[Cretaceous]] and [[Eocene]], and the colder temperatures which proxies suggested were present. The long-standing paradox was resolved when novel proxy derived temperatures showed significantly warmer tropics during past greenhouse climates. The low-gradient problem, i.e. the very warm polar regions with respect to present day, is still an issue for state-of-the-art climate models.

==Origin of the paradox==
[[Proxy (climate)|Proxy]]-based reconstructions of [[paleotemperature]] appeared to predict a low temperature gradient between the tropics and [[polar region|poles]]. Data from surface-dwelling [[foramanifera]] suggested that during the late Cretaceous, an unusually warm period, [[sea surface temperature]]s were cooler than today's.&lt;ref name="D'hondt1996"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = D'hondt, S.
 | author2=Arthur, M.A.
 | year = 1996
 | title = Late Cretaceous Oceans and the Cool Tropic Paradox
 | journal = Science
 | volume = 271
 | issue = 5257
 | pages = 1838
 | doi = 10.1126/science.271.5257.1838
|bibcode = 1996Sci...271.1838D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later applied to similar situations, for example during the Eocene.

Climate models which worked during the Tertiary failed to produce this low temperature gradient; in order to match the observed data, they predicted that the tropics should be 40&amp;nbsp;°C or more - much hotter than the proxies said they were, and much hotter than the tropical surface temperatures observed today, which average around 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F). To attempt to match the data, bizarre models involving unreasonable eddies were required.

===Models===
Models were developed to predict and explain the lack of ice during the warm periods of the Cretaceous and Eocene. Models are developed according to the fundamental principle that they should be kept as simple as possible. Consequently, the first models attempted to explain the lack of ice using solely the different continental configuration.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; These could not produce an ice-free state without using an increased atmospheric concentration of {{co2}}; this assumption was checked against the evidence and found to be valid.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; This introduced a new difficulty: more {{co2}} would produce warmer tropical sea temperatures, and the evidence suggested they were the same or even colder than today's.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt;

===Data supporting cool tropical oceans===
Foraminiferal data, suggesting tropical temperatures cooler than today's, disagreed with terrestrial proxies, which spoke of warmer temperatures&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; - although most of the terrestrial figures are based on extrapolation of data from outside the tropics.&lt;ref name=Lunt2007&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Lunt, D.J. |author2=Ross, I. |author3=Hopley, P.J. |author4=Valdes, P.J.

 | doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.04.004
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources of error===
Analytical error is around 2−3&amp;nbsp;°C for individual specimens, but this drops to 0.5−1.0&amp;nbsp;°C when a sample is analysed - not enough to explain the discrepancy.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors mean that any pristine sample can be considered to have an associated error of up to 3&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;!--page=62--&gt;&lt;ref name=Crowley2000 /&gt; Changes in salinity, kinetic and diagenesis, can also confound analysis: the latter two are each estimated to reduce estimated temperatures by 1−2&amp;nbsp;°C, and are difficult to quantify.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt;

===Reconciling the data with the model===
Taking the data to be true, how could they be reconciled with the predictions of the model? The only way the model could be "tweaked" was by fiddling with the parameterisation of clouds, one of the most unpredictable aspects of any model. The model was adjusted to assume that the higher {{co2}} levels produced more tropical cloud, shielding these regions from the sun's heat.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; However, there was no evidence for this behaviour, and still left problems. The poles were still ''warmer'' than the models predicted.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; Further feedbacks, including increased poleward heat transport by the oceans, and vegetational responses at high latitudes, were proposed, but these didn't fully explain behaviour in the southern hemisphere, and winter, respectively.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt;

==Unravelling the paradox==

===Hints of warmth - terrestrial proxies===
Data from terrestrial proxies suggested that the equator may have reached 30&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=Lunt2007/&gt; - however, this figure is based upon extrapolation of data found outside the tropics.&lt;ref name=Lunt2007/&gt; This would imply that the foramaniferal proxies were wrong - the tests may perhaps have been overprinted by [[diagenesis]]. Researchers turned to shallow marine [[Mollusca|molluscs]] as it is easy to determine whether their shells had been altered by diagenesis.

===Detecting diagenesis in molluscs===
Many mollusc shells are constructed from aragonite, a mineral that is quickly replaced by calcite by diagenetic alteration.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; Also, near-shore molluscs preserve seasonal variability in their shells, a feature that would be lost in the presence of a diagenetic signal.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Kobashi, T. |author2=Grossman, E.L. |author3=Yancey, T.E. |author4=Dockery, D.T.

|bibcode = 2001Geo....29..983K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This removes ambiguity about whether or not a shell has been affected by post-deposition processes.

===Data from molluscs===
Evidence from the molluscs suggested a cooling between the Eocene and Oligocene.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; Taken from the Mississippi embayment, they recorded temperatures of around 26&amp;nbsp;°C in the Eocene, and 22&amp;nbsp;°C in the Oligocene; this cooling was markedly seasonal, with reconstructed water temperatures being 5° cooler in the summer, but just 3° cooler in winter.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; This trend fits best if {{co2}} was the dominant force for cooling.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt;

The winter temperatures of molluscs match well with the foramaniferal temperatures, suggesting that foramanifera predominantly grew during the winter months.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; The overall temperatures corresponded well with terrestrial and modelled estimates of a sea surface temperature around 4–5° warmer than today's.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt;

===Reassessment of the foraminiferal record===
The magnesium/calcium paleothermometer is a recently developed alternative to the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O method, and avoids many of the uncertainties inherent in the latter method. Use of this technique generates results more consistent with those expected, in contrast to the original δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records from the same sites.&lt;ref name=Tripati2003&gt;{{cite journal

'''Creativity''' is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

== Etymology ==
The [[lexeme]] in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō'' "to create, make": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Creativity Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[The Parson's Tale]]&lt;ref&gt;"And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath '''created''' all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order."&lt;/ref&gt;). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=RuncoAlbert /&gt;

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mumford | first1 = M. D. | year = 2003 | title = Where have we been, where are we going? Taking stock in creativity research | url = | journal = [[Creativity Research Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 107–120 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2003.9651403}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in [[Robert Sternberg]]'s words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".&lt;ref name="Sternberg Cognitive Psychology 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-38701-5|page=479|edition=6|chapter=Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Meusburger1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meusburger|first=Peter|title=Milieus of Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Spatiality of Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9876-5 |editor=Meusburger, P. |editor2=Funke, J. |editor3=Wunder, E.|chapter=Milieus of Creativity: The Role of Places, Environments and Spatial Contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an illustration, one definition given by [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Dr. E. Paul Torrance]] described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."&lt;ref name="Torrance Test Manual Verbal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Paul|title=The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Norms-Technical Manual Research Edition|publisher=Personnel Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=6|chapter=Verbal Tests. Forms A and B-Figural Tests, Forms A and B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Rhodes: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20342603?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103750220081''An Analysis of Creativity.''] in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42,  No. 7, p. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ''product'' usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful [[memetics|memes]].&lt;ref name="Gabora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Liane Gabora|Gabora, Liane]]|year=1997|title= The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity|journal=Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|volume=1|url=http://cogprints.org/794/1/oecc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=CENGAGE Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|page=468|editor=Jaime A. Perkins |editor2=Dan Moneypenny |editor3=Wilson Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of [[Ideation (creative process)|ideation]], autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468" /&gt;

== History of the concept ==
{{Main|History of the concept of creativity}}
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery.

Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt; [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]],&lt;ref name="Albert99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "''poiein''" ("to make"), which only applied to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who made it. [[Plato]] did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, The Republic, Book X – [[wikisource:The Republic/Book X]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt;

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in [[Western culture]] through [[Christianity]], as a matter of [[Revelation|divine inspiration]].&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; According to the historian [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], "the early Western conception of creativity was the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical story of creation]] given in the ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''."&lt;ref name="Albert2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the [[Renaissance]]. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0091265|last=Niu|first=Weihua|author2=Sternberg, Robert J.|title=The Philosophical Roots of Western and Eastern Conceptions of Creativity|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|year=2006|volume=26|pages=18–38|url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/641OBVx0d?url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}; cf.

Pritzer|chapter=Concepts of Creativity: A history|publisher=[[Elsevier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "[[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]" (Greek) or "[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Albert3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "[[Great Man theory|great men]]".&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt;

=== The Enlightenment and after ===
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the [[Renaissance]] and even later.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg" /&gt; The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the [[Renaissance]], when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named [[humanism]], which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Humanism - Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|website = www.loc.gov|date = 1993-01-08|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this philosophy arose the [[Renaissance man]] (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonardo da Vinci {{!}} Italian artist, engineer, and scientist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt; By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], mention of creativity (notably in [[aesthetics]]), linked with the concept of [[imagination]], became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz80"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tatarkiewicz, Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Tatarkiewicz |title=A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics |location=Translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], The Hague |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writing of [[Thomas Hobbes]], imagination became a key element of human cognition;&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; [[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]] was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of [[genius]], typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt;

As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt; Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of [[Darwinism]]. In particular, they refer to the work of [[Francis Galton]], who through his [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

=== Twentieth century to the present day ===
The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]]&lt;ref name="Wallas26"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallas, G. |title=Art of Thought |year=1926 |authorlink=Graham Wallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Wertheimer]]. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name="Simonton99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simonton, D. K. |year=1999 |title=Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|title=Process and reality : an essay in cosmology ; Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh during the session 1927–28|year=1978|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-934580-1|edition=Corrected}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Steven|title=Introduction: Whitehead Now|journal=Configurations|year=2005|volume=1|issue=13|pages=1–33}}. Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[Psychology|psychological]] literature, is usually considered to have begun with [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name="Sternberg99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sternberg, R. J. |author2=Lubart, T. I. |chapter=The Concept of Creativity: Prospects and Paradigms |editor=Sternberg, R. J. |title=Handbook of Creativity |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |isbn=978-0-521-57285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = H. L. | year = 1927 | title = The faculty of imagination: An enquiry concerning the existence of a general faculty, or group factor, of imagination | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = Monograph Supplement 3 | issue = | pages = 1–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.&lt;ref name="Kozbelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozbelt|first=Aaron|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9 |author2=Beghetto, Ronald A. |author3=Runco, Mark A.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Theories of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Four C" model ===
[[James C. Kaufman]] and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.&lt;ref name="KaufBeg2009"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0013688|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|author2=Beghetto, Ronald A.|title=Beyond Big and Little: The Four C Model of Creativity|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|year=2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–12|authorlink=James C. Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.&lt;ref name=Kozbelt /&gt; [[Margaret Boden]] distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).&lt;ref name="Boden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boden|first=Margaret|title=The Creative Mind: Myths And Mechanisms|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-297-82069-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craft makes a similar distinction between "high" and "little c" creativity.&lt;ref name="Craft1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craft|first=Anna|title=Creativity in education|year=2001|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=978-0-8264-4863-7 |editor=Craft, A. |editor2=Jeffrey, B. |editor3=Leibling, M. |chapter='Little C' creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Ken Robinson]] as referring to "high" and "democratic" creativity. [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]&lt;ref name="Csik1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi |first=Mihály|title=Creativity:Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention|year=1996|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-092820-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.&lt;ref name="Simonton97"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.104.1.66|last=Simonton|first=D.

== Theories of creative processes ==
There has been much empirical study in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
Incubation is a temporary break from [[creative problem solving]] that can result in insight.&lt;ref name="EoC Incubation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=S. M.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity Volume I|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-375039-6|pages=653–657|edition=2nd|editor=M. A. Runco |editor2=S. R. Pritzker|chapter=Incubation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref name="Ward2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, T. |year=2003 |chapter=Creativity |editor= Nagel, L. |title=Encyclopaedia of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some [[empirical evidence]] is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steven M.|title=The Creative Cognition Approach|year=1995|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|editor=Steven M. Smith |editor2=Thomas B. Ward |editor3=Ronald A. Finke|chapter=Fixation, Incubation, and Insight in Memory and Creative Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref name=Anderson2000&gt;"{{cite book |author=Anderson, J. R. |year=2000 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-1686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1996). ''Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention.'' New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergent and divergent thinking ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]&lt;ref name="Guilford67"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guilford, J. P. |year=1967 |title=The Nature of Human Intelligence |authorlink=J. P. Guilford}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Creative cognition approach ===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.&lt;ref name="Ward1995"&gt;Ward, T.B. (1995). What’s old about new ideas. In S. M. Smith, T. B. Ward &amp; R. A. &amp; Finke (Eds.) ''The creative cognition approach'', 157–178, London: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg&lt;ref name="Weisberg93"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weisberg, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Creativity: Beyond the myth of genius |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-2119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory ===
Helie and Sun&lt;ref name="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Helie S. |author2=Sun R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861|citeseerx=10.1.1.405.2245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently proposed a unified framework for understanding [[creative problem-solving|creativity in problem solving]], namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 
# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;
# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. 
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
{{Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.&lt;ref name="Koestler64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. &amp; Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20–23, 2011, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N. J. &amp; Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M. J. Byrne|Byrne, R. M. J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessing individual creative ability ==
=== Creativity quotient ===
There was a ''creativity quotient'' developed similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415–419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric approach ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name="Guilford67" /&gt; which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.uncw.edu/caropresoe/GiftedFoundations/SocialEmotional/Creativity-articles/Kim_Can-we-trust-creativity-tests.pdf|title=Can We Trust Creativity Tests?|author=Kim, Kyung Hee|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

Such tests, sometimes called ''Divergent Thinking (DT)'' tests have been both supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K.

Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of [[divergent thinking]] tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, [[Natural language processing|NLP]] techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E. A., &amp; Dunbar, K. N. (2009). Creativity evaluation through latent semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 602–607).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, I. J., &amp; Haarmann, H. (2014). Automated scoring of originality using semantic representations. In Proceedings of the 36th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (poster paper).&lt;/ref&gt; The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.

Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = S. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

Runco&lt;ref&gt;Other members include Kenes Beketayev PhD Computer Science; Liberty Lidz, PhD Linguistics; Perman Gochyyev, PhD Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system).

=== Social-personality approach ===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternberg99" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.&lt;ref name=Feist /&gt; Within the framework of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.&lt;ref name="Batey, M. 2006 p. 355-429"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Creativity, intelligence and personality: A critical review of the scattered literature | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 355–429 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.4.355-430}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openness to experience]] has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A.

Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=Feist&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feist | first1 = G. J. | year = 1998 | title = A meta-analysis of the impact of personality on scientific and artistic creativity | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychological Review | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 290–309 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0204_5| pmid = 15647135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
An alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as [[Self-report study#Questionnaires and interviews|self-report questionnaires]] supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire|Creative Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying-Yao|first=Wang, Chia-Chi{{!}}Ho, Hsiao-Chi{{!}}Cheng, Chih-Ling{{!}}Cheng|date=2014-00-00|title=Application of the Rasch Model to the Measurement of Creativity: The Creative Achievement Questionnaire.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1088863|journal=Creativity Research Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendetowicz|first=David|last2=Urbanski|first2=Marika|last3=Aichelburg|first3=Clarisse|last4=Levy|first4=Richard|last5=Volle|first5=Emmanuelle|date=2017-01|title=Brain morphometry predicts individual creative potential and the ability to combine remote ideas|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010945216303161|journal=Cortex|volume=86|pages=216–229|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.10.021|pmid=27919546|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German-speaking&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017-11|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees' creative achievement.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt; version.

== Creativity and intelligence ==
The potential relationship between creativity and [[intelligence]] has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962"&gt;Getzels, J. W., &amp; Jackson, P. W. (1962). Creativity and intelligence: Explorations with gifted students. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron,&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963"&gt;Barron, F. (1963). Creativity and psychological health. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach &amp; Kogan,&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965"&gt;Wallach, M. A., &amp; Kogan, N. (1965). Modes of thinking in young children: A study of the creativity-intelligence distinction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guilford&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967"&gt;Guilford, J. P. (1967). The nature of human intelligence. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.&lt;ref&gt;Plucker, J., &amp; Renzulli, J. S. (1999). Psychometric approaches to the study of human creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 35–60). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:

*Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967" /&gt;
*Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, J. R. (1989). Cognitive processes in creativity. In J. A. Glover, R. R. Ronning, &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 135–145). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996"&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1996). Successful Intelligence. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg and O’Hara&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; O’Hara, L. A. (1999). Creativity and intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 251–272). Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
#Creativity is a subset of intelligence
#Intelligence is a subset of creativity
#Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs
#Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)
#Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)

=== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ===
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.

''Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence''

*Gardner’s  [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] (MIT)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). Creating minds. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; – implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT. To demonstrate this, Gardner cited examples of different famous creators, each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e.g. Picasso (spatial intelligence); Freud (intrapersonal); Einstein (logical-mathematical); and Gandhi (interpersonal).
*Sternberg’s Theory of Successful intelligence&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J., Kaufman, J. C., &amp; Grigorenko, E. L. (2008). Applied intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Triarchic theory of intelligence]]) includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories: Componential (Analytic), Contextual (Practical), and Experiential (Creative). Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.
*The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Lichtenberger | first3 = E. O. | year = 2011 | title = Finding creativity on intelligence tests via divergent production | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of School Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 83–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silvia | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Beaty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = E.

Martindale&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (1999). Biological bases of creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 137– 152). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
*The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by ''g''. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.

''Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity''

*Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1991 | title = An investment theory of creativity and its development | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.1159/000277029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1992 | title = Buy low and sell high: An investment approach to creativity | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.1992.tb00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the metaphor of a stock market, they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
*Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | year = 1982 | title = Social psychology of creativity: A consensual assessment technique | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 997–1013 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1996). Creativity in context: Update to "The Social Psychology of Creativity". Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2005 | title = Bridging generality and specificity: The Amusement Park Theoretical (APT) Model of creativity | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 158–163 | doi=10.1080/02783190509554310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.
**Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).
**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.
**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.

=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.

''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''

*Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J. S. | year = 1978 | title = What makes giftedness? Reexamining a definition | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 180–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
*[[PASS theory of intelligence]]. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naglieri | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2001 | title = Understanding intelligence, giftedness, and creativity using PASS theory | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 151–156 | doi=10.1080/02783190109554087}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, E. P. (1962). Guiding creative talent. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of the TT, Barron&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron, F. (1969). Creative person and creative process. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = K | year = 1964 | title = Creativity and sociometric choice among adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–261 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919564| pmid = 14238998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of ''r'' = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children.

Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cho | first1 = S. H. | last2 = Nijenhuis | first2 = J. T. | last3 = van Vianen | first3 = N. E.

Jauk et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jauk | first1 = E. | last2 = Benedek | first2 = M. | last3 = Dunst | first3 = B. | last4 = Neubauer | first4 = A.

Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wai | first1 = J. | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = D. | last3 = Benbow | first3 = C. P. | year = 2005 | title = Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 3| pages = 484–492 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.484}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K. H. | year = 2005 | title = Can only intelligent people be creative? | url = | journal = Journal of Secondary Gifted Education | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 57–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preckel | first1 = F. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiese | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students: An investigation of threshold theory | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

=== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ===
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind’s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

Weisberg &amp; Alba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Alba | first2 = J. W. | year = 1981 | title = An examination of the alleged role of "fixation" in the solution of several "insight" problems | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 110 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see [[Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle]]) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt; administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence? Why? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 871–882 | doi=10.1037/h0042008}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.

== Neuroscience ==
The [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed&lt;ref name="NeuroPsychiatry"&gt;[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the article "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms." The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147–53 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.&lt;ref name=PMID_26003860&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |laysummary = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232–9 |volume = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, in press-a&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2011, in press-b&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert &amp; Vandervert-Weathers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al.

=== REM sleep ===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02223 |author1=Wagner U. |author2=Gais S. |author3=Haider H. |author4=Verleger R. |author5=Born J. | year = 2004 | title = Sleep inspires insight | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972| pages = 352–5 | pmid = 14737168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] rather than [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900271106 |author1=Cai D.

It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."&lt;ref name="Cai" /&gt;

== Affect ==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term "affect" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Winkielman2007&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive affect relations ===
According to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

== Creativity and artificial intelligence ==
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s formal [[theory]] of creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658| citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.6919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990–2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple [[Computational learning theory|computational]] principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Youtube, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[physicist]]s are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished [[physical law]]s permitting better [[data compression]]. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&amp;list=PL194623EBA834DB77&amp;index=11 When creative machines overtake man]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 |pmid=16125369 |url=http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215212520/http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= |volume=80 |issue=2–3 |title=Verbal creativity and schizotypal personality in relation to prefrontal hemispheric laterality: A behavioral and near-infrared optical imaging study |year=2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |pages=271–282 | last1 = Folley | first1 = Bradley S. | last2 = Park | first2 = Sohee|pmc=2817946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and "creative bipolarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|last2=Koutsoukou-Argyraki|first2=Asimina|date=2017|title=Bipolar Disorder and/or Creative Bipolarity: Robert Schumann's Exemplary Psychopathology - Combining Symptomatological and Psychosocial Perspectives with Creativity Research|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/479883|journal=Psychopathology|language=english|volume=50|issue=6|pages=379–388|doi=10.1159/000479883|pmid=29017153|issn=0254-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle.

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;

According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx|title=The science of creativity|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creativity and personality ==
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each

: (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
: (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)

This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;(Batey &amp; Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C. K. | year = 2002 | title = Creativity and Group Innovation | url = | journal = Applied Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 400–406 | doi = 10.1111/1464-0597.00984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Guilford, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.

Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.&lt;ref&gt;(Christiaans &amp; Venselaar, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.

From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro &amp; Gardner, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.&lt;ref&gt;(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malevolent creativity ==
Malevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the "darker side" of creativity.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R. B. | year = 1993 | title = The dark side of creativity | url = | journal = Creat. Res. J. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 137–144 | doi = 10.1080/10400419309534472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.&lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"/&gt; Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Reiter-Palmon | first2 = R. | year = 2015 | title = Fast and furious: The influence of implicit aggression, premeditation, and provoking situations on malevolent creativity | url = | journal = Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 54–64 | doi = 10.1037/a0038499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) &lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"/&gt;

===Malevolent creativity and crime===
Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.&lt;ref&gt;Aggression: A social psychological analysis.

== Creativity across cultures ==
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg RJ 'Introduction' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (2006) (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 1-9. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-cultural research centred on [[Hong Kong]] found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society.&lt;ref&gt;Niu W (2006) 'Development of Creativity Research in Chinese Societies' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 386-387. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 465. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[linguistic relativity]], i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; [[Africa]] has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as [[music]], [[art]], and [[storytelling]]. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 458. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Preiss DD and Strasser K (2006) 'Creativity in Latin America' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 46. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Smith GJW and Carlsson I (2006) 'Creativity under the Northern Lights' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 202. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Preiser S (2006) 'Creativity Research in German-Speaking Countries' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 175. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In organizations ==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|right|Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in [[Brazil]]. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Amabile&lt;ref name="Amabile98"&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] – [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;
* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement – recognitions, cheering, praising;
* Organizational support – value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name="Nonaka91"&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1998). "How to kill creativity". Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R. 2010. Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence]] is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, S. y Urrea J. "Ingenio y Pasión" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

The investigation by Loo (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391&lt;/ref&gt; on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).

Loo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.

The study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.

This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.

There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).

The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.

'''[[Team Composition]]'''

Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822–832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

'''Team Processes'''

Team communication [[norm (social)|norm]]s, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, [[negotiation|negotiating]], remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with [[brainstorming]] and [[problem solving]]. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], which facilitates collective creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Organizational culture|'''Organizational Culture''']]

Supportive and motivational environments that create [[psychological safety]] by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Organizations in which [[help-seeking]], [[Helping behavior|help giving]], and [[collaboration]] are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargadon | first1 = A.

==Economic views of creativity==
Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]" model of creativity.&lt;ref name="RubRunc1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.&lt;ref name="Diamond1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative_problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].

Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickerson&lt;ref name="Nickerson99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nickerson|first=R. S.|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R. J. Sternberg|chapter=Enhancing creativity|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:
# Establishing purpose and intention
# Building basic skills
# Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge
# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance
# Providing balance

==Creativity and education policies==

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as "stifling" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[preschool]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csik99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi|first=Mihály|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R. J. Sternberg|chapter=Implications of a systems perspective for the study of creativity|authorlink=Mihály Csíkszentmihályi|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RobAzzam2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=K.|author2=Azzam, A. M.|title=Why creativity now?|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2009|volume=67|issue=1|pages=22–26|authorlink=Ken Robinson (British author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise.&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt; In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paris, C., Edwards, N., Sheffield, E., Mutinsky, M., Olexa, T., Reilly, S., &amp; Baer, J. (2006). How early school experiences impact creativity. In J. C. Kaufman &amp; J. Baer (Eds.), Creativity and Reason in Cognitive Development (pp. 333–350). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.

Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrgeHanson2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrge|first=C.|author2=Hanson. S.|title=The creative platform: A new paradigm for teaching creativity|journal=Problems of Education in the 21st Century|year=2009|volume=18|pages=33–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1993). Evolution and flow. In M. Csikszentmihalyi (Ed.), The evolving self: A psychology for the third millennium (pp. 175–206). New York: Harper Perennial.&lt;/ref&gt; To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (1998). All our futures: Creativity, culture, and education. UK: NACCCE&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ByrgeHanson2009 /&gt; In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The manifesto : a guide to developing a creative career|last=Torrance|first=E. Paul (Ellis Paul)|date=2002|publisher=Ablex Pub|isbn=978-0313011863|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=|oclc=52769638}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the benefits of mentoring creativity apply only to creative contributions considered great in a given field, not to [[Creativity#"Four C" model|everyday creative expression]].&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"/&gt;

===Scotland===
In the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]], creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual.  It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)] The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/Creative%20Learning%20Networks] and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/What%20are%20creativity%20skills?] Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/documents/creativity/cre24_infographics/cre24-the-big-picture.pdf] Scotland’s national Creative Learning Plan [http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications/plans-and-strategy-documents/scotlands-creative-learning-plan-2013] supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/Pages/Search.aspx?k=Creativity%20infographics] including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)]

===United States===
Creativity has also been identified as one of the key [[21st century skills]] and as one of the  [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29302">'''Forensic identification''' is the application of [[forensic science]], or "forensics", and technology to identify specific objects from the [[trace evidence]] they leave, often at a [[crime scene]] or the scene of an accident. Forensic means "for the courts".

==Human identification==
[[File:Blooddroplets.JPG|right|thumb|Droplets of [[human blood]]. In addition to analyzing for [[DNA]], the droplets are round and show no spattering, indicating they impacted at a relatively slow velocity, in this case from a height of two feet.]]

People can be identified by their [[fingerprint]]s. This assertion is supported by the philosophy of [[Dermal papillae|friction ridge]] identification, which states that friction ridge identification is established through the agreement of friction ridge formations, in sequence, having sufficient uniqueness to individualize.

Friction ridge identification is also governed by four premises or statements of facts:
# Friction ridges develop on the fetus in their definitive form prior to birth.
# Friction ridges are persistent throughout life except for permanent scarring, disease, or decomposition after death.
# Friction ridge paths and the details in small areas of friction ridges are unique and never repeated.
# Overall, friction ridge patterns vary within limits which allow for classification.

People can also be identified from traces of their DNA from blood, skin, hair, saliva, and semen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAN DNA DEMAND A VERDICT?{{!}}|url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/labs/gel/forensics/|work=Learn Genetics|publisher=The University of Utah|accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by [[DNA fingerprinting]], from their [[ear print analysis|ear print]], from their teeth or bite by [[forensic odontology]], from a photograph or a video recording by [[facial recognition system]]s, from the video recording of their walk by [[gait analysis]], from an audio recording by [[voice analysis]], from their handwriting by [[Questioned Document Examination|handwriting analysis]], from the content of their writings by their writing style (e.g. typical phrases, factual bias, and/or misspellings of words), or from other traces using other [[biometric]] techniques.

Since forensic identification has been first introduced to the courts in 1980, the first exoneration due to DNA evidence was in 1989 and there have been 336 additional exonerations since then.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/exonerate/|title=Exonerate the Innocent|date=|website=Innocence Project|publisher=|access-date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who specialize in forensic identification continue to make headway with new discoveries and technological advances to make convictions more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehrer|first=M.|date=1998|title=The role of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

[[Body identification]] is a subfield of forensics concerned with identifying someone from their remains.

=== Foot creases ===
Feet also have friction ridges like fingerprints do. Friction ridges have been widely accepted as a form of identification with fingerprints but not entirely with feet. Feet have creases which remain over time due to the depth it reaches in the dermal layer of the skin, making them permanent.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=S. L.|date=2004|title=Persistence of creases of the foot and their value for forensic identification purposes|url=|journal=Journal of Forensic Identification|volume=54|issue=3|page=296|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These creases are valuable when individualizing the owner. The concept of no two fingerprints are alike is also applied to foot creases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blake|first=J. W.|date=1959|title=Identification of the New Born by Flexure Creases|url=|journal=Journal of Language, Identity, &amp; Education|volume=9|issue=9|pages=3–5|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foot creases can grow as early as 13 weeks after conception when the [[Anatomical terms of location|volar pads]] begin to grow and when the pads regress, the creases remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kimura|first=S.|last2=Kitagawa|first2=T.|date=1986|title=Embryological development of human palmar, plantar, and digital flexion creases.|url=|journal=The Anatomical Record|volume= 216|pages=191–197|doi=10.1002/ar.1092160211|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qamra|first=S.

There is record of foot crease identification used in a criminal case to solve a murder.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. vs. Ybo Airut Jr. Manslaughter Conviction registered in Nunavut Court of Justice, Rankin Inlet, Nunavut Territory, Canada. April 23, 2002 (Offense occurred on December 19, 2000.)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes with marks left by the foot with ink, blood, mud, or other substances, the appearance of creases or ridges become muddled or extra creases may appear due to cracked skin, folded skin, or fissures. In order to truly compare morphological feature, the prints of feet must be clear enough to distinguish between individuals.

=== Downfalls ===

The two basic conceptual foundations of forensic identification is that everyone is individualized and unique.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=S.A.|date=2009|title=Forensics without uniqueness, conclusions without individualization: the new epistemology of forensic identification.|url=|journal=Law, Probability, and Risk|edition=3|volume=8|pages=233–255|doi=10.1093/lpr/mgp016|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This individualization belief was invented by a police records clerk, [[Alphonse Bertillon]], based on the idea that "nature never repeats," originating from the father of social statistics, [[Adolphe Quetelet|Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet]]. The belief was passed down through generations being generally accepted, but it was never scientifically proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Page|first=M.|last2=Taylor|first2=J.|last3=Blenkin|first3=M.|date=April 19, 2011|title=Forensic Identification Science Evidence Since Daubert: Part II—Judicial Reasoning in Decisions to Exclude Forensic Identification Evidence on Grounds of Reliability|url=|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|edition=4|volume=56|pages=913–917|doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2011.01776.x|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a study done intending to show that no two fingerprints were the same, but the results were inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=H.|last2=Mildo|first2=C.|date=1943|title=Finger Prints, Palms and Soles: An Introduction to  Dermatoglyphics|url=|journal=|location=Philadelphia, PA|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern forensic and [[evidentiary]] scholars collectively agree that individualization to one object, such as a fingerprint, bite mark, handwriting, or ear mark is not possible. In court cases, forensic scientists can fall victim to [[Observer-expectancy effect|observer bias]] when not sufficiently blinded to the case or results of other pertinent tests. This has happened in cases like ''[http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/11a0221p-06.pdf United States v. Green]'' and ''[https://casetext.com/case/state-v-langill-2 State v. Langill]''. Also, the [http://www.forensic-testing.net/proficiency-tests proficiency tests] that forensic analysts must do are often not as demanding to be considered admissible in court.

=== DNA Identification ===
Forensic [[DNA]] analysis can be a useful tool in aiding forensic identification because DNA is found in almost all cells of our bodies except red blood cells. [[Deoxyribonucleic]] acid is located in two different places of the cell, the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]; which is inherited from both parents, and the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondria]]; inherited maternally. Similar to fingerprints, an individual’s [[DNA profile]] and characteristics are unique. Forensic identification using DNA can be useful in different cases such as determining suspects in violent crimes, solving [[DNA paternity testing|paternity]]/maternity, and identifying human remains of victims from mass disasters or missing person cases. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It is also used to link suspects or victims to each other or to crime scenes. When a sample is located at a crime scene, it must be collected, processed, and transported, along with a chain of custody, to the laboratory for analysis, so that if a DNA profile is generated it can be accepted in court. Proper evidence collection and preservation is crucial to ensure evidence is not being contaminated. Main procedures investigators must use when packaging biological material is allowing the evidence to air dry and then package into paper bags. Plastic bags should never be used on biological evidence because it could degrade DNA or lead to bacterial growth. 

DNA can be sourced from [[Organic matter|biological material]] such as semen, blood, saliva, feces, urine, teeth, bone, and hair that is left behind from an individual. There are different [[Presumptive and confirmatory tests|presumptive]] and [[Presumptive and confirmatory tests|confirmatory]] tests used for each type of biological material found at a scene. Presumptive tests are quick, sensitive and are relatively specific to bodily fluids that give the analyst an idea of what might be present. Confirmatory tests confirm what the biological sample is. In addition to looking for biological material at a crime scene, pieces of evidence can also be examined and analyzed for the presence of DNA. Evidence pieces that may have the presence of DNA could include clothing, bedding, weapons, masks, gloves, among many others. This is attributed to [[touch DNA]], where only minute samples are left after an object has been touched. It is defined as “evidence with no visible staining that would likely contain DNA resulting from the transfer of epithelial cells from the skin to an object.” &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/article/2013/04/touch-dna-crime-scene-crime-laboratory|title=Touch DNA: From the Crime Scene to the Crime Laboratory|date=2013-04-12|work=Forensic Magazine|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Forensic Scientist|forensic scientist]] can attempt to obtain a DNA profile from the sample with as few as six cells.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

The first step in the DNA process with a piece of evidence is [[DNA extraction|extraction]]. Extraction is a technique used to remove the DNA from the cell. The next step would be quantification which determines how much DNA is present. The third step is [[Amplification of DNA|amplification]] in order to yield multiple copies of DNA. Next is [[DNA separation by silica adsorption|separation]], to separate the DNA out to use for identification. Finally, the analyst can now complete analysis and interpretation of the DNA sample and compare to known profiles. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forensicsciencesimplified.org/dna/how.html|title=DNA Evidence: How It’s Done|website=www.forensicsciencesimplified.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unknown sample found at a crime scene is called a questioned sample. A known sample can be taken either from a suspect or found in a [[database]]. The FBI’s database used for DNA is [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]], Combined DNA Index System. It has data at three levels: local, state, and national. The national level data is stored in [[Combined DNA Index System|NDIS]], National DNA Index system. CODIS/NDIS allows analysts to compare their questioned DNA profile among those of arrestees, convicted offenders, and other unknown samples to try and produce investigative leads. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nij.gov/journals/266/Pages/backlogs-codis.aspx|title=What is CODIS? {{!}} National Institute of Justice|website=National Institute of Justice|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; If questioned and known samples are similar, [[statistics]] and interpretation will then be completed. The DNA profile will be compared to a population database and a [[Forensic statistics|random match probability]] will be determined. Random match probability is defined as the chance that an individual selected randomly from a population will have an identical DNA profile to the markers tested. &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45406517|title=Forensic DNA typing : biology &amp; technology behind STR markers|last=1969-|first=Butler, John M. (John Marshall),|date=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780121479510|location=San Diego|oclc=45406517}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they do not equal each other, they are not a match, termed exclusion.  

During [[Dna Typing|DNA typing]], several markers are examined, termed [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]. When more markers are examined, this could result in either a greater probability that two unrelated individuals will have different [[Genotype|genotypes]] or adds to the confidence of connecting an individual to an unknown sample.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One locus difference between a questioned and known sample is enough to exclude that suspect as the contributor.  

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has identified 13 core STR loci that are effective for human identification. STR is [[short tandem repeats]] which are short DNA regions in the [[genome]] and are 2-6 base pairs in length. STR is common in forensic analysis because they are easily amplified using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and they have unique variation among individuals for human identification. PCR is the technique of copying DNA by making millions of copies. When all 13 core loci are tested on a DNA profile, the random match probability is more than one in a trillion.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 

Since DNA was first used in a criminal investigation in 1986, it has aided investigators to solve many cases. DNA profiling is one of the most important tools in forensics and continued research will increase its ability and accuracy to provide more techniques for the future. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exploredna.co.uk/understanding-forensic-identification.html|title=Understanding Forensic Identification|website=www.exploredna.co.uk|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Animal identification ==

=== Wildlife forensics ===
There are many different applications for wildlife forensics and below are only some of the procedures and processes used to distinguish species.

&lt;u&gt;Species Identification&lt;/u&gt;: The important of species identification is most prominent in animal population that are [[Poaching|illegally hunted]], harvested, and traded,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alacs|first=E. A.|last2=Georges|first2=A.|last3=FitzSimmons|first3=N. N.|last4=Robertson|first4=J.|date=2009-12-16|title=DNA detective: a review of molecular approaches to wildlife forensics|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12024-009-9131-7|journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=180–194|doi=10.1007/s12024-009-9131-7|issn=1547-769X}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as rhinoceroses, lions, and African elephants. In order to distinguish which species is which, [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]], or mitochondrial DNA, is the most used [[genetic marker]] because it's easier to [[DNA profiling|type]] from highly decomposed and processed tissue compared to [[nuclear DNA]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Randi|first=E|date=2000|editor-last=Baker|editor-first=A. J.|others=Malden: Blackwell Science|title=Mitochondrial DNA|url=|journal=Molecular methods in ecology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the mitochondrial DNA has multiple copies per cell,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is another reason it's frequently used. When nuclear DNA is used, certain segments of the strands are amplified in order to compare those to segments of mitochondrial DNA. This comparison is used to figure out related genes and species proximity since distant relatives of animals are closer in proximity in the gene tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandamme|first=A|date=2003|editor-last=Salemi M., Vandamme A.|others=New York: Cambridge University Press|title=Basic concepts of molecular evolution|url=|journal=The phylogenetic handbook. A practical approach to DNA and protein phylogeny.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, the comparison process demands precision because mistakes can easily be made due to genes evolving and [[Mutation|mutating]] in the evolution of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maddison|first=W.

&lt;u&gt;Determination of geographic origin:&lt;/u&gt; Determining the origin of a certain species aids research in population numbers and [[Data lineage|lineage data]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] studies are most often used to find the broad geographic area of which a species reside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avise|first=J.C.|last2=Arnold|first2=J.|last3=Martin Bal|first3=I.R.|last4=Bermingham|first4=E.|last5=Lamb|first5=T.|last6=Neigel|first6=J.E.|date=1987|title=Intraspecific phylogeography: the mitochondrial DNA bridge between population genetics and systematics.|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=18|pages=489–522|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.18.1.489|pmid=|access-date=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in California seahorses were being sold for traditional medicinal purposes and the phylogenetic data of those seahorses led researchers to find their origin and from which population they came from and what species they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.G.|last2=Cribbs|first2=J.E.|last3=Fienberg|first3=H.G.|last4=Hulburd|first4=G.C.|last5=Katz|first5=L.S.|last6=Palumbi|first6=S.R.|authorlink6=Stephen R.

=== Domestic animal forensics ===
Domestic animals such as dogs and cats can be utilized to help solve criminal cases. These can include homicides, sexual assaults, or robberies. DNA evidence from dogs alone have helped over 20 criminal cases in Great Britain and the U.S. since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halverson|first=J.|last2=Basten|first2=C.|date=2005|title=A PCR multiplex and database for forensic DNA identification of dogs.|url=|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|edition=2|volume=50|pages=352–363|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only a few laboratories though that are able to process and analyze evidence or data from domestic animals.&lt;ref&gt;International Society for Animal Genetics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4970">'''Twenty-Four Elders''' appear in the [[Book of Revelation]] (4:4) of the [[Christian]] [[Bible]].

Saint John described the scene,
:before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal... round about... were four beasts full of eyes... The four and twenty elders fall down before him... and worship him that liveth for ever and ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=1149&amp;tabview=work The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne: Description]. [[Tate]]. Retrieved on November 05, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TJ9FXO1bt8C&amp;pg=PA26|p=26|title=Bible Textionary on Revelation|isbn=9781572585164|author1=Vining|first1=Noble|date=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hall of initiation ==
[[File:The Four and Twenty Elders (William Blake).jpg|thumb|''The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne'', c. 1803–5. [[William Blake]], [[Tate]]. 354 x 293 mm.]]

In the centre of a huge hall is placed a throne: round about the Throne are four and twenty seats on which sit four and twenty Elders, robed in white and wearing crowns of gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienvr_jFYAEC|p=2902|title=Complete Evangelical Parallel Bible-PR-KJV/NKJV/NIV/NLT|isbn=9781598569506|author1=Bibles|first1=Hendrickson|date=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Assembly is introduced the Lamb that is to be initiated. In front of the Throne are four remarkable beasts ([[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]]): one of them is like a lion, another resembles an eagle, the third has the appearance of a calf, and the fourth has the face of a man. These beasts have six wings each, and are full of eyes all over; and they rest not night and day, but keep on blessing the One on the Throne.

== Interpretation ==
The word "Elder" in the majority of places where it is used in the Scriptures means the representative head of a city, family, tribe or nation, so the "Four and Twenty Elders" are representative of the redeemed human race. But why 24 Elders? Twenty-four is the number of the Priestly Courses as given in 1. Chron. 24:1-19. When David distributed the Priests into "Courses" he found there were 24 Heads of the Priestly families, and these 24 Heads he made representative of the WHOLE PRIESTHOOD. As the "Elders" are representative of both the Old and New Testament Saints, and the Old Testament Saints are represented by the Twelve Tribes of Israel, and the New Testament Saints' by the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, they together make up 24 representative characters. This distinction is clearly brought out in the description of the New Jerusalem, where the 12 Foundation Stones are named after the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, and the 12 Gates after the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Rev. 21:10-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/tbr/tbr022.htm|title=The Book of Revelation: III. The Things Which Shall Be Hereafter: 3. The Four and Twenty Elders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegorical interpretation ==
[[Champat Rai Jain]], a 20th-century Jain writer claimed that the "Four and Twenty Elders" mentioned in the [[Christian Bible]] are "Twenty-four Jain ''[[Tirthankara]]s''".{{sfn|Jain|1930|p=78}} In his book, Jainism Christianity and Science, he wrote:{{quote|Briefly, the beasts represent the different kinds of souls that are embodied in the four elements (of matter), namely, the earth-bodied (represented by the lion, since he walks on earth), the air-bodied (represented by the eagle who flies in the air), the water-bodied (represented by the calf, which here is the young of the sea-mammals), and the fire-bodied (represented by the sun which is painted as the face of a man). Wings are a symbol for time, since it flies; and the number six is descriptive of the six ''aras'' (spokes) or a half-cycle in which four and twenty ''Tirthamkaras'' appear and preach the Truth. Plainly put, the significance of the secret teaching is only this that Life is Divine, and its divinity is manifested most perfectly and fully in the case of four and twenty ''Tirihamkaras'', who appear in a half-cycle of time, consisting of six aras, and preach the Noble Truth to and for the benefit of the souls embodied in material bodies.{{sfn|Jain|1930|p=78-79}}}}

In [[architecture]],  a '''gargoyle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɑr|ɡ|ɔɪ|l}}) is a carved or formed [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesque]]&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|6–8}} with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side of a building, thereby preventing rainwater from running down [[masonry]] walls and eroding the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between. Architects often used multiple gargoyles on a building to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to minimize the potential damage from a rainstorm. A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater typically exits through the open mouth. Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastical animal because the length of the gargoyle determines how far water is directed from the wall. When [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[flying buttress]]es were used, [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] were sometimes cut into the buttress to divert water over the aisle walls.&lt;ref name="Wonderopolis"&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is a Gargoyle? |url=https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/what-is-a-gargoyle |website=Wonderopolis |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term originates from the [[French language|French]] ''gargouille,'' which in English is likely to mean "throat" or is otherwise known as the "gullet";&lt;ref name="Hargreaves 1990 p. 51" /&gt;&lt;ref name="American Heritage Dictionary" /&gt; cf. [[Latin]] ''gurgulio, gula, gargula'' ("gullet" or "throat") and similar words derived from the root ''gar,'' "to swallow", which represented the gurgling sound of water (e.g., [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''garganta,'' "throat"; ''gárgola,'' "gargoyle"). It is also connected to the French verb ''gargariser,'' which shares a Latin root with the verb "gargle"&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary" /&gt; and is likely imitative in origin.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 2015" /&gt; The [[Italian language|Italian]] word for gargoyle is ''doccione'' or ''gronda sporgente,''  an architecturally precise phrase which means "protruding gutter. (Italian also uses ''gargolla'' o ''garguglia'', when it has a grotesque shape)

When not constructed as a waterspout and only serving an ornamental or artistic function, the correct term for such a sculpture is a [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesque]], chimera, or [[Boss (architecture)|boss]]. There are also regional variations, such as the [[hunky punk]]. Just as with bosses and chimeras, gargoyles are said to frighten off and protect those that it guards, such as a church, from any evil or harmful spirits.

== Legend of the Gargouille ==
A French legend that sprang up around the name of [[Romanus of Rouen|St. Romanus]] ({{lang-fr|Romain}}; [[floruit|fl.]] {{Circa}} 631 – 641 AD), the former chancellor of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] king [[Clotaire II]] who was made [[bishop of Rouen]], relates how he delivered the country around Rouen from a monster called ''[[Gargouille]]'' or ''Goji''.&lt;ref name="Butler Thurston Attwater 1956 p. 183" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbermann Pace Pallen Shahan 1913 p. 209" /&gt;  La Gargouille is said to have been the typical dragon with bat-like wings, a long neck, and the ability to breathe fire from its mouth.  Multiple versions of the story are given, either that St. Romanus subdued the creature with a crucifix, or he captured the creature with the help of the only volunteer, a condemned man. In each, the monster is led back to Rouen and burned, but its head and neck would not burn due to being tempered by its own fire breath. The head was then mounted on the walls of the newly built church to scare off evil spirits, and used for protection.&lt;ref name="Cipa 2009" /&gt; In commemoration of St. Romain, the Archbishops of Rouen were granted the right to set a prisoner free on the day that the [[reliquary]] of the saint was carried in procession (see details at [[Rouen]]).&lt;ref name="Hodder 1881 p. 46" /&gt;&lt;ref name="British Archaeological Association 1939 p. 361" /&gt;

== History ==
The term ''gargoyle'' is most often applied to [[medieval]] work, but throughout all ages, some means of water diversion, when not conveyed in gutters, was adopted. In [[Ancient Egypt]]ian architecture, gargoyles showed little variation, typically in the form of a lion's head.&lt;ref name="Clarke Engelbach 1930" /&gt; Similar lion-mouthed water spouts were also seen on [[Greek temple]]s, carved or modelled in the [[marble sculpture|marble]] or [[terracotta]] [[cymatium]] of the [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]].&lt;ref name="Dinsmoor Anderson 1950" /&gt; An excellent example of this are the 39 remaining lion-headed water spouts on the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]].  Originally, it had 102 gargoyles or spouts, but due to the heavy weight (they were crafted from marble), many snapped off and had to be replaced.&lt;ref name="Willemsen 1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swaddling 1980" /&gt;

Many medieval cathedrals included gargoyles and chimeras.&lt;ref name="Fudgé 2016 p. 91" /&gt; According to French architect and author [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], himself one of the great producers of gargoyles in the 19th century,&lt;ref name="Hourihane 2012 p. 642" /&gt; the earliest known medieval gargoyles appear on [[Laon Cathedral]] c. 1200–1220.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016 p. 248" /&gt; One of the more famous examples is the gargoyles of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. Although most have grotesque features, the term gargoyle has come to include all types of images. Some gargoyles were depicted as monks, or combinations of real animals and people, many of which were humorous. Unusual animal mixtures, or chimeras, did not act as rainspouts and are more properly called grotesques. They serve as ornamentation but are now popularly called gargoyles.

Both ornamented and unornamented water spouts projecting from roofs at parapet level were a common device used to shed rainwater from buildings until the early 18th century. From that time, more and more buildings used drainpipes to carry the water from the [[Rain gutter|guttering]] roof to the ground and only very few buildings using gargoyles were constructed.  This was because some people found them frightening, and sometimes heavy ones fell off, causing damage. In 1724, the London Building Act passed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] made the use of downpipes compulsory on all new construction.&lt;ref name="Holy Horrors" /&gt;

== Catholic Church ==
The primary use of the gargoyle was to illustrate [[evil]] through the form of the gargoyle,{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} while another theory posits that grotesques in architecture were [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] devices.&lt;ref name="Tschen-Emmons 2015 p. 72" /&gt; In the 12th century, before the use of gargoyles as rainspouts, [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard of Clairvaux]] was famous for speaking out against gargoyles carved on the walls of his monastery's cloister:&lt;ref name="Di Renzo 1995 p. 1" /&gt;

{{quotation|What are these fantastic monsters doing in the cloisters before the eyes of the brothers as they read? What is the meaning of these unclean monkeys, these strange savage lions, and monsters? To what purpose are here placed these creatures, half beast, half man, or these spotted tigers? I see several bodies with one head and several heads with one body. Here is a quadruped with a serpent's head, there a fish with a quadruped's head, then again an animal half horse, half goat... Surely if we do not blush for such absurdities, we should at least regret what we have spent on them.&lt;ref name="Leclercq 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nathan 1961 p. 74" /&gt;
}}
According to Lester Burbank Bridaham, writing in ''Gargoylaes, Chimeres and the Grotesque in French Gothic Sculpture'', "There is much symbolism in the sculpture of the Gothic period; but we must be wary of reading in too much meaning."&lt;ref name="Bridaham 1930 p. xii" /&gt;
{{Clear}}

== Animal ==
The [[ancient Egypt]]ians, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] all used animal-shaped waterspouts.&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|11}} During the 12th Century, when gargoyles appeared in Europe, the Roman Catholic Church was growing stronger and converting many new people.  Most of the population at this time was illiterate, so images were very important to convey ideas.  Many early gargoyles depicted some version of a dragon, especially in France.  In addition to serving as spouts for water, the gaping mouths of these gargoyles evoked the fearsome destructiveness of these legendary beasts, reminding the laity of the need for the church's protection.&lt;ref name="Varner 2008" /&gt;

Human qualities were sometimes ascribed to specific animals—that is, the animals were [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]]. This was especially common for pagans, and using these ideas helped conversion to Catholicism. Some animals (such as the [[rhinoceros]] and the [[hippopotamus]]) were unknown in western Europe during the Middle Ages, so gargoyles of these species (such as the ones at [[Laon Cathedral]]) are modern gargoyles and therefore did not have symbolic meaning in Medieval times.&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|20}}

The '''Hussain Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry''', ICCBS, widely known as HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry, is an [[Applied science|advanced]] [[Research institute| research center]] in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh province|Sindh Province]] of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry"&gt;{{Cite web   | last =HEJ-RIC    | first =HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry   | authorlink =   | coauthors =    | title =History of HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry | work =    | publisher =HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry   | url =http://www.iccs.edu/hej/index.php   | doi =    | accessdate=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Prof. Salimuzzaman Siddiqui established a postgraduate institute of chemistry in the department of Chemistry, University of Karachi. Dr. Atta ur Rahman joined the Institute later on after obtaining Ph.D. from the Kings College, Cambridge University, later he accepted a 4-year assignment as a Fellow of Kings College, Cambridge University. Currently the institute is led by Prof. Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary as the director of the ICCBS. The HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry (HEJRIC) oversees Pakistan’s largest doctoral program in a single field of interest. The main areas of student training and research include natural product, protein and synthetic organic chemistry, computational medicinal chemistry, pharmacology and plant biotechnology. Specific areas of research relate largely to pharmacological studies of novel natural products and protein chemistry. 

==Overview==
On the retirement of Professor [[Salimuzzaman Siddiqui]] (FRS) as Chairman PCSIR, his services were taken up by the University of Karachi and a "Postgraduate Institute of Chemistry" was established under his Directorship in 1967 in a wing of the Department of Chemistry. PCSIR provided the services of some of its staff (including Dr. Viqar Uddin Ahmad and Dr. Zafar H. Zaidi) and furniture during the initial phase of the establishment of this institute. Dr. Atta ur Rahman joined the Institute in March 1969 after obtaining Ph.D. from the Kings College, Cambridge University, later he accepted a 4-year assignment as a Fellow of Kings College, Cambridge University. He was then sent by Cambridge University to the University of Karachi during 1971-74 to assist in the setting up of a modern postgraduate institute of chemistry, and he brought with him donations of gas chromatograph, balances and a combustion microanalyser from Cambridge University.
Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman succeeded in obtaining grants to acquire a new mass and NMR spectrometers, both of which were installed in 1973, within a year of his return to Pakistan. He was appointed as the Co-Director in 1977. He succeeded in winning several major projects for the institute from the West, which have transformed the institute into the finest center in Asia and one of the best in the world in the field of Natural Product Chemistry. A generous donation was offered to the University for the Institute by the leading philanthropist/industrialist Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal on behalf of the Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation in 1976, the largest donation at that time in the history of the country. The Institute was accordingly named as "Husein Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry", in the memory of late Mr. Husein Ebrahim Jamal.
The efforts of Professor Dr. W. Voelter of Tuebingen University, Germany, deserve a special praise since the initial grant of 2.3 million DM from the Republic of Germany was largely due to his untiring efforts, and collaborative researches continue with his group till today.
Professor Atta-ur-Rahman was appointed as the Director in January 1990, while Professor Viqar Uddin Ahmad took over as Co-Director in 1990. In 2000, Professor Bina S. Siddiqui was appointed as the Co-Director on the retirement of Professor Ahmad, while in 2002 Professor Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary was given the responsibilities of the Director (Acting) of ICCBS and Co-Director of Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research. In September 2008, he was appointed as the Director of the ICCBS institutions. During last ten years, the institute has gone through a rapid and unprecedented expansion, both in terms of infrastructure development and academic programs, while maintaining the highest quality in research and student training.
The institute has organized a number of major international conferences and symposia on various aspects of Natural Product Chemistry, Spectroscopy and Protein Chemistry. The institute had the distinction of hosting the 19th IUPAC Symposium on Natural Product Chemistry in January 1994 in which over 500 scientists from 52 countries, including 4 Nobel Laureates participated.
Additionally the Institute has also been selected as one of the three library centers of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS). The H.E.J. Institute has been designated as the W.H.O. Center for Pesticide Analysis for the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The institute is also a member of the IUCN-International, WAITRO, and COMSATS. More recently the institute is designated as the OIC Center of Excellence in Chemical Sciences. In 2001, the H.E.J. Research Institute became a constituent institution of the International Center for Chemical Sciences (later named as International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences).
In 2004, the H.E.J. Research Institute received the most prestigious IDB (Islamic Development Bank) prize for the best science institution in the entire Islamic world. Recently, the IDB awarded the best science institution again to the H.E.J. Research Institute (second time), an unprecedented honor to any science institution in OIC region.
In August 2003, an Industrial Analytical Center was established as the service wing of H. E. J. Institute. Third World Center (TWC) Laboratory complex was formally inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2005 as an extension of the H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry. The building of TWC was renamed as Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman Laboratories by the Executive Board in 2011, in recognition of the outstanding services of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman (FRS) who is now serving the ICCBS institution as the Patron-in-chief.
Molecular medicine is an emerging new field, which deals with the understanding of the molecular basis of diseases and then developing appropriate strategies for their early diagnosis, management and elimination. Knowledge of human biology and disease mechanism at molecular level is the most important step in developing effective disease prevention and treatment. In the year 2004, the Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD) was established through a generous donation and patronage of Ms. Nadira Panjwani (Chairperson, Dr. Panjwani Memorial Trust) in the memory of her beloved father, Dr. Mohammad Hussain Panjwani, a leading scholar and philanthropist. The main objective of the center is to train highly qualified manpower in the emerging new fields of molecular medicine and drug development. The academicians, clinicians and pharmaceutical researchers are brought together to translate basic scientific discoveries into new therapies, vaccines and diagnostic tests. 
Late Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal, Chairman Ebrahim Jamal Foundation, continuing his patronage to the Institute, established the Latif Ebrahim Jamal National Science Information Center in 2005. The beautiful building of this one of the largest paperless libraries of the region was constructed under the direct supervision of Mr. Aziz Latif Jamal S.I. (Current Chairman Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation), able and committed son of (Late) Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal.

== Key elements ==

To understand knowledge ecology as a productive operation, it is helpful to focus on the knowledge ecosystem that lies at its core. Like natural ecosystems, these knowledge ecosystems have inputs, throughputs and outputs operating in open exchange relationship with their environments. Multiple layers and levels of systems may be integrated to form a complete ecosystem. These systems consist of interlinked knowledge resources, databases, human experts, and artificial knowledge agents that collectively provide an online knowledge for anywhere anytime performance of organizational tasks. The availability of knowledge on an anywhere-anytime basis blurs the line between learning and work performance. Both can occur simultaneously and sometimes interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge ecosystems operate on two types of technological core – one dealing with the content or substantive knowledge of the industry, and the other involving computer hardware and software and telecommunications, that serve as the "procedural technology" of operations. These technologies provide knowledge management capabilities that are far beyond individual human capacity. In the business education and training context substantive technology would be knowledge of different business functions, tasks, processes products, R&amp;D, markets, finances and relations. Research, codification, documentation, publication and electronic sharing create this substantive knowledge. [[Communications]] between computers and among humans permit knowledge ecosystems to be interactive and responsive within the wider community and within its subsystems.

&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational knowledge resides in a complex network of individuals, systems and procedures both inside and outside the organization. This network is established in the form of social and technological relationships. The relationships reflect vital interests and mutual histories. The elements of the network are dependent on each other for resources and mutual survival. Accessing and using this knowledge network involves understanding and maintaining the integrity of underlying relationships.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational knowledge is converted into economic value through processes that involve action. These could be cognitive actions such as learning or deciding, or physical actions such as preparing a meal or writing a check, and social actions such as organizing or entertaining. Organizational tasks most often require all these and other types of actions to occur in a linked way for value to be created. They occur in the physical spaces, electronic spaces, economic transactions, and communicative exchanges of knowledge tasks. They contribute to achievement of organizational goals.

'''Leon Battista Alberti''' ({{IPA-it|leˈon batˈtista alˈbɛrti|lang}}; February 14, 1404 – April 25, 1472) was an Italian [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] author, artist, architect, poet, [[Catholic priest|priest]], [[linguistics|linguist]], philosopher and [[cryptography|cryptographer]]; he epitomised the [[Polymath|Renaissance Man]]. Although he is often characterized exclusively as an architect, as James Beck has observed,&lt;ref&gt;James Beck, "Leon Battista Alberti and the 'Night Sky' at San Lorenzo", ''Artibus et Historiae'' '''10''', No. 19 (1989:9–35), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; "to single out one of Leon Battista's 'fields' over others as somehow functionally independent and self-sufficient is of no help at all to any effort to characterize Alberti's extensive explorations in the fine arts."  Although Alberti is known mostly for being an artist, he was also a mathematician of many sorts and made great advances to this field during the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mathematical Works of Leon Battista Alberti |last=Williams |first=Kim |publisher=Birkhauser Verlag AG |date=August 27, 2010 |isbn=978-3-0346-0473-4 |location= |pages=1 |quote= |via=Duke Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti's life was described in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]].

==Life==
Leon Battista Alberti was born in 1404 in [[Genoa]]. His mother is not known, and his father was a wealthy Florentine who had been exiled from his own city, allowed to return in 1428. Alberti was sent to boarding school in Padua, then studied Law at [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name=MS&gt;Melissa Snell, ''[http://historymedren.about.com/od/awho/a/bio_alberti.htm Leon Battsta Alberti]'', About.com: Medieval History.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived for a time in [[Florence]], then travelled to Rome in 1431 where he took [[holy orders]] and entered the service of the papal court.&lt;ref name=IL/&gt; During this time he studied the [[Ancient Roman architecture|ancient ruins]], which excited his interest in architecture and strongly influenced the form of the buildings that he designed.&lt;ref name=IL&gt;''The Renaissance:a Illustrated Encyclopedia'', Octopus (1979) {{ISBN|0706408578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti was gifted in many ways. He was tall, strong and a fine athlete who could ride the wildest horse and jump over a man's head.&lt;ref name="Renaissance Italy 1860"/&gt; He distinguished himself as a writer while he was still a child at school, and by the age of twenty had written a play which was successfully passed off as a genuine piece of Classical literature.&lt;ref name=MS/&gt; In 1435, he began his first major written work, ''[[De Pictura|Della pittura]],'' which was inspired by the burgeoning pictorial art in Florence in the early 15th century. In this work he analyses the nature of painting and explores the elements of perspective, composition and colour.&lt;ref name=IL/&gt;

In 1438 he began to focus more on architecture and was encouraged by the Marchese [[Leonello d'Este]] of Ferrara, for whom he built a small [[triumphal arch]] to support an equestrian statue of Leonello's father.&lt;ref name=MS/&gt; In 1447 he became the architectural advisor to [[Pope Nicholas V]] and was involved with several projects at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].&lt;ref name=MS/&gt;

His first major architectural commission was in 1446 for the facade of the [[Rucellai Palace]] in Florence. This was followed in 1450 by a commission from [[Sigismondo Malatesta]] to transform the Gothic church of San Francesco in [[Rimini]] into a memorial chapel, the [[Tempio Malatestiano]].&lt;ref name=IL/&gt; In Florence, he designed the upper parts of the facade for the Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]], famously bridging the nave and lower aisles with two ornately inlaid scrolls, solving a visual problem and setting a precedent to be followed by architects of churches for four hundred years.&lt;ref name=AD49&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ed., ''Leon Baptiste Alberti'', Architectul Design, Vol 49 No 5-6, London&lt;/ref&gt; In 1452, he completed  ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'', a treatise on architecture, using as its basis the work of [[Vitruvius]] and influenced by the archaeological remains of Rome. The work was not published until 1485.  It was followed in 1464 by his less influential work, ''De statua'', in which he examines sculpture.&lt;ref name=IL/&gt; Alberti's only known sculpture is a self-portrait medallion, sometimes attributed to [[Pisanello]].
[[File:Palazzo Rucellai.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palazzo Rucellai]]]]
Alberti was employed to design two churches in [[Mantua]], [[San Sebastiano (Mantua)|San Sebastiano]], which was never completed, and for which Alberti's intention can only be speculated, and the [[Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua|Basilica of Sant'Andrea]]. The design for the latter church was completed in 1471, a year before Alberti's death, but was brought to completion and is his most significant work.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

As an artist, Alberti distinguished himself from the ordinary craftsman, educated in workshops. He was a [[humanism|humanist]], and part of the rapidly expanding entourage of intellectuals and artisans supported by the courts of the princes and lords of the time. Alberti, as a member of noble family and as part of the Roman [[curia]], had special status. He was a welcomed guest at the [[House of Este|Este]] court in [[Ferrara]], and in [[Urbino]] he spent part of the hot-weather season with the [[condottieri|soldier-prince]] [[Federico III da Montefeltro]]. The [[Duke of Urbino]] was a shrewd military commander, who generously spent money on the [[patronage]] of art. Alberti planned to dedicate his [[treatise]] on architecture to his friend.&lt;ref name="Renaissance Italy 1860"/&gt;

Among Alberti's smaller studies, pioneering in their field, were a treatise in [[cryptography]], ''[[Alberti cipher|De componendis cifris]]'', and the first Italian [[grammar]]. With the Florentine cosmographer [[Paolo Toscanelli]] he collaborated in astronomy, a close science to geography at that time, and produced a small Latin work on geography, ''Descriptio urbis Romae'' (''The Panorama of the City of Rome''). Just a few years before his death, Alberti completed ''De iciarchia'' (''On Ruling the Household''), a dialogue about Florence during the [[Medici]] rule.

Alberti, having taken holy orders, remained unmarried all his life. He loved animals and had a pet dog, a mongrel, for whom he wrote a [[panegyric]], (''Canis'').&lt;ref name="Renaissance Italy 1860"/&gt; Vasari describes him as "an admirable citizen, a man of culture.... a friend of talented men, open and courteous with everyone. He always lived honourably and like the gentleman he was."&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;Vasari, ''The Lives of the Artists''&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti died in Rome on April 25, 1472 at the age of 68.

==Publications==
{{further|Mathematics and architecture}}

Alberti regarded mathematics as the common ground of art and the sciences. "To make clear my exposition in writing this brief commentary on painting," Alberti began his treatise, ''Della Pittura'' (On Painting), "I will take first from the mathematicians those things with which my subject is concerned."&lt;ref&gt;Leone Battista Alberti, On Painting, editor John Richard Spencer, 1956, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Della pittura'' (also known in Latin as ''[[De Pictura]]'') relied in its scientific content on classical [[optics]] in determining [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] as a geometric instrument of artistic and architectural representation.  Alberti was well-versed in the sciences of his age. His knowledge of [[optics]] was connected to the handed-down long-standing tradition of the ''Kitab al-manazir'' (''The Optics''; ''De aspectibus'') of the Arab polymath [[Alhazen]] ([[Ibn al-Haytham]], d. c. 1041), which was mediated by Franciscan optical workshops of the 13th-century ''Perspectivae'' traditions of scholars such as [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Peckham]] and [[Witelo]] (similar influences are also traceable in the third commentary of [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], ''Commentario terzo'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], "A Philosophical Perspective on [[Alhazen]]’s [[Optics]]," ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'', vol. 15, issue 2 (2005), pp. 189–218 ([[Cambridge University Press]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Archtitecture of Leon Battista Alberti title page.jpg|thumb|English title page of the first edition of Giacomo Leoni's translation of Alberti's ''De Re Aedificatoria'' (1452). The book is bilingual, with the Italian version being printed on the left and the English version printed on the right.]]
In both ''Della pittura'' and ''De statua'', Alberti stressed that "all steps of learning should be sought from nature."&lt;ref name=kirjasto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/alberti.htm |title=Leon Battista Alberti |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210175324/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/alberti.htm |archivedate=February 10, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate aim of an artist is to imitate nature. Painters and sculptors strive "through by different skills, at the same goal, namely that as nearly as possible the work they have undertaken shall appear to the observer to be similar to the real objects of nature."&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; However, Alberti did not mean that artists should imitate nature objectively, as it is, but the artist should be especially attentive to beauty, "for in painting beauty is as pleasing as it is necessary."&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; The work of art is, according to Alberti, so constructed that it is impossible to take anything away from it or add anything to it, without impairing the beauty of the whole. Beauty was for Alberti "the harmony of all parts in relation to one another," and subsequently "this concord is realized in a particular number, proportion, and arrangement demanded by harmony." Alberti's thoughts on harmony were not new—they could be traced back to Pythagoras—but he set them in a fresh context, which fit in well with the contemporary aesthetic discourse.

In Rome, Alberti had plenty of time to study its ancient sites, ruins, and objects. His detailed observations, included in his ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'' (1452, ''On the Art of Building''),&lt;ref name=DeRe&gt;Alberti, Leon Battista. On ''the Art of Building in Ten Books''. Trans. Leach, N., Rykwert, J., &amp; Tavenor, R. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; were patterned after the ''De architectura'' by the Roman architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 46–30 BC). The work was the first architectural treatise of the Renaissance. It covered a wide range of subjects, from history to town planning, and engineering to the philosophy of beauty. ''De re aedificatoria,'' a large and expensive book, was not fully published until 1485, after which it became a major reference for architects.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., [http://www.palladiancenter.org/predecessors.html Palladio's Literary Predecessors]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book was written "not only for craftsmen but also for anyone interested in the noble arts," as Alberti put it.&lt;ref name=DeRe/&gt; Originally published in Latin, the first Italian edition came out in 1546. and the standard Italian edition by [[Cosimo Bartoli]] was published in 1550. Pope [[Nicholas V]], to whom Alberti dedicated the whole work, dreamed of rebuilding the city of Rome, but he managed to realize only a fragment of his visionary plans. Through his book, Alberti opened up his theories and ideals of the Florentine Renaissance to architects, scholars and others.

Alberti wrote ''I Libri della famiglia''—which discussed education, marriage, household management, and money—in the Tuscan dialect. The work was not printed until 1843. Like [[Erasmus]] decades later, Alberti stressed the need for a reform in education. He noted that "the care of very young children is women's work, for nurses or the mother," and that at the earliest possible age children should be taught the alphabet.&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; With great hopes, he gave the work to his family to read, but in his autobiography Alberti confesses that "he could hardly avoid feeling rage, moreover, when he saw some of his relatives openly ridiculing both the whole work and the author's futile enterprise along it."&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; ''Momus'', written between 1443 and 1450, was a misogynist comedy about the Olympian gods. It has been considered as a [[roman à clef]]—[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] has been identified in some sources as Pope Eugenius IV and Pope Nicholas V. Alberti borrowed many of its characters from [[Lucian]], one of his favorite Greek writers. The name of its hero, Momus, refers to the Greek word for blame or criticism. After being expelled from heaven, [[Momus]], the god of mockery, is eventually castrated. Jupiter and the other gods come down to earth also, but they return to heaven after Jupiter breaks his nose in a great storm.

Alberti did not concern himself with the practicalities of building, and very few of his major works were brought to completion.  As a designer and a student of Vitruvius and of ancient Roman remains, he grasped the nature of column and lintel architecture, from the visual rather than structural viewpoint, and correctly employed the [[Classical orders]], unlike his contemporary, [[Brunelleschi]], who utilised the Classical column and pilaster in a free interpretation. Among Alberti's concerns was the social effect of architecture, and to this end he was very well aware of the cityscape.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt; This is demonstrated by his inclusion, at the Rucellai Palace, of a continuous bench for seating at the level of the basement.

In Rome he was employed by [[Pope Nicholas V]] for the restoration of the [[Roman aqueduct]] of [[Acqua Vergine]], which [[debouches|debouched]] into a simple basin designed by Alberti, which was swept away later by the Baroque [[Trevi Fountain]].

Some studies&lt;ref&gt;D. Mazzini, S. Simone, ''Villa Medici a Fiesole. Leon Battista Alberti e il prototipo di villa rinascimentale'', Centro Di, Firenze 2004&lt;/ref&gt; propose that the [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]] might owe its design to Alberti, not to Michelozzo, and that it then became the prototype of the [[Renaissance]] [[villa]]. This hilltop dwelling, commissioned by [[Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]], [[Cosimo il Vecchio]]'s second son, with its view over the city, may be the very first example of a Renaissance villa: that is to say it follows the Albertian criteria for rendering a country dwelling a "villa suburbana". Under this perspective the Villa Medici in Fiesole could therefore be considered the "muse" for numerous other buildings, not only in the Florence area, which from the end of the 15th century onwards find inspiration and creative innovation here.

===Tempio Malatestiano, Rimini===
The [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in [[Rimini]] (1447, 1453–60)&lt;ref name=Borsi&gt;Franco Borsi. ''Leon Battista Alberti''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; is the rebuilding of a Gothic church.  The facade, with its dynamic play of forms, was left incomplete.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

===Façade of Palazzo Rucellai===
The design of the façade of the [[Palazzo Rucellai]] (1446–51) was one of several commissions for the Rucellai family.&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; The design overlays a grid of shallow pilasters and cornices in the Classical manner onto rusticated masonry, and is surmounted by a heavy cornice. The inner courtyard has [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns.  The palace set a standard in the use of Classical elements that is original in civic buildings in Florence, and greatly influenced later palazzi. The work was executed by [[Bernardo Rosselino]].&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

===Santa Maria Novella===
At [[Santa Maria Novella]], Florence, between (1448–70)&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; the upper facade was constructed to the design of Alberti. It was a challenging task, as the lower level already had three doorways and six [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] niches containing tombs and employing the polychrome marble typical of Florentine churches such as [[San Miniato al Monte]] and the [[Baptistery of Florence]]. The design also incorporates an [[rose window|ocular window]] which was already in place. Alberti introduced Classical features around the portico and spread the polychromy over the entire facade in a manner which includes Classical proportions and elements such as pilasters, cornices and a pediment in the Classical style, ornamented with a sunburst in tesserae, rather than sculpture. The best known feature of this typically aisled church is the manner in which Alberti has solved the problem of visually bridging the different levels of the central nave and much lower side aisles. He employed two large scrolls, which were to become a standard feature of Church facades in the later Renaissance, Baroque and Classical Revival buildings.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

===Pienza===
[[File:Pienza Piazza Pio II.JPG|thumb|upright= 1.5|Piazza Pio II in Pienza, looking towards the Palazzo Piccolomini]]
Alberti is considered to have been the consultant for the design of the Piazza Pio II, [[Pienza]]. The village, previously called Corsignano, was redesigned beginning around 1459.&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; It was the birthplace of Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, [[Pope Pius II]], in whose employ Alberti served.  Pius II wanted to use the village as a retreat but needed for it to reflect the dignity of his position.

The piazza is a [[trapezoid]] shape defined by four buildings, with a focus on Pienza Cathedral and passages on either side opening onto a landscape view. The principal residence, ''Palazzo Piccolomini'', is on the west side. It has three stories, articulated by pilasters and entablature courses, with a twin-lighted [[cross window]] set within each bay. This structure is similar to Alberti's [[Palazzo Rucellai]] in Florence and other later palaces. Noteworthy is the internal court of the palazzo. The back of the palace, to the south, is defined by [[loggia]] on all three floors that overlook an enclosed [[Italian Renaissance garden]] with ''[[Giardino all'italiana]]'' era modifications, and spectacular views into the distant landscape of the [[Val d'Orcia]] and Pope Pius's beloved Mount Amiata beyond.  Below this garden is a vaulted stable that had stalls for 100 horses. The design, which radically transformed the center of the town, included a palace for the pope, a church, a town hall and a building for the bishops who would accompany the Pope on his trips. Pienza is considered an early example of Renaissance urban planning.

===Sant' Andrea, Mantua===
The [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|Basilica of Sant'Andrea]], [[Mantua]] was begun in 1471,&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; the year before Alberti's death. It was brought to completion and is his most significant work employing the [[triumphal arch]] motif, both for its facade and interior, and influencing many works that were to follow.&lt;ref name= AD49/&gt; Alberti perceived the role of architect as designer. Unlike [[Brunelleschi]], he had no interest in the construction, leaving the practicalities to builders and the oversight to others.&lt;ref name= AD49/&gt;

===Other buildings===
* [[San Sebastiano (Mantua)|San Sebastiano]], Mantua, (begun 1458)&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; the unfinished facade of which has promoted much speculation as to Alberti's intention&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

* The Tribune for [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze|Santissima Annunziata]], Florence (1470, completed with alterations, 1477)&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt;

==Painting==
[[Giorgio Vasari]], who argued that historical progress in art reached its peak in [[Michelangelo]], emphasized Alberti's scholarly achievements, not his artistic talents: "He spent his time finding out about the world and studying the proportions of antiquities; but above all, following his natural genius, he concentrated on writing rather than on applied work." &lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt; [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], who ironically called himself "an uneducated person" (''omo senza lettere''), followed Alberti in the view that painting is science. However, as a scientist Leonardo was more empirical than Alberti, who was a theorist and did not have similar interest in practice. Alberti believed in ideal beauty, but Leonardo filled his notebooks with observations on human proportions, page after page, ending with his famous drawing of the [[Vitruvian man]], a human figure related to a square and a circle.

In ''On Painting'', Alberti uses the expression "We Painters", but as a painter, or sculptor, he was a dilettante. "In painting Alberti achieved nothing of any great importance or beauty," wrote Vasari.&lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt; "The very few paintings of his that are extant are far from perfect, but this is not surprising since he devoted himself more to his studies than to draughtsmanship." [[Jacob Burckhardt]] portrayed Alberti in ''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy'' as a truly universal genius. "And Leonardo Da Vinci was to Alberti as the finisher to the beginner, as the master to the dilettante. Would only that Vasari's work were here supplemented by a description like that of Alberti! The colossal outlines of Leonardo's nature can never be more than dimly and distantly conceived."&lt;ref name="Renaissance Italy 1860"&gt;Jacob Burckhardt in [[s:The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy#Personality|''The Civilization of the Renaissance Italy'', 2.1]], 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti is said to be in Mantegna's great frescoes in the [[Camera degli Sposi]], the older man dressed in dark red clothes, who whispers in the ear of [[Ludovico III Gonzaga|Ludovico Gonzaga]], the ruler of Mantua.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} In Alberti's self-portrait, a large [[plaquette]], he is clothed as a Roman. To the left of his profile is a winged eye. On the reverse side is the question, ''Quid tum?'' (what then), taken from [[Virgil]]'s ''Eclogues'': "So what, if Amyntas is dark? (''quid tum si fuscus Amyntas?'') Violets are black, and hyacinths are black."{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Contributions==
[[File:Tempio malatestiano, ri, facciata, capitello.JPG|thumb|Detail of the facade of [[Tempio Malatestiano]]]]
Alberti made a variety of contributions to several fields:
* Alberti was the creator of a theory called "historia". In his treatise ''[[De pictura]]'' (1435) he explains the theory of the accumulation of people, animals, and buildings, which create harmony amongst each other, and "hold the eye of the learned and unlearned spectator for a long while with a certain sense of pleasure and emotion".  ''[[De pictura]]'' ("On Painting") contained the first scientific study of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. An Italian translation of ''De pictura'' (''Della pittura'') was published in 1436, one year after the original Latin version and addressed [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] in the preface. The Latin version had been dedicated to Alberti's humanist patron, Gianfrancesco Gonzaga of Mantua. He also wrote works on [sculpture], ''[[:it:De statua|De Statua]]''.
* Alberti used his artistic treatises to propound a new humanistic theory of art. He drew on his contacts with early Quattrocento artists such as Brunelleschi, Donatello and Ghiberti to provide a practical handbook for the renaissance artist.
* Alberti wrote an influential work on architecture, ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', which by the 16th century had been translated into Italian (by Cosimo Bartoli), French, Spanish and English. An English translation was by [[Giacomo Leoni]] in the early 18th century. Newer translations are now available.
* Whilst Alberti's treatises on painting and architecture have been hailed as the founding texts of a new form of art, breaking from the Gothic past, it is impossible to know the extent of their practical impact within his lifetime. His praise of the ''Calumny of Apelles'' led to several attempts to emulate it, including paintings by Botticelli and Signorelli. His stylistic ideals have been put into practice in the works of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Fra Angelico]]. But how far Alberti was responsible for these innovations and how far he was simply articulating the trends of the artistic movement, with which his practical experience had made him familiar, is impossible to ascertain.
* He was so skilled in [[Latin]] verse that a comedy he wrote in his twentieth year, entitled ''Philodoxius'', would later deceive the younger [[Aldus Manutius]], who edited and published it as the genuine work of 'Lepidus Comicus'.

[[File:Toscana24te.jpg|thumb|The upper storey of [[Santa Maria Novella]]]]
[[File:Santa Maria Novella (Florence) - 0851.jpg|thumb|One of the giant scrolls at Santa Maria Novella]]
* He has been credited with being the author, or alternatively the designer of the [[woodcut]] illustrations, of the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', a strange [[fantasy]] novel.&lt;ref&gt;Liane Lefaivre, ''Leon Battista Alberti's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili'', Cambridge: MIT Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apart from his treatises on the arts, Alberti also wrote: ''Philodoxus'' ("Lover of Glory", 1424), ''De commodis litterarum atque incommodis'' ("On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Literary Studies", 1429), ''Intercoenales'' ("Table Talk", c. 1429), ''Della famiglia'' ("On the Family", begun 1432) ''Vita S. Potiti'' ("Life of St. Potitus", 1433), ''De iure'' (On Law, 1437), ''Theogenius'' ("The Origin of the Gods", c. 1440), ''Profugorium ab aerumna'' ("Refuge from Mental Anguish",), ''Momus'' (1450) and ''De Iciarchia'' ("On the Prince", 1468). These and other works were translated and printed in Venice by the humanist [[Cosimo Bartoli]] in 1586.
* Alberti was an accomplished [[cryptography|cryptographer]] by the standard of his day, and invented the first [[polyalphabetic cipher]], which is now known as the [[Alberti cipher]], and machine-assisted encryption using his [[Alberti Cipher Disk|Cipher Disk]]. The polyalphabetic cipher was, at least in principle, for it was not properly used for several hundred years, the most significant advance in cryptography since before Julius Caesar's time. Cryptography historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] titles him the "Father of Western Cryptography", pointing to three significant advances in the field which can be attributed to Alberti: "the earliest Western exposition of cryptanalysis, the invention of polyalphabetic substitution, and the invention of enciphered code."{{cite book |author=David Kahn |title=The codebreakers: the story of secret writing |publisher=MacMillan |location=New York |year=1967}}
* According to Alberti himself, in a short autobiography written c. 1438 in Latin and in the third person, (many but not all scholars consider this work to be an autobiography) he was capable of "standing with his feet together, and springing over a man's head." The autobiography survives thanks to an 18th-century transcription by [[Antonio Muratori]]. Alberti also claimed that he "excelled in all bodily exercises; could, with feet tied, leap over a standing man; could in the great cathedral, throw a coin far up to ring against the vault; amused himself by taming wild horses and climbing mountains." Needless to say, many in the Renaissance promoted themselves in various ways and Alberti's eagerness to promote his skills should be understood, to some extent, within that framework. (This advice should be followed in reading the above information, some of which originates in this so-called autobiography.)
* Alberti claimed in his "autobiography" to be an accomplished musician and organist, but there is no hard evidence to support this claim. In fact, musical posers were not uncommon in his day (see the lyrics to the song ''Musica Son'', by Francesco Landini, for complaints to this effect.) He held the appointment of canon in the metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Church|church]] of [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], and thus – perhaps – had the leisure to devote himself to this art, but this is only speculation. Vasari also agreed with this.&lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt;
* He was also interested in the drawing of [[map]]s and worked with the [[astronomer]], astrologer, and [[cartographer]] [[Paolo Toscanelli]].
* In terms of Aesthetics Alberti is one of the first defining the work of art as imitation of nature, exactly as a selection of its most beautiful parts: "So let's take from nature what we are going to paint, and from nature we choose the most beautiful and worthy things"&lt;ref&gt;De Pictura, book III: Ergo semper quae picturi sumus, ea a natura sumamus, semperque ex his quaeque pulcherrima et dignissima deligamus.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">'''Libertarian anarchism''' may refer to:
* [[Anarchism]], a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies, usually considered a radical left-wing ideology
* [[Autarchism]], a political philosophy that upholds the principle of individual liberty, rejects compulsory government and supports the elimination of government in favor of ruling oneself and no other
* [[Free-market anarchism]], a political philosophy that advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property and open markets
** [[Agorism]], a revolutionary form of free-market anarchism that focuses on employing counter-economic activity to undermine the state

{{Italic title}}
'''''Man: Whence, How and Whither, A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation''''', published in 1913, is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] book compiled by the second president of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society (TS) - Adyar]], [[Annie Besant]], and by a TS member, [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Charles W. Leadbeater]].{{refn|group=note|According to [[WorldCat]], "18 editions published between 1913 and 1984 in English and held by 177 WorldCat member libraries worldwide."{{sfn|WorldCat}}}} The book is a study on early [[Round (Theosophy)|times]] on planetary chains, beginnings of early [[root races]], early [[civilization]]s and empires, and past lives of men.{{sfn|Lubelsky|2013|p=351}}{{refn|group=note|There were other collaborative authors [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] works, [[Occult Chemistry (book)|''Occult Chemistry'']] (1908) and ''The Lives of Alcyone'' (1924).{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=1013}}}}

== Introduction ==
[[File:Solar syst.jpg|thumb|left|400px|The seven Schemes of our [[Solar System]].{{refn|group=note|"At any one period of time only one of the rings in each Scheme will be active; each ring of each of these seven Schemes is composed of seven globes."{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=4}}}}]]
At the beginning of the book the authors wrote that "metaphysicians, ancient and modern, declare that Past, Present, and Future are ever simultaneously existent in the divine Consciousness, and are only successive as they come into manifestation, ''i.e.'', under Time which is verily the succession of states of consciousness." Hence, when a mystic turn the soul away from earth and focuses his attention upon the spirit – the soul may approach the "Memory of Nature", the personification in the material world of the "Thoughts of the [[Logos]]," the image, as it were, of "His Mind." There resides the Past in [[Akashic Records|ever-living records]].{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|pp=iv–v}}{{sfn|Cayce|1968}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=985}}{{sfn|Cerminara|1988}}{{sfn|Todeschi|1998}}{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=106–7}}

The authors say that "they, having been taught the method of gaining touch, but being subject to the difficulties involved in their uncompleted evolution, have done their best to observe and transmit, but are fully conscious of the many weaknesses which mar their work. Occasional help has been given to them by the [[Mahatma|Elder Brethren]]."{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=v}}

Leadbeater speculated that "the total number of souls, or [[Monad (philosophy)|Monads]],{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} making up humanity was sixty thousand million, the majority being out of incarnation at any given time."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=1010}} Thus [[reincarnation]]{{sfn|Fussell, Poutz|1911|p=408}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} had been one of the doctrines of the [[Theosophical Society]] almost from its beginnings.

Leadbeater wrote later that "the two hundred and fifty characters to whom names have been assigned are supposed to be less than one tenth of the whole".{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1924|loc=Foreword}} Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] said, "The series of incarnations showed these pioneers going through their own evolution from subhumans to worldly and spiritual leaders of the race."{{sfn|Godwin|2011|loc=Ch. 4}}

== Early root races ==

=== In Lemuria ===

In the chapter VII the authors describe in detail{{refn|group=note|"Leadbeater wrote elaborate descriptions of these things in a style of simplicity and clearness," — claimed Kuhn.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=329}}}} a remarkable Lemurian:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] there was some domestication of animals; the egg-headed Lemurian{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky stated that the Lemurian is "the first physical man which itself took place 18,000,000 years ago."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=46|Lubelsky|2013|2p=345}}}} was seen leading about a scaly monster, almost as unattractive as his master. Animals of all sorts were eaten raw – among some tribes human flesh was not despised – and creatures of the grade of our slugs, snails and worms, much larger than their degenerate descendants, were regarded with peculiar favor as toothsome morsels."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=105|Tillett|1986|2p=452}}{{refn|group=note|Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] wrote, "Leadbeater regularly adopts an archly humorous tone when dealing with disgusting habits, ugly people, or lowly human types."{{sfn|Godwin|2011|p=99}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== In Atlantis ===
In the chapter IX the authors wrote about [[Atlantis]] that "explosions of gas, floods and earthquakes" razed Ruta and Daitya, the great islands, left from the cataclysm of 200,000 B.C., and only the island of Poseidonis remained, the last vestige of the once grand continent of the Atlantis. These islands were lost in 75,025 B.C., Poseidonis survived to 9,564 B.C., when it also was devoured by the ocean.{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=132|Lubelsky|2013|2p=351}}

The authors assert in the chapter X of the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The immense growth of wealth and of luxury gradually undermined the most splendid civilization that the world has yet seen. Knowledge was prostituted to individual gain, and control over the powers of nature was turned from service to oppression. Hence Atlantis fell, despite the glory of its achievements and the might of its Empires."{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=139}}{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky claimed, "The civilization of the Atlanteans was greater even than that of the Egyptians. It is their degenerate descendants, the nation of [[Plato|Plato's]] Atlantis, which built the first Pyramids... The great Pyramid must have been built 78,000 years ago."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1pp=429, 432|Lubelsky|2013|2p=345}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== On the Moon chain ==
[[File:Seven chains.jpg|thumb|left|400px|The seven planetary chains and the five planes.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=5}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}}]]
Blavatsky wrote in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''  that the [[Moon]] "plays the largest and most important part, as well in the formation of the [[Earth]] itself, as in the peopling thereof with human beings". The "Lunar Monads" or Pitris, the progenitors of man, become in reality man himself.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=180}} A religious studies scholar Isaac Lubelsky stated that Besant and Leadbeater write in the book the chain of the Moon "was an evolutionary precursor of the chain of the planet Earth."{{sfn|Lubelsky|2013|p=351}}

In the chapter III the authors describe in detail how Sirius, Alcyone, Herakles and Mizar{{refn|group=note|[[Mizar (star)|Mizar]] — J. Nityananda (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}}} achieved individualization{{refn|group=note|"The divine life begins the evolution of consciousness, building for itself forms on the various planes, passing slowly through the elemental, mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, and finally reaching self-consciousness and individualization, when it passes into the human stage."{{sfn|Fussell, Poutz|1911|p=407}}}} and left the animal kingdom while living as lunar monkey-creatures.{{refn|group=note|The lunar [[manvantara]] generated seven classes of the entities for the earthly manvantara.{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=235}}}} They were servants to a family of lunar men, the leaders of which are now the Masters [[Morya (Theosophy)|M.]] and [[Kuthumi|K.H.]]{{refn|group=note|[[Morya (Theosophy)|M.]] — [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Kuthumi|K.H.]] — [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}{{sfn|Godwin|2011|loc=Ch. 4}}}} Leadbeater wrote that "individualization from the animal kingdom usually takes place through association with the humanity of the period. Such examples of it as we occasionally see taking place round us at the present time will serve as instances for us." Some peculiar domestic animal, well treated by its human friends, is stimulated by its permanent contact with them up to the point where it breaks away from the group-soul to which it has previously belonged.{{sfn|Leadbeater|1912|loc=Sect. 6/6}} The authors wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One night there is an alarm; the hut is surrounded by savages, supported by their domesticated animals, fierce and strong, resembling furry lizards and crocodiles. The faithful guardians spring up around their master's hut and fight desperately in its defence; Mars comes out and drives back the assailants, using some weapons they do not possess; but, while he drives them backward, a lizard-like creature darts behind him into the hut, and catching up the child Surya{{refn|group=note|"Surya — the Lord [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the present Bodhisattva, the Supreme Teacher of the world" (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}}} begins to carry him away. Sirius springs at him, bearing him down, and throws the child to Alcyone, who carries him back into the hut, while Sirius grapples with the lizard, and, after a desperate struggle, kills it, falling senseless, badly mangled, over its body.  Meanwhile, a savage slips behind Mars and stabs at his back, but Herakles, with one leap, flings himself between his master and the weapon and receives the blow full on his breast, and falls, dying. The savages are now flying in all directions, and Mars, feeling the fall of some creature against his back, staggers, and, recovering himself, turns. He recognizes his faithful animal defender, bends over his dying servant, and places his head in his lap. The poor monkey lifts his eyes, full of intense devotion, to his master's face, and the act of service done, with passionate desire to save, calls down a stream of response from the Will aspect of the Monad in a fierce rush of power, and in the very moment of dying the monkey individualizes, and thus he dies – a man."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1pp=35–6|Tillett|1986|2pp=450–51}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Fruits of Evolution ==
[[File:Life-waves.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Successive Life-waves.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=7}}{{refn|group=note|"The vertical columns indicate the successive incarnations of the Chain; the horizontal divisions represent the various kingdoms of nature; the diagonal arrows are the successive waves of Evolution which have come forth from the [[Logos]]."{{sfn|Leadbeater|1912|loc=Sect. 6/3}}}}]]
The theosophical concept of Evolution suppose spiritual development of the Mankind will attain the fullness of the stature of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus|Christ]], etc. of the prize of the high calling of God in Christianity.{{sfn|Sellon, Weber|1992|p=324}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}}

The authors the book proclaimed "when the Human Kingdom is traversed, and man stands on the threshold of His superhuman life, a liberated Spirit", seven paths open before Him for His choosing: He may enter into the blissful omniscience and omnipotence of [[Nirvana]], with activities far beyond our knowing, to become, perchance, in some future world an [[Avatara]], or godlike Incarnation; this is sometimes called, "taking the [[Dharmakaya]] vesture". He may enter on "the Spiritual Period" — a phrase including unknown meanings, among them probably that of "taking the [[Sambhogakaya]] vesture". He may become part of that treasure-house of spiritual forces on which the Agents of the [[Logos]] draw for Their work, "taking the [[Nirmanakaya]] vesture". He may remain a member of the [[Great White Brotherhood|Occult Hierarchy]] which rules and guards the world in which He has reached perfection. He may pass on to the next Chain, to aid in constructing its forms. He may enter the majestic Angel – Deva-Evolution. He may give Himself to the immediate service of the Logos, to be used by Him in any part of the [[Solar System]], His Servant and Messenger, who lives but to carry out His will and do His work over the whole of the system which He controls.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=12}}

== Criticism ==
A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] wrote in his thesis that ''The Canadian Theosophist'', a magazine published at [[Toronto]], announced a series of articles in which "parallel passages from the writings of Mrs. Blavatsky and the ''[[Mahatma Letters]]'' on one side, and from the books of Mrs. Besant and Mr. Leadbeater, on the other (''Man: whence, how and whither'' included), gave specific evidence bearing on the claims of perversion of the original theories by those whom they call [[Neo-Theosophy|Neo-Theosophists]]."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=330}}{{refn|group=note|Thomas stated, "Many, many have doubtless been turned away from genuine Theosophy after being exposed to the obvious gibberish of 'Leadbeaterism' and not being aware of the difference."{{sfn|Thomas}}}}

John Prentice in an article ''Clairvoyant Research'' criticized the book of the authors. He proclaimed that the material for the [[Peru]]vian lives in ''Man: whence, how and whither'' (Ch. XI) had been lifted out of Garcilaso de la Vega's ''Royal Commentaries on the Yuccas of Peru'' (written in 1609 and published in English translation in 1638, 1869 and 1871).{{sfn|Prentice|1923}}

Joseph Fussell wrote about "abnormal and preposterous claims" published by Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Fussell|1914}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=630–31}}

[[Helena Roerich]] stated that Leadbeater's books are a mix of "false and ugly" statements and some fragments of truth: one of the [[Mahatma|Great Masters]] supposedly called the book ''Man: Whence, How and Whither'' as "a work which devoid of knowledge, honesty and beauty."{{sfn|Рерих|2001}} She wrote: "The book by Besant and Leadbeater is particularly awful, therein is described the lives supposedly the Great Masters and some their pupils, namely: Besant, Leadbeater... I've never seen anything equal to this tasteless blasphemy and falsehood."{{sfn|Рерих|1993|p=45}}

Professor [[Olav Hammer]] stated that Leadbeater's claims about past lives "were increasingly used to buttress power struggles." He wrote, "Those who supported the controversial Leadbeater were recorded as having had important roles in the past, while his opponents were depicted as villains."
{{sfnm|Washington|1995|1p=129|Hammer|2003|2p=474}} In his thesis Hammer wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"How can Leadbeater's readers know that his clairvoyant results really are 'records' and 'information', rather than delusions or deliberate fabrications? His response is feeble, 'there is no assurance. The investigators themselves are certain &lt;...&gt; of the difference between observation and imagination'."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=485|Hammer|2003|2p=474}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alice Bailey]] stated that the book published at Adyar by Besant and Leadbeater was "psychic in his implications and impossible of verification". In her ''Unfinished Autobiography'' she wrote that it proved to her the "untrustworthiness" of Leadbeater's writings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Books were being published at Adyar by Mr. Leadbeater that were psychic in their implications and impossible of verification,  carrying a strong note of astralism. One of his major works, ''Man: Whence, How and Whither,'' was a book that proved to me the basic untrustworthiness of what he wrote. It is a book that outlines the future and the work of the Hierarchy of the future, and the curious and arresting thing to me was that the majority of the people slated to hold high office in the Hierarchy and in the future coming civilisation were all Mr. Leadbeater's personal friends. I knew some of these people—worthy, kind, and mediocre, none of them intellectual giants and most of them completely unimportant."{{sfn|Bailey|2013|loc=Ch. IV}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">The '''Master of IT in Business (MITB)''' is a master's degree emphasizing on the application of [[information technology]] to create business impact and value. The MITB degree originated in the early [[21st century]] as the [[digital transformation]] of businesses took place leaving industries to compete with each other on their technological capacity and advancement. The MITB is typically a sandwich course of two distinct horizontals targeted at providing a holistic view and understanding of both [[technology]] and [[management]] alike. The MITB offers a more specialized and niche course selection for [[technology]] and [[business]] education aspirants alike. Students on completion of such degrees typically pursue careers in various verticals leveraging [[information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.smu.edu.sg/master-it-business |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mbs.rutgers.edu/ |title=Rutgers MBS |publisher=Rutgers University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jcu.edu.sg/courses-and-study/courses/course/master-of-information-technology-business-informatics |title=James Cook MITBI |publisher=James Cook University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postgrad.com.sg/master-of-it-in-business |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mbaguide.com.sg/course/master-of-it-in-business-mitb/ |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109110054/http://mbaguide.com.sg/course/master-of-it-in-business-mitb/ |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/postgraduate-study/masters-by-coursework/mc200/#pageId=overview |title=RMIT MBIT |publisher=RMIT University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/programs-courses/postgraduate-coursework/agsm-master-business-technology-mbt |title=UNSW MBT |publisher=UNSW |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The degree is offered under various names by:
* [[Singapore Management University]] as Master of IT in Business (MITB) 
* [[Rutgers University]] as Master of Business &amp; Science (MBS)
* [[James Cook University]] as Master of IT in Business Informatics (MITBI)
* [[RMIT]] as Master of Business Information Technology (MBIT) 
* [[UNSW]] as Masters of Business &amp; Technology (MBT)

and by many other universities worldwide.

==Admissions==
Many programs base their admission decisions in a very similar fashion to the [[MBA]] programs, on a combination of undergraduate grade point average, academic transcripts, entrance exam scores, a résumé containing significant work experience, essays, letters of recommendation, and personal interviews. Some schools are also interested in extracurricular activities, community service activities or volunteer work, and how the student can improve the school's diversity and contribute to the student body as a whole. The [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT) is the most prominently used entrance exam for admissions into MITB programs. The [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) is also accepted by almost all MITB programs in order to fulfill any entrance exam requirement they may have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kitroeff, Natalie |title=Almost All Business Schools Now Accept the GRE|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-20/gre-at-business-school-most-mba-programs-now-accept-the-gre-too |date=20 October 2014|publisher=Bloomberg Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools do not weigh entrance exam scores as heavily as other criteria, and some programs do not require entrance exam scores for admission.

'''Material flow''' is the description of the transportation of raw materials, pre-fabricates, parts, components, integrated objects and final products as a flow of entities. The term applies mainly to advanced modeling of [[supply chain management]].

As industrial material flow can easily become very complex, several different specialized simulation tools have been developed for complex systems. Typical tools are:
* [[AnyLogic]]
* AutoMod for logistics systems
* [[Plant Simulation]] for production system

The '''maximum acceptable toxicant concentration''' (MATC) is a value that is calculated through [[Aquatic Toxicology|aquatic]] toxicity tests to help set [[water quality]] regulations for the protection of aquatic life. Using the results of a partial life-cycle [[chronic toxicity]] test, the MATC is reported as the [[geometric mean]] between the No Observed Effect Concentration ([[No-observed-adverse-effect level|NOEC]]) and the lowest observed effect concentration ([[Lowest-observed-adverse-effect level|LOEC]]).&lt;ref name="Rand1"/&gt;

The MATC is used to set regulatory standards for priority pollutants&lt;ref name="EPAPP"/&gt; under the US federal [[Clean Water Act]]. Regulatory guidelines give two acceptable concentrations of pollutants to protect against effects: chronic or acute. Since the MATC should only be reported in chronic toxicity tests, there is a widely accepted method to convert the chronic MATC to a concentration that protects against acute effects.&lt;ref name="Rand1"/&gt;

The MATC is calculated and reported from the results of a number of standard procedures designed by the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (US EPA) and other organizations to maintain high accuracy and precision among all toxicity tests for regulatory purposes.

==Calculation==

===Chronic toxicity tests===
In a toxicity test, the NOEC and LOEC are derived as a comparison from the [[Scientific control|negative control]], or the experimental group that does not contain the chemical in question. The NOEC is the highest concentration that does not cause a statistically different effect than the negative control through [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. Likewise, the LOEC is the lowest concentration tested that does cause a statistically different effect than the negative control. The MATC is the geometric mean between these two values, such that: MATC={{math|{{radical|(NOEC)(LOEC)}}}}

The MATC is calculated to protect against chronic effects on overall function or health of an organism, not death. A partial life cycle test must be used. This type of toxicity test uses organisms in their most sensitive life stages, usually during times of early reproduction and growth, but not juveniles.&lt;ref name="Rand2"/&gt; The MATC is the highest concentration that should not cause chronic effects, however, for regulatory purposes, a maximum concentration to protect against acute effects must exist as well.

===Applying MATC to acutely toxic concentrations===
The MATC can be applied to the results of an acute toxicity test to obtain a concentration that would protect against adverse effects during an acute exposure. An [[Median lethal dose|LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]], or the concentration at which 50% of the organisms die during an acute toxicity test is used to derive a value called the acute to chronic ratio (ACR).

The MATC can be used to calculate the ACR as follows: &lt;math&gt; ACR= LC50/MATC &lt;/math&gt;

The ACR is useful for estimating an MATC for species in which only acute toxicity data exists, or for setting regulatory guidelines for the protection of aquatic life through water quality criteria by the US EPA.&lt;ref name="Rand2"/&gt;

==Regulatory uses==

===United States===
The US EPA is the governmental organization responsible for writing and enforcing environmental regulations passed by Congress. The [[Clean Water Act]] was passed in 1972.

Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act is the Water Quality Criteria (WQC) developed for the protection of aquatic life and human health.&lt;ref name="EPAWQC"/&gt; The MATC and ACR are used in a sequence of calculations to obtain the Criterion Maximum Concentration and Criterion Continuous Concentration (CMC and CCC, respectively) for the chemicals being regulated.&lt;ref name="CCCCMC"/&gt;

The CMC and CCC are two of the six parts of the aquatic life criterion under the WQC, and are the actual regulatory values for all priority pollutants tested. The CMC is the highest concentration of a chemical in water that aquatic organisms can be exposed to acutely without causing an adverse effect. Likewise, the CCC is the highest concentration of a chemical in water that aquatic organisms can be exposed to indefinitely without resulting in an adverse effect. Typically, the CMC is higher than the CCC.&lt;ref name="CCCCMC"/&gt;

===Canada===
[[Environment Canada]] is the regulatory agency for environmental protection in Canada. Under the Canada Water Act of 1970, the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines (CWQG) for the Protection of Aquatic Life give regulatory guidelines of maximum concentrations of pollutants that are acceptable in freshwater and marine environments.&lt;ref name="CCME"/&gt;

The CWQG's long and short-term exposure concentrations are derived in a similar way as the methods used by the US EPA, and are the CMC or CCC equivalents.&lt;ref name="CCMEDERV"/&gt; When an MATC is reported with toxicity tests, it has sometimes been called a threshold-observed-effect-concentration (TOEC). The MATC and TOEC are both calculated as the geometric mean of the NOEC and LOEC, and are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="CCMEDERV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CASTAT"/&gt;

===Standard methods===

Standard methods are designed and used widely to maximize precision and accuracy for all toxicity tests. Values derived from toxicity tests such as the MATC are reported to regulatory organizations like the US EPA and Environment Canada so more confident regulations can be designed.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Some common standard methods include those designed by the governmental organizations like Environment Canada, the US EPA, or the United States [[Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]]. Others are designed by scientific organizations such as [[ASTM International]], or the [[OECD]].

Many of these methods use the same test organism or are designed for the same exposure time. Common test organisms include, but are not limited to, [[daphnia]], [[fathead minnow]], [[rainbow trout]], and [[mussel]]s. Acute toxicity tests are normally 24–96 hours, whereas chronic tests will typically run for a week or longer.

==Advantages and limitations==

Using the MATC to derive regulatory guidelines has been accompanied with some debate. Hypothesis testing, or statistical tests performed with data sets that only report a significant difference, are not considered the most statistically robust. There are no confidence intervals to show a measure of uncertainty in a NOEC and LOEC. In addition, the NOEC and LOEC can only be concentrations in the test, and nothing in between.&lt;ref name="RAND3"/&gt; Because of these reasons, values that are derived through curve fitting methods, such as an LC50, or EC10 (the concentration that causes the measured effect in 10% of organisms) would be preferred if it was possible more often.

From a regulatory standpoint, there are advantages to using results from hypothesis tests. NOEC and LOEC’s were used more often in the past, and there are more test results reporting NOEC and LOEC’s than EC10’s. The time and effort required to perform all of the previous tests to derive a different value is not seen as a good use of resources. In addition, the use of NOEC and LOEC’s allows for reporting of one number to regulatory agencies.&lt;ref name="CASTAT"/&gt; Water Quality Criteria are reported as one number that the actual concentration must remain below. If the MATC were reported as a range of values to account for uncertainty, the regulatory guidelines would not be presented as a single value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4113">'''Micro x-ray fluorescence''' (''µXRF'') is an elemental analysis technique that relies on the same principles as [[x-ray fluorescence]] (''XRF''). The difference is that micro x-ray fluorescence has a spatial resolution with a diameter many orders of magnitude smaller than conventional XRF. While a smaller excitation spot can be achieved by restricting x-ray beam using a pinhole aperture, this method blocks much of the x-ray [[flux]] which has an adverse effect on the sensitivity of trace [[elemental analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Bichlmeier, K. Janssens, J. Heckel, D.Gibson, P. Hoffmann and H.M. Ortner, [http://www.xos.com/products/x-ray-optics-excitation-systems-x-beam/optics/key-publications/], ''X-Ray Spectrom'', 14 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Two types of [[x-ray optics]], polycapillary and doubly curved crystal focusing optics, are able to create small focal spots of just a few [[micrometers]] in diameter. By using x-ray optics, the irradiation of the focal spot is much more intense and allows for enhanced trace element analysis and better resolution of small features. Micro x-ray fluorescence using x-ray optics has been used in applications such as forensics, small feature evaluations, elemental mapping, mineralogy, electronics, multi-layered coating analysis, micro-contamination detection, film and plating thickness&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xos.com/techniques/xrf/micro-x-ray-fluorescence-%CE%BCxrf/ Micro X-ray Fluorescence (µXRF)]&lt;/ref&gt;, biology and environment.

==Application in Forensic Science==

'''Micro x-ray fluorescence''' is among the newest technologies used to detect [[fingerprint]]s. It is a new visualization technique which rapidly reveals the elemental composition of a sample by irradiating it with a thin beam of X-rays without disturbing the sample. It was discovered recently by scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The newly discovered technique was then first revealed at the 229th national meeting of the [[American Chemical Society]] (March, 2005). This new discovery could prove to be very beneficial to the law enforcement world, because it is expected that ''µXRF'' will be able to detect the most complex molecules in fingerprints.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Michael, [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-03/acs-fv030805.php], ''New fingerprint visualization method uses X-rays to reveal missing clues'' 13 Mar 2005 accessed(14 Oct 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Bernstein of the American Chemical Society describes how the process works "Salts such as [[sodium chloride]] and [[potassium chloride]] excreted in sweat are sometimes present in detectable quantities in fingerprints. Using µXRF, the researchers showed that they could detect the sodium, potassium and chlorine from such salts. And since these salts are deposited along the patterns present in a fingerprint, an image of the fingerprint can be visualized producing an elemental image for analysis." This basically means that we can “see” a fingerprint because the salts are deposited mainly along the patterns present in a fingerprint.&lt;ref&gt;Worley, Christopher, {{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/dbis/stories/2006/15248.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511184241/http://www.aip.org/dbis/stories/2006/15248.html |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }}, ''American Institute of Physics'' 12 Jan 2006 accessed(14 Oct 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''µXRF'' technology uses [[X-ray]] technology to detect fingerprints, instead of traditional techniques, the image comes out much clearer. Traditional fingerprints are performed by a technique using powders, liquids or vapors to add color to the fingerprint so it can be distinguished. But sometimes this process may alter the fingerprint or may not be able to detect some of the more complex molecules.

Another µXRF application in forensics is [[Gunshot residue|GSR (Gunshot Residue)]] determination. Some specific elements, as antimony, barium and lead, can be identified on a cotton passed on the hands and clothes of the suspect of using a gun.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7034">'''Microhistory''' is the intensive [[History|historical]] investigation of a well-defined smaller unit of research (most often a single event, the community of a village, or an individual). In its ambition, however, microhistory can be distinguished from a simple [[case study]] insofar as microhistory aspires to "[ask] large questions in small places", to use the definition given by Charles Joyner.&lt;ref&gt;Joyner, C. W. ''Shared Traditions: Southern History and Folk Culture'', (Urbana: University of Illinois, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XH0gSiHYhrQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Joyner,+search+for+answers+to+large+questions+in+small+places&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0urxT7_2DKas2wWZ3bHDCg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=answers%20to%20large%20questions&amp;f=false p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Microhistory originally developed in Italy in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Giovanni Levi]], one of the pioneers of the approach, it began as a reaction to a perceived crisis in existing historiographical approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Giovanni|chapter=On Microhistory|year=1991|editor-last=Burke|editor-first=Peter|title=New Perspectives on Historical Writing|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|pages=93&amp;ndash;94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carlo Ginzburg]], another of microhistory's founders, has written that he first heard the term used around 1977, and soon afterwards began to work with Levi and [[Simona Cerutti]] on ''Microstorie'', a series of microhistorical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "microhistory" dates back to 1959, when the American historian [[George R. Stewart]] published ''Pickett's Charge: A Microhistory of the Final Attack on Gettysburg, July 3, 1863'', which tells the story of the final day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early use was by the [[Annales School|Annales]] historian [[Fernand Braudel]], for whom the concept had negative connotations, being overly concerned with the history of events.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A third early use of the term was in the title of Luis González's 1968 work ''Pueblo en vilo: Microhistoria de San José de Gracia''.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12/&gt;  González distinguished between microhistory, for him synonymous with local history, and "''petite histoire''", which is primarily concerned with anecdotes.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12/&gt;

==Approach==
The most distinctive aspect of the microhistorical approach is the small scale of investigations.&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26/&gt;  Microhistorians focus on small units in society, as a reaction to the generalisations made by the social sciences which do not necessarily hold up when tested against these smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magnússon|first=Sigurdur Gylfi|title='The Singularization of History': Social History and Microhistory within the Postmodern State of Knowledge|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=36|issue=3|year=2003|page=709}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, Ginzburg's 1976 work ''[[The Cheese and the Worms]]'' &amp;ndash; "probably the most popular and widely read work of microhistory"&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26/&gt; &amp;ndash; investigates the life of a single sixteenth-century Italian miller, Menocchio.  The individuals microhistorical works are concerned with are frequently those Robert Tristano describes as "little people", especially those considered heretics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|pages=26&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlo Ginzburg has written that a core principle of microhistory is making obstacles in sources, such as [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]], part of the historical account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatedly, Levi has said that the point of view of the researcher becomes part of the account in microhistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Giovanni|chapter=On Microhistory|year=1991|editor-last=Burke|editor-first=Peter|title=New Perspectives on Historical Writing|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable aspects of microhistory as a historical approach are an interest in the interaction of elite and popular culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an interest in the interaction between micro- and macro-levels of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1893">'''Molse School''', ''translated as "School of Mol",'' is a common term for some international paint artists or a specific genre of paintings in late 19th and early 20th century.  The paintings typically show picturesque and rustic places, farms, ... of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[municipality]] [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]], which is located in the [[Campine]].  The most famous painters of the  ''Molse School'' were [[Jakob Smits]] and [[Dirk Baksteen]] who lived in Achterbos, a hamlet of Mol.

Based upon the [[Barbizon school]] the municipality Mol organized an international art [[exhibition]] in 1907 and invited painters from all over the world.   Most of these artists had not met before and their only connection was their stay in a local [[hotel]] during the exhibition. These artists were not tied by a fine art society, neither was there a common style. In total 68 artists participated at this event, showing  212 works. This exhibition was also an attempt to show the artists the beauty of Mol, its [[heath]], the white sand flats and how the inhabitants (mostly [[farmer]]s) lived.  This attempt succeeded.

Upon their return home, the artists showed their paintings to their colleagues. This resulted in those colleagues also coming over to Mol making painting [[en plein air]] popular.

Some artists commonly categorized under the  ''Molse School'' are [[Dirk Baksteen]], [[Gerard Baksteen]], [[Charles Claessens]], [[Leon Delderenne]], [[Paul Mathieu]], [[Ernest Midy]], [[Erneste Rinquet]], [[Jakob Smits]], [[Willem Battaille]], [[Emile Van Damme-Sylva]], [[Paula Van Rompa-Zenke]], [[Gaston De Biemme]]

It is dedicated to learn about the possible risks to human beings [[Health threat from cosmic rays|exposed to cosmic radiation]].

==Overview==
Although Brookhaven Lab researchers and their colleagues used beams of heavy ions for radiobiology research at another Brookhaven accelerator from 1995, the NSRL became operational during summer 2003, and over 75 experimenters from some 20 institutions from the U.S. and abroad have taken part on radiobiology research.&lt;ref name='intro'/&gt; Jointly managed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and NASA’s Johnson Space Center, the facility employs beams of heavy ions extracted from Brookhaven’s Booster accelerator that are then used to simulate the [[Cosmic ray]]s found in space. NSRL also features its own beam line dedicated to radiobiology research, as well as specimen-preparation areas.

==Science==
Since [[astronaut]]s are spending more time in outer space, they are receiving more exposure to ionizing radiation, a stream of particles that, when passing through a body, has enough energy to cause the atoms and molecules within that substance to become an [[ion]]. By directly or indirectly ionizing and thus damaging the components of living cells, including genetic material called [[DNA]], ionizing radiation may cause changes in cells' ability to carry out repair and reproduction. This may lead to mutations, which, in turn, may result in [[tumor]]s, [[cancer]], genetic defects in offspring, or death.

Although the spacecraft itself somewhat reduces radiation exposure, it does not completely shield astronauts from galactic cosmic rays, which are highly energetic heavy ions, or from [[solar energetic particles]], which primarily are energetic protons. By one NASA estimate, for each year that astronauts spend in deep space, about one-third of their DNA will be hit directly by heavy ions.&lt;ref name='intro'/&gt;

NSRL researchers employ the unique [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] to irradiate a variety of biological specimens, tissues, and cells, as well as DNA in solution. Other experimenters use industrial materials as samples, studying their suitability for [[space suit]]s and spacecraft shielding.&lt;ref name='research'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://spaceradiation.usra.edu/ | title = NASA Space Radiation  Research | accessdate = 2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In increasing knowledge of the effects of cosmic radiation, NSRL studies may expand the understanding of the link between ionizing radiation and aging or neuro-degeneration, as well as cancer. In aiming to limit the damage to healthy tissue by ionization, NSRL research may also lead to improvements in cancer radiation treatments.&lt;ref name='intro'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8410">The National Institute for Social Work Training was set up in 1961, following proposals put forward in the 1959 [[Eileen Younghusband]] report for an independent staff college for social work.&lt;ref&gt; Ministry of Health Working Party on Social Workers in the Health and Welfare Services. Chaired by [[Eileen Younghusband]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its initial funding was assured for ten years by the [[Nuffield Foundation]] and the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust. It was later renamed the National Institute for Social Work (NISW), with a governing body of  some twenty-five members. 

Its staff worked throughout the [[United Kingdom]], supporting users and carers, practitioners, managers and policy makers in their work. NISW also attracted students from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;these included Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Nigeria, Norway, Singapore, South Africa and Zimbabwe&lt;/ref&gt; 

NISW’s later funding came as a grant from the [[Department of Health and Social Security]]. This was supplemented by fees from courses and consultancies. Special projects e.g. research, were also funded by other government departments, as well by charitable trusts.

NISW was located in Mary Ward House, Tavistock Place, London. NISW North opened in 1986 with an office in Leeds. 

When the National Institute for Social Work closed in 2003, its archives were deposited at the [[Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick]]. Its Library collection moved to the [[Social Care Institute for Excellence]], as did some staff from the Institute’s Research Unit. Other research staff working on the social services workforce project were transferred to Kings College, London University.&lt;ref&gt;the new group at Kings was named the Social Care Workforce Research Unit (SCWRU). For further information On SCWRU, see:  https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/scwru/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Activities ==

=== Teaching ===
NISW offered a one-year course and a three months course, aimed at social work practitioners and managers in both the statutory and voluntary sectors. These covered all aspects of social work, including casework, group work, community development, residential and community care, as well as management and staff development. 
NISW staff also provided a consultancy service, and an extensive programme of residental short courses throughout the UK. By the late 1970s, they had also begun to work with colleague organisations in other European countries.

NISW’s Research Unit&lt;ref&gt; Directors of Research: Tilda Goldberg 1963-1977, Ian Sinclair 1977 – 1989,  Jan Pahl 1990 – 1995, Mike Fisher 1996 – 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  was established in 1963 by Tilda Goldberg,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jan/10/socialcare.guardianobituaries and also [http://www.beds.ac.uk/goldbergcentre www.beds.ac.uk/goldbergcentre]&lt;/ref&gt; who designed the first randomised controlled trials in British social work. The Unit's  numerous studies were each designed to answer the question: ‘What works, and why?’ These studies included evaluations of social work in general practice, the effectiveness of task-centred casework, the role of social work area offices and clients’ attitudes to social work. Thereafter, during the 1980s, the Unit carried out studies of the carers for the confused elderly, the reasons for admission into old people’s homes and the varying roles played by relatives, friends, neighbours and services in supporting frail elderly people living alone. During the 1990s, the Unit’s research included studies of respite services for those caring for someone with dementia, hospital discharge of elderly people, child care and the social services workforce. 
 
From its inception, the Unit’s staff also took part in the Institute’s teaching programme, and published widely.

=== Policy Influence === 

NISW hosted and/or provided members for a number of important committees and their reports. These included:
* the [[Frederic Seebohm, Baron Seebohm|Frederic Seebohm]] committee on the integration of social work services&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Committee on Local Authority and Allied Personal Social Services, 1968. Chaired by [[Frederic Seebohm, Baron Seebohm|Frederic Seebohm]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* the [[Geraldine Aves]] committee on the voluntary worker in social services.&lt;ref&gt;report published by NCSS in 1969. Chaired by Geraldine Aves&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Gillian Wagner committee on residential care&lt;ref&gt;published as A Positive Choice. Report of the Independent Review of Residential Care, HMSO, 1988. Chaired by Gillian Wagner&lt;/ref&gt;  
* the Peter Barclay committee on the roles and tasks of social workers&lt;ref&gt;published as The Barclay Report: Social Workers, Their Role and Tasks 1982, NISW. Chaired by Peter Barclay&lt;/ref&gt;  
* the [[Eileen Younghusband]] and [[Edward Boyle, Baron Boyle of Handsworth|Edward Boyle]] committees set up by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] to consider the future of community development in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;published as (1) Community Work and Social Change 1968 and (2) Current Issues in Community Work 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Projects ===

Race Equality Unit (1987-1995)&lt;ref&gt; see https://raceequalityfoundation.org.uk/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Library ===

By the end of the 1990s, NISW’s Library comprised some 30,000 books and 300 journal titles. &lt;ref&gt;see http://info.uwe.ac.uk/news/uwenews/news.aspx?id=360&lt;/ref&gt; It had also developed an online information service, as well as an information and lending service for Social Services Departments. The Library attracted social workers, students and scholars, but it was also a valuable resource to staff from government departments, as well those in other statutory bodies and voluntary agencies who had their headquarters in or near central [[London]].

The Institute’s series, the ''National Institute Social Services Library'', was run in partnership with [[George Allen and Unwin]], who published over fifty books in the series on all aspects of social work practice and training. NISW also published its own in-house series, the ''National Institute for Social Work Papers'', designed as accessible guides to various elements of social work practice. 

Together with its Library, the Institute’s gardens, meeting rooms and Common Room provided a congenial setting for minds to meet, from all walks of social work life. NISW's policy of renting out office space to kindred organisations brought in not just valuable  income but also fellow professionals with new or different ideas to share.

=== Visiting Professors ===

All of NISW’s activities were strengthened by its ability to attract a steady stream of visiting professors, all but two of whom came from American universities:

Ken Daniels (New Zealand),  Eileen Gambrill,  Neil Gilbert,  Charles Grosser,  Arnold Gurin,  Ken Heap (Norway),  Ralph Kramer,  Frank Maple,  

Anne Minahan,  Mel Moguloff,  Robert Perlman,  Allen Pincus,  Jack Rothman,  Harry Specht,  Roland Warren, James Whittaker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7959">'''The Nordic Gender Institute (NIKK)''' (''Norwegian: Nordisk institutt for kunnskap om kjønn''), previously ''Nordic Institute for Women's Studies and Gender Research'', was a transnational resource and information centre for gender research and gender equality in the [[Nordic countries]]. 

The Institute aimed at constituting a bridge between Nordic gender research and equality politics. It co-operated closely with the Nordic Ministers for Co-operation on Gender Equality and the Nordic Executive Committee on Gender Equality. It claimed to contribute to the implementation of the Nordic cooperation programme on gender equality: "Focus on Gender: Working toward an Equal Society" (2006-2010). It initiated projects with the goal of gender equality, and coordinated and carried out investigations, studies, surveys, reports and opinions.

The Institute was located at the [[University of Oslo]] in Norway. It employed research coordinators, researchers, information advisors, and administrative personnel &amp;ndash; in 2010 the staff consisted of six employees from four of the Nordic countries.

== Reorganizing ==
In 2011, the Nordic Council of Ministers decided to reorganize NIKK, from a Nordic institute to a Nordic co-operation programme. A bidding round was announced in 2012. The co-operation programme was to further develop the information function, administer a Nordic funding scheme for gender equality and serve as project secretariat. The University of Gothenburg and the Swedish Secretariat for Gender Research won the bidding. 

Nordic Information on Gender, NIKK, was established in late 2012 and the programme's assignment expires at the end of 2015. As the acronym NIKK is established in the Nordic region and beyond, and associated with information, research and knowledge related to gender and gender equality, the Nordic co-operation programme continues to use NIKK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikk.no/en/about-nikk/background-to-the-nordic-cooperation-and-nikk/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of ''Hjernevask'' ===
{{Disputed-section|date=July 2014}} 

Certain journalists{{who|date=August 2014}} have speculated about the decision to restructure NIKK, and its relation to the public debate that followed the seven-part television documentary series "[[Hjernevask]]" ('Brainwash'), by the comedian and documentarian [[Harald Eia]], which aired in spring 2010 on the Norwegian broadcasting service NRK. However, the Norwegian Research Council has denied that the programme had any influence on its decision not to renew the Norwegian research programme on gender in 2011.{{cn|date=April 2017}} 

The gender researcher Marit Aure speculates, however, that the discussions on gender research, following the programme, might have influenced the decision indirectly, by presenting gender research in Norway as a more established field than actually was the case. Anders Hanneborg, involved in the Norwegian Research Council's committee that evaluated the Norwegian gender research programme's renewal application, explained that the programme was not renewed in order to decentralize and strengthen gender research in Norway. He also denied directly that the television programme "Hjernevask" was any part of their discussions on the issue. The Norwegian research programme on gender had received funding in 2008 for a period of four years, which expired in 2011. The Norwegian research programme, funded by the Norwegian Research Council, was not related to NIKK, which was funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.svd.se/opinion/ledarsidan/hur-gar-det-for-norge-utan-genusvetenskap_6687272.svd |title=Hur går det för Norge utan genusvetenskap? |author=Ledare Johan Ingerö |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |date=2011-12-06 |access-date=2012-08-31 |language=sv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Kjnnsforskningen-mister-56-millioner-6704899.html |title=Kjønnsforskningen mister 56 millioner |author=Kjersti Nipen |publisher=[[Aftenposten]] |date=2011-11-23 |access-date=2012-08-31 |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian Parliament, responding to a direct question from Tord Lien of the rightist Progress Party, addressed these television programmes. The core of his criticism concerned the scientific neglect of the biological to the social component. The Minister of Research and Higher Education, Tora Aasland, from the Socialist Leftist Party, dismissed these criticisms, adding that multidisciplinary gender research in Norway has been evaluated positively, not by television programmes, but through external scientific evaluations of Norwegian research on the field&lt;ref name="Stortinget1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stortinget - Møte onsdag den 28. april 2010 kl. 10 |publisher=[[Stortinget]]|url=http://www.stortinget.no/no/Saker-og-publikasjoner/Publikasjoner/Referater/Stortinget/2009-2010/100428/ordinarsporretime/16/ |date=2010-04-28 |access-date=2012-09-01 |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stortinget2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stortinget - Møte tirsdag den 8. juni 2010 kl. 10 |publisher=[[Stortinget]]|url=http://www.stortinget.no/no/Saker-og-publikasjoner/Publikasjoner/Referater/Stortinget/2009-2010/100608/8/ |date=2010-06-08 |access-date=2012-09-01 |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian network for Gender Studies states correlations between  "Hjernevask" and increased discussion on the gender studies in its Annual report 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uis.no/getfile.php/genderresearch/%C3%A5rsrapport%20NFK%202010%201.pdf |title=Årsrapport NFK 2010 |publisher=Nettverk for kjønnsforskning |pages=3 |access-date=2012-08-31 |language=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==

The Nordic Gender Institute initiated, co-ordinated, and executed projects that focus on central gender equality issues, i.e. research and development, statements, surveys, and reports. The most recent projects are:

* Gender and Power in the Nordic Countries (2008-2009)
* Gendered Citizenship in Multicultural Europe: The Impact of Contemporary Women's Movements (FEMCIT) (2007-2011)
* Prostitution in the Nordic Countries (2007-2008)
* Multidimensional Discrimination Policies in the Nordic Countries (2007)
* Gender Equality and Quality of Life. A Norwegian Perspective (2007)
* Youth, Gender and Pornography in the Nordic Countries (2004-2006)

A large NIKK study on [[prostitution]] for the Nordic ministers of gender equality was presented in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytid.no/perspektiver/artikler/20081017/blank/|title=Sexkjøpforbud kan bli sovepute|last=Stackpole Dahl|first=Miriam|date=2008-10-17|publisher=[[Ny Tid]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2009-01-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022043927/http://www.nytid.no/perspektiver/artikler/20081017/blank/|archivedate=2008-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=840915|title=Bland liljor och rhododendronbuskar|last=Bjurwald|first=Lisa|date=2008-10-17|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study on gender and power was presented in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gp.se/ekonomi/1.252763-fa-kvinnor-i-styrelser|title=Få kvinnor i styrelser|last=Björk|first=Evalis|date=2009-11-19|publisher=[[Göteborgs-Posten]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magazine ==

''NIKK magasin'' wrote about new and current themes and perspectives on gender research and gender equality politics in the Nordic countries. It was published three times a year: two issues in Scandinavian languages &amp;ndash; one issue in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikk.no/en/nordic-cooperation/themes-1996-2011/|title=NIKK magasin|publisher=NIKK|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy of religion''' is "the philosophical examination of the central themes and concepts involved in religious traditions."&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Winter 2014|title = Philosophy of Religion|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/|date = 1 January 2014|first = Charles|last = Taliaferro|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sorts of philosophical discussion are ancient, and can be found in the earliest known [[manuscripts]] concerning philosophy. The field is related to many other branches of philosophy, including [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-religion/#FieSig "Philosophy of Religion."]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The philosophy of religion differs from [[religious philosophy]] in that it seeks to discuss questions regarding the nature of religion as a whole, rather than examining the problems brought forth by a particular belief system. It is designed such that it can be carried out dispassionately by those who identify as [[religious belief|believers]] or non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=C. Stephen|title=Philosophy of Religion: Thinking about Faith|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=1985|pages=16|isbn=978-0-87784-343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Bronnikov gimnpifagoreizev.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Pythagoreans Celebrate the Sunrise'' (1869) by [[Fyodor Bronnikov]]. [[Pythagoreanism]] is one example of a [[Greek philosophy]] that also included religious elements.]]
Philosopher [[William L. Rowe]] characterized the philosophy of religion as: "the critical examination of basic religious beliefs and concepts."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Philosophy of Religion, An Introduction, Fourth Edition, 2007, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy of religion covers alternative beliefs about God (or gods), the varieties of [[religious experience]], the interplay between science and religion, the nature and scope of good and evil, and religious treatments of birth, history, and death.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; The field also includes the ethical implications of religious commitments, the relation between faith, reason, experience and tradition, concepts of the miraculous, the sacred revelation, mysticism, power, and salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnin, N, Tsui-James, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HNWIcgEswrsC&amp;pg=PA453&amp;dq=philosophy+of+religion+field&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RvFjVPmhPKSe7gbU1YGgAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20religion%20field&amp;f=false ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 453.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Philosophy of Religion" did not come into general use in the West until the nineteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, WJ., [https://books.google.com/books?id=GbcuCf9TlDgC&amp;dq=oxford+handbook+Philosophy+religion&amp;q=%22come+into+general%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22come%20into%20general%22&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion''], Oxford Handbooks Online, 2004, p. 3. "The expression "philosophy of religion" did not come into general use until the nineteenth century, when it was employed to refer to the articulation and criticism of humanity's religious consciousness and its cultural expressions in thought, language, feeling, and practice."&lt;/ref&gt; and most pre-modern and early modern philosophical works included a mixture of religious themes and "non-religious" philosophical questions. In Asia, examples include texts such as the Hindu [[Upanishads]], the works of [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhist texts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: History of the philosophy of religion.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophies like [[Pythagoreanism]] and [[Stoicism]] included religious elements and theories about deities, and [[Medieval philosophy]] was strongly influenced by the big three Monotheistic [[Abrahamic religions]]. In the Western world, early modern philosophers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], and [[George Berkeley]] discussed religious topics alongside secular philosophical issues as well. &lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-religion/#FieSig "Philosophy of Religion."]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The philosophy of religion has been distinguished from [[theology]] by pointing out that, for theology, "its critical reflections are based on religious convictions".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': Theology.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, "theology is responsible to an authority that initiates its thinking, speaking, and witnessing ... [while] philosophy bases its arguments on the ground of timeless evidence."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590855/theology/14945/Relationship-to-philosophy Theology; Relationship of theology to the history of religions and philosophy; Relationship to philosophy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some aspects of philosophy of religion have classically been regarded as a part of [[metaphysics]]. In [[Aristotle]]'s ''Metaphysics'', the necessarily prior cause of eternal motion was an [[unmoved mover]], who, like the object of desire, or of thought, inspires motion without itself being moved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abu.nb.ca/courses/grphil/philrel/aristotle.htm Aristotle], Professor Barry D. Smith, Crandall University&lt;/ref&gt; This, according to Aristotle, is God, the subject of study in [[theology]]. Today, however, philosophers have adopted the term "philosophy of religion" for the subject, and typically it is regarded as a separate field of specialization, although it is also still treated by some, particularly [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[philosopher]]s, as a part of metaphysics.

==Basic themes and problems==
===Ultimate Reality===
Different religions have different ideas about Ultimate Reality, its source or ground (or lack thereof) and also about what is the "Maximal Greatness".&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Keith E. PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION A contemporary introduction, Routledge, 2002, Part II in general&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, William, "Concepts of God", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/concepts-god/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Tillich]]'s concept of 'Ultimate Concern' and [[Rudolf Otto]]'s 'Idea of the Holy' are concepts which point to concerns about the ultimate or highest truth which most religious philosophies deal with in some way. One of the main differences among religions is whether the Ultimate Reality is a personal God or an impersonal reality.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meister, Chad. Introducing Philosophy of Religion. Routledge 2009, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Western religions, various forms of [[Theism]] are the most common conceptions of the ultimate Good, while in [[Eastern Religions]], there are theistic and also various non-theistic conceptions of the Ultimate. Theistic vs non-theistic is a common way of sorting the different types of religions.&lt;ref&gt;see the whole structure of 'Yandell, 2002.'&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several philosophical positions with regard to the existence of [[God]] that one might take including various forms of [[Theism]] (such as [[Monotheism]] and [[Polytheism]]), [[Agnosticism]] and different forms of [[Atheism]].

====Monotheism====
[[Image:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Aquinas]] considered five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the ''[[quinque viae]]'' (Five Ways).]]
{{Main|Existence of God}}
Monotheism is the belief in a single deity or [[God]], who is ontologically independent.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many forms of monotheism. [[Keith Yandell]] outlines roughly three kinds of historical monotheisms: Greek, Semitic and Hindu. Greek monotheism holds that the world has always existed and does not believe in Creationism or divine providence, while Semitic monotheism believes the world is created by a God at a particular point in time and that this God acts in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Keith E. PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION A contemporary introduction, Routledge, 2002, page 86-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian monotheism meanwhile teaches that the world is beginningless, but that there is God's act of creation which sustains the world.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt to provide proofs or arguments for the existence of [[God]] is one aspect of what is known as [[natural theology]] or the natural theistic project. This strand of natural theology attempts to justify belief in God by independent grounds. Perhaps most of philosophy of religion is predicated on natural theology's assumption that the existence of God can be justified or warranted on rational grounds. There has been considerable philosophical and theological debate about the kinds of proofs, justifications and arguments that are appropriate for this discourse.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[Antony Flew]], [[John Polkinghorne]], [[Keith Ward]], [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Richard Swinburne]]&lt;/ref&gt; Common types of arguments for the existence of god include:

*[[Cosmological Argument]]
*[[Ontological Argument]]
*[[Teleological argument]]
*[[Argument from religious experience]]
*[[Argument from morality]]
*Wager arguments like [[Pascal's Wager]] attempts to rationally argue that one ''should'' believe in God.

Skeptics and atheists have put forth various arguments against the existence of God including:

*The [[argument from inconsistent revelations]]
*The [[problem of evil]], the question of how to reconcile the existence of [[evil]] with that of a [[deity]] who is, in either absolute or relative terms, [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]], and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]].&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil The Problem of Evil]", Michael Tooley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The Evidential Problem of Evil]", Nick Trakakis&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Argument from poor design]]
*[[Argument from nonbelief]] or the argument from divine hiddenness

====Non-theistic conceptions====
[[File:Seshin Vasubandhu Kofukuji.jpg|thumb|225px|The Buddhist [[Vasubandhu]] argued against Hindu Creator God views and for an impersonal conception of absolute reality that has been described as a form of Idealism.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Sean (2011) "Idealism in Yogācāra Buddhism," The Hilltop Review: Vol. 4: Iss. 1, Article 6. Available at: http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/hilltopreview/vol4/iss1/6&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Eastern Religions have included both theistic and other alternative positions about the ultimate nature of reality. One such view is [[Jainism]], which holds a dualistic view that all that exists is matter and a multiplicity of souls ([[jiva]]), without depending on a supreme deity for their existence. There are also different Buddhist views, such as the [[Theravada]] [[Abhidharma]] view, which holds that the only ultimately existing things are transitory phenomenal events (''[[Abhidharma#Dharma_theory|dharmas]]'') and their [[dependent origination|interdependent relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhists such as [[Nagarjuna]] hold that Ultimate reality is emptiness ([[shunyata]]) while the [[Yogacara]] holds that it is ''vijñapti'' (mental phenomena). In Indian philosophical discourses, monotheism was defended by Hindu philosophers (particularly the [[Nyaya]] school), while Buddhist thinkers argued against their conception of a Creator God (Sanskrit: [[Ishvara]]).&lt;ref&gt;Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad (Reviewer) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=z88GAfvNGH0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Nyaya&amp;f=false Against a Hindu God: Buddhist Philosophy of Religion in India]''.

The Hindu view of [[Advaita Vedanta]], as defended by [[Adi Shankara]], is a total [[non-dualism]]. Though Advaitins do believe in the usual Hindu gods, their view of ultimate reality is a radically [[monistic]] oneness ([[Brahman]] without qualities) and anything which appears (like persons and gods) is illusory (''maya'').&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The various philosophical positions of Chinese [[Taoism]] can also be viewed as non-theistic about the ultimate reality ([[Tao]]).

For most of these non-theistic traditions, the path to ultimate reality includes various spiritual practices such as [[yoga]] and [[meditation]].

It is important to note that the above philosophical views do not necessarily entail atheism. Traditionally, Jains and Buddhists did not rule out the existence of limited deities or divine beings, they only rejected the idea of a single all powerful creator God or First cause posited by monotheists.

===Knowledge and belief===
{{See also|Belief#Religion}}
[[File:Blind monks examining an elephant.jpg|thumb|The [[Blind men and an elephant]] is a parable widely used in Buddhism and Jainism to illustrate the dangers of dogmatic religious belief]]
All religious traditions make knowledge claims which they argue are central to religious practice and to the ultimate solution to the main problem of human life.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; These include epistemic, metaphysical and ethical claims. 

[[Evidentialism]] is the position that may be characterized as "a belief is rationally justified only if there is sufficient evidence for it".&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 105&lt;/ref&gt; Many theists and non-theists are evidentialists, for example, Aquinas and Bertrand Russell agree that belief in God is rational only if there is sufficient evidence, but disagree on whether such evidence exists.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 105&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments often stipulate that subjective religious experiences are not reasonable evidence and thus religious truths must be argued based on non-religious evidence. One of the strongest positions of evidentialism is that by [[William Kingdon Clifford]] who wrote: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, Peter, "The Epistemology of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/religion-epistemology/.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent supporters of evidentialism include [[Antony Flew]] ("The Presumption of Atheism", 1972) and [[Michael Scriven]] (Primary philosophy, 1966). Both of them rely on the [[Ockhamist]] view that in the absence of evidence for X, belief in X is not justified. Many modern [[Thomists]] are also evidentialists in that they hold they can demonstrate there is evidence for the belief in God. Another move is to argue in a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] way for the probability of a religious truth like God, not for total conclusive evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, Peter, "The Epistemology of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/religion-epistemology/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers however, argue that religious belief is warranted ''without evidence'' and hence are sometimes called ''non-evidentialists''. They include [[Fideism|fideists]] and [[reformed epistemologists]]. [[Alvin Plantinga]] and other [[reformed epistemologists]] are examples of philosophers who argue that religious beliefs are "properly basic beliefs" and that it is not irrational to hold them even though they are not supported by any evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale here is that some beliefs we hold must be foundational and not be based on further rational beliefs, if this is not so we risk an [[infinite regress]]. This is qualified by the proviso that they can be defended against objections (this differentiates this view from fideism). A properly basic belief is a belief that one can reasonably hold without evidence, such as a memory, a basic sensation or a perception. Plantinga's argument is that belief in God is of this type, because within every human mind there is a natural awareness of divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William James]] in his essay "[[The Will to Believe]]" argues for a pragmatic conception of religious belief. For James, religious belief is justified if one is presented with a question which is rationally undecidable and if one is presented with genuine and live options which are relevant for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 98&lt;/ref&gt; For James, religious belief is defensible because of the pragmatic value it can bring to one's life, even if there is no rational evidence for it.

Some work in recent epistemology of religion goes beyond debates over evidentialism, fideism, and reformed epistemology to consider contemporary issues deriving from new ideas about knowledge-how and practical skill; how practical factors can affect whether one could know whether theism is true; from formal epistemology's use of probability theory; or from social epistemology (particularly the epistemology of testimony, or the epistemology of disagreement).&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see {{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |last2=Hawthorne |first2=John |last3=Rabinowitz |first3=Dani |title=Knowledge, Belief, and God: New Insights in Religious Epistemology |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780198798705 |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/knowledge-belief-and-god-9780198798705}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, an important topic in the epistemology of religion is that of religious disagreement, and the issue of what it means for intelligent individuals of the same epistemic parity to disagree about religious issues. Religious disagreement has been seen as possibly posing first-order or higher-order problems for religious belief. A first order problem refers to whether that evidence directly applies to the truth of any religious proposition, while a higher order problem instead applies to ''whether one has rationally assessed'' the first order evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Pittard, John. Religious Disagreement, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/rel-disa/&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a first order problem is the [[Argument from nonbelief]]. Higher order discussions focus on whether religious disagreement with epistemic peers (someone whose epistemic ability is equal to our own) demands us to adopt a skeptical or agnostic stance or whether to reduce or change our religious beliefs.

===Faith and reason===
While religions resort to rational arguments to attempt to establish their views, they also claim that religious belief is at least partially to be accepted through [[faith]], confidence or trust in one's religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 91&lt;/ref&gt; There are different conceptions or models of faith, including:&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, John, "Faith", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/faith/.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] model of faith sees it as a feeling of trust, a psychological state
*The special knowledge model of faith as revealing specific religious truths (defended by [[Reformed epistemology]])
*The belief model of faith as the theoretical conviction that a certain religious claim is true.
*Faith as trusting, as making a [[Fiduciary|fiducial]] commitment such as trusting in God.
*The practical [[doxastic]] venture model where faith is seen as a commitment to believe in the trustworthiness of a religious truth or in God. In other words, to trust in God presupposes belief, thus faith must include elements of belief and trust.
*The non-doxastic venture model of faith as practical commitment ''without actual belief'' (defended by non-realists like [[J. L. Schellenberg]] and [[Don Cupitt]]). In this view, one need not believe in literal religious claims about reality to have religious faith. 
*The hope model, faith as hoping

There are also different positions on how faith relates to reason. One example is the belief that faith and reason are compatible and work together, which is the view of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and the orthodox view of Catholic [[natural theology]]. According to this view, reason establishes certain religious truths and faith (guided by reason) gives us access to truths about the divine which, according to Aquinas, "exceed all the ability of human reason."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 93&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another position on is [[Fideism]], the view that faith is "in some sense independent of, if not outright adversarial toward, reason."&lt;ref&gt;Amesbury, Richard, "Fideism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Fall 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/fideism/.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was famously defended by the theologian [[Tertullian]] (c.160–230 CE). Modern philosophers such as [[Kierkegaard]], [[William James]], and [[Wittgenstein]] have been associated with this label. [[Kierkegaard]] in particular, argued for the necessity of the religious to take a non-rational [[leap of faith]] to bridge the gulf between man and God. Wittgensteinian fideism meanwhile sees religious [[language games]] as being incommensurate with scientific and metaphysical language games, and that they are autonomous and thus may only be judged on their own standards. The obvious criticism to this is that many religions clearly put forth metaphysical claims.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, Peter, "The Epistemology of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/religion-epistemology/.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several contemporary [[New Atheist]] writers which are hostile to religion hold a related view which says that religious claims and scientific claims are opposed to each other, and that therefore religions are false.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant theologian [[Karl Barth]] (1886–1968) argued that religious believers have no need to prove their beliefs through reason and thus rejected the project of [[natural theology]]. According to Barth, human reason is corrupt and God is utterly different from his creatures, thus we can only rely on God's own revelation for religious knowledge. Barth's view has been termed [[Neo-orthodoxy]]. &lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[D.Z. Phillips]] argues that God is not intelligible through reason or evidence because God is not an empirical object or a 'being among beings'.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Brian. An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion 2rd Edition, 1993, p. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  

As Brian Davies points out, the problem with positions like Barth's is that they do not help us in deciding between [[Argument from inconsistent revelations|inconsistent and competing revelations]] of the different religions.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
{{Main article|Relationship between religion and science}}

The topic of whether religious beliefs are compatible with [[science]] and in what way is also another important topic in the philosophy of religion as well as in [[theology]]. This field draws the historical study of their interactions and conflicts, such as the debates in the United States over the teaching of [[evolution]] and [[creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;De Cruz, Helen, "Religion and Science", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/religion-science/.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different models of interaction that have been discussed in the philosophical literature, including :&lt;ref&gt;De Cruz, Helen, "Religion and Science", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/religion-science/.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Conflict thesis]] which sees them as being in constant conflict, such as during the reception of the theory of [[evolution]] and the current debate over [[creationism]].
*Independence model, both have separate domains, or [[non-overlapping magisteria]]
*Dialogue model, some overlap between the fields, they remain separate but share some concepts and presuppositions
*Integration or unification model includes projects like [[natural theology]] and [[process theology]]

The field also draws the scientific study of religion, particularly by psychologists and sociologists as well as cognitive scientists. Various theories about religion have arisen from these various disciplines. One example is the various [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|evolutionary theories of religion]] which see the phenomenon as either adaptive or a by-product. Another can be seen in the various theories put forth by the [[Cognitive science of religion]].

===Religious experience===
{{See also|Religious experience|Phenomenology of religion}}
[[File:William_James_b1842c.jpg|thumb|225px|[[William James]] wrote [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]].]]
Closely tied to the issues of knowledge and belief is the question of how to interpret [[religious experiences]] vis-à-vis their potential for providing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious experiences have been recorded throughout all cultures and are widely diverse. These personal experiences tend to be highly important to the individuals who undergo them.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions about religious experiences can be said to be informed in part by the question: "what sort of information about what there is might religious experience provide, and how could one tell?"&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One could interpret these experiences either veridically, neutrally or as delusions. Both monotheistic and non-monotheistic religious thinkers and mystics have appealed to religious experiences as evidence for their claims about ultimate reality. Philosophers such as [[Richard Swinburne]] and [[William Alston]] have compared religious experiences to everyday perceptions, that is, both are [[noesis|noetic]] and have a perceptual object, and thus religious experiences could logically be veridical unless we have a good reason to disbelieve them.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Brian Davies (philosopher)|Brian Davies]] common objections against the veridical force of religious experiences include the fact that experience is frequently deceptive and that people who claim an experience of a god may be "mistakenly identifying an object of their experience", or be insane or hallucinating.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he argues that we cannot deduce from the fact that our experiences are ''sometimes'' mistaken, hallucinations or distorted to the conclusion that all religious experiences are mistaken etc. Indeed, a drunken or hallucinating person could still perceive things correctly, therefore these objections cannot be said to ''necessarily'' disprove all religious experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to C. B. Martin, "there are no tests agreed upon to establish genuine experience of God and distinguish it decisively from the ungenuine", and therefore all that religious experiences can establish is the reality of these psychological states.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Naturalistic explanations for religious experiences are often seen as undermining their epistemic value. Explanations such as the [[Death anxiety (psychology)|fear of death]], [[suggestion]], [[Regression (psychology)|infantile regression]], [[sexual frustration]], neurological anomalies ("it's all in the head") as well as the socio-political power that having such experiences might grant to a mystic have been put forward.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt; A hostile position was famously taken by [[Bertrand Russell]] who have compared the veridical value of religious experiences to the [[hallucinations]] of a drunk person: "From a scientific point of view, we can make no distinction between the man who eats little and sees heaven and the man who drinks much and sees snakes. Each is in an abnormal physical condition, and therefore has abnormal perceptions."&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell "Mysticism" From Religion and Science (Oxford University Press, 1961)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as [[William L. Rowe]] notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The hidden assumption in Russell's argument is that bodily and mental states that interfere with reliable perceptions of the physical world also interfere with reliable perceptions of a spiritual world beyond the physical, if there is such a spiritual world to be perceived. Perhaps this assumption is reasonable, but it certainly is not obviously true.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, as argued by [[C.D. Broad]], "one might need to be slightly 'cracked'" or at least appear to be mentally and physically abnormal in order to perceive the supranormal spiritual world.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 85&lt;/ref&gt; 

William James meanwhile takes a middle course between accepting mystical experiences as veridical or seeing them as delusional. He argues that for the individual who experiences them, they are authoritative and they break down the authority of the rational mind. Not only that, but according to James, the mystic is justified in this. But when it comes to the non-mystic, the outside observer, they have no reason to regard them as either veridical nor delusive.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 88&lt;/ref&gt; 

The study of religious experiences from the perspective of the field of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] has also been a feature of the philosophy of religion. Key thinkers in this field include [[William Brede Kristensen]] and [[Gerard van der Leeuw]].

====Types====
[[File:Avatars of Vishnu.jpg|thumb|225px|Depiction of the [[theophany]] scene in the [[Bhagavadgita]] wherein [[Krishna]] reveals his universal form to [[Arjuna]].]]
Just like there are different religions, there are different forms of religious experience. One could have "subject/content" experiences (such as a euphoric meditative state) and "subject/consciousness/object" experiences (such as the perception of having seen a god, i.e. [[theophany]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 40, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiences of [[theophany]] are described in ancient Mediterranean religious works and myths and include the story of [[Semele]] who died due to her seeing [[Zeus]] and the Biblical story of the [[Burning bush]]. Indian texts like the [[Bhagavadgita|Bhagavad Gita]] also contain theophanic events. The diversity (sometimes to the point of contradiction) of religious experiences has also been used as an argument against their veridical nature, and as evidence that they are a purely subjective psychological phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western thought, religious experience (mainly a theistic one) has been described by the likes of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], [[Rudolf Otto]] and [[William James]]. According to Schleiermacher, the distinguishing feature of a religious experience is that "one is overcome by the feeling of absolute dependence."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, 2007, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Otto meanwhile, argued that while this was an important element, the most basic feature of religious experiences is that it is ''[[numinous]]''. He described this as "non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self" as well as having the qualities of being a mystery, terrifying and fascinating.&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Rudolf (1996). Alles, Gregory D., ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Autobiographical and Social Essays'']. Berlin: [[Walter de Gruyter]]. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22ganz+andere%22%22ganz+an%22%22ders+%5bwholly+other%5d%22 30]. {{ISBN|978-3-110-14519-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rowe meanwhile defined a religious experience as "an experience in which one senses the immediate presence of the divine."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pg. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rowe, religious experiences can be divided in the following manner:&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 73, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

*Religious experiences in which one senses the presence of the divine as being distinct from oneself.
*Mystical experiences in which one senses one's own union with a divine presence.
**The extrovertive way looks outward through the senses into the world around us and finds the divine reality there.
**The introvertive way turns inward and finds the divine reality in the deepest part of the self.

Non-monotheistic religions meanwhile also report different experiences from theophany, such as [[non-dual]] experiences of oneness and deeply focused meditative states (termed [[Samadhi]] in Indian religion) as well as experiences of final enlightenment or liberation ([[moksha]], [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]], [[kevala]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] respectively).

Another typology, offered by Chad Meister, differentiates between three major experiences:&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 171-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Regenerative experiences, in which an individual feels reborn, transformed or changed radically, usually resulting in religious conversion.
*Charismatic experiences, in which special gifts, abilities, or blessings are manifested (such as healing, visions, etc.)
*[[Mystical experiences]], which can be described using William James qualifications as being: [[Ineffable]], [[Noesis|Noetic]], transient and passive.

====Perennialism vs Constructivism====
Another debate on this topic is whether all religious cultures share common core mystical experiences ([[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]]) or whether these experiences are in some way socially and culturally constructed ([[Constructivism (psychological school)|Constructivism]] or [[Contextualism]]). According to [[Walter Stace]] all cultures share mystical experiences of oneness with the external world, as well as introverted "Pure Conscious Events" which is empty of all concepts, thoughts, qualities, etc. except pure consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[Ninian Smart]] argued that monistic experiences were universal. Perennialists tend to distinguish between the experience itself, and its post experience interpretation to make sense of the different views in world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some constructivists like [[Steven T. Katz]] meanwhile have argued against the common core thesis, and for either the view that every mystical experience contains at least some concepts (soft constructivism) or that they are strongly shaped and determined by one's religious ideas and culture (hard constructivism).&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the conceptual scheme of any mystic strongly shapes their experiences and because mystics from different religions have very different schemas, there cannot be any universal mystical experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and ethics===
[[File:Sacrifice of Isaac-Caravaggio (Uffizi).jpg|thumb|''Sacrifice of Isaac'', by [[Caravaggio]].]]
All religions argue for certain values and ideas of the moral Good. Non-monotheistic Indian traditions like Buddhism and [[Advaita Vedanta]] find the highest Good in [[nirvana]] or [[moksha]] which leads to release from suffering and the [[Samsara|rounds of rebirth]] and morality is a means to achieve this, while for monotheistic traditions, God is the source or ground of all morality and heaven in the highest human good. The world religions also offer different conceptions of the source of [[evil]] and [[suffering]] in the world, that is, what is wrong with human life and how to solve and free ourselves from these dilemmas.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 180&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for Christianity, [[Sin in Christianity|sin]] is the source of human problems, while for Buddhism, it is [[Taṇhā|craving]] and [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]]. 

A general question which philosophy of religion asks is what is the relationship, if any, between morality and religion. Brian Davies outlines four possible theses:&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, pg. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Morality somehow requires religion. One example of this view is [[Kant]]'s idea that morality should lead us to believe in a moral law, and thus to believe in an upholder of that law, that is, God.
*Morality is somehow included in religion, "The basic idea here is that being moral is part of what being religious means."&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, pg. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Morality is pointless without religion, for one would have no reason to be moral without it.
*Morality and religion are opposed to each other. In this view, belief in a God would mean one would do whatever that God commands, even if it goes against morality. The view that religion and morality are often opposed has been espoused by atheists like [[Lucretius]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] as well as by theologians like [[Kierkegaard]] who argued for a '[[Fear_and_Trembling#Teleological_Suspension_of_the_Ethical|teleological suspension of the ethical]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, pg. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monotheistic religions who seek to explain morality and its relationship to God must deal with what is termed the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], famously stated in the [[Platonic dialogue]] "[[Euthyphro]]" as: "Is the [[Piety|pious]] (τὸ ὅσιον, i.e. what is morally good) loved by the [[Deity|gods]] because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?" Those who hold that what is moral is so ''because'' it is what God commands are defending a version of the [[Divine command theory]].

Another important topic which is widely discussed in [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] monotheistic religious philosophy is the problem of human [[Free will]] and God's [[omniscience]]. God's omniscience could presumably include perfect knowledge of the future, leading to [[Theological determinism]] and thus possibly contradicting with human free will.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Lockyer Jordan; Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate; Neil Lockyer; Edwin Tate (25 June 2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC ''Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition'']. Nelson Thornes. p. 211. {{ISBN|978-0-7487-8078-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different positions on this including [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]] (free will is true) and [[Predestination]].

===Miracles===
{{Main article|Miracle}}
Belief in [[miracles]] and [[supernatural]] events or occurrences is common among world religions. A miracle is an event which cannot be explained by rational or scientific means. The [[Resurrection of Jesus]] and the [[Miracles of Muhammad]] are examples of miracles claimed by religions.

[[Skepticism]] towards the supernatural can be found in early philosophical traditions like the Indian [[Carvaka]] school and Greco-Roman philosophers like [[Lucretius]]. [[David Hume]], who defined a miracle as "a violation of the laws of nature", famously argued against miracles in [[Of Miracles]], Section X of ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748). For Hume, the probability that a miracle hasn't occurred is always greater than the probability that it has because "as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws [of nature], the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined" (''Enquiry''. X. p. 173).[http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Hume/HumeMiracles.pdf] Hume doesn't argue that a miracle is impossible, only that it is unreasonable to believe in any testimony of a miracle's occurrence, for evidence for the regularity of natural laws is much stronger than human testimony (which is often in error).&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 142&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rowe, there are two weaknesses with Hume's argument. First, there could be other forms of indirect evidence for the occurrence of a miracle that does not include testimony of someone's direct experience of it. Secondly, Rowe argues that Hume overestimates "the weight that should be given to past experience in support of some principle thought to be a law of nature." For it is a common occurrence that currently accepted ideas of natural laws are revised due to an observed exception but Hume's argument would lead one to conclude that these exceptions do not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 143&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe adds that "It remains true, however, that a reasonable person will require quite strong evidence before believing that a law of nature has been violated. It is easy to believe the person who claimed to see water run downhill, but quite difficult to believe that someone saw water run uphill."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of a miracle is possible however, which is termed the [[Epistemic theory of miracles]] and was argued for by [[Spinoza]] and [[St. Augustine]]. This view rejects that a miracle is a transgression of natural laws, but is simply a transgression of our current ''understanding'' of natural law. In the ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'', [[Spinoza]] writes: "miracles are only intelligible as in relation to human opinions, and merely mean events of which the natural cause cannot be explained by a reference to any ordinary occurrence, either by us, or at any rate, by the writer and narrator of the miracle" (''Tractatus'' p. 84). Similarly, R.F. Holland has defined miracle in a naturalistic way in a widely cited paper. For Holland, a miracle need only be an extraordinary and beneficial coincidence interpreted religiously.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, R.F. (1965), "The Miraculous," ''American Philosophical Quarterly ''2:43-51&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Davies notes that even if we can establish that a miracle has occurred, it is hard to see what this is supposed to prove. For it is possible that they arise due to agencies which are unusual and powerful, but not divine.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 1993, 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afterlife===
{{Main article|Afterlife}}
World Religions put forth various theories which affirm [[life after death]] and different kinds of postmortem existence. This is often tied to belief in an immortal individual [[soul]] or self ([[Sanskrit]]: [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]) separate from the body which survives death, as defended by [[Plato]], [[Descartes]], Monotheistic religions like Christianity and many [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]]. This view is also a position on the [[mind body problem]], mainly, [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; This view then must show not only that dualism is true and that souls exist, but also that souls survive death. As [[Kant]] famously argued, the mere existence of a soul does not prove its immortality, for one could conceive that a soul, even if it is totally simple, could still fade away or lose its intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.H. Price]] is one modern philosopher who has speculated at length about what it would be like to be a disembodied soul after death. 

One major issue with soul beliefs is that since [[personhood]] is closely tied to our physical bodies, it seems difficult to make sense of a human being existing apart from their body. A further issue is with continuity of [[personal identity]], that is, it is not easy to account for the claim that the person that exists after bodily death is the ''same'' person that existed before.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 150-151&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bertrand Russell]] put forth the general scientific argument against the afterlife as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Persons are part of the everyday world with which science is concerned, and the conditions which determine their existence are discoverable...we know that the brain is not immortal, and that the organized energy of a living body becomes, as it were, demobilized at death and therefore not available for collective action. All the evidence goes to show that what we regard as our mental life is bound up with brain structure and organized bodily energy. Therefore it is rational to suppose that mental life ceases when bodily life ceases. The argument is only one of probability, but it is as strong as those upon which most scientific conclusions are based.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contra Russell, [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] argues that we have no scientific proof that the mind is dependent on the body in this particular way. As Rowe notes, the fact that the mind depends on the functions of the body while one is alive is not necessarily proof that the mind will cease functioning after death just as a person trapped in a room while depending on the windows to see the outside world might continue to see even after the room ceases to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] is one religion which, while affirming postmortem existence (through [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]), denies the existence of individual souls and instead affirms a deflationary view of personal identity, termed ''not-self'' ([[anatta]]).

While [[physicalism]] has generally been seen as hostile to notions of an afterlife, this need not be the case. Abrahamic religions like Christianity have traditionally held that life after death will include the element of bodily resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; One objection to this view is that it seems difficult to account for personal continuity, at best, a resurrected body is a replica of the resurrected person not the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt; One response is the constitution view of persons, which says persons are constituted by their bodies and by a "first-person perspective", the capacity to think of oneself ''as oneself''. In this view, what is resurrected is that first person perspective, or both the person's body and that perspective. An objection to this view is that it seems difficult to differentiate one person's first person perspective from another person's without reference to temporal and spatial relations.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter van Inwagen]] meanwhile, offers the following theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps at the moment of each man's death, God removes his corpse and replaces it with a simulacrum which is what is burned or rots. Or perhaps God is not quite so wholesale as this: perhaps He removes for "safekeeping" only the "core person"—the brain and central nervous system—or even some special part of it. These are details. (van Inwagen 1992: 245–46)&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view shows how some positions on the nature of the afterlife are closely tied to and sometimes completely depend upon theistic positions. This close connection between the two views was made by [[Kant]], who argued that one can infer an afterlife from belief in a just God who rewards persons for their adherence to moral law.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other discussions on the philosophy of the afterlife deal with phenomena such as [[near death experiences]], [[reincarnation research]], and other [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] events and hinge on whether naturalistic explanations for these phenomena is enough to explain them or not. Such discussions are associated with philosophers like [[William James]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[C.D. Broad]], and [[H.H. Price]].&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity and pluralism===
{{See also|Religious pluralism}}
[[Image:Yashovijaya.jpg|thumb|225px|Jain philosophers, such as [[Yashovijaya]], defended a theory of [[Anekantavada]] which could be interpreted as a form of inclusivism.]]
The issue of how one is to understand religious diversity and the plurality of religious views and beliefs has been a central concern of the philosophy of religion. 

There are various philosophical positions regarding how one is to make sense of religious diversity, including exclusivism, inclusivism, pluralism, relativism, [[atheism]] or [[antireligion]] and [[agnosticism]]. 

[[Religious exclusivism]] is the claim that only one religion is true and that others are wrong. To say that a religion is exclusivistic can also mean that salvation or human freedom is only attainable by the followers of one's religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 181&lt;/ref&gt; This view tends to be the orthodox view of most monotheistic religions, such as Christianity and Islam, though liberal and modernist trends within them might differ. William L Rowe outlines two problems with this view. The first problem is that it is easy to see that if this is true, a large portion of humanity is excluded from salvation and it is hard to see how a loving god would desire this. The second problem is that once we become acquainted with the saintly figures and virtuous people in other religions, it can be difficult to see how we could say they are excluded from salvation just because they are not part of our religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 182&lt;/ref&gt; 

A different view is inclusivism, which is the idea that "one's own tradition alone has the whole truth but that this truth is nevertheless partially reflected in other traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John. "On Conflicting Religious Truth-Claims," p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt; An inclusivist might maintain that their religion is privileged, they can also hold that other religious adherents have fundamental truths and even that they will be saved or liberated.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain view of [[Anekantavada]] ('many-sidedness') has been interpreted by some as a tolerant view which is an inclusive acceptance of the partial truth value of non-Jain religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Barbato, Melanie. Jain Approaches to Plurality: Identity as Dialogue. BRILL 2017, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; As Paul Dundas notes, the Jains ultimately held the thesis that Jainism is the final truth, while other religions only contain partial truths.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dundas (2004). Tara Sethia, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC ''Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism'']. Motilal Banarsidass. p. 123-125. {{ISBN|978-81-208-2036-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars such as Kristin Beise Kiblinger have also argued that some of the Buddhist traditions include inclusivist ideas and attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Beise Kiblinger. Buddhist Inclusivism: Attitudes Towards Religious Others&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern Western study of religion, the work of [[Ninian Smart]] has also been instrumental in representing a more diverse understanding of religion and religious pluralism. Smart's view is that there are genuine differences between religions.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pluralism is the view that all religions are equally valid responses to the divine and that they are all valid paths to personal transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 185&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is taken by [[John Hick]], who has developed a pluralistic view which synthesizes components of various religious traditions. Hick promotes an idea of a noumenal sacred reality which different religions provide us access to.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt; Hick defines his view as "the great world faiths embody different perceptions and conceptions of, and correspondingly different responses to, the Real or the Ultimate."&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John. "On Conflicting Religious Truth-Claims," p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; For Hick, all religions are true because they all allow us to encounter the divine reality, even if they have different deities and conceptions of it. Rowe notes that a similar idea is proposed by [[Paul Tillich]]'s concept of ''Being-itself''.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of [[Perennial philosophy|perennialism]] is that there is a single or core truth or experience which is shared by all religions even while they use different terms and language to express it. This view is espoused by the likes of [[Aldous Huxley]], the thinkers of the [[Traditionalist School]] as well as [[Neo-Vedanta]]. 

Yet another way of responding to the conflicting truth claims of religions is [[Relativism]]. [[Joseph Runzo]]., one of its most prominent defenders, has argued for ''henofideism'' which states that the truth of a religious worldview is relative to each community of adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Thus while religions have incompatible views, each one is individually valid as they emerge from individual experiences of a plurality of phenomenal divine realities.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; According to Runzo, this view does not reduce the incompatible ideas and experiences of different religions to mere interpretations of the Real and thus preserves their individual dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Another response to the diversity and plurality of religious beliefs and deities throughout human history is one of [[skepticism]] towards all of them (or even [[antireligion]]), seeing them as illusions or human creations which serve human psychological needs.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 184&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] was a famous proponent of this view, in various publications such as ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927) and ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930). According to Freud, "Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires."&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

While one can be skeptical towards the claims of religion, one need not be hostile towards religion. [[Don Cupitt]] is one example of someone who, while disbelieving in the metaphysical and cosmological claims of his religion, holds that one can practice it with a "non-realist" perspective which sees religious claims as human inventions and myths to live by.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious language===
{{Main Article|Problem of religious language}}
The question of religious language and in what sense it can be said to be meaningful has been a central issue of the philosophy of religion since the work of the [[Vienna circle]], a group of philosophers who, influenced by [[Wittgenstein]], put forth the theory of [[Logical positivism]]. Their view was that religious language, such as any talk of God cannot be verified empirically and thus was ultimately meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Brian. An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion 2rd Edition, 1993, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This position has also been termed [[Theological noncognitivism]]. A similar view can be seen in [[David Hume]]'s [[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]], where he  famously wrote that any work which did not include either (1) abstract reasoning on quantity or number or (2) reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence was "nothing but sophistry and illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kvanvig|first=Jonathan L.|title=Faith and Humility|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yv5cDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT19|year=2018|publisher=OUP Oxford|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-253727-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, [[Antony Flew]], questioned the validity of religious statements because they do not seem to be [[falsifiable]], that is, religious claims do not seem to allow any counter evidence to count against them and thus they seem to be lacking in content.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; While such arguments were popular in the 1950s and 60s, the [[verification principle]] and [[falsifiability]] as a criterion for meaning are no longer as widely held.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; The main problem with verificationism is that it seems to be self refuting, for it is a claim which does not seem to be supported by its own criterion.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by [[Brian Davies (philosopher)|Brian Davies]], when talking about God and religious truths, religious traditions tend to resort to [[metaphor]], negation and [[analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The [[via negativa]] has been defended by thinkers such as [[Maimonides]] who denied that positive statements about God were helpful and wrote: "you will come nearer to the knowledge and comprehension of God by the negative attributes."&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Similar approaches based on negation can be seen in the Hindu doctrine of [[Neti neti]] and the Buddhist philosophy of [[Madhyamaka]]. 

[[Wittgenstein]]'s theory of [[language games]] also shows how one can use analogical religious language to describe God or religious truths, even if the words one is using do not in this case refer to their everyday sense, i.e. when we say God is wise, we do not mean he is wise in the same sense that a person is wise, yet it can still make sense to talk in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Patrick Sherry notes, the fact that this sort of language may make sense does not mean that one is warranted in ascribing these terms to God, for there must be some connection between the relevant criteria we use in ascribing these terms to conventional objects or subjects and to God.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; As Chad Meister notes though, for Wittgenstein, a religion's [[language game]] need not reflect some literal picture of reality (as a [[picture theory of meaning]] would hold) but is useful simply because its ability to "reflect the practices and forms of life of the various religious adherents."&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 15-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Wittgenstein, philosophers of religion like [[Norman Malcolm]], [[B. R. Tilghman]], and [[D. Z. Phillips]] have argued that instead of seeing religious language as referring to some objective reality, we should instead see it as referring to ''forms of life''. This approach is generally termed non-realist.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this view, realists respond that non-realism subverts religious belief and the intelligibility of religious practice. It is hard to see for example, how one can pray to a God without believing that they really exist. Realists also argue that non-realism provides no normative way to choose between competing religions.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy of religion==
In ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion'', James Franklin Harris noted that
{{quote|
analytic philosophy has been a very heterogeneous 'movement'.... some forms of analytic philosophy have proven very sympathetic to the philosophy of religion and have actually provided a philosophical mechanism for responding to other more radical and hostile forms of analytic philosophy.&lt;ref name=harris2001&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=James Franklin |title=Analytic philosophy of religion |date=2002 |publisher=Kluwer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-1402005305 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rx2Qf9ieFKYC}} (432 pages)  (volume 3 of Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion, ISSN 1568-1556)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}
}}

As with the study of ethics, early analytic philosophy tended to avoid the study of philosophy of religion, largely dismissing (as per the logical positivists view) the subject as part of metaphysics and therefore meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;(a notable exception is the series of [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael B. Forest]]'s 1934-36 [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'' articles involving the Christian doctrine of creation and the rise of modern science).]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The collapse of [[logical positivism]] renewed interest in philosophy of religion, prompting philosophers like [[William Alston]], [[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]], Alvin Plantinga, [[Robert Merrihew Adams]], Richard Swinburne, and Antony Flew not only to introduce new problems, but to re-open classical topics such as the nature of [[miracle]]s, theistic arguments, the problem of evil, (see [[existence of God]]) the rationality of belief in [[God]], concepts of the nature of God, and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Michael et al. (2003). ''Reason and Religious Belief''&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga, Mackie and Flew debated the logical validity of the ''free will defense'' as a way to solve the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, John L. (1982). ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God''&lt;/ref&gt; Alston, grappling with the consequences of analytic philosophy of language, worked on the nature of religious language. Adams worked on the relationship of faith and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert M. (1987). ''The Virtue of Faith And Other Essays in Philosophical Theology''&lt;/ref&gt; Analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for a number of philosophically-sophisticated theistic arguments, like those of the [[reformed epistemology|reformed epistemologists]] like Plantinga.

Analytic philosophy of religion has also been preoccupied with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], as well as his interpretation of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Creegan, Charles. (1989). ''Wittgenstein and Kierkegaard: Religion, Individuality and Philosophical Method''&lt;/ref&gt; Using first-hand remarks (which would later be published in ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', ''Culture and Value'', and other works), philosophers such as [[Peter Winch]] and [[Norman Malcolm]] developed what has come to be known as ''contemplative philosophy'', a Wittgensteinian school of thought rooted in the "Swansea tradition" and which includes Wittgensteinians such as [[Rush Rhees]], Peter Winch and D. Z. Phillips, among others. The name "contemplative philosophy" was first coined by D. Z. Phillips in ''Philosophy's Cool Place'', which rests on an interpretation of a passage from Wittgenstein's "Culture and Value."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D. Z. (1999). ''Philosophy's Cool Place.'' Cornell University Press. The quote is from Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'' (2e): "My ideal is a certain coolness. A temple providing a setting for the passions without meddling with them."&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation was first labeled, "Wittgensteinian Fideism," by Kai Nielsen but those who consider themselves Wittgensteinians in the Swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal as a caricature of Wittgenstein's considered position; this is especially true of D. Z. Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=fideism |title=Fideism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to this interpretation, [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] and [[D.Z. Phillips]] became two of the most prominent philosophers on Wittgenstein's philosophy of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Kai and D.Z. Phillips. (2005). ''Wittgensteinian Fideism?''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10707">'''Progymnasmata''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] προγυμνάσματα "fore-exercises"; [[Latin]] ''praeexercitamina'') are a series of preliminary [[rhetorical]] exercises that began in [[ancient Greece]] and distended during the [[Roman Empire]]. These exercises were implemented by students of [[rhetoric]], who began their schooling between ages twelve and fifteen. The purpose of these exercises was to prepare students for writing [[declamations]] after they had completed their education with the [[Linguist|grammarians]].
There are only four surviving handbooks of progymnasmata, attributed to [[Aelius Theon]], [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]], [[Aphthonius of Antioch]], and Nicolaus the [[Sophism|Sophist]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, George A. A New History of Classical Rhetoric. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1994.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Composition was not a primary subject taught in schools until the fifth century. In fact, the term “progymnasmata” first appeared in Chapter 28 of [[Rhetoric to Alexander]], most likely written by [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]] in the late fourth century. This work is preserved alongside those of [[Aristotle]], yet he never mentions the use of preliminary exercises. But Aristotle does touch on the rhetorical forms, which became an aspect within the nature of progymnasmata. The use of preliminary rhetorical exercises is discussed briefly in some Greek and Roman dialogues, but all handbooks from that time remain lost today.
There are only four known surviving handbooks of progymnasmata. The earliest one is that of Theon, written some time during the first century A.D. In his introduction, Theon addresses teachers rather than students and criticizes students who skip out on these preliminary exercises.
The second handbook is attributed to one of the most influential rhetoricians of the second century, Hemogenes of Tarsus. But there is no preface to his work and the exercises are brief; therefore, many doubt its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, George A., p.203 A New History of Classical Rhetoric. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; But the third handbook is attributed to Aphthonius of Antioch, student of the great sophist Libanius during the second half of the fourth century. This is the most widely used and referenced handbook that became the standard on the practice of progymnasmata. His treatises were combined with rhetorical treatises of Hermogenes on stasis theory and style to create the “Hermogenic Corpus.”
The final handbook is attributed to Nicolaus of Myra, who taught rhetoric in [[Constantinople]] during the late fifth century.

==Progymnasmata of Aphthonius==

Although the exercises expressed in each known handbook are very similar, there are several minor variations between them. But because the work of Aphthonius is the one most widely recognized and practiced, these variations are often unrecognized. All students were asked to write out each assignment, memorize it, and then perform a class oration. The progymnasmata were taught in order, increasing in difficulty as the course advances. The courses were organized to begin with story-telling and end with making an argument. There was a focus on literature as a supplement to the course, paying close attention to models of rhetoric and literature. The progymnasmata of Aphthonius was first translated to Latin in the fifteenth century by [[Rudolphus Agricola]].

===Fable (mythos)===

[[Aesop's fables]] were popular at the time rhetoric became a common topic of study. There are three forms of [[fable]]: the rational form (where characters are men and women), the ethical form (where animals are protagonists), and a third form involving both. What all three have in common is they each have a [[moral]], stated before the story begins or after it has concluded. In Aphthonius's handbook, the first exercise was to create a fable that followed the three forms.

===Narrative (diēgēma)===

This elementary assignment was to simply write a [[narrative]] (not to be confused with fable). It is assumed that this training is a result of Aristotle's theory of categories and introduces students to the four values of narrative, which is perspicuity, incisiveness, persuasiveness, and purity of language. The content of the narrative exercise in the progymnasmata is either political, historical, or based on fiction. Just as diegesis indicates the narrative plot of a film, the so-called narrative of a speech or oration moves the content forth.

===Anecdote (chreia)===

Students were asked to take an action or saying of a famous person and elaborate on it. They were to develop the meanings of these actions or quotes with the framing under the headings of praise, paraphrase, cause, example of meaning, compare and contrast, testimonies, and an epilogue; [[anecdote]] is something that is frequently used in the Bible.

===Maxim (gnōmē)===

[[Maxim (saying)|Maxim]] or [[proverbs]] were first described by Aristotle, and in Aphthonius's book are divided into, protheptic, apotreptic, declarative, simple, and compound. A moral generalization was given to students about a writer, and they were asked to create something similar to an anecdote about the writer.

===Refutation (anaskeuē)===

This exercise required the student to logically reason against something drawn from myths, narratives, or fables. The student's argument was that something was either impossible, illogical, unsuitable, and inexpedient.

===Confirmation (kataskeuē)===

The confirmation exercise is the opposite of refutation. The student was asked to reason in favor of something drawn from legends and literature.

===Commonplace (koinos topos)===

Working out the commonplace involved attacking vice by envisioning criticism of stereotypes rather than individuals. Students do this by using contradiction, comparison, and maxim attacking the motivation of the demographic described.

===Encomium (enkōmion)===

Students used [[encomium]] to praise persons, things, times, places, animals, and growing things. Each praise could be engendered from the headings upbringing, deeds, skills, and sometimes was in the form of a comparison with another person, an epilogue, or a prayer.

===Invective (psogos)===

[[Invective]] opposes commonplace. It attacks a specific, named individual, usually a political or cultural figure.

===Comparison (synkrisis)===

The [[comparison (grammar)|comparison]] exercise acts as a double encomium or a combination of an encomium of one person or thing and the invective against another.

===Personification (ēthopoeia)===

Students used [[personification]] or [[ethopoeia]] by forming a speech ascribed to the ghost of a known person or of an imaginary or mythological character from past, present, or future times. This exercise was intended to request students to perform it with clarity, conciseness, and floridity.

===Description (ekphrasis)===

When asked to use [[ekphrasis]] to describe a person, place, thing, or time, students were obliged to produce a description that was complete. Included was detailed information about a person from head-to-toe, an action from start to finish, etc. This form is seen in many classical literature and historical writings.

===Argument (thesis)===

Because this exercise is an introduction to argument in the philosophical schools, the use of [[thesis]] was not performed until first completing all previous exercises. Students had to come up with a thesis argument of their own nature; these questions were often ones difficult to answer.

===Introduction to law (nomou eisphora)===

Aphtonius calls this final exercise a gymnasma rather than progymnsasmata. This exercise is in the form of advocacy of a proposed law or opposition of it. The argument is first stated, a counterargument follows, and then the headings are discussed

==Progymnasmata for schools==
In the past few years there has been considerable effort expended to see if the Progymnasmata could be adapted for use in elementary, middle and high school education. One of the leaders in this effort is James Selby,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selby|first1=James|title=James Selby|url=http://whitefieldacademy.org/teams/james-selby/|website=Whitefield Academy|publisher=Whitefield Academy|accessdate=17 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023215734/http://whitefieldacademy.org/teams/james-selby/|archivedate=23 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author of the Classical Composition series, who has reduced the composition curriculum used by Quintilian and Cicero, to a level that can be effectively used by fourth through twelfth grade students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classical Composition|url=http://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/writing/classical-composition|website=Memoria Press|publisher=Memoria Press|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorica and Progymnasmata is taught as a mandatory class in Sremski Karlovci, Serbia at [[Gymnasium of Karlovci]] high school, focusing on preparing students at early age for public speaking, as well as teaching classical rhetorics.

The progymnasmata is also taught at Highlands Latin School in Louisville, KY, as well as at Highlands Latin Cottage Schools (homeschooling support tutorials) around the United States.

The relationship between '''religion and schizophrenia''' is of particular interest to [[psychiatrists]] because of the similarities between [[religious experience]]s and [[psychosis|psychotic episodes]]; religious experiences often involve [[auditory hallucination|auditory]] and/or [[visual hallucination]]s, and those with schizophrenia commonly report similar hallucinations, along with a variety of beliefs that are commonly recognized by modern medical practitioners  as delusional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Murray, ED. | author2=Cunningham MG | author3=Price BH | title=The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered | journal=J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neuroscience | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=410–26 | doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 | pmid=23224447| year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, religion has been found to have "both a protective and a risk increasing effect" for schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Gearing, Robin Edward, Dana Alonzo, Alex Smolak, Katie McHugh, Sherelle Harmon, and Susanna Baldwin.

A common report from those with schizophrenia is some type of religious belief that many medical practitioners consider to be delusional - such as the belief they are divine beings or prophets, that God is talking to them, they are possessed by demons, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siddle|first=Ronald |author2=Haddock, Gillian |author3=Tarrier, Nicholas |author4=Faragher, E.

Trans-cultural studies have found that such religious beliefs, which often may not be associated with reality, are much more common in patients with schizophrenia who identify as Christian and/or reside in predominately Christian areas such as Europe or North America.&lt;ref name="Tateyama"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tateyama M, Asai M, Hashimoto M, Bartels M, Kasper S |title=Transcultural study of schizophrenic delusions.

==Background==
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}
Schizophrenia is a complex [[Psychosis|psychotic disorder]] in which symptoms include emotional blunting, intellectual deterioration, social isolation, disorganized speech and behavior, delusions, and hallucinations. The causes of schizophrenia are unclear, but it seems that [[heredity|genetics]] play a heavy role, as individuals with a family history are far more likely to suffer from schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="van Os 635–45"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Os|first=J|author2=Kapur, S |title=Schizophrenia.|journal=Lancet|date=2009-08-22|volume=374|issue=9690|pages=635–45|pmid=19700006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60995-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Picchioni|first=MM|author2=Murray, RM |title=Schizophrenia.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2007-07-14|volume=335|issue=7610|pages=91–5|pmid=17626963|doi=10.1136/bmj.39227.616447.BE|pmc=1914490}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The disorder can be triggered and exacerbated by social and environmental factors, with episodes becoming more apparent in periods of high [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. Neurologists have found that the schizophrenic brain has larger ventricles (fluid-filled cavities) compared to a well brain. This is hypothesized to be due to loss of nerve cells.&lt;ref name="UCLA Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Page|first1=Dan|title=UCLA Researchers Map How Schizophrenia Engulfs Teen Brains|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/UCLA-Researchers-Map-How-Schizophrenia-2701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms usually appear around the onset of early adulthood.&lt;ref name="van Os 635–45"/&gt;  It is rare for a child to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, in part because of the difficulty in establishing what erroneous thoughts and beliefs can be attributed to childhood development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul|title=Egocentrism|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/preoperational.html|website=simplepsychology.org|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which thoughts and beliefs can be attributed to schizophrenia. With [[psychiatric medication]] (usually [[antipsychotic]]s) and therapy, individuals with schizophrenia can live successful and productive lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/atypical-antipsychotics-for-schizophrenia/|title=Grohol, John M., Dr. "Atypical Antipsychotics for Schizophrenia."

== Role of religion in schizophrenia treatment ==

It has been shown in longitudinal studies that those suffering from schizophrenia have varying degrees of success when religion plays a significant role in their recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=S.|title=Toward an Integration of Spirituality and Religiousness Into the Psychosocial Dimension of Schizophrenia|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 November 2006|volume=163|issue=11|pages=1952–1959|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.11.1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It would seem that the use of religion can either be a helpful method of coping with the disorder, or it can be a significant hindrance in recovery. Especially for those who are active in a [[religious community]], religion can also be a very valuable tool in coping with the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danbolt|first=Lars J.|title=The Personal Significance of Religiousness and Spirituality in Patients With Schizophrenia|journal=International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=31 March 2011|volume=21|issue=2|pages=145–158|doi=10.1080/10508619.2011.557009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helman|first=DS|title=Recovery from schizophrenia: An autoethnography|journal=Deviant Behavior|date=2018|volume=39|issue=3|pages=380–399|doi=10.1080/01639625.2017.1286174}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be difficult, however, to distinguish if a religious experience is genuine to the spiritual person, or if it is a positive symptom of the illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koenig|first=Harold G.|title=Religion, spirituality and psychotic disorders|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0101-60832007000700013&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Archives of Clinical Psychiatry (São Paulo)|volume=34|pages=95–104|doi=10.1590/S0101-60832007000700013|issn=0101-6083|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where a skilled and reliable therapist can help. Provided that a [[mental health professional|therapist]] is open to the use of religion in one's treatment, and that the patient is open and receiving said treatment, it is entirely possible to tie religion in with professional therapeutic aids and [[medication]] in order to meet a desirable goal. Those who are involved in their church and are spiritual on a daily basis, while getting psychiatric treatment have reported fewer symptoms and a better quality of life. They learn to see their religion as a source of hope rather than a tormenting reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=S|author2=Huguelet P |title=The relationship between schizophrenia and religion and its implications for care|journal=Swiss Medical Weekly|url=http://www.smw.ch/docs/pdf200x/2004/25/smw-10322.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion as a trigger for schizophrenia ==
{{POV|date=April 2017}}
Schizophrenia can be triggered by a variety of environmental factors, including significant stress, intensely emotional situations, and disturbing or uncomfortable experiences. It is possible that religion itself may be a trigger for schizophrenia; religious imagery is often very grandiose, and defies commonly held beliefs of what is realistic and natural in the world. Experiencing an intense religious experience may trigger a psychotic episode in those who are vulnerable to them, because religion often requires a believer to suspend their usual idea of what is possible and impossible. This could potentially lead to a psychotic episode due to the shift in realistic thinking; a sufferer may believe that they themselves are religious deities or Messiahs, or that God himself is speaking to the individual. These symptoms may cause violent behavior, either on others or themselves because of taking passages in religious texts literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.217&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=The relationship between schizophrenia and religion and its implications for care|first1=Sylvia|last1=Mohr|first2=Philippe|last2=Huguelet|journal=Swiss Med Weekly|year=2004|volume=134|pp=369–376|via=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, they may also experience more distress-inducing symptoms if they believe that God is using their illness as a punishment. Religion, depending on how the patient views it, can be paralyzing and quite harmful, in that the patient may refuse treatment based on religious beliefs; in certain instances, one might believe that their delusions and hallucinations are actually a divine experience, and therefore deny any treatment.  It has been shown that those with schizophrenia who suffer from religious delusions are more religious than those who do not suffer from these delusions.&lt;ref name="Mohr 1095–1103"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=Sylvia |author2=Borras, Laurence |author3=Rieben, Isabelle |author4=Betrisey, Carine |author5=Gillieron, Christiane |author6=Brandt, Pierre-Yves |author7=Perroud, Nader |author8=Huguelet, Philippe|title=Evolution of spirituality and religiousness in chronic schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorders: a 3-years follow-up study|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|date=11 October 2009|volume=45|issue=11|pages=1095–1103|doi=10.1007/s00127-009-0151-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been shown that those who suffer from religious delusions are less likely to continue long-term treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4958">[[File:Retman.png|thumb|right|RETMAN, the superhero of Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy cartoons]]
'''RETMAN''' is a comics’ character, associated to [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]] (REBT). Through it, REBT tries more efficiently address children, adolescents and the general public. This form of therapy approaches the treatment of [[emotional disorders]] and the promotion of mental health by modifying maladaptive/irrational behaviors and cognitions (thoughts).

== History and evolution ==
The first RETMAN concept was thought up at the Albert Ellis Institute, US, in the 80s (Calvin Merrifield and Rebecca Merriefield: Call Me Retman and Have a Ball, 1979) inspired by the name Rational Emotive Therapy (that is how this form of [[cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy]] was referred to then). The prototype for the superhero was [[Albert Ellis]] himself. As “RET-Man”, Ellis is arrested by the police but not before helping a depressed jilted lover give up his thoughts of suicide in favor of more rational thinking.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rebt.org/professionals/prof_articles/nardiwebarticle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, because of the high production costs at the time, the project was abandoned after the publication of a comic.

=== Present ===
The concept was resumed in 2008, with the approval of the Albert Ellis Institute by a team of Romanian psychologists and graphic designers led by Prof. Daniel David, with a modern technology. For the first time they also investigated the efficiency of the concept in promoting psychological health and in the treatment of psychological disorders in children and adolescents (see "Meet RETMAN" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychotherapy.ro/content/view/143/122/&lt;/ref&gt;). The team developed the RETMAN concept in an innovative way, creating an entire system that includes: (1) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=12 therapeutic comics]; (2) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=13 therapeutic stories]; (3) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=14 therapeutic cartoons]; and (4) the therapeutic system RoboRETMAN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://retman.ro/?page_id=15 RoboRETMAN ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Retman technology is being used by (selection) The Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinic, UMF, [[Cluj-Napoca]], the “PsyTech” University Psychological Clinic at Babes-Bolyai, Cluj-Napoca, kindergartens and private clinical psychology/counseling/psychotherapy practices in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clinicalpsychology.ro/en/innovations/3/&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also used on the REThink Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rethink.info.ro/ REThink Project]&lt;/ref&gt; a research grant with the goal to design, develop, and evaluate a therapeutic video game accessible over the Internet,  meant to be used primarily as a standalone application to promote emotional resilience in children and adolescents.

== Concept ==
The concept was resumed by a team of designers and psychologists at the International Institute for the Advanced Studies of Psychotherapy and Applied Mental Health (link), led by “Aaron T.Beck” professor [[Daniel David]]. The institute was co-founded by the Albert Ellis Institute and [[Babes-Bolyai University]]. The concept put forward by this team was a completely changed one, using the character [[Superman]] as a model for Retman. A planet was created for Retman (Rationalia), as well as new adventures and a dangerous opponent (the evil sorcerer Irationalius)
The stories of Retman are based on an original story, developed by dr. Daniel David: “...Retman was the ruler of Planet Rationalia from the System of Ataraxia in the Happiness Galaxy. He lived in a town called Equilibrium and was a Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist, who is a person who helps you when you suffer and teaches you how to be happy. The Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist practiced “Retmagic” (a rational-emotional therapeutic magic). This gift had been given to him by the Almighty Creator of the World. All the inhabitants of the planet were happy because they had everything they wanted, but mostly because they wanted only what they knew they deserved. The secret of their happiness was therefore their minds and their way of thinking. But while Retman fostered rational thinking on the planet, his enemy, the Sorcerer Irationalius became envious of his power and stole the minds of the inhabitants of the planet. They became mean and envious and the whole planet was overtaken by evil and despair. Then the Almighty Creator of the World, in anger, destroyed everyone, sparing just Retman, as he was the only person whose mind Irationalius could not steal. He was sent on Earth with the goal of teaching everyone here to be rational and happy, so they wouldn’t end up like the inhabitants of Rationalia...”
The stories of Retman have been published in Romanian and English.

'''Rudolf Joseph Lorenz Steiner''' (27 (or 25) February 1861&lt;ref&gt;Steiner's autobiography gives his date of birth as 27 February 1861. However, there is an undated autobiographical fragment written by Steiner, referred to in a footnote in his autobiography in German (GA 28), that says, "My birth fell on 25 February 1861. Two days later I was baptized." See Christoph Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner'', [[Rowohlt Verlag|Rowohlt]] 1992, {{ISBN|3-499-50500-2}}, p. 8. In 2009 new documentation appeared supporting a date of 27 February : see Günter Aschoff, [http://www.dasgoetheanum.ch/fileadmin/wochenschrift/downloads/Forschungsbericht_Aschoff.pdf "Rudolf Steiners Geburtstag am 27.

At the beginning of the twentieth century he founded an esoteric spiritual movement, [[anthroposophy]], with roots in [[German idealism|German idealist philosophy]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]; other influences include [[Goethean science]] and [[Rosicrucianism]].&lt;ref name=RSLib&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37618538/The_Library_of_Rudolf_Steiner_The_Books_in_English The Library of Rudolf Steiner: The Books in English], Journal of Social and Development Sciences. 9 (3): 21–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first, more philosophically oriented phase of this movement, Steiner attempted to find a synthesis between [[science]] and [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Bruce Elder, ''Harmony and dissent: film and avant-garde art movements in the early twentieth century'', {{ISBN|978-1-55458-028-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gJ408vKWZ14C&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophical work of these years, which he termed "[[spiritual science]]", sought to apply the clarity of thinking characteristic of Western philosophy to spiritual questions,&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;{{rp|291}} differentiating this approach from what he considered to be vaguer approaches to mysticism. In a second phase, beginning around 1907, he began working collaboratively in a variety of artistic media, including drama, the movement arts (developing a new artistic form, [[eurythmy]]) and architecture, culminating in the building of the [[Goetheanum]], a cultural centre to house [[Gesamtkunstwerk|all the arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Sokolina, Anna, ed.

Moscow: KMK, 2001, 2010. 268p. 348 ills. 2001 {{ISBN|587317-0746}}, 2010 {{ISBN|587317-6604}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the third phase of his work, beginning after [[World War I]], Steiner worked to establish various [[#Breadth of activity|practical endeavors]], including [[Waldorf education]], [[Biodynamic Agriculture|biodynamic agriculture]],&lt;ref name=BD1924&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/18809/1/Paull2011KoberwitzEJSS.pdf "Attending the First Organic Agriculture Course: Rudolf Steiner’s Agriculture Course at Koberwitz, 1924"] ''European Journal of Social Sciences'', 21(1):64–70.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[anthroposophical medicine]].&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;Christoph Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner'', Rowohlt 1992, {{ISBN|3-499-50500-2}}, pp. 123–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner advocated a form of ethical [[individualism]], to which he later brought a more explicitly spiritual approach. He based his [[epistemology]] on [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]'s world view, in which "Thinking… is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colours and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rudolf | last = Steiner | title = Goethean Science | id = GA1 | year = 1883}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A consistent thread that runs from his earliest philosophical phase through his later spiritual orientation is the goal of demonstrating that there are no essential limits to human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Helmut | last1 = Zander | first2 = Schweizer | last2 = Fernsehen | title = Sternstunden Philosophie: Die Anthroposophie Rudolf Steiners | language = de | type = program | date = 15 February 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and education ===
[[File:Rudolf Steiner Geburtshaus,Donji Kraljevec, Croatia.JPG|thumb|left|The house where Rudolf Steiner was born, in present-day [[Croatia]]]]
Steiner's father, Johann(es) Steiner (1829 – 1910), left a position as a [[gamekeeper]]&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, Rudolf Steiner Publ. Penguin 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the service of Count [[House of Hoyos|Hoyos]] in [[Geras, Austria|Geras]], northeast [[Lower Austria]] to marry one of the Hoyos family's housemaids, Franziska Blie (1834 [[Horn, Austria|Horn]] – 1918, Horn), a marriage for which the Count had refused his permission. Johann became a telegraph operator on the Southern Austrian Railway, and at the time of Rudolf's birth was stationed in Murakirály ([[Donji Kraljevec|Kraljevec]]) in the ''[[Muraköz]]'' region of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Austrian Empire]] (present-day Donji Kraljevec in the [[Medjimurje|Međimurje]] region of northernmost [[Croatia]]). In the first two years of Rudolf's life, the family moved twice, first to [[Mödling]], near [[Vienna]], and then, through the promotion of his father to stationmaster, to [[:de:Pottschach|Pottschach]], located in the foothills of the eastern Austrian [[Alps]] in [[Lower Austria]].&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

Steiner entered the village school, but following a disagreement between his father and the schoolmaster, he was briefly educated at home. In 1869, when Steiner was eight years old, the family moved to the village of [[:de:Neudörfl|Neudörfl]] and in October 1872 Steiner proceeded from the village school there to the [[realschule]] in [[Wiener Neustadt]].&lt;ref name=Auto&gt;Rudolf Steiner [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/English/APC1928/GA028_index.html Autobiography: Chapters in the Course of My Life: 1861–1907], Lantern Books, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chap. 2}}
[[File:Rudolf Steiner als Abiturient.jpg|right|thumb|Rudolf Steiner, graduation photo from secondary school]]
In 1879, the family moved to [[Inzersdorf (Vienna)|Inzersdorf]] to enable Steiner to attend the [[TU Wien|Vienna Institute of Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;In Austria passing the ''[[matura]]'' examination at a [[Gymnasium (school)]] was required for entry to the University.[http://www.superfarm.net/pedagogika/images/stories/2007-5-eng/2007_05_eng_07-dr_tadej_vidmar-the_gymnasium_as_a_general.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; where he enrolled in courses in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[mineralogy]] and audited courses in [[literature]] and [[philosophy]], on an academic scholarship from 1879 to 1883, at the end of which time he withdrew from the Institute without graduating.&lt;ref name=Zander2&gt;Helmut Zander, ''Anthroposophie in Deutschland'', Göttingen, 2007, {{ISBN|3-525-55452-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122,443,446,456,503}}&lt;ref name=ZanderBio&gt;{{cite book|last=Zander|first=Helmut|title=Rudolf Steiner: Die Biografie|year=2011|publisher=Piper|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} In 1882, one of Steiner's teachers, [[:de:Karl Julius Schröer|Karl Julius Schröer]],&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c03.html Chap. 3]}} suggested Steiner's name to Joseph Kürschner, chief editor of a new edition of Goethe's works,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Ahern, Sun at Midnight, Publ. Cambridge, Clarke 2010 Rev Ed. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; who asked Steiner to become the edition's natural science editor,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Heidenreich]], [http://southerncrossreview.org/36/heidenreich.htm Rudolf Steiner – A Biographical Sketch]&lt;/ref&gt; a truly astonishing opportunity for a young student without any form of academic credentials or previous publications.&lt;ref name=ZanderBio/&gt;{{rp|43}}

Before attending the Vienna Institute of Technology, Steiner had studied [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Fichte]] and [[F. W. J. Schelling|Schelling]].&lt;ref name = CorrDoc&gt;Steiner, ''Correspondence and Documents 1901-1925'', 1988, p. 9. {{ISBN|0880102071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early spiritual experiences ===
[[File:Steiner als Student.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolf Steiner as 21-year-old student (1882)]]
When he was nine years old, Steiner believed that he saw the spirit of an aunt who had died in a far-off town asking him to help her at a time when neither he nor his family knew of the woman's death.&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Rudolf Steiner. ''Esoteric Lessons 1904–1909''. SteinerBooks, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner later related that as a child he felt "that one must carry the knowledge of the spiritual world within oneself after the fashion of geometry ... [for here] one is permitted to know something which the mind alone, through its own power, experiences. In this feeling I found the justification for the spiritual world that I experienced ... I confirmed for myself by means of geometry the feeling that I must speak of a world 'which is not seen'."&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;

Steiner believed that at the age of 15 he had gained a complete understanding of the concept of time, which he considered to be the precondition of spiritual [[clairvoyance]].&lt;ref name="CorrDoc"/&gt; At 21, on the train between his home village and [[Vienna]], Steiner met an herb gatherer, Felix Kogutzki, who spoke about the spiritual world "as one who had his own experience therein".&lt;ref name="Auto"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}}&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, GA 262, pp. 7–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Kogutzki conveyed to Steiner a knowledge of nature that was non-academic and spiritual.

=== Writer and philosopher ===
In 1888, as a result of his work for the Kürschner edition of [[Goethe]]'s works, Steiner was invited to work as an editor at the Goethe archives in [[Weimar]]. Steiner remained with the archive until 1896. As well as the introductions for and commentaries to four volumes of Goethe's scientific writings, Steiner wrote two books about Goethe's philosophy: ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'' (1886),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/ "Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception"], also translated as ''Goethe's Theory of Knowledge, An Outline of the Epistemology of His Worldview''&lt;/ref&gt; which Steiner regarded as the [[epistemological]] foundation and justification for his later work,&lt;ref&gt;Preface to 1924 edition of [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/English/AP1985/GA002_pre1924.html ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception, with Specific Reference to Schiller''], in which Steiner also wrote that the way of knowing he presented in this work opened the way from the sensory world to the spiritual one.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Goethe's Conception of the World'' (1897).&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Goethean Science'', Mercury Press, 1988 {{ISBN|0-936132-92-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-936132-92-1}}, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA001/English/MP1988/GA001_index.html link]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also collaborated in complete editions of the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and the writer [[Jean Paul]] and wrote numerous articles for various journals.

[[File:Rudolf Steiner um 1891.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rudolf Steiner around 1891/92, etching by Otto Fröhlich]]
In 1891, Steiner received a doctorate in philosophy at the [[University of Rostock]], for his dissertation discussing 
[[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte's]] concept of the ego,&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His thesis title was ''Die Grundfrage der Erkenntnistheorie mit besonderer Rücksicht auf Fichte's [[Wissenschaftslehre (Fichte)|Wissenschaftslehre]] – Prolegomena zur Verständigung des philosophierenden Bewusstseins mit sich selbst''.&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to [[:de:Heinrich von Stein|Heinrich von Stein]], whose ''Seven Books of Platonism'' Steiner esteemed.&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c14.html Chap. 14]}} Steiner's dissertation was later published in expanded form as ''Truth and Knowledge: Prelude to a Philosophy of Freedom'', with a dedication to [[Eduard von Hartmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA003/index.php ''Truth and Knowledge'' (full text)]. {{lang-de|Wahrheit und Wissenschaft – Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Freiheit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he published ''Die Philosophie der Freiheit'' (''[[The Philosophy of Freedom]]'' or ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity''—Steiner's preferred English title) (1894), an exploration of [[epistemology]] and ethics that suggested a way for humans to become spiritually free beings. Steiner later spoke of this book as containing implicitly, in philosophical form, the entire content of what he later developed explicitly as [[anthroposophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Prokofieff, ''May Human Beings Hear It!'', Temple Lodge, 2004. p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marie Steiner.jpg|upright|thumb|Marie Steiner 1903]]
In 1896, Steiner declined an offer from [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] to help organize the Nietzsche archive in [[Naumburg]]. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Her brother]] by that time was ''[[non compos mentis]]''. Förster-Nietzsche introduced Steiner into the presence of the [[catatonic]] philosopher; Steiner, deeply moved, subsequently wrote the book ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom'' Garber Communications; 2nd revised edition (July 1985) {{ISBN|978-0893450335}}. Online [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA005/English/GC1985/GA005_index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner later related that:

:"My first acquaintance with Nietzsche's writings belongs to the year 1889. Previous to that I had never read a line of his. Upon the substance of my ideas as these find expression in ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity'', Nietzsche's thought had not the least influence....Nietzsche's ideas of the '[[Ewige Wiederkunft|eternal recurrence]]' and of '[[Übermensch]]' remained long in my mind. For in these was reflected that which a personality must feel concerning the evolution and essential being of humanity when this personality is kept back from grasping the spiritual world by the restricted thought in the philosophy of nature characterizing the end of the 19th century....What attracted me particularly was that one could read Nietzsche without coming upon anything which strove to make the reader a 'dependent' of Nietzsche's."&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c18.html Chap. 18]}}

In 1897, Steiner left the [[Weimar]] archives and moved to Berlin. He became part owner of, chief editor of, and an active contributor to the literary journal ''Magazin für Literatur'', where he hoped to find a readership sympathetic to his philosophy. Many subscribers were alienated by Steiner's unpopular support of [[Émile Zola]] in the [[Dreyfus Affair]]&lt;ref name="GL"&gt;Gary Lachman, ''Rudolf Steiner'', Tarcher/Penguin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the journal lost more subscribers when Steiner published extracts from his correspondence with anarchist [[John Henry Mackay]].&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; Dissatisfaction with his editorial style eventually led to his departure from the magazine.

In 1899, Steiner married Anna Eunicke; the couple separated several years later. Anna died in 1911.

=== Theosophical Society ===
{{Main article|Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society}}
[[File:Steiner mit Annie Besant.jpg|right|thumb|Rudolf Steiner in Munich with Annie Besant, leader of the Theosophical Society. Photo from 1907]]
In 1899, Steiner published an article, "Goethe's Secret Revelation", discussing the esoteric nature of Goethe's fairy tale ''[[The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily]]''. This article led to an invitation by the Count and Countess Brockdorff to speak to a gathering of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] on the subject of Nietzsche. Steiner continued speaking regularly to the members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]], becoming the head of its newly constituted German section in 1902 without ever formally joining the society.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravagli/&gt; It was also in connection with this society that Steiner met and worked with [[Marie von Sivers]], who became his second wife in 1914. By 1904, Steiner was appointed by [[Annie Besant]] to be leader of the Theosophical ''Esoteric Society'' for Germany and Austria. In 1904, Eliza, the wife of [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]], became one of his favourite scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer| first1= Thomas|title= Helmuth von Moltke, Light for the new millennium: Rudolf Steiner's association with Helmuth and Eliza von Moltke: letters, documents and after-death communications''|publisher= Rudolf Steiner Press|place= London|year= 1997|ISBN= 1-85584-051-0|language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Through Eliza, Steiner met Helmuth, who served as the [[German General Staff|Chief of the German General Staff]] from 1906 to 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.it/books?isbn=0521791014|title= Helmuth Von Moltke and the Origins of the First World War|first1= Annika|last1= Mombauer |date= April 19, 2001|ISBN= 9780521019569|website= Google Books|language= en|access-date= Jun 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In contrast to mainstream Theosophy, Steiner sought to build a Western approach to spirituality based on the philosophical and mystical traditions of European culture. The German Section of the Theosophical Society grew rapidly under Steiner's leadership as he lectured throughout much of Europe on his [[spiritual science]]. During this period, Steiner maintained an original approach, replacing [[H. P. Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]]'s terminology with his own, and basing his spiritual research and teachings upon the Western esoteric and philosophical tradition. This and other differences, in particular Steiner's vocal rejection of [[C. W.

Krishnamurti: A Life. New Delhi: Penguin Books India. {{ISBN|0-14-400006-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a formal split in 1912/13,&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt; when Steiner and the majority of members of the German section of the Theosophical Society broke off to form a new group, the [[Anthroposophical Society]]. Steiner took the name "Anthroposophy" from the title of a work of the Austrian philosopher [[Robert von Zimmermann]], published in Vienna in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann's ''Geschichte der Aesthetik als philosophische Wissenschaft.: Anthroposophie im Umriss-Entwurf eines Systems idealer Weltansicht auf realistischer Grundlage'': Steiner, ''Anthroposophic Movement'': Lecture Two: ''The Unveiling of Spiritual Truths'', 11 June 1923.[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA258/English/RSP1993/19230611p01.html]. Steiner took the name but not the limitations on knowledge which Zimmerman proposed. Steiner, ''The Riddles of Philosophy'' (1914), Chapter VI, "Modern Idealistic World Conceptions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA018/English/AP1973/GA018_p02c06.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his departure from the Theosophical Society, Steiner maintained his interest in Theosophy throughout his life.&lt;ref name=RSLib&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37618538/The_Library_of_Rudolf_Steiner_The_Books_in_English The Library of Rudolf Steiner: The Books in English], Journal of Social and Development Sciences. 9 (3): 21–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anthroposophical Society and its cultural activities ===
[[File:RudolfSteiner.jpeg|right|thumb]]
The [[Anthroposophical Society]] grew rapidly. Fueled by a need to find an artistic home for their yearly conferences, which included performances of plays written by [[Edouard Schuré]] and Steiner, the decision was made to build a theater and organizational center. In 1913, construction began on the first [[Goetheanum]] building, in [[Dornach]], Switzerland. The building, designed by Steiner, was built to a significant part by volunteers who offered craftsmanship or simply a will to learn new skills. Once World War I started in 1914, the Goetheanum volunteers could hear the sound of cannon fire beyond the Swiss border, but despite the war, people from all over Europe worked peaceably side by side on the building's construction. Steiner moved from [[Berlin]] to Dornach in 1913 and lived there to the end of his life.&lt;ref  name=HausHansi&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36947843/The_Home_of_Rudolf_Steiner_Haus_Hansi The Home of Rudolf Steiner: Haus Hansi], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania, 126:19-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner's lecture activity expanded enormously with the end of the war. Most importantly, from 1919 on Steiner began to work with other members of the society to found numerous [[#Breadth of activity|practical institutions and activities]], including the first [[Waldorf schools|Waldorf school]], founded that year in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. At the same time, the Goetheanum developed as a wide-ranging cultural centre. On New Year's Eve, 1922/1923, the building burned to the ground; contemporary police reports indicate arson as the probable cause.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|752}}&lt;ref name=GA259&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rudolf Steiner |title=Das Schicksalsjahr 1923 in der Geschichte der Anthroposophischen Gesellschaft: vom Goethanumbrand zur Weihnachtstagung: Ansprachen, Versammlungen, Dokumente, Januar bis Dezember 1923 |publisher=Rudolf Steiner Verlag |pages=750–790 (esp. 787)|year=1991 |isbn=978-3-7274-2590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|796}} Steiner immediately began work designing a [[Goetheanum|second Goetheanum]] building - this time made of concrete instead of wood - which was completed in 1928, three years after his death.

At a "Foundation Meeting" for members held at the Dornach center during Christmas, 1923, Steiner spoke of laying a new [[:Wikisource:Foundation Stone meditation|Foundation Stone]] for the society in the hearts of his listeners. At the meeting, a new "General Anthroposophical Society" was established with a new executive board. At this meeting, Steiner also founded a School of Spiritual Science, intended as an "organ of initiative" for research and study and as "the 'soul' of the Anthroposophical Society".&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kiersch, ''A History of the School of Spiritual Science''. Publ. Temple Lodge 2006. p.xiii, {{ISBN|1902636805}}&lt;/ref&gt; This School, which was led by Steiner, initially had sections for general anthroposophy, [[Waldorf education|education]], [[Anthroposophical medicine|medicine]], performing arts ([[eurythmy]], speech, drama and music), the literary arts and humanities, mathematics, astronomy, science, and visual arts. Later sections were added for the social sciences, youth and agriculture.&lt;ref name=GoethRestruct&gt;[https://www.goetheanum.org/Overview.481.0.html?&amp;L=1 1923/1924 Restructuring and deepening.

=== Political engagement and social agenda ===
Steiner became a well-known and controversial public figure during and after World War I. In response to the catastrophic situation in post-war Germany, he proposed extensive social reforms through the establishment of a [[Threefold Social Order]] in which the cultural, political and economic realms would be largely independent. Steiner argued that a fusion of the three realms had created the inflexibility that had led to catastrophes such as [[First World War|World War I]]. In connection with this, he promoted a radical solution in the disputed area of [[Upper Silesia]], claimed by both Poland and Germany. His suggestion that this area be granted at least provisional independence led to his being publicly accused of being a traitor to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''Frankfurter Zeitung'', 4 March 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner opposed [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s proposal to create new European nations based around ethnic groups, which he saw as opening the door to rampant nationalism. Steiner proposed as an alternative "'social territories' with democratic institutions that were accessible to all inhabitants of a territory whatever their origin while the needs of the various ethnicities would be met by independent cultural institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Werner (2011), "Rudolf Steiner zu Individuum und Rasse: Sein Engagement gegen Rassismus und Nationalismus", in ''Anthroposophie in Geschichte und Gegenwart''. trans. Margot M. Saar&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attacks, illness, and death ===
The [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] gained strength in Germany after the First World War. In 1919, a political theorist of this movement, [[Dietrich Eckart]], attacked Steiner and suggested that he was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;Uwe Werner, ''Anthroposophen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus'', Munich (1999), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, [[Adolf Hitler]] attacked Steiner on many fronts, including accusations that he was a tool of the Jews,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defendingsteiner.com/sources/hitler-steiner.php ''Völkischer Beobachter'', 15 March 1921]&lt;/ref&gt; while other nationalist extremists in Germany called for a "war against Steiner". That same year, Steiner warned against the disastrous effects it would have for Central Europe if the National Socialists came to power.&lt;ref name="Werner" /&gt;{{rp|8}} In 1922 a lecture Steiner was giving in Munich was disrupted when stink bombs were let off and the lights switched out, while people rushed the stage apparently attempting to attack Steiner, who exited safely through a back door.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''The Esoteric Aspect of the Social Question: The Individual and Society'', Steinerbooks, p xiv and see also Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner: Eine Biographie'', pp. 769–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Riot at Munich Lecture", New York Times, 17 May 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to guarantee his safety, Steiner's agents cancelled his next lecture tour.&lt;ref name=GL/&gt;{{rp|193}}&lt;ref&gt;Marie Steiner, Introduction, in Rudolf Steiner, ''Turning Points in Spiritual History'', Dornach, September 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in Munich led Steiner to give up his residence in Berlin, saying that if those responsible for the attempted coup [Hitler and others] came to power in Germany, it would no longer be possible for him to enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesberger, [http://www.anthroposophy.com/aktuelles/wiesberger.html Die Krise der Anthroposophischen Gesellschaft 1923] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606014838/http://www.anthroposophy.com/aktuelles/wiesberger.html |date=6 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1923 on, Steiner showed signs of increasing frailness and illness. He nonetheless continued to lecture widely, and even to travel; especially towards the end of this time, he was often giving two, three or even four lectures daily for courses taking place concurrently. Many of these lectures focused on practical areas of life such as education.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lindenberg, Christoph, ''Rudolf Steiner: Eine Biographie'' Vol. II, Chapter 52. {{ISBN|3-7725-1551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rudolf Steiner Grabmal Dornach.jpg|thumb|right|Steiner's gravestone at the Goetheanum]]
Increasingly ill, he held his last lecture in late September, 1924. He continued work on his autobiography during the last months of his life; he died on 30 March 1925.

=== Spiritual research ===
Steiner first began speaking publicly about spiritual experiences and phenomena in his 1899 lectures to the Theosophical Society. By 1901 he had begun to write about spiritual topics, initially in the form of discussions of historical figures such as the [[mysticism|mystics]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. By 1904 he was expressing his own understanding of these themes in his essays and books, while continuing to refer to a wide variety of historical sources.

"A world of spiritual perception is discussed in a number of writings which I have published since this book appeared. ''The Philosophy of Freedom'' forms the philosophical basis for these later writings. For it tries to show that the experience of thinking, rightly understood, is in fact an experience of spirit." (Steiner, Philosophy of Freedom, Consequences of Monism)

Steiner aimed to apply his training in [[mathematics]], science, and philosophy to produce rigorous, verifiable presentations of those experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenberg, "Schritte auf dem Weg zur Erweiterung der Erkenntnis", pp. 77ff&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that through freely chosen [[ethics|ethical]] disciplines and [[meditation|meditative training]], anyone could develop the ability to experience the [[spirit|spiritual world]], including the higher nature of oneself and others.&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; Steiner believed that such [[discipline]] and training would help a person to become a more [[morality|moral]], [[creativity|creative]] and [[Freedom (philosophy)|free]] [[individuality|individual]] – free in the sense of being capable of actions motivated solely by love.&lt;ref name = "Schneider"/&gt; His philosophical ideas were affected by [[Franz Brentano]],&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; with whom he had studied,&lt;ref&gt;Steiner described Brentano's ''Psychology from the Empirical Standpoint'' (1870) as symptomatic of the weakness of a psychology that intended to follow the method of natural science but lacked the strength and elasticity of mind to do justice to the demand of modern times: Steiner, ''The Riddles of Philosophy'' (1914), Chapter VI, "Modern Idealistic World Conceptions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA018/English/AP1973/GA018_p02c06.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by Fichte, [[Hegel]], Schelling, and Goethe's [[Goethean science|phenomenological approach to science]].&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bockemühl, J., ''Toward a Phenomenology of the Etheric World'' {{ISBN|0-88010-115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelglass, S. et al., ''The Marriage of Sense and Thought'', {{ISBN|0-940262-82-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner followed [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] in using the term ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'', usually translated as "spiritual science".&lt;ref&gt;Dilthey had used this term in the title of one of the works listed in the Introduction to Steiner's ''Truth and Science'' (the doctoral dissertation) as concerned with the theory of cognition in general: ''Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften, usw.'', (Introduction to the Spiritual Sciences, etc.) published in 1883.{{cite web |url=http://sigbus.pvtridvs.net/pool/miscbooks/Rudolf_Steiner_-_Truth_and_Knowledge_v1.5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417102908/http://sigbus.pvtridvs.net/pool/miscbooks/Rudolf_Steiner_-_Truth_and_Knowledge_v1.5.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner used the term to describe a discipline treating the spirit as something actual and real, starting from the premise that it is possible for human beings to penetrate behind what is sense-perceptible.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/GA/GA0058/19091014p01.html "The Mission of Spiritual Science"], lecture 1 of ''Metamorphoses of the Soul: Paths of Experience'', Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that psychology, history, and the humanities generally were based on the direct grasp of an ideal reality,&lt;ref&gt;''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'', ch XIX&lt;/ref&gt; and required close attention to the particular period and culture which provided the distinctive character of religious qualities in the course of the evolution of consciousness. In contrast to William James' pragmatic approach to religious and psychic experience, which emphasized its idiosyncratic character, Steiner focused on ways such experience can be rendered more intelligible and integrated into human life.&lt;ref&gt;''William James and Rudolf Steiner'', Robert A. McDermott, 1991, in ReVision, vol.13 no.4 [http://www.ciis.edu/Documents/Academic%20Departments/PCC/McDermott_William%20James%20and%20Rudolf%20Steiner.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner proposed that an understanding of reincarnation and karma was necessary to understand psychology&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Reincarnation and Karma: Concepts Compelled by the Modern Scientific Point of view'', in ''Lucifer Gnosis'' 1903.[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/ReinKarma/ReKarm_e01.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the form of external nature would be more comprehensible as a result of insight into the course of karma in the evolution of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA235/English/RSP1972/Karm01_intro.html Introductory note to ''Karmic Relationships'']&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1910, he described aspects of karma relating to health, natural phenomena and free will, taking the position that a person is not bound by his or her karma, but can transcend this through actively taking hold of one's own nature and destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner ''Manifestations of Karma'' 4th edition 2000 {{ISBN|1855840588}}. Online [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/ManfKarma/ManKar_index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In an extensive series of lectures from February to September 1924, Steiner presented further research on successive reincarnations of various individuals and described the techniques he used for karma research.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These lectures were published as [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA235/English/RSP1972/Karm01_index.html Karmic Relationships: Esoteric Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric schools===
{{see also|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}

Steiner was founder and leader of the following: 
* His independent ''Esoteric School'' of the Theosophical Society, founded in 1904. This school continued after the break with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] but was disbanded at the start of World War I.
* A lodge called ''Mystica Aeterna'' within the [[Ancient and Primitive Rite|Masonic Order of Memphis and Mizraim]], which Steiner led from 1906 until around 1914. Steiner added to the Masonic rite a number of Rosicrucian references.&lt;ref&gt;Ellic Howe: ''The Magicians of the Golden Dawn'' London 1985, Routledge, pp 262 ff&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The School of Spiritual Science of the Anthroposophical Society, founded in 1923 as a further development of his earlier Esoteric School. This was originally constituted with a general section and seven specialized sections for education, literature, performing arts, natural sciences, medicine, visual arts, and astronomy.&lt;ref name=GoethRestruct/&gt;&lt;ref name="wn.rsarchive.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Elisabeth Vreede]], who Steiner had nominated as the first leader of the Mathematical-Astronomical Section, was responsible for the posthumous 1926 edition of Steiner's astronomy course, concerning this branch of natural science from the point of view of Anthroposophy and spiritual science, under the title ''The Relationship of the various Natural-Scientific Subjects to Astronomy'', [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA323/English/LR81/AstCrs_foreword.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner gave members of the School the first Lesson for guidance into the esoteric work in February 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guenther Wachsmuth]], ''The Life and Work of Rudolf Steiner from the Turn of the Century to his Death.'' p.53. Translated by Olin D. Wannamaker and Reginald E. Raab. 1955, Whittier Books (New York), 1955&lt;/ref&gt; Though Steiner intended to develop three "classes" of this school, only the first of these was developed in his lifetime (and continues today). An authentic text of the written records on which the teaching of the First Class was based was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kiersch, ''A History of the School of Spiritual Science: The First Class'', Temple Lodge Publishing, 2006, p.xii. The detailed account is given in chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breadth of activity ==
After the First World War, Steiner became active in a wide variety of cultural contexts. He founded a number of schools, the first of which was known as the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]],&lt;ref&gt;IN CONTEXT No. 6, Summer 1984&lt;/ref&gt; which later evolved into a worldwide school network. He also founded a system of organic agriculture, now known as [[biodynamic agriculture]], which was one of the very first forms of, and has contributed significantly to the development of, modern [[organic farming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/biodynamic.html ATTRA – National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Anthroposophic medicine|work in medicine]] led to the development of a broad range of complementary medications and supportive artistic and biographic therapies.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, M. and Rodger, I. ''Anthroposophical Medicine: Treating Body, Soul and Spirit''&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous homes for children and adults with [[developmental disabilities]] based on his work (including those of the [[Camphill movement]]) are found in Africa, Europe, and North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://camphill.net/silo/files/camphill-international-directory.pdf Camphill list of communities]&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings and drawings influenced [[Joseph Beuys]] and other modern artists. His two [[Goetheanum]] buildings have been widely cited as masterpieces of [[modern architecture]],&lt;ref&gt;Both Goetheanum buildings are listed as among the most significant 100 buildings of modern architecture by Goulet, Patrice, ''Les Temps Modernes?'', L'Architecture D'Aujourd'hui, December 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Rudolf_Steiner.html Rudolf Steiner] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051601/http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Rudolf_Steiner.html |date=24 September 2015 }}, Great Buildings Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brennan, [http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/reviews/brennan/brennan3-18-98.asp rudolf steiner], ''Artnet''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hortola, Policarp.

Steiner's [[literary estate]] is correspondingly broad. Steiner's writings, published in about forty volumes, include books, essays, [[Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas|four plays]] ('mystery dramas'), mantric verse, and an autobiography. His collected lectures, making up another approximately 300 volumes, discuss an extremely wide range of themes. Steiner's drawings, chiefly illustrations done on blackboards during his lectures, are collected in a separate series of 28 volumes. Many publications have covered his architectural legacy and sculptural work.

=== Education ===
[[File:Ecole Steiner-Waldorf Verrieres2.jpg|thumb|The Waldorf school in [[Verrières-le-Buisson]] (France)]]
{{main article|Waldorf education}}
As a young man, Steiner was a private tutor and a lecturer on history for the Berlin ''Arbeiterbildungsschule'',&lt;ref name=zander2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Zander|first=Helmut|title=Anthroposophie in Deutschland|year=2007|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; an educational initiative for working class adults.&lt;ref name=njacobs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Nicholas|title=The German Social Democratic Party School in Berlin, 1906–1914|journal=History Workshop|date=Spring 1978|volume=5|pages=179–187|doi=10.1093/hwj/5.1.179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, he began to articulate his ideas on education in public lectures,&lt;ref name="Ullrich"/&gt; culminating in a 1907 essay on ''The Education of the Child'' in which he described the major phases of child development which formed the foundation of his approach to education.&lt;ref&gt;The original essay was published in the journal ''Lucifer-Gnosis'' in 1907 and can be found in Steiner's collected essays, ''Lucifer-Gnosis 1903-1908'',
GA34. This essay was republished as an independent brochure in 1909; in a [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/EduChild/EduChi_note.html Prefatory note to this edition], Steiner refers to recent lectures on the subject.

In 1919, [[Emil Molt]] invited him to lecture to his workers at the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart. Out of these lectures came a new school, the Waldorf school. In 1922, Steiner presented these ideas at a conference called for this purpose in [[Oxford]] by Professor [[Millicent Mackenzie]]. He subsequently presented a teacher training course at [[Torquay]] in 1924 at an [[Anthroposophy]] Summer School organised by [[Eleanor Merry]].&lt;ref name=Torquay&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36404489/Torquay_In_the_Footsteps_of_Rudolf_Steiner Torquay: In the Footsteps of Rudolf Steiner], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania. 125 (Mar): 26–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford Conference and the Torquay teacher training led to the founding of the first Waldorf schools in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/18835/1/Paull2011OxfordEJES.pdf Rudolf Steiner and the Oxford Conference: The Birth of Waldorf Education in Britain].

=== Biodynamic agriculture ===
{{Main article|Biodynamic agriculture}}
In 1924, a group of farmers concerned about the future of agriculture requested Steiner's help. Steiner responded with a lecture series on an [[ecological agriculture|ecological]] and [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable]] approach to agriculture that increased soil fertility without the use of [[chemical fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s.&lt;ref name="BD1924"/&gt; Steiner's agricultural ideas promptly spread and were put into practice internationally&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://www.oalib.com/paper/2894417 "The secrets of Koberwitz: The diffusion of Rudolf Steiner’s Agriculture Course and the founding of Biodynamic Agriculture"], ''Journal of Social Research &amp; Policy'', 2(1):19–29.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biodynamic agriculture]] is now practiced in Europe,&lt;ref name=olympiad&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paull|first=John|title=Organics Olympiad 2011: Global Indices of Leadership in Organic Agriculture|journal=Journal of Social and Development Sciences|year=2011|volume=1|issue=4|pages=144–150|url=http://orgprints.org/18860/1/Paull2011OlympiadJSDS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; North America, South America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/06/biodynamic-coffee-in-brazil|title=Biodynamic coffee farming in Brazil|last=Purvis|first=Andrew|date=2009-12-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greenafricadirectory.org/listing/biodynamic-agricultural-association-of-southern-africa/|title=Biodynamic Agricultural Association of Southern Africa - Green Africa Directory|work=Green Africa Directory|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Asia&lt;ref name="olympiad"/&gt; and [[Australasia]].&lt;ref name=Koberwitz&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://www.organic-systems.org/journal/Vol_6(1)/pdf/6(1)-Paull-pp27-41.pdf "Biodynamic Agriculture: The Journey from Koberwitz to the World, 1924–1938"], ''Journal of Organic Systems'', 2011, 6(1):27–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodynamics.com/regional.html Groups in N.

A central aspect of biodynamics is that the farm as a whole is seen as an organism, and therefore should be a largely self-sustaining system, producing its own [[manure]] and [[Fodder|animal feed]]. Plant or animal disease is seen as a symptom of problems in the whole organism. Steiner also suggested timing such agricultural activities as sowing, weeding, and harvesting to utilize the influences on plant growth of the [[moon]] and [[planets]]; and the application of natural materials prepared in specific ways to the [[soil]], [[composting|compost]], and crops, with the intention of engaging non-physical beings and elemental forces. He encouraged his listeners to verify his suggestions [[scientific method|empirically]], as he had not yet done.&lt;ref name="Koberwitz"/&gt;

=== Anthroposophical medicine ===
{{Main article|Anthroposophical medicine}}
From the late 1910s, Steiner was working with doctors to create a new approach to medicine. In 1921, [[pharmacist]]s and physicians gathered under Steiner's guidance to create a pharmaceutical company called [[Weleda]] which now distributes natural medical products worldwide. At around the same time, Dr. [[Ita Wegman]] founded a first anthroposophic medical clinic (now the Ita Wegman Clinic) in [[Arlesheim]].

=== Social reform===
{{main article|Threefold Social Order}}
For a period after World War I, Steiner was active as a lecturer on social reform. A petition expressing his basic social ideas was widely circulated and signed by many cultural figures of the day, including [[Hermann Hesse]].

In Steiner's chief book on [[social reform]], ''Toward Social Renewal'', he suggested that the cultural, political and economic spheres of society need to work together as consciously cooperating yet independent entities, each with a particular task: political institutions should establish [[Equality before the law|political equality]] and protect [[human rights]]; cultural institutions should nurture the free and unhindered development of science, art, education and religion; and economic institutions should enable producers, distributors and consumers to cooperate to provide efficiently for society's needs.&lt;ref name="Essential"&gt;Robert McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', Harper San Francisco 1984 {{ISBN|0-06-065345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw such a division of responsibility, which he called the [[Threefold Social Order]], as a vital task which would take up consciously the historical trend toward the mutual independence of these three realms. Steiner also gave suggestions for many specific social reforms.

Steiner proposed what he termed a "fundamental law" of social life:

{{Quote|The well-being of a community of people working together will be the greater, the less the individual claims for himself the proceeds of his work, i.e. the more of these proceeds he makes over to his fellow-workers, the more his own needs are satisfied, not out of his own work but out of the work done by others.|Steiner|The Fundamental Social Law&lt;ref name=Fundamental&gt;Steiner (1917), [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/FuSoLa_index.html "The Fundamental Social Law"], translated in ''Selected writings
of Rudolf Steiner'' (1993), Richard Seddon (Ed.), Rudolf Steiner Press, Bristol. {{ISBN|1 85584 005 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He expressed this in the motto:&lt;ref name=Fundamental/&gt;
 The healthy social life is found 
 When in the mirror of each human soul 
 The whole community finds its reflection, 
 And when in the community 
 The virtue of each one is living.

[[File:Edith Maryon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|English sculptor [[Edith Maryon]] belonged to the innermost circle of founders of anthroposophy and was appointed to head the Section of Sculptural Arts at the Goetheanum.]]
Steiner designed 17 buildings, including the [[Goetheanum|First and Second Goetheanums]].&lt;ref&gt;Sokolina, Anna P. "Biology in Architecture: the Goetheanum Case Study."

His primary sculptural work is ''The Representative of Humanity'' (1922), a nine-meter high wood sculpture executed as a joint project with the sculptor [[Edith Maryon]]. This was intended to be placed in the first Goetheanum. It shows a central, free-standing Christ holding a balance between the beings of [[Lucifer]] and [[Ahriman]], representing opposing tendencies of expansion and contraction.&lt;ref&gt;''Art as Spiritual Activity: Rudolf Steiner's Contribution to the Visual Arts''.

Steiner's blackboard drawings were unique at the time and almost certainly not originally intended as art works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthromedia.net/en/themes/anthroposophy/rudolf-steiner-life-and-work/black-board-drawings/ Thought-Pictures - Rudolf Steiner’s Blackboard Drawings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504002748/http://www.anthromedia.net/en/themes/anthroposophy/rudolf-steiner-life-and-work/black-board-drawings/ |date=4 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josef Beuys]]' work, itself heavily influenced by Steiner, has led to the modern understanding of Steiner's drawings as artistic objects.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Rinder, [http://antroposofi.org/blackboard/steineressay.html Rudolf Steiner: An Aesthetic Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performing arts ===
{{See also|Eurythmy}}
Steiner wrote four [[mystery plays]] between 1909 and 1913: ''The Portal of Initiation'', ''The Souls' Probation'', ''The Guardian of the Threshold'' and ''The Soul's Awakening'', modeled on the esoteric dramas of Edouard Schuré, [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]] 'On Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas, Four Lectures Given in Spring Valley, 1948' {{ISBN|0-936132-93-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner's plays continue to be performed by anthroposophical groups in various countries, most notably (in the original German) in Dornach, Switzerland and (in English translation) in Spring Valley, New York and in Stroud and Stourbridge in the U.K.

In collaboration with Marie von Sivers, Steiner also founded a new approach to acting, storytelling, and the recitation of poetry. His last public lecture course, given in 1924, was on speech and drama. The Russian actor, director, and acting coach [[Michael Chekhov]] based significant aspects of his method of acting on Steiner's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ojs-prod.library.usyd.edu.au/index.php/LA/article/viewFile/5054/5759 |title=On Rudolf Steiner's Impact on the Training of the Actor |author=Anderson, Neil |journal=Literature &amp; Aesthetics |date=June 2011 |volume=21|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Solomon, [http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/solomonr2002.pdf Michael Chekhov and His Approach to Acting in Contemporary Performance Training] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803154254/http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/solomonr2002.pdf |date=3 August 2016 }}, MA thesis University of Maine, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Marie von Sivers]], Rudolf Steiner also developed the art of [[eurythmy]], sometimes referred to as "visible speech and song". According to the principles of eurythmy, there are archetypal movements or gestures that correspond to every aspect of speech – the sounds (or [[phonemes]]), the rhythms, and the grammatical function – to every "soul quality" – joy, despair, tenderness, etc. – and to every aspect of music – tones, intervals, rhythms, and harmonies.

=== Goethean science &lt;!--linked from 'Goethean science'--&gt;===
{{See also|Goethean science}}
In his commentaries on Goethe's scientific works, written between 1884 and 1897, Steiner presented Goethe's approach to science as essentially [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] in nature, rather than theory- or model-based. He developed this conception further in several books, ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'' (1886) and ''Goethe's Conception of the World'' (1897), particularly emphasizing the transformation in Goethe's approach from the physical sciences, where experiment played the primary role, to plant biology, where both accurate perception and imagination were required to find the biological archetypes (''Urpflanze''), and postulated that Goethe had sought but been unable to fully find the further transformation in scientific thinking necessary to properly interpret and understand the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name=Hemleben&gt;Johannes Hemleben, ''Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography'', Henry Goulden Ltd, 1975, {{ISBN|0-904822-02-8}}, pp. 37–49 and pp. 96–100 (German edition: Rowohlt Verlag, 1990, {{ISBN|3-499-50079-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner emphasized the role of evolutionary thinking in Goethe's discovery of the [[intermaxillary segment|intermaxillary bone]] in human beings; Goethe expected human anatomy to be an evolutionary transformation of animal anatomy.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt; Steiner defended [[Goethe's theory of color|Goethe's qualitative description of color]] as arising synthetically from the polarity of light and darkness, in contrast to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s particle-based and analytic conception.

This is the radical difference between inorganic and organic science.|author=Rudolf Steiner|source=The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception, Chapter XVI, "Organic Nature"}}

=== Knowledge and freedom ===
{{See also|Philosophy of Freedom}}
Steiner approached the philosophical questions of [[epistemology|knowledge]] and [[Free will|freedom]] in two stages. In his dissertation, published in expanded form in 1892 as ''Truth and Knowledge'', Steiner suggests that there is an inconsistency between Kant's philosophy, which posits that all knowledge is a representation of an essential verity inaccessible to human consciousness, and modern science, which assumes that all influences can be found in the sensory and mental world to which we have access. Steiner considered Kant's philosophy of an inaccessible beyond ("Jenseits-Philosophy") a stumbling block in achieving a satisfying philosophical viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Storr]], ''Feet of Clay'', Free Press-Simon and Schuster, 1996. Storr quotes Steiner p72, "If, however, we regard the sum of all percepts as the one part and contrast with this a second part, namely the things-in-themselves, then we are philosophising into the blue. We are merely playing with concepts."&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner postulates that the world is essentially an indivisible unity, but that our [[consciousness]] divides it into the [[senses|sense]]-perceptible appearance, on the one hand, and the formal nature accessible to our [[thinking]], on the other. He sees in thinking itself an element that can be strengthened and deepened sufficiently to penetrate all that our senses do not reveal to us. Steiner thus considered what appears to human experience as a division between the spiritual and natural worlds to be a conditioned result of the structure of our consciousness, which separates [[perception]] and thinking. These two faculties give us not two worlds, but two complementary views of the same world; neither has primacy and the two together are necessary and sufficient to arrive at a complete understanding of the world. In thinking about [[perception]] (the path of natural science) and perceiving the process of thinking (the path of [[spirituality|spiritual]] training), it is possible to discover a hidden inner unity between the two poles of our experience.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 4}} [[Truth]], for Steiner, is paradoxically both an objective discovery and yet "a free creation of the human spirit, that never would exist at all if we did not generate it ourselves. The task of understanding is not to replicate in conceptual form something that already exists, but rather to create a wholly new realm, that together with the world given to our senses constitutes the fullness of reality."&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Rudolf, ''Truth and Science'', Preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', Steiner further explores potentials within thinking: freedom, he suggests, can only be approached gradually with the aid of the creative activity of thinking. Thinking can be a free deed; in addition, it can liberate our will from its subservience to our [[instinct]]s and [[motivation|drive]]s. Free deeds, he suggests, are those for which we are fully conscious of the motive for our action; freedom is the spiritual activity of penetrating with consciousness our own nature and that of the world,&lt;ref&gt;"To be conscious of the laws underlying one's actions is to be conscious of one's freedom. The process of knowing ... is the process of development towards freedom." Steiner, GA3, pp. 91f, quoted in Rist and Schneider, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; and the real activity of acting in full consciousness.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;{{rp|133–4}} This includes overcoming influences of both heredity and environment: "To be free is to be capable of thinking one's own thoughts – not the thoughts merely of the body, or of society, but thoughts generated by one's deepest, most original, most essential and spiritual self, one's individuality."&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;

Steiner affirms [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s and [[Haeckel]]'s [[evolution]]ary perspectives but extended this beyond its [[materialism|materialistic]] consequences; he sees human [[consciousness]], indeed, all human culture, as a product of natural evolution that transcends itself. For Steiner, nature becomes self-conscious in the human being. Steiner's description of the nature of human consciousness thus closely parallels that of [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]]:&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tarnas, ''The Passion of the Western Mind'', {{ISBN|0-7126-7332-6}}. Cf. Solovyov: "In human beings, the absolute subject-object appears ''as such'', i.e. as pure spiritual activity, containing all of its own objectivity, the whole process of its natural manifestation, but containing it totally ideally – in consciousness....The subject knows here only its own activity as an objective activity (sub specie object). Thus, the original identity of subject and object is restored in philosophical knowledge." (''The Crisis of Western Philosophy'', Lindisfarne 1996 pp. 42–3)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spiritual science ===
{{See also|Anthroposophy|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}
[[File:Steiner Berlin 1900 big.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolf Steiner 1900]]
In his earliest works, Steiner already spoke of the "natural and spiritual worlds" as a unity.&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; From 1900 on, he began lecturing about concrete details of the spiritual world(s), culminating in the publication in 1904 of the first of several systematic presentations, his ''Theosophy: An Introduction to the Spiritual Processes in Human Life and in the Cosmos''. As a starting point for the book Steiner took a quotation from Goethe, describing the method of natural scientific observation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/English/RSP1965/GA009_c01.html ''Theosophy'', Chapter I: The Essential Nature of Man]&lt;/ref&gt; while in the Preface he made clear that the line of thought taken in this book led to the same goal as that in his earlier work, ''The Philosophy of Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;''Theosophy'',
from the Prefaces to the First, Second, and Third Editions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/English/AP1971/GA009_c01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 1903–1908 Steiner maintained the magazine "Lucifer-Gnosis" and published in it essays on topics such as initiation, reincarnation and karma, and knowledge of the supernatural world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsarchive.org/Articles/GA034/ Articles from "Lucifer-Gnosis," 1903–1908]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were later collected and published as books, such as ''How to Know Higher Worlds'' (1904/5) and ''Cosmic Memory''. The book ''An Outline of Esoteric Science'' was published in 1910. Important themes include:
* the human being as body, [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]];
* the path of spiritual development;
* spiritual influences on world-evolution and history; and
* [[reincarnation]] and [[karma]].

Steiner emphasized that there is an objective natural and spiritual world that can be known, and that perceptions of the spiritual world and incorporeal beings are, under conditions of training comparable to that required for the natural sciences, including self-discipline, replicable by multiple observers. It is on this basis that [[spiritual science]] is possible, with radically different epistemological foundations than those of natural science. He believed that natural science was correct in its methods but one-sided for exclusively focusing on sensory phenomena, while mysticism was vague in its methods, though seeking to explore the inner and spiritual life. Anthroposophy was meant to apply the systematic methods of the former to the content of the latter&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Christianity as Mystical Fact and the Mysteries of Antiquity'', Anthroposophic Press 2006 {{ISBN|0880104368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One of Steiner's teachers, Franz Brentano, had famously declared that "The true method of philosophy can only be the method of natural science" (Walach, Harald, "Criticism of Transpersonal Psychology and Beyond", in The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology, ed. H. L. Friedman and G. Hartelius. P. 45.)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Steiner, the cosmos is permeated and continually transformed by the creative activity of non-physical processes and spiritual beings. For the human being to become conscious of the objective reality of these processes and beings, it is necessary to creatively enact and reenact, within, their creative activity. Thus objective spiritual knowledge always entails creative inner activity.&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; Steiner articulated three stages of any creative deed:&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;{{rp|Pt II, Chapter 1}}
* Moral intuition: the ability to discover or, preferably, develop valid ethical principles;
* Moral imagination: the imaginative transformation of such principles into a concrete intention applicable to the particular situation ([[situational ethics]]); and
* Moral technique: the realization of the intended transformation, depending on a mastery of practical skills.

Steiner termed his work from this period onwards ''[[Anthroposophy]]''. He emphasized that the spiritual path he articulated builds upon and supports individual freedom and independent [[judgment]]; for the results of spiritual research to be appropriately presented in a modern context they must be in a form accessible to [[logic]]al understanding, so that those who do not have access to the spiritual experiences underlying anthroposophical research can make independent evaluations of the latter's results.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;Peter Schneider, ''Einführung in die Waldorfpädagogik'', {{ISBN|3-608-93006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual training is to support what Steiner considered the overall purpose of human evolution, the development of the mutually interdependent qualities of love and [[free will|freedom]].&lt;ref name=RAMcD&gt;Robert A. McDermott, "Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy", in Faivre and Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', {{ISBN|0-8245-1444-0}}, p. 288ff&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Steiner and Christianity ===
In 1899 Steiner experienced what he described as a life-transforming inner encounter with the being of Christ; previously he had little or no relation to Christianity in any form. Then and thereafter, his relationship to Christianity remained entirely founded upon personal experience, and thus both non-denominational and strikingly different from conventional religious forms.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt; Steiner was then 38, and the experience of meeting the Christ occurred after a tremendous inner struggle. To use Steiner's own words, the "experience culminated in my standing in the spiritual presence of the Mystery of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] in a most profound and solemn festival of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography, Chapters In The Course Of My Life: 18611907, Rudolf Steiner, SteinerBooks, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christ and human evolution ====
Steiner describes Christ as the unique pivot and meaning of earth's evolutionary processes and human history, redeeming [[The Fall of Man|the Fall]] from [[Paradise]].&lt;ref name="Willmann"&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädagogik: Theologische und religionspädagogische Befunde'', Kölner Veröffentlichungen zur Religionsgeschichte, Volume 27, {{ISBN|3-412-16700-2}}, especially Chapters 1.3, 1.4&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the Christ as a being that unifies and inspires all religions, not belonging to a particular religious faith. To be "Christian" is, for Steiner, a search for balance between polarizing extremes&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;{{rp|102–3}} and the ability to manifest love in freedom.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;

Central principles of his understanding include:
*The being of Christ is central to ''all'' religions, though called by different names by each.
*Every religion is valid and true for the time and cultural context in which it was born.
*Historical forms of Christianity need to be transformed in our times in order to meet the ongoing evolution of humanity.

In Steiner's [[esoteric cosmology]], the spiritual development of humanity is interwoven in and inseparable from the cosmological development of the universe. Continuing the evolution that led to humanity being born out of the natural world, the Christ being brings an impulse enabling human consciousness of the forces that act creatively, but unconsciously, in nature.&lt;ref&gt;An Outline of Esoteric Science, Anthroposophic, SteinerBooks, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Divergence from conventional Christian thought ====
Steiner's views of Christianity diverge from conventional Christian thought in key places, and include gnostic elements.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt; However, unlike many gnostics, Steiner affirms the unique and actual physical Incarnation of Christ in Jesus at the beginning of the Christian era.

One of the central points of divergence with conventional Christian thought is found in [[Anthroposophy#Nature of the human being|Steiner's views on reincarnation and karma]].

Steiner also posited two different Jesus children involved in the Incarnation of the Christ: one child descended from [[Solomon]], as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]; the other child from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], as described in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; He references in this regard the fact that the [[genealogy|genealogies]] in these two gospels list twenty-six (Luke) to forty-one (Matthew) completely different ancestors for the generations from [[King David|David]] to Jesus. See [[Genealogy of Jesus]] for alternative explanations of this radical divergence.

Steiner's view of the [[second coming]] of Christ is also unusual. He suggested that this would not be a physical reappearance, but rather, meant that the Christ being would become manifest in non-physical form, in the "[[Etheric plane|etheric]] realm" – i.e. visible to spiritual vision and apparent in community life – for increasing numbers of people, beginning around the year 1933. He emphasized that the future would require humanity to recognize this Spirit of Love in all its genuine forms, regardless of how this is named. He also warned that the traditional name, "Christ", might be used, yet the true essence of this Being of Love ignored.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt;

==== The Christian Community ====
In the 1920s, Steiner was approached by [[Friedrich Rittelmeyer]], a [[Lutheran]] pastor with a congregation in Berlin, who asked if it was possible to create a more modern form of Christianity. Soon others joined Rittelmeyer – mostly Protestant pastors and theology students, but including several Roman Catholic priests. Steiner offered counsel on renewing the spiritual potency of the sacraments while emphasizing [[freedom of thought]] and a personal relationship to religious life. He envisioned a new synthesis of Catholic and Protestant approaches to religious life, terming this "modern, [[John the Evangelist|Johannine Christianity]]".&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;

The resulting movement for religious renewal became known as "[[The Christian Community]]". Its work is based on a free relationship to the Christ, without dogma or policies. Its priesthood, which is open to both men and women, is free to preach out of their own spiritual insights and creativity.

Steiner emphasized that the resulting movement for the renewal of Christianity was a personal gesture of help to a movement founded by Rittelmeyer and others independently of his anthroposophical work.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; The distinction was important to Steiner because he sought with Anthroposophy to create a scientific, not [[faith]]-based, spirituality.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; He recognized that for those who wished to find more traditional forms, however, a renewal of the traditional religions was also a vital need of the times.

See also p. 98, where Hammer states that – unusually for founders of esoteric movements – Steiner's self-descriptions of the origins of his thought and work correspond to the view of external historians.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Schweitzer]] wrote that he and Steiner had in common that they had "taken on the life mission of working for the emergence of a true culture enlivened by the ideal of humanity and to encourage people to become truly thinking beings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theosophyforward.com/theosophy-and-the-society-in-the-public-eye/181-albert-schweitzers-friendship-with-rudolf-steiner Albert Schweitzer: Friendship with Rudolf Steiner]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Storr]] stated about Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy: "His belief system is so eccentric, so unsupported by evidence, so manifestly bizarre, that rational skeptics are bound to consider it delusional."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Storr|first1=Anthony|author-link1=Anthony Storr|last2= |first2= |author-link2= |last3= |first3= |author-link3= |last4= |first4= |author-link4= |last5= |first5= |author-link5= |display-authors= |author-mask= |lastauthoramp= |date= |year=1997|orig-year=1996|chapter=IV.

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] has said of Steiner that "Some of his ideas on education – such as educating the handicapped in the mainstream – are worth considering, although his overall plan for developing the spirit and the soul rather than the intellect cannot be admired".&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepdic.com/steiner.html| title= The Skeptic's Dictionary: Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925)|date=12 September 2004|accessdate=15 December 2010| author=[[Robert Todd Carroll]]| work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner's translators have pointed out that his use of ''Geist'' includes both mind and spirit, however,&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Amrine and Konrad Oberhuber (trans.), in Rudolf Steiner, ''The Boundaries of Natural Science'', Spring Valley, NY: Anthroposophic Press. {{ISBN|0-88010-018-4}}. p. 125, fn. 1&lt;/ref&gt; as the German term ''Geist'' can be translated equally properly in either way.&lt;ref&gt;J.

The 150th anniversary of Rudolf Steiner's birth was marked by the first major retrospective exhibition of his art and work, 'Kosmos - Alchemy of the everyday'. Organized by [[Vitra Design Museum]], the traveling exhibition presented many facets of Steiner's life and achievements, including his influence on architecture, furniture design, dance ([[Eurythmy]]), [[Waldorf education|education]], and agriculture ([[Biodynamic agriculture]]).&lt;ref name=SteinerExhibition&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code//32607416 Rudolf Steiner - Alchemy of the Everyday - Kosmos - A photographic review of the exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition opened in 2011 at the [[Kunstmuseum Stuttgart|Kunstmuseum]] in [[Stuttgart]], Germany,&lt;ref name=Kosmos&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19512/1/Paull2011KosmosJBDT.pdf "A Postcard from Stuttgart: Rudolf Steiner's 150th anniversary exhibition 'Kosmos'"], Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania, 103 (September ), pp. 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientism ===
{{see also|Anthroposophy#Scientific_basis|l1=Anthroposophy: Scientific basis}}
[[Olav Hammer]] has criticized as [[scientism]] Steiner's claim to use scientific methodology to investigate spiritual phenomena that were based upon his claims of [[clairvoyant]] experience.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt; Steiner regarded the observations of spiritual research as more dependable (and above all, consistent) than observations of physical reality. However, he did consider spiritual research to be fallible&lt;ref name=Zander2/&gt;{{rp|p. 618}} and held the view that anyone capable of thinking logically was in a position to correct errors by spiritual researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner: "It may even happen that a researcher who has the power of perception in supersensible realms may fall into error in his logical presentation, and that someone who has no supersensible perception, but who has the capacity for sound thinking, may correct him."[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA013/English/AP1972/GA013_c04-01.html Occult Science, Chapter IV]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and ethnicity===
&lt;!-- this section is linked from [[Waldorf education]]--&gt; 
Steiner's work includes both universalist, humanist elements and historically influenced racial assumptions.&lt;ref name=Staud&gt;{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Staudenmaier|title=Race and Redemption|journal=Nova Religio|publisher=University of California Press|date=February 2008|pages=4ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the contrast and even contradictions between these elements, "whether a given reader interprets Anthroposophy as racist or not depends upon that reader's concerns".&lt;ref name=Zander&gt;"Es hängt dabei von den Interessen der Leser ab, ob die Anthroposophie rassistisch interpretiert wird oder nicht." Helmut Zander, "Sozialdarwinistische Rassentheorien aus dem okkulten Untergrund des Kaiserreichs", in Puschner et al., Handbuch zur "Völkischen Bewegung" 1871–1918: 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner considered that by dint of its shared language and culture, each people has a unique essence, which he called its soul or spirit.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt; He saw race as a physical manifestation of humanity's spiritual evolution, and at times discussed race in terms of complex hierarchies that were largely derived from 19th century biology, anthropology, philosophy and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]. However, he consistently and explicitly subordinated race, ethnicity, gender, and indeed all hereditary factors, to individual factors in development.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; For Steiner, human individuality is centered in a person's unique biography, and he believed that an individual's experiences and development are not bound by a single lifetime or the qualities of the physical body.&lt;ref name=Ravagli&gt;Lorenzo Ravagli, ''Zanders Erzählungen'', Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-8305-1613-2}}, pp. 184f&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically:

* Steiner occasionally characterized specific [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]s, nations and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] in ways that have been termed [[racism|racist]] by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Arno Frank, "Einschüchterung auf Waldorf-Art", ''Die Tageszeitung'' 4 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes descriptions by him of certain races and ethnic groups as flowering, others as backward, or destined to degenerate or disappear.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; He presented explicitly hierarchical views of the spiritual evolution of different races,&lt;ref&gt;Corinna Treitel, ''A Science for the Soul: Occultism and the Genesis of the German Modern'', Johns Hopkins Press, {{ISBN|0-8018-7812-8}}, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; including—at times, and inconsistently—portraying the [[white race]], [[European culture]] or Germanic culture as representing the high point of human [[evolution]] as of the early 20th century, although he did describe them as destined to be superseded by future cultures.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt;
* Throughout his life Steiner consistently emphasized the core spiritual unity of all the world's peoples and sharply criticized racial prejudice. He articulated beliefs that the individual nature of any person stands higher than any racial, ethnic, national or religious affiliation.&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;&lt;!--CL, p.55--&gt; His belief that race and [[ethnicity]] are transient and superficial, and not essential aspects of the individual,&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; was partly rooted in his conviction that each individual [[reincarnation|reincarnates]] in a variety of different peoples and races over successive lives, and that each of us thus bears within him or herself the heritage of many races and peoples.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Blume, "Joseph Beuys". In Kugler and Baur, ''Rudolf Steiner in Kunst und Architektur'', {{ISBN|3-8321-9012-0}}, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of his life, Steiner predicted that race will rapidly lose any remaining significance for future generations.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; In Steiner's view, culture is universal, and explicitly not ethnically based; he saw Goethe and [[German idealism|idealist philosophy]] in particular as the source of ideas that could be drawn upon by any culture, and he vehemently criticized imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Myers, "Colonial consciousness: Rudolf Steiner's Orientalism and German Cultural Identity", ''Journal of European Studies'' 36(4): 387–417&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of his ethical individualism, Steiner considered "race, folk, ethnicity and gender" to be general, describable categories into which individuals may choose to fit, but from which free human beings can and will liberate themselves.&lt;ref name=Ravagli/&gt;

==== Judaism ====
During the years when Steiner was best known as a literary critic, he published a series of articles attacking various manifestations of [[antisemitism]]&lt;ref&gt;''Mitteilungen aus dem Verein zur Abwehr des Antisemitismus'', '''11'''(37):307-8, 11 September 1901. [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/abwehr/Blatt_bsb00000905,00315.html Article]. ''Mitteilungen'', '''11'''(38):316, 18 September 1901. [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/abwehr/Blatt_bsb00000905,00324.html Article]. Cf. GA31 for a complete list and text of articles.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticizing some of the most prominent anti-Semites of the time as "barbaric" and "enemies of culture".&lt;ref name=HuH&gt;[http://db.swr.de/upload/manuskriptdienst/wissen/wi20041122_2812.rtf "Hammer und Hakenkreuz – Anthroposophie im Visier der völkischen Bewegung"], ''Südwestrundfunk'', 26 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On a number of occasions, however, Steiner suggested that Jewish cultural and social life had lost all contemporary relevance&lt;ref&gt;Thesenpapier von Dr. Jan Badewien zur Veranstaltung: Antijudaismus bei Rudolf Steiner?, [http://groups.uni-paderborn.de/berufspaedagogik/lehrstuhl/forum-thesen-badewien.html Universität Paderborn], 23.01.02.&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted full [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] of the Jewish people into the nations in which they lived. This stance has come under severe criticism in recent years.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt;

Steiner was a critic of his contemporary [[Theodor Herzl]]'s goal of a [[Zionism|Zionist]] state, and indeed of any ethnically determined state, as he considered ethnicity to be an outmoded basis for social life and civic identity.&lt;ref&gt;"The need to overcome nationalism was one of the central themes of [Steiner's] social agenda": Hans-Jürgen Bracker, "The individual and the unity of humankind". in ''Judaism and Anthroposophy'', ed. Fred Paddock and Mado Spiegler. Anthroposophic Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0880105100}}. p. 100. See also "Humanistischer Zionismus", in Novalis 5 (1997): "Steiner generell die allmähliche Überwindung und Auflösung von Stammes-, Volks-, Nationen- und »Rasse«-grenzen vertrat"&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of Steiner's life and after his death, there were massive defamatory press attacks mounted on him by early [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] leaders (including [[Adolf Hitler]]) and other right-wing nationalists. These criticized Steiner's thought and [[anthroposophy]] as being incompatible with National Socialist racial ideology, and charged him of being influenced by his close connections with Jews and even that he himself was Jewish.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuH/&gt;

The '''science of morality''' may refer to various forms of [[ethical naturalism]] grounding [[morality]] in rational, [[empirical]] consideration of the natural world.&lt;ref name="sep-naturalism-moral"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Lenman |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2008 |title=Moral Naturalism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/naturalism-moral/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Moral science may refer to the consideration of what is best for, and how to maximize the [[flourishing]] of, either particular individuals&lt;ref&gt;Carrier&lt;/ref&gt; or all conscious creatures.&lt;ref name="tedharris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Moral Landscape'', pp. 39ff&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been proposed that "morality" can be appropriately defined on the basis of fundamental premises necessary for ''any'' empirical, secular, and philosophical discussion and that societies can use the methods of science to provide answers to moral questions.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Daleiden ''The Science of Morality: The Individual, Community, and Future Generations''; [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', 2010; and Richard Carrier ''Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote  = In sum, from the perspective of neuroscience and brain evolution, the routine rejection of scientific approaches to moral behavior based on [[David Hume|Hume]]’s warning against deriving ''ought'' from ''is'' seems unfortunate, especially as the warning is limited to deductive inferences.

The norms advocated by moral scientists (e.g. rights to [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], and [[drug liberalization]] under certain circumstances) would be founded upon the shifting and growing collection of human understanding.&lt;ref name=DaleidenSummary/&gt;  Even with science's admitted degree of ignorance, and the various semantic issues, moral scientists can meaningfully discuss things as being ''almost certainly'' "better" or "worse" for promoting flourishing.&lt;ref name=HarrisFlourishing&gt;Sam Harris (2010), page 183: "Much of the skepticism I encounter when speaking about these issues comes from people who think "happiness" is a superficial state of mind and that there are far more important things in life than "being happy." Some reasers may think that concepts like "well-being" and "flourishing" are similarly effete. However, I don't know of any better terms with which to signify the most positive states of being to which we can aspire. One of the virtues of thinking about a moral landscape, the heights of which remain to be discovered, is that it frees us from these semantic difficulties. Generally speaking, we need only worry about what it will mean to move "up" as opposed to "down".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In philosophy===
[[Utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] discussed some of the ways moral investigations are a science.&lt;ref&gt;''Deontology, or The Science of Morality''&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes [[Deontology|deontological ethics]] for failing to recognize that it needed to make the same presumptions as his science of morality to really work – whilst pursuing rules that were to be obeyed in every situation (something that worried Bentham).

[[W.V.O. Quine]] advocated naturalizing epistemology by looking to natural sciences like psychology for a full explanation of knowledge.{{explain|date=October 2015}} His work contributed to a resurgence of moral naturalism in the last half of the 20th century. [[Paul Kurtz]], who believes that the careful, secular pursuit of normative rules is vital to society, coined the term ''eupraxophy'' to refer to his approach to normative ethics. [[Steven Pinker]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and [[Peter Singer]] believe that we learn what is right and wrong through reason and empirical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/steven-pinker-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=debate1&gt;At 11:25 in the video debate at http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/the-great-debate-panel-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maria Ossowska.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Maria Ossowska]] used the methods of science to understand the origins of moral norms.]]
[[Maria Ossowska]] thought that sociology was inextricably related to philosophical reflections on morality, including normative ethics. She proposed that science analyze: (a) existing social norms and their history, (b) the psychology of morality, and the way that individuals interact with moral matters and prescriptions, and (c) the sociology of morality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/6/3/311 Marcin T. Zdrenka. (2006). "Moral philosopher or sociologist of morals?". Journal of Classical Sociology.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular literature===
The theory and methods of a normative science of morality are explicitly discussed in Joseph Daleiden's ''The Science of Morality: The Individual, Community, and Future Generations'' (1998). Daleiden's book, in contrast to Harris, extensively discusses the relevant philosophical literature.  In ''[[The Moral Landscape|The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values]]'', [[Sam Harris]]'s goal is to show how moral truth can be backed by "science", or more specifically, [[empirical knowledge]], critical thinking, philosophy, but most controversially, the [[scientific method]].

[[Patricia Churchland]] offers that, accepting [[David Hume|Hume]]'s [[Is–ought problem|is-ought problem]], the use of induction from premises and definitions remains a valid way of reasoning in life and science.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/the-great-debate-panel-1&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quotation|Our moral behavior, while more complex than the social behavior of other animals, is similar in that it represents our attempt to manage well in the existing social ecology....from the perspective of neuroscience and brain evolution, the routine rejection of scientific approaches to moral behavior based on Hume's warning against deriving ''ought'' from ''is'' seems unfortunate, especially as the warning is limited to deductive inferences....The truth seems to be that values rooted in the circuitry for caring—for well-being of self, offspring, mates, kin, and others—shape social reasoning about many issues: conflict resolutions, keeping the peace, defense, trade, resource distribution, and many other aspects of social life in all its vast richness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patricia Smith |last=Churchland |year=2011 |title=Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-13703-2 |lccn=2010043584 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLsIzyFR08IC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7 |pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Patricia Churchland|Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality}}

Daleiden and [[Leonard Carmichael]] warn that science is probabilistic, and that [[certainty]] is not possible. One should therefore expect that moral prescriptions will change as humans gain understanding.&lt;ref&gt;p502, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|To quote Carmichael: "We do not turn aside from what we know about astronomy at any time because there is still a great deal we do not know, or because so much of what we once thought we knew is no longer recognized as true. May not the same argument be accepted in our thinking about ethical and esthetic judgements?"&lt;ref&gt;Leaonard Carmichael, the chapter "Absolutes, Relativism and the Scientific Psychology of Human Nature", H. Schoeck and J. Wiggins (eds), in the book "Relativism and the Study of Man, Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand, 1961, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

==Views in scientific Morality==
{{See also|Moral psychology}}

===Training to promote good behaviour===
The science of morality may aim to discover the best ways to motivate and shape individuals. Methods to accomplish this include instilling explicit [[virtue]]s, building [[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|character strengths]], and forming [[Association (psychology)|mental associations]]. These generally require some level of practical reason. James Rest suggested that abstract reasoning is also a factor in making moral judgements&lt;ref name=RestJudging/&gt; and emphasized that moral judgements alone do not predict moral behaviour: “Moral judgement may be closely related to advocacy behaviour, which in turn influences social institutions, which in turn creates a system of norms and sanctions that influences people’s behaviour.”&lt;ref name=RestJudging&gt;James R. Rest, Development in Judging Moral Issues. (1979). Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Daleiden suggested that religions instill a practical sense of virtue and justice, right and wrong. They also effectively use art and myths to educate people about moral situations.&lt;ref&gt;323, 326, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of government====
Harris argues that moral science does not imply an "[[George Orwell|Orwell]]ian future" with "scientists at every door". Instead, Harris imagines data about normative moral issues being shared in the same way as other sciences (e.g. peer-reviewed journals on medicine).&lt;ref name=SalonHarris&gt;[http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/10/17/sam_harris_interview/ www.salon.com] Asked "Let's say scientists do end up discovering moral truths. How are they supposed to enforce their findings? Would they become something like policemen or priests?" Harris writes ''"They wouldn’t necessarily enforce them any more than they enforce their knowledge about human health. What are scientists doing with the knowledge that smoking causes cancer or obesity is bad for your health, or that the common cold is spread by not washing your hands? We’re not living in some Orwellian world where we have scientists in lab coats at every door. Imagine we discovered that there is a best way to teach your children to be compassionate, or to defer short-term gratification in the service of a long-term goal. What if it turns out to be true that calcium intake in the first two years of life has a significant effect on a child’s emotional life? If we learn that, what parent wouldn’t want that knowledge? The fear of a "Brave New World" component to this argument is unfounded."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Daleiden specifies that government, like any organization, should have limited power. He says "centralization of power irrevocably in the hands of one person or an elite has always ultimately led to great evil for the human race. It was the novel experiment of democracy—a clear break with tradition—that ended the long tradition of tyranny.”&lt;ref&gt;219, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He is also explicit that [[government]] should only use law to enforce the most basic, reasonable, evidence and widely supported moral norms. In other words, there are a great many moral norms that should never be the task of the government to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;273–274, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of punishment====
{{Main|Differential reinforcement|Prison}}
One author has argued that to attain a society where people are motivated by conditioned self-interest, [[punishment]] must go hand-in-hand with [[reward system|reward]].&lt;ref&gt;77, Daleiden (1998), quote “We use rewards and punishments, praise and blame, in training any animal. The human species is only different in degree in this regard, not in kind.”&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in this line of reasoning, prison remains necessary for many perpetrators of crimes. This is so, even if libertarian free will is false. This is because punishment can still serve its purposes: it deters others from committing their own crimes, educates and reminds everyone about what the society stands for, incapacitates the criminal from doing more harm, goes some way to relieving or repaying the victim, and corrects the criminal (also see [[recidivism]]). This author argues that, at least, any prison system ''should'' be pursuing those goals, and that it is an empirical question as to what sorts of punishment realize these goals most effectively, and how well various [[prison]] systems actually serve these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;289, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
{{see also| Positive psychology|Moral development}}
The brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a8926q746t212727/ "Bzdok, D. et al. Parsing the neural correlates of moral cognition: ALE meta-analysis on morality, theory of mind, and empathy. Brain Struct Funct, 2011."]&lt;/ref&gt;  The neural network underlying moral decisions overlaps with the network pertaining to representing others' intentions (i.e., theory of mind) and the network pertaining to representing others' (vicariously experienced) emotional states (i.e., empathy). This supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons’ points of view and to grasping others’ feelings. These results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e., there might be no such things as a "moral module" in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems.
An essential, shared component of moral judgment involves the capacity to detect morally salient content within a given social context. Recent research implicated the salience network in this initial detection of moral content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sevinc |first1=Gunes |last2=Gurvit |first2=Hakan |last3=Spreng |first3=R. Nathan |title=Salience network engagement with the detection of morally laden information |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |date=July 2017 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1118–1127 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsx035|pmid=28338944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The salience network responds to behaviorally salient events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seeley |first1=W. W. |last2=Menon |first2=V. |last3=Schatzberg |first3=A. F. |last4=Keller |first4=J. |last5=Glover |first5=G. H. |last6=Kenna |first6=H. |last7=Reiss |first7=A. L. |last8=Greicius |first8=M. D. |title=Dissociable Intrinsic Connectivity Networks for Salience Processing and Executive Control |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |date=28 February 2007 |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=2349–2356 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5587-06.2007|pmc=2680293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Menon |first1=Vinod |last2=Uddin |first2=Lucina Q. |title=Saliency, switching, attention and control: a network model of insula function |journal=Brain Structure and Function |date=29 May 2010 |volume=214 |issue=5–6 |pages=655–667 |doi=10.1007/s00429-010-0262-0|pmc=2899886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be critical to modulate downstream default and frontal control network interactions in the service of complex moral reasoning and decision-making processes. This suggest that moral cognition involves both bottom-up and top-down attentional processes, mediated by discrete large-scale brain networks and their interactions.

===Other implications===

Daleiden provides examples of how science can use empirical evidence to assess the effect that specific behaviors can have on the well-being of individuals and society with regard to various moral issues. He argues that science supports [[Drug liberalization|decriminalization and regulation of drugs]], euthanasia under some circumstances, and the permission of sexual behaviors that are not tolerated in some cultures (he cites [[homosexuality]] as an example). Daleiden further argues that in seeking to reduce human suffering, [[abortion]] should not only be permissible, but at times a moral obligation (as in the case of a mother of a potential child who would face the probability of much suffering). Like all moral claims in his book, however, Daleiden is adamant that these decisions remain grounded in, and contingent on empirical evidence.&lt;ref name=DaleidenSummary/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Joseph Daleiden's final word regarding his book, ''The Science of Morality,'' is that “[The study of ethics] should be included with the social sciences and be subject to as rigorous a scientific program of research as any other area of human behaviour. Lacking this scientific rigour, the moral conclusions drawn in this volume must be considered as working hypotheses, some with greater degree of evidentiary support than others. It is the process by which to assess and transmit moral norms that was the primary focus of this work, and I hope it will serve as a new way of deciding moral issues.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of [[cultural relativity]], to Daleiden, do offer some lessons: investigators must be careful not to judge a person's behaviour without understanding the environmental context. An action may be necessary and more moral once we are aware of circumstances.&lt;ref name="100, Daleiden"&gt;100, Daleiden&lt;/ref&gt; However, Daleiden emphasizes that this does not mean all ethical norms or systems are equally effective at promoting flourishing&lt;ref name="100, Daleiden"/&gt; and he often offers the equal treatment of women as a reliably superior norm, wherever it is practiced.

== Criticisms ==

The idea of a normative science of morality has met with some criticisms. Critics include physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]], who argues that morality cannot be part of science.&lt;ref name=twsJun14eef&gt;{{cite news
 |author= Sean Carroll
 |title= Science And Morality: You Can’t Derive 'Ought' From 'Is'
 |publisher= ''NPR''
 |quote= Casting morality as a maximization problem might seem overly restrictive at first glance, but the procedure can potentially account for a wide variety of approaches. A libertarian might want to maximize a feeling of personal freedom, while a traditional utilitarian might want to maximize some version of happiness. The point is simply that the goal of morality should be to create certain conditions that are, in principle, directly measurable by empirical means. ...Nevertheless, I want to argue that this program is simply not possible. ... Morality is not part of science, however much we would like it to be. There are a large number of arguments one could advance for in support of this claim, but I'll stick to three.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and other critics cite the widely held "[[fact-value distinction]]", that the [[scientific method]] cannot answer "moral" questions, although it can describe the norms of different cultures. In contrast, moral scientists defend the position that such a division between values and scientific facts ("moral relativism") is not only arbitrary and illusory, but impeding progress towards taking action against documented cases of human rights violations in different cultures.&lt;ref name=Moralconfusion&gt;{{cite news
 |author= Sam Harris
 |title= Moral confusion in the name of "science"
 |publisher= ''PROJECT REASON''
 |quote= There are also very practical, moral concerns that follow from the glib idea that anyone is free to value anything—the most consequential being that it is precisely what allows highly educated, secular, and otherwise well-intentioned people to pause thoughtfully, and often interminably, before condemning practices like compulsory veiling, genital excision, bride-burning, forced marriage, and the other cheerful products of alternative “morality” found elsewhere in the world. Fanciers of Hume’s is/ought distinction never seem to realize what the stakes are, and they do not see what an abject failure of compassion their intellectual “tolerance” of moral difference amounts to. While much of this debate must be had in academic terms, this is not merely an academic debate. There are women and girls getting their faces burned off with acid at this moment for daring to learn to read, or for not consenting to marry men they have never met, or even for the crime of getting raped.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that science and religion occupy "[[non-overlapping magisteria]]". To Gould, science is concerned with questions of fact and theory, but not with meaning and morality – the magisteria of religion. In the same vein, [[Edward Teller]] proposed that politics decides what is right, whereas science decides what is true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/280/5367/1200 Essays on Science and Society. "Science and Morality".]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a discussion on the role that [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] might play in professions like [[nursing]], Philosopher Trevor Hussey calls the popular view that science is unconcerned with morality "too simplistic". Although his main focus in the paper is naturalism in nursing, he goes on to explain that science can, at very least, be interested in morality at a descriptive level. He even briefly entertains the idea that morality could itself be a scientific subject, writing that one ''might'' argue "..that moral judgements are subject to the same kinds of rational, empirical examination as the rest of the world: they are a subject for science – although a difficult one. If this could be shown to be so, morality would be contained within naturalism. However, I will not assume the truth of moral realism here."
{{#tag:ref|Hussey writes "The relationship between naturalism and morality and politics is complicated, and is difficult to state in a few sentences because it involves deep philosophical issues. Only the briefest discussion is possible here. The most popular view is that science, and hence naturalism, is concerned with objective facts and not with values: with what is the case rather than what ought to be. But this is too simplistic." He gives a reason immediately: "First, at the very least, science can study morality and politics at a descriptive level and try to understand their workings within societies and in the lives of individuals, and investigate their evolutionary origins, their social propagation, and so on." Hussey then describes how scientists must adhere to certain values, but also how values guide what it is that science may investigate. His real interest in the paper is to justify naturalism as a nursing practice, yet he does eventually write: "Finally, the idea that science and morality are separate realms, one dealing with facts the other with values, is not as certain and clear-cut as it seems. Various versions of moral realism are now widely discussed among philosophers (e.g. Railton, 1986, 1996, 2003; Sayre-McCord, 1988; Dancy, 1993; Casebeer, 2003; Shafer-Landau, 2003; Baghramian, 2004; Smith, 1994, 2004). Despite their differences, moral realists generally agree on two principles. First, that our moral utterances, such as ‘Murder is morally wrong’ or ‘We ought to be honest’ are genuine statements and hence they are capable of being either true or false. Second, what makes them either true or false are aspects of the real world, open to objective examination. It can be argued that it is an implication of this thesis that moral judgements are subject to the same kinds of rational, empirical examination as the rest of the world: they are a subject for science – although a difficult one." He continues "If this could be shown to be so, morality would be contained within naturalism. However, I will not assume the truth of moral realism here. It is sufficient to say that it has at least as much credibility as any theory claiming a supernatural or divine foundation for morality: views which, while popular among the general public, do not have widespread support among moral philosophers – for what that is worth." Hussey thus directs discussion back towards Naturalism in nursing because his main point in all this was, in the end, to prove that naturalistic moralities are not necessarily less credible than supernatural ones, and may even be more credible.&lt;ref&gt;Naturalistic nursing, Trevor Hussey (2011), Nursing Philosophy, Vol 12, Pg.45–52.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

The '''Scottish Corpus of Texts &amp; Speech''' ('''SCOTS''') is an ongoing project to build a [[text corpus|corpus]] of modern-day (post-1940) written and spoken texts in [[Scottish English]] and varieties of [[Scots language|Scots]]. SCOTS has been available online since November 2004, and can be freely searched and browsed. By the end of the project, in mid-2007, SCOTS aims to increase the size of the text collection to 4 million words.

The project is a venture by the Department of English Language and STELLA project at the [[University of Glasgow]]. SCOTS is grant-funded by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]].

==Language variety==
SCOTS contains texts in [[Scottish English]] and varieties of broad Scots, including [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric]], [[Lallans]], urban varieties such as [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]] and [[Insular Scots]]. SCOTS contains a [[geographical]] spread of texts as well as a [[demographic]] spread. Each text is accompanied by extensive [[metadata]], including such information as author’s decade of birth, gender, occupation, birthplace and place of residence, and details about the text such as publication information, audience, date and genre.

==Genre and mode==
SCOTS is a [[multimedia]] [[text corpus|corpus]], containing written texts and spoken texts, available as [[transcription (linguistics)|orthographic transcriptions]], accompanied by source audio or video files. SCOTS includes a large number of [[genre]]s and text types, including prose fiction, poetry, business and personal correspondence, religious texts, parliamentary and administrative documents, emails, conversations and interviews.

==Search and analysis==
SCOTS can be investigated in various ways, depending on the user’s interest. The corpus can be browsed, for example by the author’s name or date of the text, and all texts can be downloaded in [[plain text]] format. 

[[transcription (linguistics)|Transcriptions]] are synchronised with audio / video files, which are streamed and may also be downloaded. 

An Advanced Search facility allows the user to build up more complex queries, choosing from all the fields available in the [[metadata]]. Geographical results are plotted on an interactive map, so regional variation may be investigated. 

Advanced Search results can also be viewed as a [[Key Word in Context|KWIC]] concordance, which can be reordered to highlight [[collocation]]al patterns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1234">A '''secondary atmosphere''' is an [[atmosphere]] of a [[planet]] that did not form by [[accretion disc|accretion]] during the formation of the planet's [[star]]. A secondary atmosphere instead forms from internal [[volcano|volcanic]] activity, or by accumulation of material from [[comet]] impacts. It is characteristic of [[terrestrial planet]]s, which includes the other terrestrial planets in the [[Solar System]]: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], and [[Mars]]. Secondary atmospheres are relatively thin compared to [[primary atmosphere]]s like [[Jupiter]]'s.&lt;ref name="Schombert-lec14"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6085">'''Space psychology''' refers to applying psychology to advise [[human spaceflight]]. This includes applying [[industrial and organizational psychology]] to team selection, individual and team mental preparation, team training, and ongoing psychological support,&lt;ref&gt;Freiberg, Peter. (1998). "Psychology keeps astronauts well grounded."''Monitor'', ''American Psychological Association'', March Edition, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and applying [[human factors and ergonomics]] to the construction of [[spacecraft]] to ensure sufficient [[habitability]].

==Components of industrial/organizational psychology==
The field is necessary for planning for and accomplishing successful [[human spaceflight]] missions by ensuring readiness for the unique physiological and psychological challenges posed by spending extended time in closed isolated environments like spacecraft. It is critical that each team member functions individually and as a team in order to avoid [[human error]], overcome unforeseeable challenges, and complete the mission. 
Due to the importance of team reliance on mission success, the field has focused on [[team composition and cohesion in spaceflight missions]] ever since 1957's [[Project Mercury]]. This involves applying and conducting research from [[social psychology]], [[group dynamics]], group performance and team psychology, and applying it to select team members that will be able to live together in close quarters for an extended amount of time, and create team training programs that improve team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Novotney, Amy. (2013). "I/O psychology goes to Mars" ''Monitor on Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to [[teamwork]], there is an assortment of [[psychological and sociological effects of spaceflight]] that needs to be addressed in order to plan for successful space missions, such as [[loneliness]], unavailability of familial [[mental health]] support, elevated levels of [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] due to demanding tasks, and reduced material comforts.

==Components of human factors and ergonomics==
To ensure [[habitability]] of constructed [[spacecraft]], [[human factors and ergonomics]] specialists must advise on environmental requirements such as lighting, room layout and design, sound requirements, and solutions for the physiological challenges posed by being in an environment without gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmire, Alexandra. (2014). "The Use of Psychology to Inform the Design of Future Space Vehicles and Habitats". ''American Psychological Association Convention Presentation''&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Factor in space has to deal not only with adapting to different physical habitats, but also to different social habitats and different communication settings. New activities such as performing human extravehicular activity (EVA) beyond the low Earth orbit environment require complex synchronization methods. The ergonomic approach to these environments has to include new variables, such as time delay in communication due to speed of light transmission limitations. Astronauts will become increasingly isolated from Earth-based mission support and thus will rely heavily on their own decision-making capabilities and onboard tools to accomplish proposed EVA mission objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Matthew|title=Information flow model of human extravehicular activity operations|journal=IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings 2015|date=June 2015|doi=10.1109/AERO.2015.7118942|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282954950_Information_flow_model_of_human_extravehicular_activity_operations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Most published research specific to space psychology has been conducted by [[NASA]]s [[Human Systems Integration Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Barrett. (2006). "Group Performance and space flight teams: Chapter 8" in Bowers, Salas and Jentsch. (2006). "Creating High-Tech Teams: Practical Guidance on Work Performance and Technology." ''American Psychological Association''&lt;/ref&gt; Tests conducted to ensure team success include putting a team in an airtight quarters on earth for an extended period of time, such as in the Lunar-Mars Life Support Test.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/ground/1.3Crewmembers.pdf Nasa Lunar-Mars Life Support Test]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the context of space flight, teamwork is an essential ingredient in successful missions. A variety of adverse influences may negatively impact the performance of mission teams both on the ground and in flight. Such influences may include physical stressors on the organism such as diurnal disruption, effects of microgravity, injury, or task overload as well as psychological factors such as social isolation, role overload, or interpersonal conflict among team members. Given the importance of team effectiveness, NASA’s Behavioral Health and Performance Element (BHP) has identified a need to monitor the functioning of teams, primarily using unobtrusive means. The purpose of such monitoring lies in providing a stream of indicators that can serve several operational goals:
# Monitoring during personnel selection activities can provide input for the selection of compatible team members and of individuals with psychological profiles suited to teamwork in extreme environments and situations.
# Monitoring during training activities can provide diagnostic information useful in guiding further instruction and coaching as well as in determining the composition of teams prior to mission deployment.
# Monitoring during missions can provide forewarning of potential operational failures due to disruptions.&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Maidel, &amp; Jeffrey M. Stanton (2010), ''Unobtrusive Monitoring of Spaceflight Team Functioning. Literature Review and Operational Assessment for NASA Behavioral Health and Performance Element''. School of Information Studies, Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3652">{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], '''syntagmatic analysis''' is [[Semantic analysis (linguistics)|analysis]] of [[syntax]] or surface structure ([[syntagmatic structure]]) as opposed to [[paradigm]]s ([[paradigmatic analysis]]). This is often achieved using [[Commutation test (semiotics)|commutation test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem04.html "Semiotics for Beginners" by Daniel Chandler]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Syntagmatic" means that one element selects the other element either to precede it or to follow it. For example, the [[the|definitive article]] "the" selects a [[noun]] and not a verb.

Of particular use in semiotic study, a syntagm is a chain which leads, through syntagmatic analysis, to an understanding of how a sequence of events forms a narrative. Alternatively, syntagmatic analysis can describe the spatial relationship of a visual text such as posters, photographs or a particular setting of a filmed scene.

[[Roland Barthes]] was able to use metaphor in the form of various garments in order to display how the syntagm/paradigm relationship worked together to at once create and change meaning. Expanding on this form of explanation by Barthes, both [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] and Susan Spiggle have further developed the metaphor, using specific wearable items. Shirt, shorts and sandals for example, are freely interchangeable along the plane of tops, bottoms and footwear, the paradigmatic plane, assuming they follow the rules of wearable items, the syntagmatic plane. While you can change the sandals for high heels, it would be breaking the rules to wear them as a top. Turning to the grammatically correct sentence, it prevents the text from reading like it was written by [[Yoda]].

==Application==

Due to the abstract nature of the [[Signifier and signified|signifier/signified]] relationship, a free-standing signifier is unable to convey knowledge or understanding by itself. After all, the only reason any word means what it means at all is due to a consensus of understanding by the wider community. Expanding on [[Saussure]]'s own example of the arbitrariness of the word "tree", or any word for that matter, it can be seen that the word "tree" by itself could mean just about any upright bit of wood with branches, whether it grows leaves or provides a place to hang cups or hats. Meaning is therefore provided by an extended syntagmatic chain, which will identify for the reader of the text just what sort of tree is meant.

This understanding leads to the opportunity to consider the linguistics of texts and language in a wider variety ways. Thwaite, Davis, and Mules identify a syntagm as "the result of using a conventional rule to combine a series of elements from various paradigms".&lt;ref&gt;Introducing Cultural and Media Studies. A Semiotic Approach by Thwaites, T, Davis, L, &amp; Mules, W&lt;/ref&gt; From this understanding it is possible to consider the structure of texts{{mdash}}film and television being an ideal example.

Looking at the [[mise-en-scène]] of a set piece, the various signs combine to give the viewer a greater understanding of what they are viewing. The syntagmatic chain is constructed in such a way that sets the feel of the scene and is particularly apparent when considering genre. A western for example may have many of the paradigmatic signs that the viewer has grown accustomed to. That everything is where they expect to see it is following the rules of this syntagmatic chain. If the horse is riding the cowboy, it breaks these rules and becomes a very different movie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9056">The '''Obscene Device Law''' is a [[Texas]] [[statute]] prohibiting the sale of [[sex toy]]s. The law was introduced in 1973, and was last updated in 2003. While the law technically remains in effect, in 2008 a U.S. District Judge released a report declaring it to be "facially unconstitutional and unenforceable".

==History==
In 1973, the [[Texas Legislature]] passed Section 43.21 of the [[Texas Penal Code]], which, in part, prohibited the sale or promotion of "obscene devices"', being defined as "a device including a [[dildo]] or [[artificial vagina]], designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of [[Sex organ|human genital organs]]." The legislation was last updated in 2003, and Section 43.23 currently states "A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.43.htm#43.23 |title=Penal Code Chapter 43.

==Prosecuted cases==
Prosecution under the statute is rare but has occasionally occurred. In [[Burleson, Texas|Burleson]] in 2004, Joanne Webb, a mother of three and a former schoolteacher, faced up to one year in prison for selling a [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]] to two undercover police officers posing as a married couple at a private party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/02/11/obscenity.trial.reut/ |title=Texas mom faces trial for selling sex toys |date=February 11, 2004 |work=[[CNN]] |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130110202251/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/02/11/obscenity.trial.reut/ |archivedate=January 10, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later acquitted, and the undercover officers were issued reprimands. In 2007, a [[lingerie]] shop in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] was raided, and items "deemed to be illegal by the Texas Penal Code" were confiscated. The clerk on duty at the time was arrested and may have had to [[Sex offender registries in the United States|register as a sex offender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.klbk13.tv/news/default.asp?mode=shownews&amp;id=2259 |title=Police Raid Lingerie Shop |date=May 21, 2007 |work=klbk13.tv |access-date=May 21, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070525044229/http://www.klbk13.tv/news/default.asp?mode=shownews&amp;id=2259 |archivedate=May 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, attorneys Mary and Ted Roberts used the obscenity statute in an elaborate extortion scheme against a number of men who had engaged in extramarital relations with Mary Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tdcaa.com/node/2483 |title=There's something about Mary1 … |date= |work=Texas District &amp; County Attorneys Association |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918140525/http://www.tdcaa.com/node/2483 |archivedate=September 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals==

Reliable Consultants, Inc., who operate four retail stores in Texas that carry a stock of sexual devices, and PHE, Inc., which is also engaged in the retail distribution of sexual devices through their website and catalogs, both filed [[lawsuit]]s against the legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} claiming that the statute is [[unconstitutional]]. In an appeal from the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]], a three-judge panel of the [[5th Circuit Court of Appeals]] overturned the statute on February 12, 2008, by a vote of 2–1, holding that "the statute has provisions that violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1263575.html |title=PHE v.

On July 3, 2008, the Texas 13th District Court of Appeals in Corpus Christi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Texas Office of Court Administration |url=http://www.13thcoa.courts.state.tx.us/ |title=Welcome to the official site of the Thirteenth Court of Appeals of Texas |publisher=13thcoa.courts.state.tx.us |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of Villareal vs. State,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.13thcoa.courts.state.tx.us/opinions/htmlopinion.asp?OpinionId=16906 |title=Texas Judiciary Online - HTML Opinion |publisher=13thcoa.courts.state.tx.us |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed the ruling of the federal 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.  The 13th District Court of Appeals ruled that until the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rules that 43.23 is unconstitutional, the promotion of obscene devices remains illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dallascriminaldefenselawyerblog.com/2008/10/are-dildos-illegal-in-texas-ag.html |title=Are Dildos Illegal in Texas (again)? |last=Guest |first=Robert |date=October 6, 2008 |work=Dallas Criminal Defense Lawyer Blog |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730174954/http://www.dallascriminaldefenselawyerblog.com/2008/10/are-dildos-illegal-in-texas-ag.html |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, despite the actions of the federal courts and the Texas Attorney General described elsewhere in this article, section 43.23 remains in effect in the twenty-county area of Texas covered by the jurisdiction of the 13th District Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daxlegal.com/dildos-sexually-obscene-toys-illegal-in-texas-for-now/ |title=Dildos &amp; Sexually Obscene "Toys" Illegal in Texas … for now &amp;#124; Austin Attorney Dax Garvin |work=Dax Legal |date=January 31, 2012 |accessdate=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716030219/http://daxlegal.com/dildos-sexually-obscene-toys-illegal-in-texas-for-now/ |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2008, the Fifth Circuit denied Texas's request to re-hear the case ''en banc''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/06/06-51067-CV1.wpd.pdf |title=United States Court of Appeals |publisher=Ca5.uscourts.gov |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refusal created a split between federal circuits: the 5th Circuit overturned the Texas law and the 11th Circuit upheld a nearly identical Alabama law. That would usually mean that the United States Supreme Court would grant a writ of [[certiorari]] and rule in order to clear up the disagreement between the two circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/08/dildos_at_the_supreme_court.php |title=Dildos at the Supreme Court? |last=Brayton |first=Ed |date=August 11, 2008 |work=[[ScienceBlogs]] |access-date=August 11, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018121053/http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/08/dildos_at_the_supreme_court.php |archivedate=October 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2008, U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel released a two-page document dated October 29, 2008, in which he stated that the Texas Attorney General's Office notified him that they would not file a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. The next month, on November 13, Yeakel filed a "joint status report" that noted the parties had come to an agreement. "Texas Penal Code §§ 43.23, to the extent that it applies to "obscene devices" as defined in Texas Penal Code § 43.21(a)(7), is declared to be facially unconstitutional and unenforceable throughout the State of Texas".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/322594597/2008-11-13-Texas-Western-Court-Order-Obscenity-Law&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Concord Review: A Quarterly Review of Essays by Students of History''''' is an [[academic journal]] dedicated to publishing the research papers of [[high school]] students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Your Name in Print: A Teen's Guide to Publishing for Fun, Profit and Academic Success |last=Harper |first=Elizabeth |authorlink= |author2=Timothy Harper |year=2005 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |location= |isbn=978-0-312-33759-9 |page=166 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1987 by [[William H. Fitzhugh (teacher)|William H. Fitzhugh]], a [[Massachusetts]] educator dismayed with the "[[dumbing down]]" of writing standards in American secondary schools, publication in the ''Review'' is considered among the most prestigious awards for high school students.&lt;ref name=Dillon&gt;{{cite news |title=Journal Showcases Dying Art of the Research Paper |author=Sam Dillon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/08/education/08research.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issued quarterly, the journal publishes research monographs on history topics from high school students from any country, as long as they are in English. Submissions are typically 4000 to 5500 words long, and must be accompanied by a subscription fee (ranging from $70-$150) to the journal in order to be considered.

'''''The Human Zoo''''' is a book written by the British zoologist [[Desmond Morris]], published in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a follow-up to his earlier book ''[[The Naked Ape]]''; both books examine how the biological nature of the [[human]] species has shaped the character of the [[culture]]s of the contemporary world.

''The Human Zoo'' examines the nature of [[civilization|civilized society]], especially in the [[city|cities]]. Morris compares the human inhabitants of a city to the animal inhabitants of a [[zoo]], which have their survival needs provided for, but at the cost of living in an unnatural environment. Humans in their cities, and animals in their zoos, both have food and shelter provided for them, and have considerable [[free time]] on their hands. But they have to live in an unnatural environment, and are both likely to have problems in developing healthy [[Interpersonal relationship|social relationships]], both are liable to suffer from [[Solitude|isolation]] and [[boredom]], and both live in a limited amount of physical space. The book explains how the inhabitants of cities and zoos have invented ways to deal with these problems, and the consequences that follow when they fail at dealing with them.

From this point of view, Morris examines why civilized society is the way it is. He offers explanations of the best and the worst features of civilized society. He examines the magnificent achievements of civilized society, the sublime explorations that make up science and the humanities, as well as the horrible behaviors of this same society such as war, [[slavery]], and [[rape]]. This book, and Morris's earlier book ''The Naked Ape'', are two of the early works in the field of [[sociobiology]], which have both contributed much to contemporary understandings of society.

[[File:TheTwoCultures.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Oxford University Press|OUP]])]]
'''''The Two Cultures''''' is the first part of an influential 1959 [[Rede Lecture]] by [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist and novelist [[C. P. Snow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Snow| first= Charles Percy | title = The Two Cultures |year=2001 | origyear = 1959 |publisher=Cambridge University Press| location= London | isbn = 978-0-521-45730-9 | page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = TLS /&gt; Its thesis was that "the intellectual life of the whole of western society" was split into the titular two cultures – namely the [[science]]s and the [[humanities]] – and that this was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems.

'''''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''''' (1959) was a published version of the lectures in book form. 

==The lecture==
The talk was delivered 7 May 1959 in the [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]], Cambridge, and subsequently published as ''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''. The lecture and book expanded upon an article by Snow published in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' of 6 October 1956, also entitled ''The Two Cultures''.{{Sfn | Snow | 2013}}  Published in book form, Snow's lecture was widely read and discussed on both sides of the Atlantic, leading him to write a 1963 follow-up, ''The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution |last=Snow |first=Charles Percy |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's position can be summed up by an often-repeated part of the essay:
{{Quote |A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of: ''Have you read a work of [[Shakespeare]]'s?''&lt;ref name= Nature&gt;{{cite journal |title=Across the Great Divide |journal=Nature Physics |year=2009 |volume=5 |issue=5 |page=309 |url = http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n5/full/nphys1258.html |doi= 10.1038/nphys1258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question – such as, What do you mean by [[mass]], or [[acceleration]], which is the scientific equivalent of saying, ''Can you read?'' – not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern [[physics]] goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the [[western world]] have about as much insight into it as their [[neolithic]] ancestors would have had.&lt;ref name=Nature /&gt;}}

In 2008, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' included ''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution'' in its list of the 100 books that most influenced Western public discourse since the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name = TLS&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5418361.ece | location = London | work= The Times | title= The hundred most influential books since the war | date=30 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's Rede Lecture condemned the [[British education]]al system as having, since the [[Victorian era]], over-rewarded the humanities (especially [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) at the expense of scientific and [[engineering]] education, despite such achievements having been so decisive in winning the [[Second World War]] for the Allies.&lt;ref name=Jardine&gt;{{cite journal | title = CP Snow's Two Cultures Revisited | last = Jardine | first = Lisa | authorlink = Lisa Jardine | journal = Christ's College Magazine | year = 2010 | pages = 48–57 | format = PDF | url = http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Publications_Christs_Magazine_2010_web.pdf | accessdate = 2012-02-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120417151018/http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Publications_Christs_Magazine_2010_web.pdf | archivedate = 17 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }} Jardine's 2009 C. P. Snow Lecture honored the 50th anniversary of Snow's Rede Lecture. She places Snow's lecture into its historical context, and emphasizes the expansion of certain elements of the Rede Lecture in Snow's Godkin Lectures at Harvard University in 1960. These were ultimately published as {{cite book |title = Science and Government |publisher=New American Library |year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in practice deprived British [[elite]]s (in politics, administration, and industry) of adequate preparation to manage the modern scientific world. By contrast, Snow said, [[German education|German]] and [[American schools]] sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled these countries' rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age. Later discussion of ''The Two Cultures'' tended to obscure Snow's initial focus on differences between British systems (of both schooling and [[social class]]) and those of competing countries.&lt;ref name=Jardine /&gt;

== Implications and influence ==
The literary critic [[F. R. Leavis]] called Snow a "public relations man" for the scientific establishment in his essay ''Two Cultures?: The Significance of C. P. Snow'', published in ''[[The Spectator]]''.  The article attracted a great deal of negative correspondence in the magazine's letters pages.&lt;ref name=kimball&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kimball |first=Roger |url = http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-The-Two-Cultures--today-4882 |title=The Two Cultures' today: On the C. P. Snow–F. R. Leavis controversy | journal=[[The New Criterion]] |date=12 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1963 book Snow appeared to revise his thinking and was more optimistic about the potential of a mediating third culture.  This concept was later picked up in {{Citation | year = 1995 | title = The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution | author-link = John Brockman (literary agent)| first = John | last = Brockman| title-link = The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution }}. Introducing the reprinted {{Citation | title = The Two Cultures | year = 1993}}, [[Stefan Collini]]{{Sfn | Collini | 1993 | p = lv}} has argued that the passage of time has done much to reduce the cultural divide Snow noticed, but has not removed it entirely.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s ''[[The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox]]'' provides a different perspective. Assuming the [[dialectical]] interpretation, it argues that Snow's concept of "two cultures" is not only off the mark, it is a damaging and short-sighted viewpoint, and that it has perhaps led to decades of unnecessary fence-building.

[[Simon Critchley]], in ''Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction'' suggests:{{Sfn | Critchley | 2001 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=syhsLJ1eMOEC&amp;pg=PA49  49]}}
{{Quote |[Snow] diagnosed the loss of a common culture and the emergence of two distinct cultures: those represented by scientists on the one hand and those Snow termed 'literary intellectuals' on the other. If the former are in favour of social reform and progress through science, technology and industry, then intellectuals are what Snow terms 'natural [[Luddites]]' in their understanding of and sympathy for advanced industrial society. In [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]]'s terms, the division is between [[Jeremy Bentham|Benthamites]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridgeans]].|Simon Critchley}}

That is, Critchley argues that what Snow said represents a resurfacing of a discussion current in the mid-nineteenth century. Critchley describes the Leavis contribution to the making of a controversy as "a vicious ''ad hominem'' attack"; going on to describe the debate as "a familiar clash in English cultural history" citing also [[T. H. Huxley]] and [[Matthew Arnold]].{{Sfn | Critchley | 2001 | p = 51}}{{Sfn | Collini | 1993 | p = xxxv}}

In his opening address at the [[Munich Security Conference]] in January 2014, the Estonian president [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] said that the current problems related to security and freedom in cyberspace are the culmination of absence of dialogue between "the two cultures": "Today, bereft of understanding of fundamental issues and writings in the development of liberal democracy, computer geeks devise ever better ways to track people... simply because they can and it's cool. Humanists on the other hand do not understand the underlying technology and are convinced, for example, that tracking meta-data means the government reads their emails."&lt;ref&gt;Ilves, Toomas Hendrik: "[http://www.president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/9796-qrebooting-trust-freedom-vs-security-in-cyberspaceq/index.html Rebooting Trust? Freedom vs Security in Cyberspace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223112412/http://www.president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/9796-qrebooting-trust-freedom-vs-security-in-cyberspaceq/index.html |date=23 February 2014 }}" Opening address at Munich Security Conference Cyber 31 January 2014. 31.01.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antecedents==
Contrasting scientific and humanistic knowledge is a repetition of the ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' of 1890 German universities.&lt;ref name="Brint2002p212"&gt;{{Citation | last = Brint | first = Steven G | year = 2002 | title = The Future of the City of Intellect: The Changing American University | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDfrzER0obYC&amp;pg=PA212 | pages = 212–3 | quote = positivism-versus-interpretation language [...] these fractal distinctions are generally quite old. Most of them have been around at least since the celebrated ''Methodenstreit'' of the German universities in the late nineteenth century. CP Snow's "two cultures" argument captures a later instantiation of them. [...] In negotiating the complexities of social scientific and humanistic knowledge, it is extremely helpful to have a dichotomy like positivism versus interpretation, because it saves our having to remember the exact degree of positivism of any scholarly group. [...] Every single social science discipline has internal debates about positivism/interpretation, narrative/analysis, and so on. The narrative/analytic debate may look very different in economics, anthropology, and English. But underneath all the surface differences it is quite similar.| isbn = 9780804745314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A quarrel in 1911 between [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Giovanni Gentile]] on the one hand and [[Federigo Enriques]] on the other one [https://books.google.it/books?id=oXjMYIonXTYC&amp;pg=PA422&amp;lpg=PA422&amp;dq=1911+croce+gentile+enriques+fight&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y-I3OzBiJi&amp;sig=KYsoohR9-x53CW8pBXJbYflTqGU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzrcu80JDeAhWKk4sKHUdaCgEQ6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false is believed] to have had enduring effects in the separation of the two cultures in Italy and to the predominance of the views of (objective) idealism over those of (logical) positivism. In the social sciences it is also commonly proposed as the quarrel of [[positivism]] versus [[Antipositivism|interpretivism]].&lt;ref name="Brint2002p212" /&gt;

A number of [[parchment]] pieces featuring various patterns are applied on the scroll. The differences in the border of some drawings indicate that the Topkapı Scroll consists of two different scrolls fixed together. The fact that it is not worn out suggests that it was not made to be used as a reference document in a craftman's workshop, but rather than as an exhibition work in the palace. It was probably a record of tiling works carried out in the palace.&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Notes on a recent study of the Topkapı scroll: a review article |author=Rogers, J.M. |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=433–439 |year=1997 |jstor=619536 |doi=10.1017/s0041977x0003247x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scroll was made by one person only. Most of the patterns were drawn on two pieces of parchment that were put together, and then pasted on the scroll. The placement of the patterns on the scroll is somewhat disorganized. Patterns of similar [[theme (arts)|theme]]s are fallen apart, and some patterns formed on two parchment pieces are combined imperfectly.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;

The stamp on the scroll "H1956" indicates that it is registered in the inventory of the Topkapı Palace's Treasury department.

An edition of the scroll was published with an extensive commentary, but it is now out of print.

==History==
The Topkapı Scroll was presumably prepared in Iran during the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the end of the 15th century or beginning of the 16th century. A similarity between some of the patterns on the Topkapı Scroll and a tile panel in the [[Jame-e Kabir Mosque]] (grand mosque) in [[Yazd]] indicates that this scroll was created in [[Tabriz]]. On the other hand, it is possible that the scroll was made in [[Shiraz]] because it consists of mainly [[muqarnas]] in the form of a hand-held fan referred by [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] as Shirazi. It may have been looted 
by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s after the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90)]].

The muqarnas on the scroll, which are mostly in the form of a hand-held fan, reflect the architectural style of the Timurid dynasty, [[Turkmen people#Turkmen in Iran and Afghanistan|Turkmen people in Iran and Central Asia]]. In contrast, the muqarnas in [[Cairo]] are in the form of [[seashell]].

The Topkapı Scroll was discovered in 1986. [[Gülru Necipoğlu]] of [[Harvard University]] published a book, which describes the scroll with copies of its patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Gülru Necipoglu: The Topkapı Scroll: geometry and ornament in Islamic architecture. Palace Museum Topkapı Library MS H. 1956. xiii, 395 pp. Santa Monica, CA: Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The book was translated into [[Persian language]] by Mihrdad Kayyumi Bidhind under the title ''Handasa va Tazyin dar Mi‘mari-yi Islami: Tomar-i Topkapı'' (Tahran, Kitabkhana-yi Milli-yi Iran, 1379).

The scroll consists of 114 geometric patterns drawn in ink and dye. It displays decorative ornaments found on the walls and domes of structures built between the  10th and 16th century in the Timurid dynasty. It was a guidebook for architectural designs seen in complex [[muqarnas]], [[girih]], mosaic panels and colorful tiles. The scroll does not mention how those patterns are constructed, and has no date or signature.&lt;ref name="necipoglu1"/&gt;

One of the characteristics of the Topkapı Scroll is that it includes [[Islamic calligraphy|Arabic calligraphy]] called [[Kufic#Square or geometric Kufic|square or geometric Kufic]]. This script type was seen for the first time in the state of [[Ilkhanate]], and it was presumably created in inspiration from [[Chinese character]]s in rectangular form.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt; One of the patterns on the Topkapı Scroll, which matches an existing architectural structure, is the Kufic script drawn for [[banna'i]], in which tiles are alternated with plain bricks to create geometric patterns over the surface of a wall.  Almost exactly the same of this pattern is found on the gate of a mosque in [[Varzaneh]].&lt;ref name="necipoglu1"/&gt;

[[File:Topkapi Scroll P325.JPG|thumb|250px|Hexagon with Kufic scripts of six time [[Muhammad]] (Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh) and three time [[Ali]] (Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib) in rotational symmetry]]
Some of the patterns show the application of geometric principles to Islamic traditions. For example, the word [[Muhammad]] (Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh) is repeated six times along the sides of the [[hexagon]], and the word [[Ali]] (Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib) three times in a rotating wise in the inner hexagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hacali Necefoğlu |title=Turkish Crystallografic Patterns: From Ancient to Present |url=http://www.crystallography.fr/mathcryst/pdf/istanbul/Necefoglu_text.pdf |accessdate=2011-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One pattern on the scroll consists of nine-pointed and eleven-pointed geometric [[star polygon#Star figures|star figures]], and other one thirteen-pointed and sixteen-pointed geometric star figures. In the [[Islamic art]], this sort of stars were developed by folding certain patterns along the sides of a square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cromwell, P.

Some of the drawings on the scroll are formed by overlapped patterns of different scales. This feature is seen frequently in [[Islamic architecture]]. Detailed patterns within an ornament appear when one gets closer to a building with figures, which are difficult to perceive from the distance.&lt;ref name="cromwell"/&gt;

'''Western law''' refers to the [[Law|legal traditions]] of [[Western culture]].  Western culture has an idea of the importance of [[law]] which has its roots in both [[Roman law]] and [[canon law]].  As Western culture has a [[Graeco-Roman]] [[Classics|Classical]] and [[Renaissance]] cultural influence, so does its legal systems.

==History==
The rediscovery of the [[Roman law|Justinian Code]] in the early 10th century rekindled a passion for the discipline of law, which crossed many of the re-forming boundaries between East and West. Eventually, it was only in the [[Catholic]] or [[Franks|Frankish]] west, that [[Roman law]] became the foundation on which all legal concepts and systems were based. Its influence can be traced to this day in all Western legal systems (although in different manners and to different extents in the [[common law|common]] (Anglo-American) and the [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] (continental European) legal traditions).  

The study of [[canon law]], the legal system of the Catholic Church, fused with that of Roman law to form the basis of the refounding of Western legal scholarship.   The ideas of [[civil rights]], [[social equality|equality]] before the [[law]], [[equality of women]],  [[procedural justice]], and [[democracy]] as the ideal form of [[society]], and were principles which formed the basis of modern [[Western culture]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Western legal culture==
Western [[legal culture]] is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include [[corporations]], [[contracts]], [[Estate (law)|estates]], rights and powers to name a few. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;J.C. Smith (1968) ‘The Unique Nature of the Concepts of Western Law' The Canadian Bar Review (46: 2 pp. 191-225) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;   

As a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on [[language]] and [[symbols]] and any attempt to analyse non western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;  So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group's culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundational level. Basically the latter group represents primacy of prejudices, myths and taboo as viable means to conduct human society.
