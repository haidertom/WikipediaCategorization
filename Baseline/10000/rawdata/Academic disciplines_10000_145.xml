      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7044">'''Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory''' (also known as APO) is a not-for-profit [[open access]] [[Disciplinary repository|subject repository]] or [[digital library]], specialising in public policy and practice [[grey literature]] and journal articles, mainly from Australia and New Zealand, with some coverage of other countries. Formerly known as Australian Policy Online, the organisation underwent a name change to Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory (APO) in 2017.

== Background ==

APO was established in 2002 by the Swinburne Institute for Social Research, at [[Swinburne University]] in [[Melbourne]]. It was intended as a way to collate and disseminate academic research reports and other [[grey literature]] that was increasingly proliferating online. It has since established itself as a notable resource for people involved in policy research in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="broadband.unimelb"&gt;Bellamy, C., Gibbs, M., Williamson, A., Sean Cubit, S. (December 2011).  [http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/engage/pubs/wp/IBES-political-issue-analysis-system.pdf "Political Issue Analysis System: Policy deliberation in the age of information abundance"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204050628/http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/engage/pubs/wp/IBES-political-issue-analysis-system.pdf |date=2014-02-04 }}. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from [http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/ "Institute for a Broadband-Enabled Society"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918084602/http://www.broadband.unimelb.edu.au/ |date=2010-09-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It now sits as part of the Centre of Urban Transitions within Swinburne University of Technology.

APO is a not-for-profit organisation supported by partnerships with academic institutions and government agencies, grants donations and advertising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apo.org.au/funding-and-support "Funding and support"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313112458/http://apo.org.au/funding-and-support |date=2014-03-13 }}. Retrieved 13 March 2014 from [http://apo.org.au/ "Policy Online"].&lt;/ref&gt; Partners include the [[Australian National Data Service]], [[Australia and New Zealand School of Government|ANZSOG]], the [[University of Canberra]], the [[Henry Halloran]] Trust at the [[University of Sydney]], and the [[University of South Australia]]. APO has also been an awarded a number of [[Australian Research Council]] grants.

== Purpose ==

APO was established to address the transformation of the means of production for publications brought about by the internet. Frustrations with the limitations of the [[academic publishing]] system – long delays, lack of access or audience – were causing producers of academic and other content to move online and increasingly produce [[grey literature]] (informally published written material, such as reports, that may be difficult to trace via conventional channels). The informal channels used to disseminate digital grey literature have meant that libraries and other services have only been able to collect it in an ad hoc manner. APO aims to make digital research content that is relevant to Australian policy debates more easily discoverable, accessible and able to be managed.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, M.,  Magnifico, C., Tyler, K. (August 2013). [https://www.scribd.com/doc/163740640/The-Effects-of-the-Internet-and-Open-Access-on-the-Usage-of-Grey-Literature-A-Review-of-the-Literature-Group-Project#download "The Effects of the Internet and Open Access on the Usage of Grey Literature: a review of the literature"]. Retrieved 18 November 2013 from  [https://www.scribd.com "Scribd"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

APO specialises in collecting public policy reports and articles from academic research centres, think tanks, government and non-government organisations. As well as research, the site includes a smaller collection of opinion and commentary pieces, video, audio and web resources focused on policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaaccess.org.au/research-policy/research/useful-research-and-policy-databases "Useful research and policy databases"]. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from [http://mediaaccess.org.au/ "Media Access Australia"].&lt;/ref&gt; Most content is produced by other organisations and collected and catalogued on the site, although some commentary is original to APO.

== Reception ==

In 2011, the then Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet described APO as providing “some of the most valuable and constructive contributions to Australia’s policy debate”.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, T. (28 July 2011).[http://www.dpmc.gov.au/media/speech_2011_07_28.cfm "The John Paterson Oration 2011"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019235357/http://www.dpmc.gov.au/media/speech_2011_07_28.cfm |date=2011-10-19 }}. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from  [http://www.dpmc.gov.au/ "The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet"].&lt;/ref&gt; However, APO has also been criticised on the grounds that it “could perhaps do more to engage with the formal political workings of government through providing access to formal government policy information.”&lt;ref name="broadband.unimelb" /&gt;

In 2012, the report of the Independent Inquiry into Media and Media Regulation by the Hon Raymond Antony Finkelstein QC stated that: "While the start-up costs for new print publications have been prohibitive and inhibited new enterprises emerging, the streamlining of the relationship between content producers and consumers has led to many new websites and web-based services. Among the most important such websites that have grown up in Australia over the last decade are Inside Story, Australian Policy Online, Online Opinion, The Drum, The Conversation, and New Matilda."&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, R. (March 2012).

In August 2014, APO won the "Information" category at the Australia &amp; New Zealand Internet Awards (ANZIA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetawards.org.au/winners "Winners"].

[[File:Paternoster animated.gif|160px|thumb|right|A Paternoster type of APS]]
An '''automated (car) parking system''' (APS) is a mechanical system designed to minimize the area and/or volume required for parking cars. Like a [[Multi-storey car park|multi-story parking garage]], an APS provides parking for cars on multiple levels stacked vertically to maximize the number of [[parking space]]s while minimizing land usage.

APS are also generically known by a variety of other names, including: ''automated parking facility'' (APF), ''automated vehicle storage and retrieval system'' (AVSRS), ''car parking system'', ''mechanical parking'', and ''robotic parking garage''.

==History ==
[[Image:Saravana Super Stores Automated Car Park.JPG|right|thumb|A Semi-Automated Parking System]]
The concept for the automated parking system was and is driven by two factors: a need for parking spaces and a scarcity of available land.
The earliest use of an APS was in Paris, France in 1905 at the Garage Rue de Ponthieu.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt; The APS consisted of a groundbreaking&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt; multi-story concrete structure with an internal elevator to transport cars to upper levels where attendants parked the cars.&lt;ref name=Hamelink&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, a [[Ferris wheel]]-like APS (for cars rather than people) called a [[paternoster]] system became popular as it could park eight cars in the ground space normally used for parking two cars.&lt;ref name=Hamelink /&gt; Mechanically simple with a small footprint, the paternoster was easy to use in many places, including inside buildings. At the same time, [[Kent Automatic Garages]] was installing APS with capacities exceeding 1,000 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oentaryo|first1=R.

The first driverless parking garage opened in 1951 in [[Washington, D.C.]], but was replaced with office space due to increasing land values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/29040/64-years-ago-the-worlds-first-driverless-parking-garage-opened-in-dc/|title=64 years ago, the world's first driverless parking garage opened in DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APS saw a spurt of interest in the U.S. in the late 1940s and 1950s with the Bowser, Pigeon Hole and Roto Park systems.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt; In 1957, 74 Bowser, Pigeon Hole systems were installed,&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt; and some of these systems remain in operation. However, interest in APS in the U.S. waned due to frequent mechanical problems and long waiting times for patrons to retrieve their cars.&lt;ref name=Beebe&gt;{{Citation

==Space saving==
[[Image:Autoturm von Innen.jpg|right|thumb|A Large Fully Automated Parking System]]
[[File:Aps-bologna.jpg|right|thumb|Entrance of an underground automated parking system in historic center of [[Bologna]], Italy.]]
All APS take advantage of a common concept to decrease the area of parking spaces - removing the driver and passengers from the car before it is parked. With either fully automated or semi-automated APS, the car is driven up to an entry point to the APS and the driver and passengers exit the car. The car is then moved automatically or semi-automatically (with some attendant action required) to its parking space.

The space-saving provided by the APS, compared to the multi-story parking garage, is derived primarily from a significant reduction in space not directly related to the parking of the car:

* Parking space width and depth (and distances between parking spaces) are dramatically reduced since no allowance need be made for driving the car into the parking space or for the opening of car doors (for drivers and passengers)
* No driving lanes or ramps are needed to drive the car to/from the entrance/exit to a parking space
* Ceiling height is minimized since there is no pedestrian traffic (drivers and passengers) in the parking area, and
* No walkways, stairways or elevators are needed to accommodate pedestrians in the parking area.

With the elimination of ramps, driving lanes, pedestrians and the reduction in ceiling heights, the APS requires substantially less structural material than the multi-story parking garage. Many APS utilize a steel framework (some use thin concrete slabs) rather than the monolithic concrete design of the multi-story parking garage. These factors contribute to an overall volume reduction and further space savings for the APS.&lt;ref name=Monahan_Article /&gt;

==Other considerations==
In addition to the space saving, many APS designs provide a number of secondary benefits:

* The parked cars and their contents are more secure since there is no public access to parked cars&lt;ref name="Ovrom"&gt;{{Citation

===Problems===

Problems with automated parking garages have three reasons:
1) Technical and
2) Bad planning
3) Parking customers

Most problems with automated parking garages are not of technical nature. Architects can be blinded by the large number of cars on very limited space and decide to use mechanical parking system, though they are not suitable for their specific application. Manufacturers are sometimes happy to make a sale, even though they should consult their customers better. So the main reason for dissatisfied customers is the result of bad planning.

Mechanical car parks are a solution for applications with a relatively balanced throughput, like shopping malls, train stations, etc. Most can handle peaks during the rush hour in the morning and evening quite well, but they are not recommended for high peak hour volume. Therefore, if one installs a mechanical car park at a movie theater or stadium, trouble is pre-programmed. One big peak in the morning and another one in the evening without much in between are not suitable for automated parking.

And finally many delays are caused by confusion that comes when unfamiliar parkers first use this type of system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parkingtoday.com/articledetails.php?id=181|title=Parking Today - Articles -|first=Chuck|last=Hartt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fully automated vs semi-automated==

Fully automated parking systems operate much like robotic valet parking.&lt;ref name=House&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Automated Parking (Video)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver drives the car into an APS entry (transfer) area. The driver and all passengers exit the car. The driver uses an automated terminal nearby for payment and receipt of a ticket. When driver and passengers have left the entry area, the mechanical system lifts the car and transports it to a pre-determined parking space in the system. More sophisticated fully automated APS will obtain the dimensions of cars on entry in order to place them in the smallest available parking space.

The driver retrieves a car by inserting a ticket or code into an automated terminal. The APS lifts the car from its parking space and delivers it to an exit area. Most often, the retrieved car has been oriented to eliminate the need for the driver to back out.

Fully automated APS theoretically eliminate the need for parking attendants.

Semi-automated APS also use a mechanical system of some type to move a car to its parking space, however putting the car into and/or the operation of the system requires some action by an attendant or the driver.

The choice between fully and semi-automated APS is often a matter of space and cost, however large capacity (&gt; 100 cars) tend to be fully automated.

==Applications==

By virtue of their relatively smaller volume and mechanized parking systems, APS are often used in locations where a multi-story parking garage would be too large, too costly or impractical.&lt;ref name=Monahan_Article /&gt;&lt;ref name=Munn&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such applications include, under or inside existing or new structures, between existing structures and in irregularly shaped areas.

APS can also be applied in situations similar to multi-storey parking garages such as freestanding above ground, under buildings above grade and under buildings below grade.

==Costs==

The direct comparison of costs between an APS and a multi-story parking garage can be complicated by many variables such as capacity, land costs, area shape, number and location of entrances and exits, land usage, local codes and regulations, parking fees, location, and aesthetic and environmental requirements.

Following is a comparison&lt;ref name=Monahan_Article /&gt; of building costs for generic APS and multi-story parking garages:

{| class="wikitable"
|- 
! Application !! Type !! Parking Spaces !! sq ft (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) per Space !! Building Cost !! Cost per Space
|-  cellpadding="5"
| rowspan="2" | Freestanding Above Grade || Parking Garage || 200 || {{convert|320|sqft|m2|abbr=values}} || $3,200,000 || $16,000
|- 
| APS || 200 || {{convert|225|sqft|m2|abbr=values}} || $5,225,000 || $26,125
|-  
| rowspan="2" | Below Building Above Grade || Parking Garage || 200 || {{convert|450|sqft|m2|abbr=values}} || $6,750,000 || $33,750
|-  
| APS || 200 || {{convert|225|sqft|m2|abbr=values}} || $6,125,000 || $30,625
|- 
| rowspan="2" | Below Building Below Grade || Parking Garage || 200 || {{convert|450|sqft|m2|abbr=values}} || $9,450,000 || $47,250
|- 
| APS || 200 || {{convert|225|sqft|m2|abbr=values}} || $7,025,000 || $35,125
|}

The comparison above is for building costs only. Not included, for example, is the cost of land or the opportunity cost of the use of the land (i.e. the value of the additional space made available by the smaller size of the APS). As evidence of the complexities of comparing the costs for APS and multi-story parking garages, the same author presents an actual case study &lt;ref name=Monahan_presentation&gt;{{Citation | title = De-Mystifying Automated Parking Structures | url = http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/Documents/areas/ctr/ziman/UCLA%20Parking%20Dilemma%20Symposium_Don%20Monahan.pptx | year = 2011 | author = Monahan, Don | journal = PowerPoint Presentation | pages = 8 | accessdate = 2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|- 
! Application !! Type !! Parking Spaces !! sq ft (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) per Space !! Building Cost !! Cost per Space
|- 
| rowspan="2" | Freestanding Above Grade || Parking Garage || 203 || {{convert|445|sqft|m2|abbr=values}} || $6,000,000 || $29,600
|- 
| APS || 217 || {{convert|268|sqft|m2|abbr=values}} || $6,200,000 || $28,200
|}

In this case study, the APS also provides roughly {{cvt|7000|sqft|m2}} of additional open space compared to the multi-story parking garage which provides no open space and requires minimum setbacks be utilized. Other references&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamelink /&gt;&lt;ref name=Munn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Skelley&gt;{{Citation | title = Waiting for the Robo-Garage? | url = http://urbanland.uli.org/Articles/2012/Aug/ul/SkelleyRoboGarage | year = 2012 | author = Skelley, Jack | journal = Urban Land Magazine | issue = August | accessdate = 2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; also indicate that the cost comparison between APS and multi-story parking garages is highly dependent on the application and the detailed design.

[[File:Autonomous decentralised system architecture schematic.svg|thumb|Simplified schematic showing message passing in an autonomous decentralised system]]

An '''autonomous decentralized system''' (or '''ADS''') is a [[decentralized system]] composed of modules or components that are designed to operate independently but are capable of interacting with each other to meet the overall goal of the system. This design paradigm enables the system to continue to function in the event of component failures. It also enables maintenance and repair to be carried out while the system remains operational. Autonomous decentralized systems have a number of applications including industrial [[production line]]s, [[railway signalling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=High Integrity Software|page=105|year=2001|author1=Winter, Victor L.  |author2=Bhattacharya, Sourav |lastauthoramp=yes |ISBN=0-7923-7949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and robotics.

The ADS has been recently expanded from control applications to service application and embedded systems, thus autonomous decentralized service systems and autonomous decentralized device systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/story/ad/02.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010075816/http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/story/ad/02.html |archivedate=2014-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Autonomous decentralized systems were first proposed in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Service Availability: 4th International Service Availability Symposium|page=2|author=Mori, Kinji|title=Autonomous Decentralized System for Service Assurance and Its Application|year=2007|ISBN=978-3-540-72735-4|editors= Miroslaw Malek, Manfred Reitenspieß, Aad van Moorsel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ADS received significant attention as such systems have been deployed in Japanese railway systems for many years safely with over 7 billion trips,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/shinkansen-bullet-trains-in-Japan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://web-japan.org/niponica/niponica10/en/feature/feature03.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/isads/2013/5069/00/06513400.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hase/2001/1275/00/12750220-abs.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=503194&lt;/ref&gt; proving the value of this concept. Japan railway with ADS is considered as a smart train as it also learns.&lt;ref&gt;http://mag.uchicago.edu/law-policy-society/smart-trains&lt;/ref&gt;

To recognizing this outstanding contribution, Dr. Kinji Mori has received numerous awards including 2013 IEEE Life Fellow, 2012 Distinguished Service Award, Tokyo Metropolitan Government, 2012 Distinguished Specialist among 1000 in the world, Chinese Government, 2008 IEICE Fellow, 1995 IEEE Fellow 1994 Research and Development Award of Excellence Achievers, Science and Technology Agency, 1994 Ichimura Industrial Prize, 1992 Technology Achievement Award, Society of Instrument and Control Engineers, 1988 National Patent Award, Science and Technology Agency, and 1988 Mainichi Technology Prize of Excellence. Dr. Mori donated the cash from Ichimura Industrial Price to IEEE to fund the IEEE Kanai Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aoni.waseda.jp/kinji.mori/prof.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1977, ADS has been a subject of research by many researchers in the world including US, Japan, EU particularly Germany, and China.

== ADS architecture ==

An ADS is a [[Coupling (computer programming)|decoupled architecture]] where each component or subsystem communicates by [[message passing]] using shared data fields. A unique feature of the ADS is that there is no central operating system or coordinator. Instead each subsystem manages its own functionality and its coordination with other subsystems. When a subsystem needs to interact with other subsystems it broadcasts the shared data fields containing the request to all other subsystems. This broadcast does not include the identification or address of any other subsystem. Rather the other subsystems will, depending on their purpose and function, receive the broadcast message and make their own determination on what action (if any) to take.

As ADS moves into the service-oriented architecture (SOA) or ADSS (Autonomous Decentralized Service System),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/glossary/a/adss.html&lt;/ref&gt; the data transmission can be carried out by ESB (Enterprise Service Bus), and each agent can a service that receives data from the ESB and acts according to the service specification. The results are again transmitted by the ESB to other autonomous agents.

An ADS is also similar to a [[blackboard system]] used in AI where a collection of agents will act upon seeing any data change in the common blackboard.

An ADS may include human in the loop, with both human and autonomous agents both co-learn at the same time to perform the system functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/story/ad/01.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010081631/http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/story/ad/01.html |archivedate=2014-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cloud computing]] also uses autonomous computing, but its architecture and framework are different from ADS.

== Applications ==

One application of ADS is software testing, particularly combinatorial testing. A framework has been proposed based on ADS for concurrent combinatorial testing using AR and TA.

== Conferences ==

'''Bibliomining''' is the use of a combination of [[data mining]], [[data warehousing]], and [[bibliometrics]] for the purpose of analyzing library services. The term was created in 2003 by Scott Nicholson, Assistant Professor, Syracuse University School of Information Studies, in order to distinguish data mining in a library setting from other types of data mining.

==How bibliomining works==
First a data warehouse must be created. This is done by compiling information on the resources, such as titles and authors, subject headings, and descriptions of the collections. Then the demographic surrogate information is organized. Finally the library information (such as the librarian, whether or not the information came from the reference desk or circulation desk, and the location of the library) is obtained. 

Once this is organized, the data can be processed and analyzed. This can be done via a few methods, such as online analytical processing ([[OLAP]]), using a data mining program, or through [[data visualization]].

==Uses of bibliomining==
Bibliomining is used to discover patterns in what people are reading and researching and allows librarians to target their community better. Bibliomining can also help library directors focus their budgets on resources that will be utilized. Another use is to determine when people use the library more often, so staffing needs can be adequately met. Combining bibliomining with other research techniques such as focus groups, surveys and cost-benefit analysis, will help librarians to get a better picture of their patrons and their needs.

==Issues==

There is some concern that data mining violates patron privacy. But by extracting the data, all [[personally identifiable information]] is deleted, and the data warehouse is clean. The original patron data can then be totally deleted and there will be no way to link the new data to a particular patron.  This can be done in a few ways. One, used with information regarding database access, is to track the IP address, but then replace it with a similar code, that will allow identification without violating privacy.  Another is to keep track of an item returned to the library and create a "demographic surrogate" of the patron. The demographic surrogate would not give any identifiable information such as names, library card numbers or addresses.

The other concern in bibliomining is that it only provides data in a very detached manner. Information is given as to how a patron uses library resources, but there is no way to track if the resources met the user's needs completely. Someone could take out a book on a topic, but not find the information they were seeking. Bibliomining only helps identify which books are used, not how useful they actually were. Bibliomining cannot provide information on how well a collection serves a patron. In order to counteract this, bibliomining must be used in accordance with other research techniques.

The '''binding problem''' is a term used at the interface between [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive science]] and [[philosophy of mind]] that has multiple meanings.

Firstly, there is the '''segregation problem''': a practical computational problem of how brains segregate elements in complex patterns of [[sensory perception|sensory input]] so that they are allocated to discrete "objects". In other words, when looking at a blue square and a yellow circle, what neural mechanisms ensure that the square is perceived as blue and the circle as yellow, and not vice versa? The segregation problem is sometimes called BP1.

Secondly, there is the '''combination problem''':The problem of how objects, background and abstract or emotional features are combined into a single experience.&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Revonsuo | first1 = A. | last2 = Newman | first2 = J. | title = Binding and consciousness. | journal = Conscious Cogn | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–7 |date=Jun 1999 | doi = 10.1006/ccog.1999.0393 | PMID = 10447994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination problem is sometimes called BP2.

However, the difference between these two problems is not always clear. Moreover, the historical literature is often ambiguous as to whether it is addressing the segregation or the combination problem.&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Smythies | first1 = John R. (John Raymond) | title = The walls of Plato's cave : the science and philosophy of (brain, consciousness, and perception | year = 1994 | publisher = Avebury | location = Aldershot ; Brookfield, USA | isbn = 978-1-85628-882-8 | oclc = 30156912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The segregation problem==

===Definition===
The segregation problem is the problem of how brains segregate elements in complex patterns of sensory input so that they are allocated to discrete "objects".&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"/&gt;

Smythies defined BP1 in these terms: "How is the representation of information built up in the [[neural network]]s that there is one single object 'out there' and not a mere collection of separate shapes, colours and movements?"&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"/&gt; Revonsuo refers to this as the problem of "stimulus-related binding" – of sorting stimuli. Although usually referred to as a problem of binding, the computational problem is arguably one of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt; Thus, in the words of Canales et al.: "to bind together all the features of one object and segregate them from features of other objects and the background".&lt;ref name="Canales 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Canales | first1 = AF. | last2 = Gómez | first2 = DM. | last3 = Maffet | first3 = CR. | title = A critical assessment of the consciousness by synchrony hypothesis. | journal = Biol Res | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 517–9 | month =  | year = 2007 | doi =  10.4067/S0716-97602007000500012 | PMID = 18575683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartels and Zeki  describe it as "determining that it is the same (or a different) stimulus which is activating different cells in a given visual area or in different visual areas".&lt;ref name="Bartels 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bartels | first1 = A. | last2 = Zeki | first2 = S. | title = The temporal order of binding visual attributes. | journal = Vision Res | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2280–6 | date = Jul 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.visres.2005.11.017 | PMID = 16387344 | url = http://www.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/Bartels2006_visualBinding_%5B0%5D.pdf }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental work===
Most experimental work is on vision, where it is known that humans and other mammals process different aspects of [[perception]] by separating information about those aspects and processing them in distinct regions of the brain. For example, Bartels and Zeki have shown that different areas in the [[visual cortex]] specialize in processing the different aspects of [[color vision|colour]], [[motion perception|motion]], and [[shape]]. This type of modular coding has been claimed to yield a potential for [[ambiguity]]. When humans view a scene containing a blue square and a yellow circle, some neurons signal in response to blue, others signal in response to yellow, still others to a square shape or a circle shape. Here, the binding problem is the issue of how the brain correctly pairs colour and shape, i.e. indicates that blue goes with square, rather than yellow.&lt;ref name="Bartels 2006"/&gt;

===Synchronization theory===
A popular hypothesis perhaps first suggested by Milner has been that features of individual objects are bound/segregated via [[neural oscillation|synchronisation]] of the activity of different neurons in the cortex.&lt;ref name="Milner 1974"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milner PM |title=A model for visual shape recognition |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=521–35 |date=November 1974 |pmid=4445414 |doi=10.1037/h0037149 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shadlen 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shadlen MN, Movshon JA |title=Synchrony unbound: a critical evaluation of the temporal binding hypothesis |journal=Neuron |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=67–77, 111–25 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10677027 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80822-3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that when two feature-neurons fire synchronously they are bound, while when they fire out of synchrony they are unbound. Empirical testing of the idea was given impetus when von der Malsburg  proposed that feature binding posed a special problem that could not be covered simply by cellular firing rates.&lt;ref&gt;von der Malsburg, C. (1981). The correlation theory of brain function. MPI Biophysical Chemistry, Internal Report 81–2. Reprinted in Mod- els of Neural Networks II (1994), E. Domany, J.L. van Hemmen, and K. Schulten, eds. (Berlin: Springer).&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies suggested that there is indeed a relationship between rhythmic synchronous firing and feature binding. This rhythmic firing appears to be linked to intrinsic oscillations in neuronal somatic potentials, typically in the [[gamma wave|gamma range]] close to 40&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Engel 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engel AK, König P, Gray CM, Singer W |title=Stimulus-Dependent Neuronal Oscillations in Cat Visual Cortex: Inter-Columnar Interaction as Determined by Cross-Correlation Analysis |journal=Eur.

The positive arguments for a role for rhythmic synchrony in resolving the segregational object-feature binding problem (BP1) have been summarized by Singer.&lt;ref name="Singer 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=Wolf|title=Binding by synchrony| journal=Scholarpedia| volume=2| issue=12| year=2007|pages=1657|issn=1941-6016|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1657}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is certainly extensive evidence for synchronization of neural firing as part of responses to visual stimuli. However, there is inconsistency between findings from different laboratories. Moreover, a number of recent reviewers, including Shadlen and Movshon&lt;ref name="Shadlen 1999"/&gt; and Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Merker B |title=Cortical gamma oscillations: the functional key is activation, not cognition |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=401–17 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23333264 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.01.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have raised concerns.

Shadlen and Movshon,&lt;ref name="Shadlen 1999"/&gt; raise a series of doubts about both the theoretical and the empirical basis for the idea of segregational binding by temporal synchrony. Firstly, it is not clear that binding does pose a special computational problem of the sort proposed by von der Malsburg. Secondly, it is unclear how synchrony would come to play a distinct role in terms of local computational logic. Thirdly, it is difficult to envisage a situation in which pre-synaptic firing rate and synchrony could be usefully interpreted independently by a post-synaptic cell, since the two are interdependent over plausible time scales.

Another point that has been raised is that within standard time frames for neuronal firing very few distinct phases of synchrony would be distinguishable even under optimal conditions&lt;!--[15]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} However, this would only be significant if the same pathways are potentially fed spike (signal) trains in multiple phases. In contrast, Seth&lt;ref name="Seth 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seth|first1=A. K.|title=Visual Binding Through Reentrant Connectivity and Dynamic Synchronization in a Brain-based Device|journal=Cerebral Cortex| volume=14| issue=11| year=2004| pages=1185–1199|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhh079| pmid=15142952}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes an artificial brain-based robot that demonstrates multiple, separate, widely distributed neural circuits, firing at different phases, suggesting that synchrony may assist the establishment of discrete object-related re-entrant circuits in a system exposed to randomly timed stimuli.

Goldfarb and Treisman&lt;ref name="Goldfarb 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Goldfarb | first1 = L. | last2 = Treisman | first2 = A. | title = Counting multidimensional objects: implications for the neural-synchrony theory. | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 266–71 |date=Mar 2013 | doi = 10.1177/0956797612459761 | PMID = 23334446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; point out that a logical problem appears to arise for binding solely via synchrony if there are several objects that share some of their features and not others. When viewing a display of variously coloured letters, internal representation of a red X, a green O, a red O and a green X cannot be accounted for purely by synchrony of signals for red and X shape, for instance. At best synchrony can facilitate segregation supported by other means (as von der Malsburg acknowledges&lt;ref name="von der Malsburg 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = von der Malsburg | first1 = C. | title = The what and why of binding: the modeler's perspective. | journal = Neuron | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 95–104, 111–25 |date=Sep 1999 | url = http://cogprints.org/1488/5/cvdm.pdf | PMID = 10677030 | doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80825-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A number of neuropsychological studies suggest that the association of colour, shape and movement as "features of an object" is not simply a matter of linking or "binding". Purves and Lotto&lt;ref&gt;Purves, D. and Lotto, R. B. (2003) Why we see what we do: An empirical theory of vision. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; give extensive evidence for top-down feedback signals that ensure that sensory data are handled as features of (sometimes wrongly) postulated objects early in processing. In many illusions data appear as if pre-consciously adjusted in accordance with object expectations. Pylyshyn&lt;ref name="Pylyshyn 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Pylyshyn | first1 = ZW. | title = Visual indexes, preconceptual objects, and situated vision. | journal = Cognition | volume = 80 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 127–58 |date=Jun 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00156-6 | PMID = 11245842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has also emphasized the way the brain seems to pre-conceive objects to which features are to be allocated and which are attributed continuing existence even if features, like color  change.

===Feature integration theory===
In her [[feature integration theory]], [[Anne Treisman|Treisman]] suggested that binding between features is mediated by the features' links to a common location. Psychophysical demonstrations of binding failures under conditions of full [[attention]] provide support for the idea that binding is accomplished through common location tags.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Treisman, A. |author2=Gelade, G. |year=1980 |title=A feature integration theory of attention. |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=97–136 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5 |pmid=7351125 |url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy355/Gilden/treisman.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905025042/http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy355/Gilden/treisman.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An implication of these approaches is that sensory data such as colour or motion may not normally exist in "unallocated" form. For Merker:&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; "The 'red' of a red ball does not float disembodied in an abstract color space in V4." If colour information allocated to a point in the visual field is converted directly, via the instantiation of some form of propositional logic (analogous to that used in computer design) into colour information allocated to an "object identity" postulated by a top-down signal as suggested by Purves and Lotto, (e.g. There is blue here + Object 1 is here = Object 1 is blue) no special computational task of "binding together" by means such as synchrony may exist. (Although Von der Malsburg&lt;!--[18]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} poses the problem in terms of binding "propositions" such as "triangle" and "top", these, in isolation, are not propositional.)

How signals in the brain come to have propositional content, or meaning, is a much larger issue. However, both Marr&lt;ref&gt;Marr, D. C. (1982) Vision. New York, Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barlow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barlow | first1 = H. | year = 1972 | title = Single units and sensation: A neuron doctrine for perceptual psychology? | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 371–394 | doi=10.1068/p010371}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested, on the basis of what was known about neural connectivity in the 1970s that the final integration of features into a percept would be expected to resemble the way words operate in sentences.

The role of synchrony in segregational binding remains controversial. Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; has recently suggested that synchrony may be a feature of areas of activation in the brain that relates to an "infrastructural" feature of the computational system analogous to increased oxygen demand indicated via MRI. Apparent specific correlations with segregational tasks may be explainable on the basis of interconnectivity of the areas involved. As a possible manifestation of a need to balance excitation and inhibition over time it might be expected to be associated with reciprocal re-entrant circuits as in the model of Seth et al.&lt;ref name="Seth 2004"/&gt; (Merker gives the analogy of the whistle from an audio amplifier receiving its own output.)

If it transpires that synchronized activity plays at most an infrastructural role in segregative computational "binding", the question arises as to whether we need another explanation. The implication both of Shadlen and Movshon's and of Merker's analyses seems to be that there may be no special binding problem in this sense. The problem may be merely an integral part of the more general problem of the computational logic used by neurons, or what is often referred to as the "neural code". In particular it may be inappropriate to analyse binding in perception without taking into account the way features are bound in memory, as addressed by Zimmer and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, H.D., Mecklinger, A. and Lindenberger, U. (2006) Binding in human memory: A neurocognitive approach. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and how that informs the way the brain pre-conceives objects&lt;!--[19,20]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==The combination problem==

===Definition===
[[John Raymond Smythies|Smythies]]&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"/&gt; defines BP2 as "How do the brain mechanisms actually construct the phenomenal object?". Revonsuo&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt; equates this to "[[consciousness]]-related binding", emphasizing the entailment of a phenomenal aspect. As Revonsuo explores in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Revonsuo, A, (2006) Inner Presence: Consciousness as a biological phenomenon. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; there are nuances of difference beyond the basic BP1:BP2 division. Smythies speaks of constructing a phenomenal object ("local unity" for Revonsuo) but philosophers such as Descartes, Leibniz, Kant and James (see Brook and Raymont&lt;ref&gt;The Unity of Consciousness. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-unity/&lt;/ref&gt;) have typically been concerned with the broader unity of a phenomenal experience ("global unity" for Revonsuo) – which, as Bayne&lt;ref name="Bayne"&gt;Bayne, T. and Chalmers, D. (2003) What is the unity of consciousness? In Cleeremans, A. The Unity of consciousness, Binding, Integration and Dissociation, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates may involve features as diverse as seeing a book, hearing a tune and feeling an emotion. Further discussion will focus on this more general problem of how sensory data that may have been segregated into, for instance, "blue square" and "yellow circle" are to be re-combined into a single phenomenal experience of a blue square next to a yellow circle, plus all other features of their context. There are a wide range of views on just how real this "unity" is, but the existence of medical conditions in which it appears to be subjectively impaired, or at least restricted, suggests that it is not entirely illusory&lt;!--[26]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===History===
Early philosophers such as [[Descartes]] and [[Leibniz]]&lt;!--[26]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} noted that the apparent unity of our experience is an all-or-none qualitative characteristic that does not appear to have an equivalent in the known quantitative features, like proximity or cohesion, of composite matter. [[William James]]&lt;!--[5]--&gt;,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} in the nineteenth century, considered the ways the unity of consciousness might be explained by known physics and found no satisfactory answer. He coined the term "combination problem", in the specific context of a "mind-dust theory" in which it is proposed that a full human conscious experience is built up from proto- or micro-experiences in the way that matter is built up from atoms. James claimed that such a theory was incoherent, since no causal physical account could be given of how distributed proto-experiences would "combine". He favoured instead a concept of "co-consciousness" in which there is one "experience of A, B and C" rather than combined experiences. A detailed discussion of subsequent philosophical positions is given by Brook and Raymont (see 26). However, these do not generally include physical interpretations. James&lt;!--[5]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} remained concerned about the absence of a "single physical thing", other than an atom, that could be co-conscious (of A, B and C), echoing Leibniz.

[[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929) Process and Reality. 1979 corrected edition, edited by David Ray Griffin and Donald W. Sherburne, Free Press. {{ISBN|0-02-934570-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a fundamental ontological basis for a relation consistent with James's idea of co-consciousness, in which many causal elements are co-available or "compresent" in a single event or "occasion" that constitutes a unified experience. Whitehead did not give physical specifics but the idea of compresence is framed in terms of causal convergence in a local interaction consistent with physics. Where Whitehead goes beyond anything formally recognized in physics is in the "chunking" of causal relations into complex but discrete "occasions". Even if such occasions can be defined, Whitehead's approach still leaves James's difficulty with finding a site, or sites, of causal convergence that would make neurobiological sense for "co-consciousness". Sites of signal convergence do clearly exist throughout the brain but there is a concern to avoid re-inventing what [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett"&gt;Dennett, D.C. (1978) Brainstorms (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press)&lt;/ref&gt; calls a Cartesian Theater or single central site of convergence of the form that Descartes proposed.

Descartes's central "soul" is now rejected because neural activity closely correlated with conscious perception is widely distributed throughout the cortex. The remaining choices appear to be either separate involvement of multiple distributed causally convergent events or a model that does not tie a phenomenal experience to any specific local physical event but rather to some overall "functional" capacity. Whichever interpretation is taken, as Revonsuo&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt; indicates, there is no consensus on what structural level we are dealing with – whether the cellular level, that of cellular groups as "nodes", "complexes" or "assemblies" or that of widely distributed networks. There is probably only general agreement that it is not the level of the whole brain, since there is evidence that signals in certain primary sensory areas, such as the V1 region of the visual cortex (in addition to motor areas and cerebellum), do not contribute directly to phenomenal experience.

Dennett&lt;ref name="Dennett"/&gt; has proposed that our sense that our experiences are single events is illusory and that, instead, at any one time there are "multiple drafts" of sensory patterns at multiple sites. Each would only cover a fragment of what we think we experience. Arguably, Dennett is claiming that consciousness is not unified and there is no phenomenal binding problem. Most philosophers have difficulty with this position (see Bayne&lt;ref name="Bayne"/&gt;). Dennett's view might be in keeping with evidence from recall experiments and change blindness purporting to show that our experiences are much less rich than we sense them to be – what has been called the Grand Illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, S. J., Brelstaff, G., Nelson, K., Troscianko, T. (1995), "Is the richness of our visual world an illusion? Transsaccadic memory for complex scenes", Perception, 24, pp. 1075–81.&lt;/ref&gt; However, few, if any, other authors suggest the existence of multiple partial "drafts". Moreover, also on the basis of recall experiments, Lamme&lt;ref name="Lamme"&gt;Lamme, V. (2002) The grand Grand Illusion illusion. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 9, 141–157.&lt;/ref&gt; has challenged the idea that richness is illusory, emphasizing that phenomenal content cannot be equated with content to which there is cognitive access.

Dennett does not tie drafts to biophysical events. Multiple sites of causal convergence are invoked in specific biophysical terms by Edwards&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. C. (2005) Is consciousness only a property of individual cells? Journal of Consciousness Studies 12, 4-5, 60–76. Available at http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jonathan-edwards&lt;/ref&gt; and Sevush.&lt;ref&gt;Sevush, S. (2006) Single neuron theory of consciousness. J. Theoretical Biology 238, 704–725.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view the sensory signals to be combined in phenomenal experience are available, in full, at each of multiple sites. To avoid non-causal combination each site/event is placed within an individual neuronal dendritic tree. The advantage is that "compresence" is invoked just where convergence occurs neuro-anatomically. The disadvantage, as for Dennett, is the counter-intuitive concept of multiple "copies" of experience. The precise nature of an experiential event or "occasion", even if local, also remains uncertain.

The majority of theoretical frameworks for the unified richness of phenomenal experience adhere to the intuitive idea that experience exists as a single copy, and draw on "functional" descriptions of distributed networks of cells. Baars&lt;ref&gt;Baars, B. J. (1997), In the Theater of Consciousness New York, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that certain signals, encoding what we experience, enter a "Global Workspace" within which they are "broadcast" to many sites in the cortex for parallel processing. Dehaene, Changeux and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene, S., Sergent, C. and Changeux, J.-P. (2003). A neuronal network model linking subjective reports and objective physiological data during conscious perception. Proc. National Academy of Science (USA) 100. 14: 8520–8525.&lt;/ref&gt; have developed a detailed neuro-anatomical version of such a workspace. Tononi and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Balduzzi D, Tononi G. (2008) Integrated information in discrete dynamical systems: motivation and theoretical framework. ''PLoS Comput Biol''. 4(6):e1000091. doi: 10.1371/ journal.pcbi.1000091&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the level of richness of an experience is determined by the narrowest information interface "bottleneck" in the largest sub-network or "complex" that acts as an integrated functional unit. Lamme&lt;ref name="Lamme"/&gt; has suggested that networks supporting reciprocal signaling rather than those merely involved in feed-forward signaling support experience. Edelman and colleagues have also emphasized the importance of re-entrant signaling&lt;!--[16]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Cleeremans&lt;ref&gt;Cleeremans, A. (2011) The radical plasticity thesis. Frontiers in Psychology 2, Article 86 {{DOI|10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00086}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes meta-representation as the functional signature of signals contributing to consciousness.

In general, such network-based theories are not explicitly theories of how consciousness is unified, or "bound" but rather theories of functional domains within which signals contribute to unified conscious experience. A concern about functional domains is what Rosenberg&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, G. (2004) A Place for Consciousness. Oxford, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-516814-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has called the boundary problem; it is hard to find a unique account of what is to be included and what excluded. Nevertheless, this is, if anything is, the consensus approach.

Within the network context, a role for synchrony has been invoked as a solution to the phenomenal binding problem as well as the computational one. In his book, [[The Astonishing Hypothesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Crick, F. (1995) The Astonishing Hypothesis. Scribner Paperback {{ISBN|0-684-80158-2}} {{ISBN|978-0684801582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crick appears to be offering a solution to BP2 as much as BP1. Even von der Malsburg,&lt;!--[19]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} introduces detailed computational arguments about object feature binding with remarks about a "psychological moment". The Singer group&lt;!--[14]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} also appear to be interested as much in the role of synchrony in phenomenal awareness as in computational segregation.

The apparent incompatibility of using synchrony to both segregate and unify might be explained by sequential roles. However, Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; points out what appears to be a contradiction in attempts to solve the phenomenal unification problem (BP2) in terms of a functional (effectively meaning computational) rather than a local biophysical, domain, in the context of synchrony.

Functional arguments for a role for synchrony are in fact underpinned by analysis of local biophysical events. However, Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; points out that the explanatory work is done by the downstream integration of synchronized signals in post-synaptic neurons: "It is, however, by no means clear what is to be understood by 'binding by synchrony' other than the threshold advantage conferred by synchrony at, and only at, sites of axonal convergence onto single dendritic trees..." In other words, although synchrony is proposed as a way of explaining binding on a distributed, rather than a convergent, basis the justification rests on what happens at convergence. Signals for two features are proposed as bound by synchrony because synchrony effects downstream convergent interaction. Any theory of phenomenal binding based on this sort of computational function would seem to follow the same principle. The phenomenality would entail convergence, if the computational function does.

Although BP1 and BP2 are different, this need not invalidate the assumption, implicit in many of the quoted models, that computational and phenomenal events, at least at some point in the sequence of events, parallel each other in some way. The difficulty remains in identifying what that way might be. Merker's&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; analysis suggests that either (1) both computational and phenomenal aspects of binding are determined by convergence of signals on neuronal dendritic trees, or (2) that our intuitive ideas about the need for "binding" in a "holding together" sense in both computational and phenomenal contexts are misconceived. We may be looking for something extra that is not needed. Merker, for instance, argues that the homotopic connectivity of sensory pathways does the necessary work.

The nature of, and solution to, BP2 remains a matter of controversy.

==Recent developments== 

A new study published in [[Psychological Review]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/125/4/545|title=The emergence of polychronization and feature binding in a spiking neural network model of the primate ventral visual system|author1=Eguchi A.|author2=et al.,|date=2018|publisher=Psychological Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Interface Focus|''Interface Focus'']] 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/4/20180021.e-letters|author1=Isbister, J.|author2 = et al.| year = 2018|title=A new approach to solving the feature-binding problem in primate vision|work=|format=| publisher = The Royal Society| DOI=10.1098/rsfs.2018.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]] cross-disciplinary journal at the interface between the physical and life sciences, sheds new light on how the visual system may represent which features are bound together as part of the same object. 

The research team, [http://www.oftnai.org the Oxford Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oftnai.org |title=Oxford Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence|work=|format=|}} &lt;/ref&gt; , led by Dr [[Simon Stringer]] from [[University of Oxford]], performed bio-inspired [[Spiking neural network|Spiking Neural Network]] simulations of the primate ventral visual system to address this enduring question. By training the biophysical model on a set of visual stimuli, has been observed the emergence of a subpopulation of [[neurons]], called ''polychronous neuronal groups'' (PNG), that exhibits regularly repeating spatio-temporal patterns of spikes. The underlying phenomenon of such spatio-temporal patterns responses is known as polychronization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/089976606775093882|title=Polychronization: computation with spikes|last=Izhikevich|first=EM,|date=2006|publisher=Neural Computation}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main point of this proposed novel approach is that within these PNGs exist neurons, called ''binding neurons'', that learn to represent the hierarchical binding relationships between lower and higher level visual features at every spatial scale and across the entire visual field. These binding neurons have been firstly formulated by [[Christoph von der Malsburg]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(00)80825-9|title=The What and Why of Binding|last=von der Malsburg|first=Christoph,|date=1999|publisher=Cell Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; , however, it has not previously been shown how these neurons may develop naturally through a biologically plausible process of visually guided learning and self-organization of polychronous neuronal groups. This latest research describe that such binding neurons emerge automatically within the PNGs during visually training when key properties of the visual cortex are incorporated into the model. This finding is consistent with the hierarchical nature of primate vision depicted by John Duncan &amp; [[Glyn W. Humphreys]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A fully hierarchical representation is created by repeating segmentation at different levels of scale. Each structural unit, contained by its own boundary, is further subdivided into parts by the major boundaries within it. Thus, a human body may be subdivided into head, torso, and limbs, and a hand into palm and fingers. Such subdivision serves two purposes. The description of a structural unit at one level of scale (animal, letter, etc.) must depend heavily on the relations between the parts defined within it (as well as on properties such as colour or movement that may be common to the parts). Then, at the next level down, each part becomes a new structural unit to be further described with its own properties, defined among other things by the relations between its own subparts. At the top of the hierarchy may be a structural unit corresponding to the whole input scene, described with a rough set of properties (e.g. division into light sky above and dark ground below)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/hollingworth/prosem/Duncan_Humphreys_89_PR_VisualSearchStimulus.pdf|title=Visual Search and Stimulus Similarity|author1=Duncan J.|author2=Humphreys GW.|date=1989|publisher=Psychological Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, this hierarchy feature binding theory proposes that information about visual features at every spatial scale, including the binding relations between these features, would be projected upwards to the higher layers of the network, where spatial information would be available for readout by later brain systems to guide behavior. This mechanism has been called  the ''holographic principle''. Lastly, by representing the hierarchical binding relationships between visual features at every spatial scale across a visual scene, these kinds of binding neurons could underpin visual consciousness itself, the capacity of the visual brain to perceive and make sense of its visuospatial world. Therefore, this work may represent a significant advancement towards the future development of [[Artificial General Intelligence]] and [[Machine Consciousness]], opening up new perspectives on building machines endowed with human-level intelligence.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citeweb|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/intelligent-machines-are-starting-to-catch-up-ps2f5m0j6|date=August 2018|title=Intelligent machines are starting to catch up|publisher = The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biotic potential'''  is described by the unrestricted growth of populations resulting in the maximum growth of that population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Gary|title=Living with the Earth, Third Edition: Concepts in Environmental Health Science|page=38|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Biotic potential is the highest possible vital index of a species; therefore, when the species has its highest birthrate and lowest mortality rate.

==Quantitative Expression==

The biotic potential is the quantitative expression of the ability of a species to face selection in any environment. The main equilibrium of a particular population is described by the equation:

:Number of Individuals = Biotic Potential/Resistance of the Environment (Biotic and Abiotic)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Ancona|first1=Umberto|title=The Struggle for Existence|page=227|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman also relates to a "vital index", regarding a ratio to find the rate of surviving members of a species, whereas;
:Vital Index = (number of births/number of deaths)*100

==Components==

According to the ecologist R.N Chapman (1928), the biotic potential could be divided into a reproductive and survival potential. The survival potential could in turn be divided into nutritive and protective potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Ancona|first1=Umberto|title=The Struggle for Existence|page=227|accessdate=8 July 2016}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive potential (potential [[natality]]) is the upper limit to biotic potential in the absence of mortality. Survival potential is the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of [[Death|mortality]]. Because reproductive potential does not account for the number of gametes surviving, survival potential is a necessary component of biotic potential. In the absence of mortality, biotic potential = reproductive potential.

Chapman also identified two additional components of nutritive and protective potentials as divisions of the survival potential. Nutritive potential is the ability to acquire and use food for growth and energy. Protective potential is described by the ability of the organism to protect itself against the dynamic forces of environment in order to insure successful reproduction and offspring.

Full expression of the biotic potential of an organism is restricted by environmental resistance, any condition that inhibits the increase in number of the population. It is generally only reached when environmental conditions are very favorable. A species reaching its biotic potential would exhibit exponential [[population growth]] and be said to have a high [[fertility]], that is, how many offspring are produced per mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nebel|first1=Bernard|last2=Wright|first2=Richard|title=Environmental Science: The Way the World Works|page=73|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5613">'''The Centre for Technology Assessment TA-SWISS''' is a Centre of Competence of the [http://www.swiss-academies.ch/index.php Swiss Academies of Arts and Science], based on a mandate in the Swiss federal law on research. It is an advisory body, financed by public money, and devoted to [[technology assessment]]. (The abbreviation «TA» which is used to describe TA-SWISS stands for [[Technology Assessment]], and reflects the activities of the Centre.)

==Mission==
The object of the Centre for Technology Assessment TA-SWISS is to follow technological changes and developments and to identify the social, legal and ethical consequences of new technologies. Another element of its mission is to encourage the discussion of scientific and technological challenges.

The recommendations that result from TA-SWISS projects are used to assist the decision making process, and are intended for the Swiss Parliament and the Federal Council. Depending on the topics covered, these recommendations may also be of interest to other groups, such as professional associations, commercial enterprises, universities and stakeholder groups, as well as public administrations. The media, in their role as disseminators of information, are also kept regularly informed about the activities of TA-SWISS.

TA-Swiss is full member of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network&lt;ref&gt;EPTA is a network of those bodies in Europe that are devoted, at least among other tasks, to advise Parliaments, see [http://eptanetwork.org EPTA homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a founding member of the German speaking Network NTA (Netzwerk Technikfolgenabschätzung).&lt;ref&gt;NTA is the association of technology assessment institutions and practitioners in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, see [http://www.netzwerk-ta.net NTA homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The activities of the Centre for Technology Assessment TA-SWISS are further divided into two areas:

1. Studies (interdisciplinary scientific analyses)

==History==
Experimental beginnings: The Centre for Technology Assessment began its work in 1992. Following a number of parliamentary interventions, the Federal Council assigned the Swiss Science and Technology Council the task of developing a system of technology assessment for Switzerland over a four-year pilot phase (1992–1995).

Institutionalisation of technology assessment: In its Message relating to the promotion of training, research and technology for the years 1996-1999, the Federal Council defined the bases for the institutionalisation and financing of technology assessment in Switzerland. In 1999, technology assessment was firmly fixed in the law on research. In this way, the Federal Council reinforced the independence of TA-SWISS, which until 2007 was affiliated to the Swiss Science and Technology Council.

In 2008 a change in the law on research conferred the legal basis on the incorporation of the mandate for TA-SWISS within the Association of Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences. Accordingly, since 1 January 2008 TA-SWISS has been a Centre for Excellence of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences.

{{Expand Hungarian|Társadalomelméleti Kollégium|date=November 2011}}
The '''College for Advanced Studies in Social Theory''' ({{lang-hu|Társadalomelméleti Kollégium}}, ''TEK'') is the second oldest college of its type at the [[Corvinus University of Budapest]] as well as in [[Hungary]].

== History ==

TEK is the second oldest, still operating, college in Hungary. It was founded in 1981 by young researchers and students. Its orientation can be divided into two parts: vocational work and community life. The first is well documented, the latter is somewhat more distorted, due to the effects of [[collective memory]].
[[Image:Marx old.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karl Marx]]]]

=== 1981–present ===

TEK seceded from the first established college in Hungary, the [[Rajk László College for Advanced Studies]].
However, in the beginning - before [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] - the College's main topic was the reinterpretation of [[Marx]]'s ouvre, since liberal and alternative thinking was only possible if it was related to Marxist studies. With the fall of the iron curtain, this coercion disappeared, and since the College's main profile was its diversity and openness to new ideas, philosophies and theories, the College's profile now freely and rapidly ramified into diverse - and pioneering among the Hungarian colleges at that time - topics: [[environmentalism]], [[sustainability]], [[postmodernism]], [[anarchism]], [[postmarxism]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Buddhist economics]], [[feminism]], [[minority group|sociology of minorities]], [[queer studies]], [[postcolonialism]], [[network theory]]. The College also dealt with the topic of [[squatting]], the sociological causes of [[poverty]] and since the establishment the farmost detailed analysis of [[critical theory]]/[[Frankfurt school]] among other colleges.

== Philosophical principles ==
=== Criticism ===

TEK is providing a critical approach to the economical theories that Corvinus University has in its educational program– among others, focusing on the social inequalities [[human resources]], [[structuralism]], [[neoliberalism]], [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], [[corporatism]] inherently bares -.
TEK is also involved in highly regarded green activism, such as [[critical mass]], [[gay pride]], many [[flashmob]]s, that are held in support of promoting a livable environment. Among the members of TEK are also permanent supporters of the anti-[[g8]] anti-[[g20]] demonstrations.

=== Commune ===
The TEK started a lifestyle experiment, by establishing - again firstly - the habit of an annual [[commune (intentional community)|commune]],  in which the members apply voluntarily. These communes give the participants the opportunity to experience such a lifestyle that is hard to experience among European [[capitalist]] societies. In these communities the members share all goods, live together in one place creating a highly tied community of a few.

=== Aims ===

TEK’s main aim is a critical approach to the topics taught in Corvinus University.
TEK is more of a theoretical college, putting theoretical approaches to the questions of the society in front of bare statistical analysis, processing of data.
However members of TEK – individually - are highly involved in diverse fields of practice – e.g. organizing conferences on behalf of the homeless, many voluntary work promoting the reintegration of gypsies into the labour market, helping the educational development of those from less developed areas -.

== Vocational work ==
=== Tutorials ===

The base of the vocational work in TEK are the annual or semi-annual Tutorials. The topics of these Tutorials are given by the members of the College, which Tutorials are to be held by the tutors after compiling a schedule. The participants analyse, discuss the literature together with the tutor. As a conclusion, at the end of every tutorial, the participants are to hand in an essay of one of the topics that were discussed during the Tutorial.
The main frame for the Tutorials are based on 5 main fields: [[political economy]], economics of [[globalization]], Frankfurt School, [[green economics|green]] and [[Justice (economics)|ethical]] economics, postmodern sociology.
Every fresher has to participate in the Ground Tutorial, which provides a brief insight to the work and schedule of all five fields.

=== Related works ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41653">The '''coloniality of gender''' is a  concept developed by feminist philosopher [[Maria Lugones|María Lugones]], which she defines as "the analysis of [[racialized]], [[capitalist]], gender oppression", while the process of potentially overcoming this practice can be defined as "decolonial feminism".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"&gt;Lugones, María. Toward a Decolonial Feminism. Hypatia vol. 25, no. 4 (Fall 2010). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|747}} Central to these terms is the definition and recognition of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] social structures and their relation to land, and the articulation of how these [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] occupy an oppositional consciousness&lt;ref&gt;[[Chela Sandoval|Sandoval, Chela]]. US Third World Feminism: the Theory and Method of Oppositional Consciousness in the Postmodern World. pp. 1-24. Genders, no. 10, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to colonial systems of social, sexual, ecological, spatial, and temporal hierarchy. María Lugones describes this difference as the 'oppressing ←→ resisting' relationship.

Colonialism of gender has altered the indigenous sense of self, identity and to the larger extent their cosmology and gender relationships. With the colonization of indigenous groups, it allowed European to implement their idea of gender and sex. This covered up the preexisting conception of  sex and gender in the indigenous group during the pre-colonialism times. This is evident with the lack of representation or awareness in Western society for the indigenous concept of being "Two Spirited"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://transhealth.phsa.ca/trans-101/two-spirit|title=Two-Spirit - Transgender Health Information Program|work=Transgender Health Information Program|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of gender itself was believed to be introduced by Western colonizers as a way to distinct two dualistic social categories which are men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/topics/coloniality-of-gender/|title=Coloniality of Gender – GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|website=globalsocialtheory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonizers had introduced the idea of gender itself into Indigenous groups as this was originally a colonial concept which was made to organize production, territory and behavior. The desire for the colonizer to put forth the idea of gender onto an Indigenous group was to have control over their labor, authority, influence their subjectivity and ideas of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jstor.org.proxy.library.carleton.ca/stable/pdf/4640051.pdf|title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial / Modern Gender System|last=Lugones|first=María|date=December 12, 2017|website=www.jstor.org.proxy.library.carleton.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In relation to race, land, and sovereignty ==

According to [[Glen Sean Coulthard]] in his essay ''For the Land: the Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination'', Indigenous resistances against "capitalist imperialism" can be understood as struggles surrounding the question of land and knowledge-based practices encompassing the "relation to one another and our surroundings in a respectful, nondominating and nonexploitative way".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"&gt;Coulthard, Glen Sean. "For the Land: The Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination." Red Skin White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} Coulthard defines this system of relationality as "grounded normativity"&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} stating, "the late Lakota philosopher [[Vine Deloria Jr.]] argues that one of the most significant differences that exist between Indigenous and Western [[metaphysics]] revolves around the central importance of land to Indigenous modes of being, thought, and ethics".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Further to this, Coulthard argues that Indigenous "philosophies of nonoppression" are defined through spatial as well as temporal relationships.&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|62}} Lugones refers to these Western-versus-Indigenous epistemologies as 'cosmologies'&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|754, 749}} in her essay ''Toward a Decolonial Feminism'', where she analyzes these structures in relation to the colonial imposition of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] on Indigenous communities.

According to Lugones, colonial modernity is positioned as "the dichotomous hierarchy between the human and the non-human",&lt;ref name=Foot01/&gt; summarized by Lugones' use of the term "colonial difference".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones states that within the context of colonization in the Americas and the Caribbean, this hierarchy was employed as a tactic of subordination of the colonized to "Western man".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones argues that related hierarchies were constructed by colonizers to create a binary division between men and women, describing this distinction as "a mark of the human and a mark of civilization. Only the civilized are men or women," which excluded Indigenous peoples and Africans as being non-human animals, while upholding the status of "bourgeois European women" as passive reproductive servants of "white bourgeois" male colonizers.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} According to Lugones, colonial relations of power constructed through such binaries constitute the "colonial difference", a term with open-ended origins that Lugones attributes to Walter Mignolo's book ''Local Histories/Global Designs''.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|751}}

Logones has stated that colonial notions of [[femininity]] as inversions of [[masculinity]] did not grant human status, but rather established a [[gender dimorphism]] of [[hypersexuality]] and sexual passivity that rendered colonized "men" and "women" as non-human gendered entities.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Through the performance of colonial [[anthropocentrism]] and the disruption of Indigenous [[cosmologies]] of grounded normativity, extreme acts of sexualized violence could be justified towards gendered and dehumanized colonized subjects, as stated by Lugones.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Lugones writes that through murder and rape,&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} control of colonized bodies institutionalized the internalization of colonial systems. Religious indoctrination, with divisions between good and evil equating colonized females with Satan, arguably established not only a colonization of bodies, but of memory.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}} Systematic replications of these ideologies, according to Lugones, facilitated the erasure of Indigenous cosmologies of reciprocal relations to place, psychologically clearing the way for the re-appropriation of land toward the implementation of capitalist projects.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}}

Within Lugones' analysis of Mignolo's usage of the colonial difference is her assertion that the colonial difference (and the coloniality of gender) is "not an affair of the past";&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752}} as such, as a contemporary phenomenon, Lugones argues that seeking parity with the colonizer by erasing colonial difference does not eliminate oppression.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752–753}} [[Rey Chow]] terms the act of seeking parity with the colonizer as "the ascendancy of whiteness",&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"&gt;Arvin, Maile; Tuck, Eve; and Morrill, Angie. Decolonizing Feminism: Challenging Connections between Settler Colonialism and [[Heteropatriarchy]]. Feminist Formations, vol. 25 No. 1 (Spring 2013). pp. 8-34. Print. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; which Arvin, Tuck and Morrill further elaborate as taking part in the colonial "settling process" to dispossess "'other-ed' peoples globally".&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt; Instead, Lugones proposes a "feminist border thinking" that positions learning from subalternity at the colonial difference as central to a decolonial feminism.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|753}} This concept embraces movements toward coalitional social relations between feminists of color, which Lugones describes as "the oppositional consciousness of a social erotics."&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|755}}

In this context, according to Arvin, Tuck, and Morrill, "Indigenous communities' concerns are often not about achieving formal equality or civil rights within a nation-state, but instead achieving substantial independence from a Western nation-state—independence decided on their own terms."&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt;

== Colonialism of gender in Canada ==
Some researchers believe that contact with patriarchal, European colonial contact reduced the value of Indigenous women in Canadian society.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Cindy|last2=Regina|first2=University of|date=2016|title=Gender, Justice, and the Indian Residential School Claims Process|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/iipj/vol7/iss1/3/|journal=International Indigenous Policy Journal|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.18584/iipj.2016.7.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, colonialism greatly shifted the role of women in Indigenous communities through patriarchal laws and regulations placed on marriage and other sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men, to whom the Indigenous people were viewed as inferior.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trafficking of Aboriginal Women and Girls|last=Boyer|first=Yvonne|last2=Kampouris, Peggy|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1-100-23756-5|location=Canada|pages=5–7 &amp; 31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal impositions on sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men resulted in such relations to have underlying monetary agendas, a commodification of women that caused many Indigenous women to involve themselves in prostitution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this Indigenous people as a whole were encouraged to adopt what  European Canadians and the Canadian government considered to be "[[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]]", eschewing their native culture and traditions in favor of assimilation.&lt;ref name="RoyalCom-sg3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|title=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Stage Three: Displacement and Assimilation|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada.|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071124124236/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|archive-date=November 24, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|title=Report-Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples-Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 6 of the ''Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples''|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]]|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071115053257/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|archive-date=November 15, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] in 1847 contributed to the [[systemic racism]], violence, and sexual mistreatment of Indigenous people, which led to the normalization and repeated occurrence of this abuse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cindy Hanson feels that this has contributed to a lingering sense of trauma among Indigenous women and girls that has caused them to become further victimized and [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], as well as impact how they interact with their families and communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The issue of [[Missing and murdered Indigenous women|Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls]] has been cited by researchers such as Robyn Bourgeois as an example of how colonial exploitation has led to systemic racism, causing Indigenous women to be stereotyped or discriminated against as dirty, sexually indiscriminate bodies that can be violated and thrown away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourgeois|first=Robyn|date=2015|title=Colonial exploitation: The Canadian state and the trafficking of Indigenous women and girls in Canada.|url=|journal=UCLA Law Review|volume=62 |issue=6|pages=1426–1463|via=Hein Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination towards Indigenous ==
The impact of colonialism of gender is evidently seen in Canada with Indigenous women as they often migrate to urban areas due to a lack of education and opportunities in general. While there is a lack of survey regarding the migration of indigenous people from rural to urban the 1991 Aboriginal People's Survey suggests that  61% of Aboriginal people have moved at some point in their life indicating their strong desire to seek out better career and livelihood.&lt;ref name="Trovato"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-people-demography/|title=Demography of Indigenous People|last=Trovato|first=Frank|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 and 1980, the ''Indian Act'' created by Canadian government dictating Indigenous women as the act controlled their status, land, resources...etc. This act made it so if an indigenous women marries an individual without the same status, the women will lose their status.&lt;ref name="Trovato"/&gt; Since making this act obsolete. the number of registered Indians doubled as many were reinstated. This is seen in 1985 there were approximately 360,000 registered and 778.000 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/native-womens-issues/|title=Indigenous Women's Issues|last=McNab|first=Miriam|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indigenous women are seen to be most affected by Colonialism of Gender as there are many missing reports or homicides among Aboriginal females. A study shows that between 1980 and 2012, a total of 1,017 Aboriginal female were homicide victims and 164 women currently missing with additional 225  unsolved cases. As of November 4, 2013, 11.3% (1,455 total) female were considered missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/missing-and-murdered-aboriginal-women-national-operational-overview#sec3|title=Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational Overview {{!}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police|last=Police|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-colonial Indigenous idea of gender ==
Not only has the idea of gender and sexuality changed due to colonialism, but power distribution and family structure as well. In the pre-colonial times, Indigenous families were not organized through an authoritative figure but rather it was more communal. Some pre-colonial Indigenous communities were matrilineal and gave women very powerful roles within the society.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}}

This drastically changed once they became colonized, European values and structures were enforced onto this community thus covering their pre-existing idea of gender and family. European societies were placed power onto the men and families were patrilinal rather than matrilineal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/patrilineal-vs-matrilineal-succession-3529192|title=Patrilineal vs. Matrilineal Succession|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In colonized societies, men often are the head of the family which allows them to make important decisions while the women are often seen more submissive and plays a supportive role for the men. This contrasted with the Indigenous way of life as Cree women were believed to be the center of life and Iroquois women were given spiritual roles and control over food for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Darcy|date=2009-04-01|title=Colonialism, Gender and the Family in North America: For a Gendered Analysis of Indigenous Struggles|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01029.x/abstract|journal=Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=70–88|doi=10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01029.x|issn=1754-9469}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German philosopher Immanuel Kant comments on the different gender power the Indigenous communities has compared to those who are colonized, as he says "'Among all savages there are none by whom the feminine sex is held in greater actual regard than by those of Canada. They assemble and deliberate upon the most important regulations of the nation'".(Kant, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=z9w4CKjHXlgC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=kant+%E2%80%99Among+all+savages+there+are+none+by+whom+the+feminine+sex+is+held+in+greater+actual+regard+than+by+those+of+Canada.+They+assemble+and+deliberate+upon+the+most+important+regulations+of+the+nation%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R-eqz_8RX-&amp;sig=bgbeGmQW-g32l3B6t_6E5xpwSxw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMhZT47OHXAhVDw4MKHXGpDnEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kant%20%E2%80%99Among%20all%20savages%20there%20are%20none%20by%20whom%20the%20feminine%20sex%20is%20held%20in%20greater%20actual%20regard%20than%20by%20those%20of%20Canada.%20They%20assemble%20and%20deliberate&amp;f=false|title=Defamiliarizing the Aboriginal: Cultural Practices and Decolonization in Canada|last=Emberley|first=Julia|date=2007|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802091512|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colonialism of Gender in Asian ==
===Indonesia===

==== Westernised roles of women ====
Prior to the 1945 independence, the role of women only revolved around the household. To be a good woman is to be a good wife that provide support for the family. It was not until 1941 that women were allowed access to education as it would increase the possibility for Indonesia to gain independence. After the independence in 1945, the role of women in society has expanded beyond the domestic sphere and the National Women’s Congress keep in touch with women’s organizations abroad. For example, the government allowed women to be involved in activities such as police work training and other national defense related institutions, which would be considered out of the ordinary before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=WOMEN IN INDONESIA: Gender, Equity and Development.|last=Robinson &amp; Bessell|first=|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2002|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Women’s role in the public sphere ====

===== Employment =====
According to the 2014 World Development Indicators, labour participation rate of Indonesian women from the age of fifteen is 51.4%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is considered low by international standards. Although the gender pay gap is 5.3 %, Indonesian women are relatively paid more than men. It is because gender pay gap also included underemployment rate. For instance, the number of women working in higher position are lacking compared to male.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Megawati Soekarnopoetri, the daughter of the first president of Republic of Indonesia, was elected as the first female ruler of the country in 2001 after her predecessor was impeached. She served as president until 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muslim women of power gender, politics, and culture in Islam|last=Bennett|first=C|publisher=Continuun|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Currently, Indonesia has eight female ministers that are in office&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2018/03/19/055916784/President-Jokowi-Takes-Pride-in-His-Female-Ministers|title=President Jokowi Takes Pride in His Female Ministers|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which seven of them has received international recognition such as Best Minister in the World Award at the World Government Summit 2018 that was given to Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idntimes.com/life/women/ismet-maulana/7-menteri-wanita-di-era-jokowi-yang-terima-penghargaan-internasional-c1c2/full|title=7 Menteri Wanita di Era Jokowi yang Terima Penghargaan Internasional|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== Education =====
According to the data collected by the World Economic Forum in 2013, women in Indonesia has equal or nearly equal education participation rate to men. The female-to-male ratio in secondary education is one, meaning that the number enrolled is equal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2013/#section=list-of-countries&amp;ol=info|title=The Global Gender Report 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A figure that started the fight for women’s right to education is Kartini. During the colonial period, she opened up the first school for native girls in Indonesia with the help of her sisters. At that time, girls do not have the opportunity to get education. Her legacy continued with the founding of Kartini School in Batavia, three years after she passed away&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letters of a Javanese princess|last=Kartini and Symmers|first=Raden Ajeng and A.L.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== Economy =====
Women’s participation in entrepreneurship is still low, with ‘only 23% of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises are owned by women’. Although 45% of manufacturing business owners are women, they mostly relied on unpaid female workers while businesses owned by male have more paid workers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Women’s role in the private sphere ====

===== Community =====
There are many women’s organizations in Indonesia that are based on various interest of its members. One of the well-known organizations is Dharma Wanita Persatuan (DWP), composed of the wives of government employees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.liputan6.com/regional/read/3392512/kegiatan-dharma-wanita-jangan-hanya-lomba-masak-dan-kecantikan|title=Kegiatan Dharma Wanita Jangan Hanya Lomba Masak dan Kecantikan.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The younger generation are more focused on gender equality, preventing sexual assault and empowerment. A few organisations include National Commission on Violence Against Women, Hollaback! Jakarta, Community Legal Aid Institute. The organisations mentioned, along with several others, participate in the ‘Women’s March’ in 2018, a rally to voice out their opinion regarding gender-based violence in Indonesia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jakartaglobe.id/features/women-behind-womens-march-jakarta/|title=The Women Behind Women’s March Jakarta|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Women’s role in the public sphere ====

===== Politics =====
Despite women contribution in the developing of Lao, the gender data on health education and political show that women still absence to political power and basis services. However, Lao women still related to national level through the Lao Women Union (LWU)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk/sites/bridge.ids.ac.uk/files/reports/re9c.pdf|title=Women and Development in Laos|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only female minister is the president of the LWU.

===== Education =====
Education status of women in Laos has improve significantly since 1975, the percentage of female students in school increase from 37,6% to 45,3% in 1980. In regards of salary, educated women tend to face inequalities5. However, the overall average education level of Lao women still lower than men. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk/sites/bridge.ids.ac.uk/files/reports/re9c.pdf|title=Women and Development in Laos|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s role in the private sphere ====

===== Community =====
Women and men are equal in regards of legal right. Many families take part in agriculture, farming. Also, work is divide by gender role, women are often take care of their child, cooking maintaining the household and household finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/lao-culture/family-edd122c0-5b12-4cd9-8e34-22029325a9aa|title=Lao culture|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;women who live in urbanised area work in companies and civil service position. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/lao-culture/family-edd122c0-5b12-4cd9-8e34-22029325a9aa|title=Lao culture|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men mostly is the head of family and decision maker.

===== Conclusion =====
The gender inequality and gender issues tend to conflict with urban areas and rural areas, but overall women are still mainly seen as a home maker or care taker. However, they are still opportunities for women to hold positions in many industries and work area. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edmund Hodgson|first=Yates|date=1865|title=French Cochin China.|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/docview/6506789?rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo|journal=Temple bar : a London magazine for town and country readers, Dec. 1860-Dec. 1881; London|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===

==== Westernised Roles of Women ====
Under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, China is a male-dominated society while women had a relatively subordinate familial role which they were assumed to be taking care of housework and children. While for Hong Kong, due to the emergence of western culture during the british colonial period, westernization leads to a mix of traditional chinese thoughts and western culture and a significant different women roles in Hong Kong were found. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Sangwha|date=1999|title=The Patriarchy in China: An Investigation of Public and Private Spheres.|url=|journal=Asian Journal of Women's Studies|volume=5(1)|pages=9-49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

===== Employment =====
The labour force participation rate for women increased gradually from 48.7% in 2004 to 50.7% in 2014. On the other hand, the labour force participation rate of men decreased from 71.6% in 2004 to 68.7% in 2014. 2 In 2017, there are 45.8% female and 54.2% males recorded in the employment rate, this indicated the equal and fair workplaces between male and female. There are different rights for the employed women including maternity protection and sick leave, however, there are different difficulties women facing for example some companies required a male supervisor instead of a female one.

===== Economy =====
According to the Women and Men Hong Kong Key Statistics 2018 Edition, there is 331 thousand female employed person, excluding foreign domestic helper, earned more than 30,000per month. 542.4 thousand male employed person earned more than 30,000 per month. contribution towards economic development by women is relatively lower than male these days. Although more Hong Kong women than men are attaining tertiary education, but are earning less than men across all professions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.women.gov.hk/download/research/HK_Women2015_e.pdf|title=Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
According to data collected in the Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015, the ratio of male and female in the Executive council is 23:6. Although the number of women who participated in the executive council is low, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (CE) 2017 is known as Carrie Lam who is the first female CE in the history. This allocated the rise of women participation in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youth.gov.hk/en/info-centre/education/education-policy.htm|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Education =====
In the past, under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, for those family who are not affordable to send all children to school, they are prioritising their son to attend school. However, after the british control, people realise the education system should have changed and discovered the importance of being educated. The education opportunities in Hong Kong are comparatively fair since the Hong Kong government is providing a 12-year free education including 6 years primary school and 6 year secondary school education. Parents are compulsory to send their children to school or stay-home study for special needs, thus all teenagers in Hong Kong can be well-educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkfw.org/chi/index.php|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
For both gender in Hong Kong, they are getting married later in their life since women are getting more independent and bare a higher responsibility in their work forces. Traditional marriage values are less important and women are less relying on men in nowadays society. People agreed that the household income should be contributed from both husband and wife, thus, women are getting their own job as well instead of being a housewife only.

===== Community =====
There are several common communities protecting Hong Kong women’s rights. The Hong Kong Federation of women founded by 11 prominent ladies was established on 28 June 1993.  Members of the federation came from various levels, occupations, races, and districts in Hong Kong. Amongst members are business women, professionals, workers and housewives as well as those who are fervent in women development and advancement.Their goal is to unite women from all walks of life, to encourage them taking an active interest in Hong Kong affairs, to improve and protect the lawful rights of women and to liaise with women organizations all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.japanpowered.com/japan-culture/gender-roles-women-modern-japan|title=Gender Roles of Women in Modern Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Japan===

==== Westernised Roles of Women ====
Through modernisation and western influence, women status and role are changed. In the past, women were very much seen as second class citizens. They had no rights or possessions and were subservient to their husbands. Women are expected to marry, produce heirs, and take care of the household. Marriage was often arranged and it is a contract between families. However, after western influence, women are making strides toward equality in Japan. Equality benefits men as much as it does women for example becoming more acceptable to want a career. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/643486/japan-female-employment-rate/|title=Female employment rate in Japan from 2007 to 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

==== Employment ====
The government takes credit for adding about 1m women to the workforce since 2012. At 66%, the female participation rate is now among the highest in the world. That is largely the result, say critics, of Japan’s drum-tight labour market rather than of innovative policies. Mindful that most of these jobs are far down the corporate totem pole, the government has also revived a decade-old target of having women occupy 30% of “leadership positions” by 2020. But it admits that this goal is nowhere near being met. In 2016, the female employment rate reach 48.9%, being one of the leading countries regarding economic key factors, showing a very low unemployment rate compared to other major industrial and emerging countries. In order to encourage women get their job, there is in-house babysitting service for the employee essential for helping working mothers make an easier transition back into the workforce. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fewjapan.com/|title=FEW: For Empowering Women in Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economy ====
Women participation in the labour force in the early development process indicates that they had a much larger role to play in the development process of Japan, which brought about such high economic growth in a short period of time. In the context of the broader debate over whether economic development expands or restricts women's economic opportunities and status, Japan  illustrates that the employment patterns of married women and the degree of gender equality is not similar to that of the industrialised west. The association between women's higher education attainment and labour market participation after marriage, which can be observed in the US and most other industrialised societies, is weak for Japan largely due to the cultural and institutional factors.  The export-oriented economic growth of Japan, which depended largely on the female reserve labour available at a low cost and used as a buffer to cyclical fluctuations, actually discouraged a large proportion of female workers from job seeking and they retired from the labour market.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Japanese women have been participants in a long history of social activism. But their participation in politics and political parties, is a more recent phenomenon. NGOs and other grassroots organisations have provided training, information and assisted with fund-raising to equip women to participate in the leadership positions in politics, especially at the local government levels. However, most political parties still continue to provide only limited leadership opportunities for women. Tokyo’s first female governor Koike Yuriko’s political background is in national politics. Before working the office of Tokyo governor, she was a member of the long-ruling government party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and had a seat in the national legislative assembly. She was influential in the preparation of policies to better utilise women’s labour largely as a strategy of improving the economy, so her commitment to “women’s empowerment” is unquestionable. She is interested in encouraging women to participate more in the workforce and take an active part in the capitalist economy.

===== Education =====
In the past, during the early stage of building modern education system, educational opportunities for girls were considerably disadvantaged. The attendance rate of girls were particularly low in the compulsory elementary school. Limited opportunities for girls to access secondary school was provided while higher education for women was not even supposed. Japanese government has developed policies and efforts for promoting education for girls and young females and encourage them to study with males. Conditions for women’s education have been gradually improved. As a result, in elementary education, gender gap in schooling was dissolved until the first decade of the 20th century. There is no gender gap in the opportunity for education in Japan recently, difference of enrollment ratios between male and female students in the upper secondary education and higher education levels is scarcely present. Enrollment of female students  in the secondary vocational schools had been increasing gradually.

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
In the past, the head of the household was responsible for finding a marriage partner for the family’s heir. Married women were expected to produce an heir. Traditionally, women are expected to submit to male authority in three ways. When young, she submits to her father; When married, she submits to her husband; When old, she submits to her sons. Motherhood is considered the defining characteristic of a woman. Besides, housework, child care, and elder care each day are daily household taken up by women at home
Thus, a lot of young Japanese women struggle to form their own sense of identity apart from this cultural expectation.

===== Community =====
There are differenet association founded in Japan. For Empowering Women (FEW), Founded in 1981 as an organization for “Foreign Executive Women”, has long been a stable source of support and learning for international women in both the Tokyo and Kansai areas. It is an exceptionally active and ever-growing Tokyo-based nonprofit business and social networking organization whose mission is to “enable internationally-minded women in Japan to achieve their full professional and personal potential.”  FEW organise exciting line-up of personal and professional development workshops and opportunities to support women’s empowerment annually.

The '''cosmological interpretation of quantum mechanics''', proposed by [[Anthony Aguirre]] and [[Max Tegmark]],&lt;ref&gt;"Born in an Infinite Universe: a Cosmological Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics", A. Aguirre and M. Tegmark (2010), ''Phys. Rev. D'' '''84''', 105002, {{arxiv|1008.1066}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]] that applies in the context of [[eternal inflation]], which arguably predicts an infinite three-dimensional space with infinitely many planets and infinitely many copies of any quantum system. According to this interpretation, the [[wavefunction]] for a quantum system describes not some imaginary ensemble of possibilities for what the system might be doing, but rather the actual spatial collection of identical copies of the system that exist in our infinite space. Its collapse can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;"Non-collapsing wave functions in an infinite universe", E. Moulay (2014), Results in Physics 4, {{doi|10.1016/j.rinp.2014.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the quantum uncertainty that you experience simply reflects your inability to self-locate in space, i.e., to know which of your infinitely many copies throughout space is the one having your subjective perceptions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The cosmological interpretation is based on the mathematical theorem that when the same quantum experiment is performed in infinitely many places at once, the result is a quantum superposition of indistinguishable states for all of space, and in each of these states, the fraction of all places where a given outcome occurs equals that given by the [[Born rule]]. In this sense, quantum probabilities emerge from classical probabilities.

Cosmologist [[Alexander Vilenkin]] has expressed support for this interpretation:
"I think this is an important advance. They showed that the mathematics really works out. It kind of clears up the foundations of quantum mechanics."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727753.600-infinite-doppelgangers-may-explain-quantum-probabilities.html "Infinite doppelgängers may explain quantum probabilities"], R. Courtland (2010), ''New Scientist'', 7, August 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37440">'''Description logics''' ('''DL''') are a family of formal [[knowledge representation]] languages. Many DLs are more expressive than [[propositional logic]] but less expressive than [[first-order logic]]. In contrast to the latter, the core reasoning problems for DLs are (usually) [[Decision problem|decidable]], and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems. There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy descriptions logics, and each description logic features a different balance between DL expressivity and [[Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning|reasoning]] [[Complexity_class|complexity]] by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DLs are used in [[artificial intelligence]] to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain (known as ''terminological knowledge''). It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] and the [[Semantic Web]]: the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) and its profile is based on DLs. The most notable application of DLs and OWL is in [[biomedical informatics]] where DL assists in the codification of biomedical knowledge.

==Introduction==
A description logic (DL) models ''concepts'', ''roles'' and ''individuals'', and their relationships.

The fundamental modeling concept of a DL is the ''axiom''—a logical statement relating roles and/or concepts.&lt;ref name="GHMPPS"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grau | first1 = B.

==Nomenclature==
===Terminology compared to FOL and OWL===
The description logic community uses different terminology than the [[first-order logic]] (FOL) community for operationally equivalent notions; some examples are given below. The [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) uses again a different terminology, also given in the table below.

===Naming convention===
There are many varieties of description logics and there is an informal naming convention, roughly describing the operators allowed. The [[Expressive power (computer science)|expressivity]] is encoded in the label for a logic starting with one of the following basic logics:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{AL}&lt;/math&gt; ||Attributive language. This is the base language which allows:
|-
| ||
* Atomic negation (negation of concept names that do not appear on the left-hand side of axioms)
* Concept intersection
* Universal restrictions
* Limited existential quantification
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FL}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Frame based description language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levesque | first1 = Hector J. | author1-link = Hector Levesque | last2 = Brachmann | first2 = Ronald J. | author2-link = Ronald Brachman | title = Expressiveness and tractability in knowledge representation and reasoning | journal = Computational Intelligence | year = 1987 | number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows:
|-
| ||
* Concept intersection
* Universal restrictions
* Limited existential quantification
* Role restriction
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{EL}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Existential language, allows:
|-

* Concept intersection
* Existential restrictions (of full existential quantification)
|}
Followed by any of the following extensions:
{|

|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Functional properties, a special case of [[uniqueness quantification]].
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Full existential qualification (existential restrictions that have fillers other than &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;).
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Concept union.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Complex concept negation.
|-
| ||

|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Role hierarchy (subproperties: &lt;code&gt;rdfs:subPropertyOf&lt;/code&gt;).
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Limited complex role inclusion axioms; reflexivity and irreflexivity; role disjointness.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Nominals. (Enumerated classes of object value restrictions: &lt;code&gt;owl:oneOf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;owl:hasValue&lt;/code&gt;).
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Inverse properties.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Cardinality restrictions (&lt;code&gt;owl:cardinality&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;owl:maxCardinality&lt;/code&gt;), a special case of [[counting quantification]]
|-
| ||

====Examples====
As an example, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; is a centrally important description logic from which comparisons with other varieties can be made. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; is simply &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{AL}&lt;/math&gt; with complement of any concept allowed, not just atomic concepts. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; is used instead of the equivalent &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALUE}&lt;/math&gt;.

A further example, the description logic &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHIQ}&lt;/math&gt; is the logic &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; plus  extended cardinality restrictions, and transitive and inverse roles. The naming conventions aren't purely systematic so that the logic &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALCOIN}&lt;/math&gt; might be referred to as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALCNIO}&lt;/math&gt; and abbreviations are made where possible,

The Protégé ontology editor supports &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHOIN}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;. Three major biomedical informatics terminology bases, [[SNOMED CT]], GALEN, and GO, are expressible in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{EL}&lt;/math&gt; (with additional role properties).

OWL 2 provides the expressiveness of  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SROIQ}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;, OWL-DL is based on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHOIN}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;, and for OWL-Lite it is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHIF}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==
Description logic was given its current name in the 1980s. Previous to this it was called (chronologically): ''terminological systems'', and ''concept languages''.

===Knowledge representation===
[[semantic frames|Frame]]s and [[semantic network]]s lack formal (logic-based) semantics.&lt;ref name="DLHB"&gt;Franz Baader, Ian Horrocks, and Ulrike Sattler ''Chapter 3 Description Logics''. In Frank van Harmelen, Vladimir Lifschitz, and Bruce Porter, editors, ''Handbook of Knowledge Representation''. Elsevier, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; DL was first introduced into [[knowledge representation]] (KR) systems to overcome this deficiency.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

The first DL-based KR system was [[KL-ONE]] (by [[Ronald J. Brachman]] and Schmolze, 1985). During the '80s other DL-based systems using ''structural subsumption algorithms''&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; were developed including KRYPTON (1983), [[LOOM (ontology)|LOOM]] (1987), BACK (1988), K-REP (1991) and CLASSIC (1991). This approach featured DL with limited expressiveness but relatively efficient (polynomial time) reasoning.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

In the early '90s, the introduction of a new ''tableau based algorithm'' paradigm allowed efficient reasoning on more expressive DL.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; DL-based systems using these algorithms - such as KRIS (1991) - show acceptable reasoning performance on typical inference problems even though the worst case complexity is no longer polynomial.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

From the mid '90s, reasoners were created with good practical performance on very expressive DL with high worst case complexity.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; Examples from this period include FaCT,&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Tsarkov | first1 = D. | last2 = Horrocks | first2 = I. | chapter = FaCT++ Description Logic Reasoner: System Description | doi = 10.1007/11814771_26 | url = http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ian.horrocks/Publications/download/2006/TsHo06a.pdf| title = Automated Reasoning | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 4130 | pages = 292–297 | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-3-540-37187-8 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RACER system|RACER]] (2001), CEL (2005), and [[KAON|KAON 2]] (2005).

==Modeling==
In DL, a distinction is drawn between the so-called [[Tbox|TBox]] (terminological box) and the [[Abox|ABox]] (assertional box). In general, the TBox contains sentences describing concept hierarchies (i.e., relations between [[concept]]s) while the ABox contains [[ground sentence]]s stating where in the hierarchy individuals belong (i.e., relations between individuals and concepts). For example, the statement:

{{NumBlk|:|Every employee is a person|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

belongs in the TBox, while the statement:

{{NumBlk|:|Bob is an employee|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

belongs in the ABox.

Note that the TBox/ABox distinction is not significant, in the same sense that the two "kinds" of sentences are not treated differently in first-order logic (which subsumes most DL). When translated into first-order logic, a subsumption [[axiom]] like ({{EquationNote|1}}) is simply a conditional restriction to [[unary operation|unary]] [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]s (concepts) with only variables appearing in it. Clearly, a sentence of this form is not privileged or special over sentences in which only constants ("grounded" values) appear like ({{EquationNote|2}}).

So why was the distinction introduced? The primary reason is that the separation can be useful when describing and formulating decision-procedures for various DL. For example, a reasoner might process the TBox and ABox separately, in part because certain key inference problems are tied to one but not the other one ('classification' is related to the TBox, 'instance checking' to the ABox). Another example is that the complexity of the TBox can greatly affect the performance of a given decision-procedure for a certain DL, independently of the ABox. Thus, it is useful to have a way to talk about that specific part of the [[knowledge base]].

The secondary reason is that the distinction can make sense from the knowledge base modeler's perspective. It is plausible to distinguish between our conception of terms/concepts in the world (class axioms in the TBox) and particular manifestations of those terms/concepts (instance assertions in the ABox). In the above example: when the hierarchy within a company is the same in every branch but the assignment to employees is different in every department (because there are other people working there), it makes sense to reuse the TBox for different branches that do not use the same ABox.

There are two features of description logic that are not shared by most other data description formalisms: DL does not make the [[Unique name assumption]] (UNA) or the [[Closed-world assumption]] (CWA). Not having UNA means that two concepts with different names may be allowed by some inference to be shown to be equivalent. Not having CWA, or rather having the [[Open world assumption]] (OWA) means that lack of knowledge of a fact does not immediately imply knowledge of the negation of a fact.

==Formal description==
Like [[first-order logic]] (FOL), a [[Syntax (logic)|syntax]] defines which collections of symbols are legal expressions in a description logic, and [[semantics]] determine meaning. Unlike FOL, a DL may have several well known syntactic variants.&lt;ref name="HS"/&gt;

===Syntax===
The syntax of a member of the description logic family is characterized by its recursive definition, in which the constructors that can be used to form concept terms are stated. Some constructors are related to logical constructors in [[first-order logic]] (FOL) such as ''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]'' or ''[[logical conjunction|conjunction]]'' of concepts, ''[[union (set theory)|union]]'' or ''[[disjunction]]'' of concepts, ''[[negation]]'' or ''[[complement (set theory)|complement]]'' of concepts, ''[[Universal quantifier|universal restriction]]'' and ''[[Existential quantifier|existential restriction]]''. Other constructors have no corresponding construction in FOL including restrictions on roles for example, inverse, [[transitive relation|transitivity]] and functionality.

====Notation====
Let C and D be concepts, a and b be individuals, and R be a role.

If a is R-related to b, then b is called an R-successor of a.

====The description logic ALC====
The prototypical DL ''Attributive Concept Language with Complements'' (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt;) was introduced by Manfred Schmidt-Schauß and Gert Smolka in 1991, and is the basis of many more expressive DLs.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;N_C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_O&lt;/math&gt;  be (respectively) [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of ''concept names'' (also known as ''atomic concepts''), ''role names'' and ''individual names'' (also known as ''individuals'', ''nominals'' or ''objects''). Then the ordered triple (&lt;math&gt;N_C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_O&lt;/math&gt;) is the ''signature''.

=====Concepts=====
The set of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; ''concepts'' is the smallest set such that:

* The following are ''concepts'':
** &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; (''top'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; (''bottom'' is a ''concept'')
** Every &lt;math&gt;A \in N_C&lt;/math&gt; (all ''atomic concepts'' are ''concepts'')
* If &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are ''concepts'' and &lt;math&gt;R \in N_R&lt;/math&gt; then the following are ''concepts'':
** &lt;math&gt;C\sqcap D&lt;/math&gt; (the intersection of two ''concepts'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;C\sqcup D&lt;/math&gt; (the union of two ''concepts'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\neg C&lt;/math&gt; (the complement of a ''concept'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\forall R.C&lt;/math&gt; (the universal restriction of a ''concept'' by a ''role'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\exists R.C&lt;/math&gt; (the existential restriction of a ''concept'' by a ''role'' is a ''concept'')

=====Terminological axioms=====
A ''general concept inclusion'' (GCI) has the form &lt;math&gt;C \sqsubseteq D&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are ''concepts''. Write &lt;math&gt;C \equiv D&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;C \sqsubseteq D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D \sqsubseteq C&lt;/math&gt;. A ''TBox'' is any finite set of GCIs.

=====Assertional axioms=====
{{Anchor|concept_assertion}}
* A ''concept assertion'' is a statement of the form &lt;math&gt;a : C&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;a \in N_O&lt;/math&gt; and C is a ''concept''.
* A ''role assertion'' is a statement of the form &lt;math&gt;(a,b) : R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a, b \in N_O&lt;/math&gt;  and R is a ''role''.

An ''ABox'' is a finite set of assertional axioms.

=====Knowledge base=====
A ''knowledge base'' (KB) is an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; for [[Tbox|TBox]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; and [[Abox|ABox]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Semantics===
The [[semantics]] of description logics are defined by interpreting concepts as sets of individuals and roles as sets of ordered pairs of individuals. Those individuals are typically assumed from a given domain. The semantics of non-atomic concepts and roles is then defined in terms of atomic concepts and roles. This is done by using a recursive definition similar to the syntax.

====The description logic ALC====
The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

A ''terminological interpretation'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}=(\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}, \cdot^{\mathcal{I}})&lt;/math&gt; over a ''signature'' &lt;math&gt;(N_C,N_R,N_O)&lt;/math&gt; consists of
* a non-empty set &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; called the [[domain of discourse|''domain'']]
* a ''interpretation function'' &lt;math&gt;\cdot^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; that maps:
** every ''individual'' &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to an element &lt;math&gt;a^{\mathcal{I}} \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
** every ''concept'' to a subset of &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
** every ''role name'' to a subset of &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}  \times \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
such that
* &lt;math&gt;\top^{\mathcal{I}} = \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\bot^{\mathcal{I}} = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(C \sqcup D)^{\mathcal{I}} = C^{\mathcal{I}} \cup D^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; ''([[union (set theory)|union]] means [[disjunction]])''
* &lt;math&gt;(C \sqcap D)^{\mathcal{I}} = C^{\mathcal{I}} \cap D^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; ''([[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] means [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]])''
* &lt;math&gt;(\neg C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} \setminus C^{\mathcal{I}} &lt;/math&gt; ''([[complement (set theory)|complement]] means [[negation]])''
* &lt;math&gt;(\forall R.C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \{x \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} | \text{for} \; \text{every} \; y, (x,y) \in R^{\mathcal{I}} \;  \text{implies} \; y \in C^{\mathcal{I}} \} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(\exists R.C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \{x \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} | \text{there} \; \text{exists} \; y, (x,y) \in R^{\mathcal{I}} \; \text{and} \; y \in C^{\mathcal{I}}\} &lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models&lt;/math&gt; (read ''in I holds'') as follows

=====TBox=====
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models C \sqsubseteq D&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;C^{\mathcal{I}} \subseteq D^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \Phi&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\Phi \in \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;

=====ABox=====
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models a : C&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a^{\mathcal{I}} \in C^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models (a,b) : R&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;(a^{\mathcal{I}},b^{\mathcal{I}}) \in R^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\phi \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;

=====Knowledge base=====
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K} = (\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; be a knowledge base.

* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;

==Inference==
===Decision problems===
In addition to the ability to describe concepts formally, one also would like to employ the description of a set of concepts to ask questions about the concepts and instances described. The most common decision problems are basic database-query-like questions like ''instance checking'' (is a particular instance (member of an A-box) a member of a given concept) and ''relation checking'' (does a relation/role hold between two instances, in other words does '''a''' have property '''b'''), and the more global-database-questions like ''subsumption'' (is a concept a subset of another concept), and ''concept consistency'' (is there no contradiction among the definitions or chain of definitions). The more operators one includes in a logic and the more complicated the T-box (having cycles, allowing non-atomic concepts to include each other), usually the higher the computational complexity is for each of these problems (see [http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ezolin/dl/ Description Logic Complexity Navigator] for examples).

==Relationship with other logics==
===First-order logic===
Many DLs are [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] [[fragment (logic)|fragments]] of [[first-order logic]] (FOL)&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; and are usually fragments of [[two-variable logic]] or [[guarded logic]]. In addition, some DLs have features that are not covered in FOL; this includes ''concrete domains'' (such as integer or strings, which can be used as ranges for roles such as ''hasAge'' or ''hasName'') or an operator on roles for the transitive closure of that role.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

===Fuzzy description logic===
Fuzzy description logics combines [[fuzzy logic]] with DLs. Since many concepts that are needed for [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent systems]] lack well defined boundaries, or precisely defined criteria of membership, fuzzy logic is needed to deal with notions of vagueness and imprecision. This offers a motivation for a generalization of description logic towards dealing with imprecise and vague concepts.

===Modal logic===
Description logic is related to—but developed independently of—[[modal logic]] (ML).&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; Many—but not all—DL are syntactic variants of ML.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

In general, an object corresponds to a [[Kripke semantics|possible world]], a concept corresponds to a modal proposition, and a role-bounded quantifier to a modal operator with that role as its accessibility relation.

Operations on roles (such as composition, inversion, etc.) correspond to the modal operations used in [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]].&lt;ref name=CTTL&gt;{{cite web|last=Schild|first=Klaus|title=Correspondence theory for terminological logics: Preliminary Report|url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ezolin/dl/bib/Correspondence_theory_for_terminological_logics_%28IJCAI_1991%29.pdf|work=KIT Report 91|publisher=KIT-BACK|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CTTL"/&gt;

===Temporal description logic===
Temporal description logic represents—and allows reasoning about—time dependent concepts and many different approaches to this problem exist.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Artale and Enrico Franconi "Temporal Description Logics". In "Handbook of Temporal Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence", 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a description logic might be combined with a [[modal logic|modal]] [[temporal logic]] such as [[linear temporal logic]].

The '''Franz–Keldysh effect''' is a change in [[optical absorption]] by a [[semiconductor]] when an [[electric field]] is applied.  The effect is named after the German physicist [[Walter Franz]] and Russian physicist [[Leonid Keldysh]] (nephew of [[Mstislav Keldysh]]).

Karl W. Böer observed first the shift of the optical [[absorption edge]] with electric fields &lt;ref&gt;K. W. Böer, H. J. Hänsch, and U. Kümmel, Naturwiss. 19, 460 (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; during the discovery of high-field domains&lt;ref&gt;Karl W. Böer Monatsber. Deutsch.Akad. d.Wissensch. 1,272 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; and named this the Franz-effect.&lt;ref&gt;Karl W. Böer Z. für Physik, 155,184 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, when the English translation of the Keldysh paper became available, he corrected this to the Franz–Keldysh effect.&lt;ref&gt;Karl W. Böer H.J. Hänsch and U. Kümmel Zeitschr. für Physik 155, 170 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

As originally conceived, the Franz–Keldysh effect is the result of [[wavefunction]]s "leaking" into the band gap. When an electric field is applied, the [[electron]] and [[electron hole|hole]] wavefunctions become [[Airy function]]s rather than plane waves. The Airy function includes a "tail" which extends into the classically forbidden band gap. According to [[Fermi's Golden Rule]], the more overlap there is between the wavefunctions of a free electron and a hole, the stronger the optical absorption will be. The Airy tails slightly overlap even if the electron and hole are at slightly different potentials (slightly different physical locations along the field). The absorption spectrum now includes a tail at energies below the band gap and some oscillations above it. This explanation does, however, omit the effects of [[exciton]]s, which may dominate optical properties near the band gap.

The Franz–Keldysh effect occurs in uniform, bulk semiconductors, unlike the [[quantum-confined Stark effect]], which requires a quantum well. Both are used for [[Electro-absorption modulator]]s. The Franz–Keldysh effect usually requires hundreds of [[volt]]s, limiting its usefulness with conventional electronics – although this is not the case for commercially available Franz–Keldysh-effect electro-absorption modulators that use a waveguide geometry to guide the optical carrier.

== Effect on modulation spectroscopy ==
The [[absorption coefficient]] is related to the [[dielectric constant]] (especially the complex term). From Maxwell's equation, we can easily find out the relation,

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{2\omega k_0} {c}={{\omega\kappa_2} \over{n_0c}}.&lt;/math&gt;

We will consider the direct transition of an electron from the valence band to the [[conduction band]] induced by the [[Ray (optics)|incident light]] in a [[perfect crystal]] and try to take into account of the change of absorption coefficient for each Hamiltonian with a probable interaction like electron-photon, electron-hole, external field. These approach follows from.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;C. Hamaguchi, "Basic Semiconductor Physics", Springer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; We put the 1st purpose on the theoretical background of Franz–Keldysh effect and third-derivative modulation spectroscopy.

===One electron Hamiltonian with EM (electro magnetic) field===
&lt;math&gt;H = {1 \over 2m} (p+eA)^2 + V(r)&lt;/math&gt; (A: [[vector potential]], V(r): periodic potential)

&lt;math&gt;A = {1 \over 2} A_0 e [e^{i(k_p \cdot r - \omega t)}+e^{-i(k_p \cdot r - \omega t)}]&lt;/math&gt;
(k&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and e are the wave vector of em field and [[unit vector]].)

Neglecting the square term &lt;math&gt;A^2&lt;/math&gt; and using the relation &lt;math&gt;A\cdot p  = p \cdot A&lt;/math&gt; within the Coulomb gauge &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot A=0&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

&lt;math&gt;H \sim {p^2 \over 2m} + V(r) + {e \over m} A \cdot p&lt;/math&gt;

Then using the [[Bloch wave|Bloch function]] &lt;math&gt;|jk\rangle = e^{ik \cdot r} u_{jk}(r)&lt;/math&gt; (j= v, c that mean valence band, conduction band)

the transition probability can be obtained such that

&lt;math&gt;w_{cv} = {2 \pi \over \hbar} |\langle ck'| {e \over m} A \cdot p |vk\rangle|^2\delta[\Epsilon _c (k') - \Epsilon _v (k) - \hbar \omega]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;= {\pi e^2 \over 2 \hbar m^2}A_0 ^2 |\langle ck'|exp(ik_p \cdot r)e \cdot p |vk\rangle |^2 \delta[\Epsilon _c (k') - \Epsilon _v (k) - \hbar \omega]&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;k_p&lt;/math&gt; means [[wave vector]] of light)
&lt;math&gt;e \cdot p_{cv} = {1 \over V} \int_v e^{i(k_p +k-k') \cdot r} {u^*}_{ck'}(r)e \cdot (p+ \hbar k)u_{vk} (r) d^3r&lt;/math&gt;

Power dissipation of the [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] per unit time and unit volume gives rise to following equation

&lt;math&gt;\hbar \omega w_{cv} = {1 \over 2} \omega \kappa_2 \epsilon_0 {E_0}^2&lt;/math&gt;

From the relation between the [[electric field]] and the vector potential, &lt;math&gt;{E} = -{{\partial A} \over {\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;, we may put &lt;math&gt;E_0 = \omega A_0&lt;/math&gt;

And finally we can get the imaginary part of the dielectric constant and surely the absorption coefficient.
&lt;math&gt;\kappa = {{\pi e^2} \over {\epsilon_0 m^2 \omega^2}}\sum_{k,k'} |e \cdot p_{cv}|^2 \delta[\Epsilon _c (k') - \Epsilon _v (k) - \hbar \omega]\delta_{kk'} &lt;/math&gt;

===2-body(electron-hole) Hamiltonian with EM field===
An electron in the [[valence band]](wave vector k) is excited by photon absorption into the conduction band(the wave vector at the band is &lt;math&gt;k'=k_e&lt;/math&gt;) and leaves a hole in the valence band(the wave vector of the hole is &lt;math&gt;k_h=-k&lt;/math&gt;). In this case, we include the electron-hole interaction.(&lt;math&gt;V(r_e -r_h)&lt;/math&gt;)

Thinking about the direct transition, &lt;math&gt;|k_e|, |k_h|&lt;/math&gt; is almost same. But Assume the slight difference of the momentum due to the photon absorption is not ignored and the bound state- electron-hole pair is very weak and the [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] approximation is valid for the treatment. Then we can make up the following procedure, the wave function and wave vectors of the electron and hole

&lt;math&gt; \Psi_{ij} (r_e, r_h) = \psi_{ik_e}(r_e) \psi_{jk_h} (r_h)&lt;/math&gt; (i, j are the band indices, and r&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; are the coordinates and wave vectors of the electron and hole respectively)

And we can take a total wave vector '''K''' such that

&lt;math&gt;K = k_e + k_h.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;H=H_e + H_h +V(r_e -r_h)&lt;/math&gt;

Then, Bloch functions of the electron and hole can be constructed with the phase term &lt;math&gt;A^{n,K}_{cv}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{n,K}(r_e,r_h) = \sum_{c,k_e,v,k_h}A^{n,K}_{cv}(k_e,k_h) \psi_{ck_e}(r_e) \psi_{vk_h} (r_h)&lt;/math&gt;

If V slowly over the distance of the integral, the term can be treated like following.

&lt;math&gt;[\Epsilon_c(k_e) + \Epsilon_h(k_h)+V(r_e-r_h)-\epsilon]A^{n,K}_{c,V}(k_e,k_h) =0(*)&lt;/math&gt;

here we assume that the conduction and valence bands are parabolic with scalar masses and that at the top of the valence band &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon_v =0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.
&lt;math&gt;\Epsilon_c(k_e) = {{\hbar^2k_e^2} \over {2m_e}}+\Epsilon_G, \Epsilon_h(k_h)={{\hbar^2k_h^2} \over {2m_h}}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\Epsilon_G&lt;/math&gt; is the energy gap)

Now, The [[Fourier transform]] of &lt;math&gt;A^{n,K}_{cv}(k_e,k_h)&lt;/math&gt; and above (*), the effective mass equation for the exciton may be written as

&lt;math&gt;[(-{\hbar^2 \over 2M}\nabla^2)+(-{\hbar^2 \over 2\mu} \nabla^2-{e^2 \over 4\pi\epsilon r})]\Phi^{n,k}(r,R) = [\Epsilon-\Epsilon_G] \cdot \Phi^{n,K}(r,R)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r=r_e-r_h, R={{m_e r_e + m_h r_h}\over {m_e+m_h}}, {1 \over \mu} = {1\over m_e}+{1 \over m_h}, M= m_e + m_h &lt;/math&gt;

then the solution of eq is given by

&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{n,K} (r,R) = \Psi_K(R)\psi_n(r)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{n,K} (r,R) = {1 \over \sqrt {V}}exp(iK \cdot R) \phi_n(r)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\phi_n(r)&lt;/math&gt; is called the envelope function of an exciton. The ground state of the exciton is given in analogy to the [[hydrogen atom]].

then, the [[dielectric function]] is

&lt;math&gt;\kappa_2(\omega) = {\pi e^2 \over{\epsilon_0 m^2 \omega^2}} |e \cdot p_{cv}|^2\sum_{\lambda} |\phi_\lambda(0)|^2 \delta(\Epsilon_G + \Epsilon_\lambda - \hbar\omega)(**) &lt;/math&gt;

detailed calculation is in.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Franz–Keldysh effect means an electron in a valence band can be allowed to be excited into a conduction band by absorbing a photon with its energy below the band gap. Now we're thinking about the effective mass equation for the [[Kinematics|relative motion]] of [[electron hole]] pair when the external field is applied to a crystal. But we are not to take a mutual potential of electron-hole pair into the Hamiltonian.

When the Coulomb interaction is neglected, the effective mass equation is

&lt;math&gt;[-{\hbar^2 \over 2\mu} \nabla^2 - eE \cdot r ] \psi(r) = \epsilon \psi(r)&lt;/math&gt;.

And the equation can be expressed,

&lt;math&gt;[-{\hbar^2 \over 2\mu}{d^2 \over {dr_i^2}}-eE_ir_i-\epsilon_i]\psi(r_i) = 0&lt;/math&gt;( where &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the value in the direction of the principal axis of the reduced effective mass tensor)

Using change of variables:

&lt;math&gt;\hbar\theta_i = ({{e^2E_i^2\hbar^2} \over {2\mu_i}})^{1/3}, \xi_i={{\epsilon_i+eE_ir_i}\over{\hbar\theta_i}} &lt;/math&gt;

then the solution is

&lt;math&gt;\psi(\xi_x,\xi_y,\xi_z)=C_x C_y C_z Ai(-\xi_x)Ai(-\xi_y)Ai(-\xi_z)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_i = {{\sqrt{e|E_i|}}\over{\hbar\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, &lt;math&gt;E_y=E_z=0, E_x&lt;/math&gt; the solution is given by

&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,y,z)=C \cdot Ai({{-eEx-\epsilon+\hbar^2k_y^2/2\mu_y + \hbar^2k_z^2/2\mu_z} \over {\hbar\theta_x}})&lt;/math&gt;

The dielectric constant can be obtained inserting this equation to the (**) (above block), and changing the summation with respect to λ to &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}d\epsilon_xd\epsilon_yd\epsilon_z&lt;/math&gt;

The integral with respect to &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_x d\epsilon_y&lt;/math&gt; is given by the joint [[density of states]] for the two-D band. (the Joint density of states is nothing but the meaning of DOS of both electron and hole at the same time.)

&lt;math&gt;{\kappa(\omega, E)} = {{\pi^2} \over{\epsilon_0 m^2 \omega^2}}|e \cdot p_cv|^2 {{e|E_x|} \over {\hbar\theta_x^2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{J^{2D}}_{cv}(\hbar\omega - \epsilon_G - \epsilon_x) \cdot|Ai(-{{\epsilon_x} \over {\hbar\theta}})^2 |d\epsilon_x.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J^{2D}_{cv}(\hbar\omega) = {(\mu_y\mu_z)^{1/2} \over \pi\hbar^2}, \hbar\omega &gt; \epsilon_G. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=0, \hbar\omega &lt; \epsilon_G.&lt;/math&gt;

Then we put &lt;math&gt;\eta = {{\hbar\omega - \epsilon_G} \over {\hbar\theta_x}}&lt;/math&gt;

And think about the case we find &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;&lt;0 &lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;\hbar\omega &lt;&lt; \epsilon_G&lt;/math&gt; with the asymptotic solution for the [[Airy function]] in this limit.

Finally,&lt;math&gt;\kappa _2(\omega, E_x) = {1/2}\kappa_2(\omega)exp[{-4 \over 3}({{\epsilon_G-\hbar\omega} \over {\hbar\theta_x}})]&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the dielectric function for the [[Photon|incident photon]] energy below the band gap exist! These results indicate that absorption occurs for an incident photon.

[[File:Punnett Square Genetic Carriers.PNG|thumb|Punnett square depicting a cross between two genetic carriers. The chance of two genetic carriers having a child with two copies of the recessive gene, thus being homozygous recessive, is 25%.]]
A '''hereditary carrier''' (or just '''carrier'''), is a person or other organism that has [[Genetics|inherited]] a recessive allele for a genetic trait or mutation but usually does not display that trait or show symptoms of the [[Genetic disease|disease]]. Carriers are, however, able to [[Heredity|pass]] the [[allele]] onto their offspring, who may then express the genetic if they inherit the recessive allele from both parents. The chance of two carriers having a child with the disease is 25%. This phenomenon is a direct result of the [[Dominance relationship#Recessive allele|recessive]] nature of many genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krasnewich|first1=D.|title=Carrier|url=https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=23|website=Talking Glossary of Genetic Terms|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==X-linked genes==
[[Queen Victoria]], and her daughters Princesses Alice and Beatrix, were carriers of the [[Sex linkage|X-linked]] [[hemophilia]] gene (an abnormal allele of a gene, necessary to produce one of the blood clotting factors). Both had children who continued to pass on the gene to succeeding generations of the royal houses of [[Spain]] and [[Russia]], into which they married.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, W.T.W. "Royal Haemophilia." Journal of Biological Education (Society of Biology) 30.3 (1996): 207. Academic Search Premier. 16 Sept. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Since males only have one X chromosome, males who carried the altered gene had hemophilia B Females have two X chromosomes, so one copy of an [[X-linked recessive]] gene would cause them to be an asymptomatic carrier. These females simply passed it to half of their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pagon|first1=R. A.|last2=Adam|first2=M. P.|last3=Ardinger|first3=H.

==Cystic fibrosis==
Up to 1 in 25 individuals of Northern European ancestry may be considered carriers of mutations ([[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR genes]]) that can lead to [[cystic fibrosis]]. The disease appears only when two of these carriers have children, as each pregnancy between them will have a 25% chance of producing a child with the disease. However, it is also thought that carriers of CF may be more resistant to diarrhea during [[typhoid fever]] or [[cholera]], and are therefore not truly asymptomatic. This resistance leads to increased fitness of the carriers, known as a [[heterozygote advantage]], and thereby increases the frequency of the altered genes in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodman |first1=D.M. |last2= Zamudio |first2=S. |title= The Cystic Fibrosis Heterozygote--Advantage in Surviving Cholera? |journal= [[Medical Hypotheses]] |date= 1991 |volume=36 |pages= 253–258 |doi= 10.1016/0306-9877(91)90144-n }}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Although only about 1 of every 3,000 Caucasian newborns has CF, there are more than 900 known mutations of the gene that causes CF. Current tests look for the most common mutations.&lt;ref name= "Edwards"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=Q. T. |last2=Seibert |first2=D. |last3=Macri |first3=C. |last4=Carolyn |first4=C. |last5=Tilghman |first5=J. |title= Assessing ethnicity in preconception counseling: Genetics--what nurse practitioners need to know|journal=Clinical Practice|date=November 2004|volume=16|issue=11|pages=472–480|doi=10.1111/j.1745-7599.2004.tb00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic testing]] can be used to tell if a person carries one or more mutations of the CF gene and how many copies of each mutation. The test looks at a person’s [[DNA]], which is taken from cells in a blood sample or from cells that are gently scraped from inside the mouth.

The mutations screened by the test vary according to a person's ethnic group or by the occurrence of CF already in the family. More than 10 million Americans, including 1 in 25 Caucasian Americans, are carriers of one mutation of the CF gene. CF is present in other races, though not as frequently as in Caucasian individuals. 1 in 46 Hispanic Americans, 1 in 65 African Americans, and 1 in 90 Asian Americans carry a mutation of the CF gene.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;

==Sickle cell anemia==
Sickle cell anemia is the most common genetic disorder among African Americans in the United States. While approximately 8% are carriers, 1 in 375 African Americans are born with the disease. Carriers are typically asymptomatic, but they may show symptoms at high altitudes or under oxygen-poor environments as in instances of extreme exercise.&lt;ref name= "Edwards" /&gt; Carriers are also known to be resistant to malaria, suggesting there is a heterozygote advantage in certain regions of Africa. This is a probable explanation for why the disease is most prevalent among African Americans &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=B.|first1=G.|title=Malaria and Sickle-Cell Anemia|journal=Science|date=October 5, 1956|volume=124|pages=619–624|doi=10.1126/science.124.3223.619 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4303">As introduced by [[Kurt Lewin]], '''genidentity''' is an ''existential relationship'' underlying the genesis of an object from one moment to the next. What we usually consider to be an object really consists of multiple entities, which are the phases of the object at various [[time]]s. Two objects are not identical because they have the same properties in common, but because one has developed from the other. 
Lewin introduced the concept in his 1922 [[Habilitationsschrift]] ''Der Begriff der Genese in Physik, Biologie und Entwicklungsgeschichte''. It is today perhaps the only surviving evidence of Lewin's influence on the philosophy of science. However, this concept never became an object of widespread discussion and debate in its own terms. Rather, it was extracted from its context by philosophers such as [[Rudolf Carnap]], Hans Hermes, [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Adolph Grünbaum]], and [[Bas van Fraassen]] who incorporated this concept into their own theories such as the [[topology of the universe]] or the axiomatization of [[mechanics]]. Lewin's idea was to compare and contrast the concept of genidentity in various branches of science, thereby laying bare the characteristic structure of each and making their classification possible in the first place. 

== Classification of Natural Sciences ==

In his thesis mentioned above, Lewin compares [[physics]] (in which he includes [[chemistry]]) and [[biology]] (which he divides into organic biology and [[evolutionary history of life]]). A comparison of this kind presupposes that it is possible to find equivalent notions in both sciences. According to Lewin, the concept of ''genidentity'' in the various sciences meets this requirement.

Lewin distinguishes between partial and total genidentity. This is due to the difficulty caused by parts of objects: for instance, an object might disintegrate into several pieces in the course of its development. As we follow such an object through time, only a small portion of it may remain. Lewin says that two objects existing at different times are partly genidentical if at least some part of the later object was present in the earlier object. By contrast, he says that two objects are totally genidentical if and only if at neither of the considered times there is any distinct object partially genidentical to one of the two objects concerned. 

Lewin also introduces the idea of viewing physical bodies as links in a so-called ''development chain''. According to this approach, between two totally genidentical objects there always exists, at any intermediate time, an object totally genidentical with each. Thus genidentity implies the existence of an entire infinite series of intermediate objects. In this Lewin sees an analogy between physical objects and [[real number]]s, as defined by so-called [[Dedekind cut]]s in the ordering of [[rational number]]s. 

Genidentity so defined is postulated to have various characteristics, such as symmetry, transitivity, density, and continuity. When reviewed in the light of contemporary standards of logical precision, it becomes clear that Lewin had the correct intuition, even though he did not have the benefit of a highly developed terminology of definition theory or modern day [[symbolic logic]]. 

However, genidentity has never been explicitly discussed in the experimental sciences. Rather, it has always been a basic assumption hovering in the background, tacitly assumed. The credit for having made these assumptions explicit for the first time doubtlessly belongs to Kurt Lewin, usually renowned for his psychological work in the field of [[Gestalt psychology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16082">A '''geographic range limit''' is the geographic boundary beyond which a [[species]] does not occur, the limit or limits of the [[Range (biology)|range]] of a species. "Core populations" are populations of individuals occurring within the center of the [[Range (biology)|range]], and "peripheral" or "edge populations" are groups of individuals near the boundary of the range.

The inability of a species to expand its range beyond these limits is because of some factor or factors that constrain the species from adapting to overcome the factors that are imposing limits on its distribution.&lt;ref name=Mott&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mott|first=CL|title=Environmental Constraints to the Geographic Expansion of Plant and Animal Species|journal=Natural Education Knowledge|year=2010|volume=3|issue=10|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, geographical range limits are entirely predictable, such as the physical barrier of an ocean for a terrestrial species.&lt;ref name=Mott /&gt; In other cases, reasons why species do not pass these boundaries are unknown, however the main determinants of the distribution of a species across its range are [[ecological]] and [[evolutionary]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardie|first=DC|author2=Hutching JA|title=Evolutionary ecology at the extreme of species' ranges|journal=Environ. Rev.|year=2010|volume=18|pages=1–20|doi=10.1139/a09-014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many species of invertebrate animals, the exact geographic range limits have never been precisely ascertained, because not enough scientific field work has been carried in many parts of the world to map distribution more precisely, therefore finding a range extension for species, especially marine species, is not an uncommon occurrence.

==Abiotic factors==
[[File:Moth September 2008-3.jpg|thumbnail|The pine moth, ''[[Thaumetopoea pityocampa]]'', expanded its range northward in France.]]

Gradients in climactic factors create physiological barriers to dispersal.&lt;ref name=Mott /&gt; All species have limits of tolerance to [[abiotic]] factors, which can lower their survival and [[reproductive success]] and limit range expansion beyond the edge. Changes in [[temperature]] may cause a species to change its geographical distribution. With increasing temperatures resulting from [[global warming]], species have been seen to expand their range northward due to increased survival and reproduction as a result of warming.&lt;ref name=Battisti&gt;{{cite journal|last=Battisti|first=A|author2=Stastny M |author3=Netherer S |author4=Robinet C |author5=Schopf A |author6=Roques A |author7=Larsson S |title=Expansion of geographic range in the pine processionary moth caused by increased winter temperatures|journal=Ecological Applications|year=2005|volume=15|issue=6|pages=2084–2096 |doi=10.1890/04-1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can also be a key determinant in limiting the geographic range edges of species. This is often seen in organisms with high water demands, whose survival and reproduction would decrease beyond the edge due to dry conditions, limiting expansion.&lt;ref name=Bateman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bateman|first=BL|author2=Abell-Davis SE |author3=Johnson CN |title=Climate-driven variation in food availability between the core and range edge of the endangered northern betting (''Bettongia tropica'')|journal=Australian Journal of Zoology|year=2011|volume=59|pages=177–185|doi=10.1071/zo11079}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moisture]] of [[soil]] or [[air]] is also seen to limit range expansion.

There are many other abiotic factors that can determine a species range, including [[dissolved oxygen]], [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] cover, [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]], [[alkalinity]] and [[pH]].&lt;ref name=Neff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neff|first=MR|author2=Jackson DA|title=Effects of broad-scale geological changes on patterns in macroinvertebrate assemblages|journal=Am.

==Biotic factors==
[[File:Spitzschlammschnecke.jpg|thumbnail|The freshwater gastropod ''[[Lymnaea stagnalis]]'' was found to have the highest occurrence of trematode parasites at the range edge compared to the core.]]

Interactions between species can cause limitations to a species geographic range. The most obvious interaction that limits range expansion is [[predation]], where [[prey]] species do not move beyond their range to avoid predator attack and [[Death|mortality]].&lt;ref name=Holt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holt|first=RD|author2=Barfield M|title=Trophic interactions and range limits: the diverse roles of predation|journal=Proc.

This is seen in [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationships, where fitness and population growth are reduced outside of the [[Host (biology)|hosts]] range where the [[symbiont]] is not present.&lt;ref name=Stanton-Geddes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton-Geddes|first=J|author2=Anderson C|title=Does a facultative mutualism limit species expansion?|journal=Oecologia|year=2011|volume=167|pages=149–155|doi=10.1007/s00442-011-1958-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parasitism]] can also play a role in limiting the expansion of species outside of their range. This occurs when there is a higher presence of [[infection]] at the range edges that reduces population growth and survivorship and ultimately reduces further expansion.&lt;ref name=Briers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Briers|first=R|title=Range limits and parasite prevalence in a freshwater snail|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|year=2003|volume=270|pages=178–180|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0046|pmc=1809944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher parasite presence can occur when abiotic conditions are unfavorable at the edge, leading to lower resistance of species to the infection.&lt;ref name=Briers /&gt;

==Anthropogenic factors==
[[File:Molothrus aeneus -Tucson, Arizona, USA-8 (3).jpg|thumbnail|The [[Bronzed Cowbird|bronzed cowbird]], ''Molothrus aeneus'', continues to expand its range in New Mexico and Texas due to deforestation.]]

Humans are responsible for causing changes to the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and habitat that [[plants]] and [[animals]] rely on for survival. These impacts have the potential to alter species [[behaviours]], interactions and distributions. Many areas are [[deforested]] in order to provide land for [[agriculture]] or [[Industry|industrial]] use.

==Genetic factors==
[[File:Mangrove-leaves-nz.jpg|thumbnail|Comparative analysis of core and edge populations of the mangrove ''[[Avicennia marina]]'' found reduced genetic diversity in edge populations.]]

Studies of the [[Genetics|genetic]] influences on geographic range limits tend to focus on genetic effects that restrict peripheral populations from expanding beyond their range edge. Many [[hypotheses]] have been proposed, however there has not been a general consensus on one main cause. Most hypotheses stem from the fact that peripheral populations are expected to be small, due to less optimal conditions at the edge.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=JH|title=On the relationship between abundance and distribution of species|journal=The American Naturalist|year=1984|volume=124|pages=255–279|doi=10.1086/284267}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis predicts that due to smaller [[population size]] at the edge, [[genetic drift]] will have a larger effect and reduce [[genetic variation]] of edge populations.&lt;ref name=Dai&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dai|first=Q|author2=Fu JZ|title=When central populations exhibit more genetic diversity than peripheral populations: a simulation study|journal=Chinese Sci Bull|year=2011|volume=56|issue=24|pages=2531–2540|doi=10.1007/s11434-011-4605-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; With less genetic variation, populations at the edge may have difficulty adapting to changing conditions.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; Another hypothesis predicts that high [[selection pressure]] at the peripheral edge will only allow for a few [[genotypes]] to survive, decreasing genetic variation and future adaptation.&lt;ref name=Dai /&gt; Reduced [[gene flow]] between central and peripheral populations has also been hypothesized as a limitation for species expansion. Without introduction of new [[alleles]] from central to edge populations, genetic variation will remain low and peripheral populations will have difficulty adapting to new conditions.&lt;ref name=Dai /&gt; Contrary to this, some hypothesize that gene flow between central and peripheral populations can prevent range expansion, where gene flow causes contamination of the edge [[gene pool]].&lt;ref name=Kirk&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=M|author2=Barton NH|title=Evolution of a species' range|journal=American Naturalist|year=1997|volume=150|pages=1–23|doi=10.1086/286054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions at the center of the range differ from those at the periphery; therefore adapted alleles at the center may not benefit those at the edge who experience different conditions.&lt;ref name=Kirk /&gt; The [[Allee effect]] has also been proposed to reduce range expansion, where small population sizes lead to reduced [[cooperation]] and survival.&lt;ref name=allee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allee|first=WC|author2=Bowen E|title=Studies in animal aggregations: mass protection against colloidal silver among goldfishes|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|year=1932|volume=61|issue=2|pages=185–207|doi=10.1002/jez.1400610202}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many potential causes of the allee effect, including mate-finding failure or [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref name=tobin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tobin|first=PC|author2=Robinet C |author3=Jhonson DM |author4=Whitmire SL |author5=Bjornstad ON |author6=Leibhold AM |title=The role of Allee effects in gypsy moth, ''Lymnatria dispar'' (L.), invasions|journal=Popul Ecol|year=2009|volume=51|pages=373–384 |doi=10.1007/s10144-009-0144-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At low densities, the challenge for [[males]] and [[females]] to locate each other is much larger, leading to decreased reproduction and survival.&lt;ref name=tobin /&gt; Small population sizes may also cause species to mate with their relatives, increasing chances of [[lethal alleles]] within the population and decreasing survival.&lt;ref name=tobin /&gt;

==Combined influences==
[[File:Scarabaeus viettei 01.jpg|thumbnail|Deforestation leads to dry conditions within the soil, causing the dung beetle to migrate northward into areas of higher moisture.]]

In most cases, combinations of factors are responsible for limiting the geographic range edge of species. Abiotic and [[biotic component|biotic]] factors may work as co-factors in determining the ability of species to expand their range. This is found in [[obligate seeder]] plants, who require [[fire]] to activate their [[seedbank|seed bank]] and produce [[seeds]], and require mediated [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] of seeds by other species to expand their range.&lt;ref name=Arnan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnan|first=X|author2=Rodrigo A |author3=Molowny-Horas R |author4=Retana J |title=Ant-mediated expansion of an obligate seeder species during the first years after fire|journal=Plant Biology|year=2010|volume=12|issue=|pages=842–852|doi=10.1111/j.1438-8677.2009.00294.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be seen in species that share an overlapping range, where competition for food and habitat determines where each species resides.&lt;ref name=Hersteinsson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hersteinsson|first=P|author2=Macdonald W|title=Interspecific competition and the geographical distribution of red and arctic foxes Vulpes vulpes and Alopex Lagopus|journal=Oikos|year=1992|volume=64|pages=505–515|doi=10.2307/3545168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abiotic and anthropogenic factors can be found to work together to limit a species range.

'''''Germinal''''' is the thirteenth novel in [[Émile Zola]]'s twenty-volume series ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]''. Often considered Zola's masterpiece and one of the most significant novels in the French tradition, the novel&amp;nbsp;– an uncompromisingly harsh and realistic story of a coalminers' strike in northern France in the 1860s&amp;nbsp;– has been published and translated in over one hundred countries and has additionally inspired five film adaptations and two television productions.

''Germinal'' was written between April 1884 and January 1885. It was first serialized between November 1884 and February 1885 in the periodical ''[[Gil Blas (periodical)|Gil Blas]]'', then in March 1885 published as a book.

The title ({{IPA-fr|ʒɛʁminal|pron}}) refers to [[Germinal (French Republican Calendar)|the name of a month]] of the [[French Republican Calendar#Months|French Republican Calendar]], a spring month. ''Germen'' is a [[Latin]] word which means "seed"; the novel describes the hope for a better future that seeds amongst the [[miner]]s. As the final lines of the novel read:
{{Quote|''Des hommes poussaient, une armée noire, vengeresse, qui germait lentement dans les sillons, grandissant pour les récoltes du siècle futur, et dont la germination allait faire bientôt éclater la terre.''&lt;br /&gt;Men were springing forth, a black avenging army, germinating slowly in the furrows, growing towards the harvests of the next century, and their germination would soon overturn the earth.|1885 translation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/eldritch/ez/g76.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Plot summary==
[[File:First page GERMINAL.jpg|thumb|left|The title page of the 1885 [[French language|French]] edition]]

The novel's central character is Étienne Lantier, previously seen in ''[[L'Assommoir]]'' (1877), and originally to have been the central character in Zola's "murder on the trains" thriller ''[[La Bête humaine]]'' (1890) before the overwhelmingly positive reaction to ''Germinal'' persuaded him otherwise. The young migrant worker arrives at the forbidding coal mining town of Montsou in the bleak area of the far north of France to earn a living as a miner. Sacked from his previous job on the railways for assaulting a superior, Étienne befriends the veteran miner Maheu, who finds him somewhere to stay and gets him a job pushing the carts down the pit.

Étienne is portrayed as a hard-working idealist but also a naïve youth; Zola's genetic theories come into play as Étienne is presumed to have inherited his Macquart ancestors' traits of hotheaded impulsiveness and an [[addictive personality]] capable of exploding into rage under the influence of drink or strong passions. Zola keeps his theorizing in the background and Étienne's motivations are much more natural as a result. He embraces socialist principles, reading large amounts of working class movement literature and fraternizing with Souvarine, a Russian anarchist and political émigré who has also come to Montsou to seek a living in the pits. Étienne's simplistic understanding of socialist politics and their rousing effect on him are very reminiscent of the rebel Silvère in the first novel in the cycle, ''[[La Fortune des Rougon]]'' (1871).

While this is going on, Étienne also falls for Maheu's daughter Catherine, also employed pushing carts in the mines, and he is drawn into the relationship between her and her brutish lover Chaval, a prototype for the character of Buteau in Zola's later novel ''[[La Terre]]'' (1887). The complex tangle of the miners' lives is played out against a backdrop of severe poverty and oppression, as their working and living conditions continue to worsen throughout the novel; eventually, pushed to breaking point, the miners decide to strike and Étienne, now a respected member of the community and recognized as a political idealist, becomes the leader of the movement. While the anarchist Souvarine preaches violent action, the miners and their families hold back, their poverty becoming ever more disastrous, until they are sparked into a ferocious riot, the violence of which is described in explicit terms by Zola, as well as providing some of the novelist's best and most evocative crowd scenes. The rioters are eventually confronted by police and the army that repress the revolt in a violent and unforgettable episode. Disillusioned, the miners go back to work, blaming Étienne for the failure of the strike; then, Souvarine sabotages the entrance shaft of one of the Montsou pits, trapping Étienne, Catherine and Chaval at the bottom. The ensuing drama and the long wait for rescue are among some of Zola's best scenes, and the novel draws to a dramatic close. Étienne is eventually rescued and fired but he goes on to live in Paris with Pluchart&lt;!-- Such man or woman has not been introduced in this article yet. --&gt;.

==Historical context==
[[File:Angiolillo died bravely.png|thumb|[[Michele Angiolillo]] uttered clearly the word '''Germinal''' before he died.]]

The title, ''Germinal'', is drawn from the springtime seventh month of the [[French Revolutionary Calendar]] and is meant to evoke imagery of germination, new growth and fertility. Accordingly, Zola ends the novel on a note of hope and one that has provided inspiration to socialist and reformist causes of all kinds throughout the years since its first publication:

"Beneath the blazing of the sun, in that morning of new growth, the countryside rang with song, as its belly swelled with a black and avenging army of men, germinating slowly in its furrows, growing upwards in readiness for harvests to come, until one day soon their ripening would burst open the earth itself."

By the time of his death, the novel had come to be recognized as his undisputed masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XA3ct_HebxsC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=Germinal+Zola+influence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUs6GBrLvKAhULcz4KHRehB84Q6AEIVDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Germinal%20Zola%20influence&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; At his funeral crowds of workers gathered, cheering the cortège with shouts of "Germinal! Germinal!". Since then the book has come to symbolize working class causes and to this day retains a special place in French mining-town folklore.

Zola was always very proud of ''Germinal'' and was always keen to defend its accuracy against accusations of hyperbole and exaggeration (from the conservatives) or of slander against the working classes (from the socialists). His research had been typically thorough, especially the parts involving lengthy observational visits to northern French mining towns in 1884, such as witnessing the after-effects of a crippling miners' strike first-hand at [[Anzin]] or actually going down a working coal pit at [[Denain]]. The mine scenes are especially vivid and haunting as a result.

A sensation upon original publication, it is now by far the best-selling of Zola's novels, both in France and internationally. A number of modern translations are currently in print and widely available.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been filmed a number of times, including:
* ''[[Germinal (1913 film)|Germinal]]'' (1913), directed by [[Albert Capellani]], starring [[Henry Krauss]]
* ''[[Germinal (1963 film)|Germinal]]'' (1963), directed by [[Yves Allégret]], starring [[Jean Sorel]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Berthe Granval|fr}}, [[Claude Brasseur]] and [[Bernard Blier]].
* ''Germinal'' (1970), a BBC five-part serial with [[Mark Jones (actor)|Mark Jones]] and  [[Rosemary Leach]]
* ''[[Germinal (1993 film)|Germinal]]'' (1993), a large-scale production directed by [[Claude Berri]] and starring [[Gérard Depardieu]] and [[Miou-Miou]], at that time the most expensive feature film ever made in France. Much of Berri's film was shot on location in the [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] and [[Valenciennes]] regions of northern France, and the extensive unemployment and poverty the cast and crew still witnessed there led to the formation of a society, "Germinal l'association", headed by Depardieu, to alleviate the suffering caused by crippling unemployment in the ''[[Departments of France|départements]]'' comprising the region of [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]].

The '''Goddard Institute for Space Studies''' ('''GISS''')  is a laboratory in the Earth Sciences Division of NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and a unit of the [[The Earth Institute|Columbia University Earth Institute]].&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;
{{NASA
|article=Overview
|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is located at [[Columbia University]] in New York City.

Research at the GISS emphasizes a broad study of Global Change; the natural and anthropogenic changes in our environment that affect the habitability of our planet. These effects may occur on greatly differing time scales, from one-time forcings such as volcanic explosions, to seasonal/annual effects such as [[El Niño]], and on up to the millennia of ice ages.

The institute's research combines analysis of comprehensive global datasets, (derived from surface stations combined with satellite data for SSTs), with global models of atmospheric, land surface, and oceanic processes. Study of past climate change on Earth and of other planetary atmospheres provides an additional tool in assessing our general understanding of the atmosphere and its evolution.&lt;ref name=gsss&gt;{{NASA

&lt;/ref&gt; It was separated from the Theoretical Division in July 1962. Its offices were originally located in [[The Interchurch Center]], and the institute moved into Columbia's Armstrong Hall (formerly the Ostend apartments and then the Oxford Residence Hotel) in April 1966.

From 1981 to 2013, GISS was directed by [[James E. Hansen]]. In June 2014, [[Gavin A.

== History of scientific research ==

In the 1960s, GISS was a frequent center for high-level scientific workshops, including the "History of the Earth’s Crust Symposium" in November 1966 which has been described as the meeting that gave birth to the idea of [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://eos.org/features/meeting-gave-birth-idea-global-tectonics| title=Meeting gave birth to the idea of global tectonics}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a GISS workshop in 1967, [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] popularized the term "[[black hole]]" as a short-hand for 'gravitionally completely collapsed star', though the term was not coined there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/topicalwords/tw-bla1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Black Hole|website=World Wide Words|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1974, at a seminal meeting led by [[Patrick Thaddeus]] at GISS with [[John C. Mather|John Mather]] (his then post-doc) and others discussions began on the possibility of building a satellite to measure both the spectrum and possible spatial fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background. This led directly to the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite project and a [[Nobel Prize]] for Mather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0170 | title=Patrick Thaddeus}} Nature Astronomy 1, 2017, doi:10.1038/s41550-017-0170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change research ==
A key objective of Goddard Institute for Space Studies research is prediction of climate change in the 21st century. The research combines paleogeological record, analysis of comprehensive global datasets (derived mainly from spacecraft observations), with global models of atmospheric, land surface, and oceanic processes.

Climate science predictions are based substantially on historical analysis of Earth's paleoclimate (climate through geological ages), and the sea-level/ temperature/ carbon dioxide record.

Changes in carbon dioxide associated with continental drift, and the decrease in volcanism as India arrived at the Asian continent, allowed temperatures to drop &amp; Antarctic ice-sheets to form. This resulted in a 75m drop in sea level, allowing our present-day coastlines &amp; habitats to form and stabilize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklin-live.net/site/20110512DrJamesHansen.php|title=James Hansen, public lecture 12th May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515102527/http://www.franklin-live.net/site/20110512DrJamesHansen.php|archivedate=15 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global change studies at GISS are coordinated with research at other groups within the Earth Sciences Division, including the Laboratory for Atmospheres, Laboratory for Hydrospheric and Biospheric Sciences, and Earth Observing System science office.

== Awards ==

[[File:Trientalis borealis 1177.JPG|right|thumb|''[[Trientalis latifolia]]'' (Broadleaf Starflower) is a perennial herbaceous plant of the ground layer of forests in western North America.]]
'''Herbaceous plants''' (in [[Botany|botanical]] use frequently simply '''herbs''') are [[plant]]s that have no persistent [[wood]]y stem above ground.&lt;ref&gt;''Flora of the British Isles'', Clapham, Tutin, and Warburg, 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is mainly applied to [[Perennial plant|perennial]]s,&lt;ref name="RHS encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Royal Horticultural Society encyclopedia of gardening |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=9781405303538 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pulnPwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- glossary p679 --&gt; but in botany it may also refer to [[Annual plant|annual]]s or [[Biennial plant|biennial]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Solomon, E.P. |author2=Berg, L.R. |author3=Martin, D.W. |year=2004|title=Biology|publisher=Brooks/Cole Thomson Learning|isbn=978-0-534-49547-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UCUxpgfcoNsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include both [[forb]]s and [[graminoid]]s.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Annual herbaceous plants die completely at the end of the growing season or when they have flowered and fruited, and they then grow again from seed.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Carol. 1995. ''A guide to wildflowers in winter: herbaceous plants of northeastern North America''. New Haven: Yale University Press. page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbaceous perennial and biennial plants may have [[Plant stem|stem]]s that die at the end of the growing season, but parts of the plant survive under or close to the ground from season to season (for biennials, until the next growing season, when they flower and die). New growth develops from living tissues remaining on or under the ground, including [[root]]s, a [[caudex]] (a thickened portion of the stem at ground level) or various types of [[underground stem]]s, such as [[bulb]]s, [[corm]]s, [[stolon]]s, [[rhizome]]s and [[tuber]]s. Examples of herbaceous biennials include [[carrot]], [[parsnip]] and [[Senecio jacobaea|common ragwort]]; herbaceous perennials include [[potato]], [[peony]], [[hosta]], [[Mentha|mint]], most [[fern]]s and most [[Poaceae|grasses]]. By contrast, non-herbaceous perennial plants are [[woody plant]]s which have stems above ground that remain alive during the dormant season and grow shoots the next year from the above-ground parts &amp;ndash; these include [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[vine]]s.

Some relatively fast-growing herbaceous plants (especially annuals) are [[Pioneer species|pioneers]], or early-successional species.  Others form the main vegetation of many stable habitats, occurring for example in the ground layer of [[forest]]s, or in naturally open [[habitat]]s such as [[meadow]], [[salt marsh]] or [[desert]].

Some herbaceous plants can grow rather large, such as the genus ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'', to which the [[banana]] belongs.&lt;ref name=PicqINIB00&gt;{{Cite book |date=2000 |editor-last=Picq |editor-first=Claudine |editor2-last=INIBAP |title=Bananas |edition=English |publication-place=Montpellier |publisher=International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantains/International Plant Genetic Resources Institute |isbn=978-2-910810-37-5 |url=http://www.musalit.org/pdf/info09.1_en.pdf |accessdate=2013-01-31 |lastauthoramp=yes |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411222515/http://www.musalit.org/pdf/info09.1_en.pdf |archivedate=April 11, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of some herbaceous perennial plants can be determined by [[herbchronology]], the analysis of annual growth rings in the secondary root xylem.

'''Hort.''', in the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of plants, is an abbreviation used to indicate a name that saw significant use in the [[Horticulture|horticultural]] literature (usually of the 19th century and earlier), but was never properly published.

==Origins and usage==
"Hort.," short for ''hortulanorum'',&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; was proposed in order that a non-wild, cultivated plants known and described in agriculture or gardening circles can be examined by taxonomists, to be examined if they can be established as species, and published.
The proposal was made at the 1928 "International Congress of Horticulture of Vienna"&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; by [[citrus]] scholar [[Chōzaburō Tanaka|Tyozaburo Tanaka]].&lt;ref name=khan&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=Iqrar Ahmad|title=Citrus Genetics, Breeding And Biotechnology|publisher=CABI|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pKlNrSR_8IEC&amp;pg=PA33|page=33|isbn=9781845931933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, for the [[clementine]], the following [[binomial name]] was adopted by Tanaka:

:''Citrus clementina'' &lt;small&gt;hort. [[Ex (botany author citation)|ex]] [[Chōzaburō Tanaka|Tanaka]]&lt;/small&gt;

With respect to the citrus, Tanaka's system is no longer considered viable (for the clementine example above, the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] name [[Citrus × clementina|''Citrus'' × ''clementina'']] would be favored by most consensus), but it is still useful as an expedient for designating the numerous Japanese  "types" (hybrids, [[cultivars]], [[Accession number (bioinformatics)|accessions]], [[phenotypes]]).

While [[Walter Tennyson Swingle]] recognized only 16 citrus species,&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; Tanaka came up with some 157 species&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; or close to 160.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite book|last=Page|first=Martin|title=Growing Citrus: The Essential Gardener's Guide|publisher=Timber Press|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tk7DaWYvuPAC&amp;pg=PA30|page=30|isbn=9780881929065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanaka's approach has been characterized as that of a "[[Lumpers and splitters|splitter]]", and Swingles that of a "lumper",&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; but recent comparative research on phenotypes and genetics bear out support for many fewer species (four species&lt;ref&gt;Scora and Kumamoto (1983), cited by Martin.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In 1895 [[Thomas Hunt Morgan|Thomas Morgan]] removed one of a [[frog]]'s two [[blastomere]]s and found that [[amphibians]] are able to form whole [[embryo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s from the remaining part. This meant that the cells can change their differentiation pathway. In 1924 Spemann and Mangold demonstrated the key importance of cell–cell inductions during animal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Robertis | first1 = Edward M. | year = 2006 | title =  Spemann''s organizer and self-regulation in amphibian embryos| url = | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 296–302 | doi = 10.1038/nrm1855 | pmid=16482093 | pmc=2464568}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reversible transformation of cells of one differentiated cell type to another is called [[metaplasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/path.2442| pmid = 18855879| title = Metaplasia and somatic cell reprogramming| journal = The Journal of Pathology| volume = 217| issue = 2| pages = 161–8| year = 2009| last1 = Slack | first1 = J.

One example is the transformation of [[iris (eye)|iris]] cells to [[lens (eye)|lens]] cells in the process of maturation and transformation of [[retinal pigment epithelium]] cells into the neural retina during regeneration in adult [[newt]] eyes. This process allows the body to replace cells not suitable to new conditions with more suitable new cells. In [[Drosophila]] imaginal discs, cells have to choose from a limited number of standard discrete differentiation states. The fact that transdetermination (change of the path of differentiation) often occurs for a group of cells rather than single cells shows that it is induced rather than part of maturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1634/stemcells.18-6-409| pmid = 11072028| title = Stem Cell Plasticity in Mammals and Transdetermination in ''Drosophila'': Common Themes?| journal = Stem Cells| volume = 18| issue = 6| pages = 409–14| year = 2000| last1 = Wei | first1 = G.| last2 = Schubiger | first2 = G.| last3 = Harder | first3 = F.| last4 = M&amp;uuml;ller | first4 = A.

The researchers were able to identify the minimal conditions and factors that would be sufficient for starting the cascade of molecular and cellular processes to instruct pluripotent cells to organize the [[embryo]]. They showed that [[Chemotaxis|opposing gradients]] of [[bone morphogenetic protein]] (BMP) and [[NODAL|Nodal]], two [[transforming growth factor]] family members that act as [[morphogen]]s, are sufficient to induce molecular and cellular mechanisms required to organize, ''[[in vivo]]'' or ''[[in vitro]]'', [[Cell fate determination|uncommitted cells]] of the [[zebrafish]] [[blastula]] animal pole into a well-developed [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = Peng-Fei | last2 = Houssin | first2 = Nathalie | last3 = Ferri-Lagneau | first3 = Karine F. | last4 = Thisse | first4 = Bernard | last5 = Thisse | first5 = Christine | year = 2014 | title = Construction of a Vertebrate Embryo from Two Opposing Morphogen Gradients | url = | journal = Science | volume = 344 | issue = 6179| pages = 87–89 | doi = 10.1126/science.1248252 | pmid=24700857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of mature, specialized adult cells can naturally revert to stem cells. For example, "chief" cells express the stem cell marker Troy. While they normally produce digestive fluids for the stomach, they can revert into stem cells to make temporary repairs to stomach injuries, such as a cut or damage from infection. Moreover, they can make this transition even in the absence of noticeable injuries and are capable of replenishing entire gastric units, in essence serving as quiescent "reserve" stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.008| title = Differentiated Troy+ Chief Cells Act as Reserve Stem Cells to Generate All Lineages of the Stomach Epithelium| journal = Cell| volume = 155| issue = 2| pages = 357–68| year = 2013| last1 = Stange | first1 = D.

A variety of nontumorigenic stem cells display the ability to generate multiple cell types. For instance, multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring [[Muse cell|(Muse)]] cells are stress-tolerant adult human stem cells that can self-renew.

By reprograming mouse embryonic [[fibroblast]]s into pluripotent stem cells via the ectopic expression of four [[transcription factor]]s, namely [[Oct4]], [[Sox2]], [[Klf4]] and [[c-Myc]], they proved that the overexpression of a small number of factors can push the cell to transition to a new stable state that is associated with changes in the activity of thousands of genes.&lt;ref name="Takahashi"/&gt;

A small molecule called MitoBloCK-6 can force the pluripotent stem cells to die by triggering [[apoptosis]] (via [[cytochrome c]] release across the [[mitochondria]]l outer membrane) in human pluripotent stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. Shortly after differentiation, daughter cells became resistant to death. When MitoBloCK-6 was introduced to differentiated cell lines, the cells remained healthy. The key to their survival, was hypothesized to be due to the changes undergone by pluripotent stem cell mitochondria in the process of cell differentiation. This ability of MitoBloCK-6 to separate the pluripotent and differentiated cell lines has the potential to reduce the risk of teratomas and other problems in regenerative medicine.&lt;ref name="Dabir"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.devcel.2013.03.006| pmid = 23597483| pmc = 3726224| title = A Small Molecule Inhibitor of Redox-Regulated Protein Translocation into Mitochondria| journal = Developmental Cell| volume = 25| issue = 1| pages = 81–92| year = 2013| last1 = Dabir | first1 = D.

In 2012 other [[small molecules]] (selective cytotoxic inhibitors of human pluripotent stem cells – hPSCs) were identified that prevented human pluripotent stem cells from forming teratomas in mice. The most potent and selective compound of them (PluriSIn #1) inhibits [[Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1|stearoyl-coA desaturase]] (the key enzyme in [[oleic acid]] biosynthesis), which finally results in apoptosis.

By using solely [[small molecules]], Deng Hongkui and colleagues demonstrated that endogenous "master genes" are enough for cell fate reprogramming. They induced a pluripotent state in adult cells from mice using seven small-molecule compounds.&lt;ref name="Hongkui Deng"/&gt;
The effectiveness of the method is quite high: it was able to convert 0.02% of the adult tissue cells into iPSCs, which is comparable to the gene insertion conversion rate.
The authors note that the mice generated from CiPSCs were "100% viable and apparently healthy for up to 6 months". So, this chemical reprogramming strategy has potential use in generating functional desirable cell types for clinical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Los | first1 = Angeles | last2 = Daley | first2 = G.

So, chemical reprogramming became a promising approach to manipulate cell fates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = Y. | last2 = Zhao | first2 = T. | last3 = Guan | first3 = J. | year = 2015 | title = A XEN-like State Bridges Somatic Cells to Pluripotency during Chemical Reprogramming | journal = Cell | volume =  163| issue = 7| pages =  1678–1691| doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.11.017 | pmid=26686652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differentiation from induced teratoma ===

The fact that human iPSCs capable of forming teratomas not only in humans but also in some animal body, in particular in mice or pigs, allowed to develop a method for differentiation of iPSCs in vivo. For this purpose, iPSCs with an agent for inducing differentiation into target cells are injected to [[Genetically modified mammal|genetically modified]] pig or mouse that has suppressed immune system activation on human cells.
The formed teratoma is cut out and used for the isolation of the necessary differentiated human cells&lt;ref&gt;Nakauchi Hiromitsu; Kamiya Akihide; Suzuki Nao; Ito Keiichi; Yamazaki Satoshi (2011) [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=WO&amp;NR=2011071085&amp;KC=&amp;FT=E&amp;locale=en_EP   Method for Producing Cells Induced to Differentiate from Pluripotent Stem Cells.] Patent Cooperation Treaty Application, patno: WO2011071085  (A1). 2011-06-16 (C12N5/07)&lt;/ref&gt; by means of [[monoclonal antibody]] to tissue-specific markers on the surface of these cells. This method has been successfully used for the production of functional myeloid, erythroid and lymphoid human cells suitable for transplantation (yet only to mice).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1182/blood-2012-06-434407| pmid = 23212524| title = In vivo generation of transplantable human hematopoietic cells from induced pluripotent stem cells| journal = Blood| volume = 121| issue = 8| pages = 1255–1264| year = 2012| last1 = Amabile | first1 = G.| last2 = Welner | first2 = R.

Mice engrafted with human iPSC teratoma-derived hematopoietic cells produced human B and T cells capable of functional immune responses. These results offer hope that in vivo generation of patient customized cells is feasible, providing materials that could be useful for transplantation, human antibody generation and drug screening applications.
Using MitoBloCK-6&lt;ref name="Dabir"/&gt; and/or PluriSIn # 1 the differentiated progenitor cells can be further purified from teratoma forming pluripotent cells. The fact, that the differentiation takes place even in the teratoma niche, offers hope that the resulting cells are sufficiently stable to stimuli able to cause their transition back to the dedifferentiated (pluripotent) state and therefore safe. A similar in vivo differentiation system, yielding engraftable hematopoietic stem cells from mouse and human iPSCs in teratoma-bearing animals in combination with a maneuver to facilitate hematopoiesis, was described by Suzuki et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/mt.2013.71| pmid = 23670574| title = Generation of Engraftable Hematopoietic Stem Cells from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells by Way of Teratoma Formation| journal = Molecular Therapy| volume = 21| issue = 7| pages = 1424–1431| year = 2013| last1 = Suzuki | first1 = N. | last2 = Yamazaki | first2 = S. | last3 = Yamaguchi | first3 = T. | last4 = Okabe | first4 = M. | last5 = Masaki | first5 = H. | last6 = Takaki | first6 = S. | last7 = Otsu | first7 = M. | last8 = Nakauchi | first8 = H. | pmc=3705943}}&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that neither leukemia nor tumors were observed in recipients after intravenous injection of iPSC-derived hematopoietic stem cells into irradiated recipients. Moreover, this injection resulted in multilineage and long-term reconstitution of the hematolymphopoietic system in serial transfers. Such system provides a useful tool for practical application of iPSCs in the treatment of hematologic and immunologic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/mt.2013.129| pmid = 23812546| title = Generation and Homing of iPSC-Derived Hematopoietic Cells in Vivo| journal = Molecular Therapy| volume = 21| issue = 7| pages = 1292–1293| year = 2013| last1 = Chou | first1 = B.

To prevent rejection after transplantation to the patient of the allogenic organ or tissue, grown from the pluripotent stem cells in vivo in the animal, these cells should express two molecules: [[Belatacept|CTLA4-Ig]], which disrupts T cell costimulatory pathways and [[PD-L1]], which activates T cell inhibitory pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2013.11.014| pmid = 24388175| pmc = 4023958| title = An Effective Approach to Prevent Immune Rejection of Human ESC-Derived Allografts| journal = Cell Stem Cell| volume = 14| issue = 1| pages = 121–130| year = 2014| last1 = Rong | first1 = Z. | last2 = Wang | first2 = M. | last3 = Hu | first3 = Z. | last4 = Stradner | first4 = M. | last5 = Zhu | first5 = S. | last6 = Kong | first6 = H. | last7 = Yi | first7 = H. | last8 = Goldrath | first8 = A. | last9 = Yang | first9 = Y.

==== Single transcription factor transdifferentiation ====

Originally only early embryonic cells could be coaxed into changing their identity. Mature cells are resistant to changing their identity once they've committed to a specific kind. However, brief expression of a single transcription factor, the ELT-7 GATA factor, can convert the identity of fully differentiated, specialized non-endodermal cells of the [[pharynx]] into fully differentiated intestinal cells in intact [[larvae]] and adult roundworm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' with no requirement for a dedifferentiated intermediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1242/dev.103010| pmid = 24257624| title = Transdifferentiation and remodeling of post-embryonic C.

==== Transdifferentiation with CRISPR-mediated activator ====

The cell fate can be effectively manipulated by [[epigenome editing]]. In particular, by directly activating of specific endogenous gene expression with [[CRISPR]]-mediated activator. When [[Cas9#Applications of Cas9 to transcription tuning|dCas9]] (that has been modified so that it no longer cuts DNA, but still can be guided to specific sequences and to bind to them) is combined with transcription activators, it can precisely manipulate endogenous gene expression. Using this method, Wei et al., enhanced the expression of endogenous [[CDX2|Cdx2]] and [[GATA6|Gata6]] genes by CRISPR-mediated activators, thus directly converted mouse embryonic stem cells into two extraembryonic lineages, i.e., typical trophoblast stem cells and extraembryonic endoderm cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = S | last2 = Zou | first2 = Q | last3 = Lai | first3 = S | display-authors = etal   | year = 2016 | title = Conversion of embryonic stem cells into extraembryonic lineages by CRISPR-mediated activators | url = | journal = Sci.

The rapid and sustained activation of endogenous genes in their native chromatin context by this approach may facilitate reprogramming with transient methods that avoid genomic integration and provides a new strategy for overcoming epigenetic barriers to cell fate specification.

=== Phased process modeling regeneration ===

Another way of reprogramming is the simulation of the processes that occur during [[amphibian]] limb regeneration. In [[urodele]] amphibians, an early step in limb regeneration is skeletal muscle fiber dedifferentiation into a cellulate that proliferates into limb tissue. However, sequential small molecule treatment of the muscle fiber with myoseverin, [[reversine]] (the [[aurora B kinase]] inhibitor) and some other chemicals: BIO (glycogen synthase-3 kinase inhibitor), [[lysophosphatidic acid]] (pleiotropic activator of G-protein-coupled receptors), [[SB203580]] ([[p38 MAP kinase]] inhibitor), or [[SQ22536]] (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor) causes the formation of new muscle cell types as well as other cell types such as precursors to fat, bone and nervous system cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cb2000154| pmid = 21322636| title = Novel Chemically Defined Approach to Produce Multipotent Cells from Terminally Differentiated Tissue Syncytia| journal = ACS Chemical Biology| volume = 6| issue = 6| pages = 553–562| year = 2011| last1 = Jung | first1 = D.

CRCs do not express high levels of proteins characteristic of iPSCs or embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (e.g., Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, or Klf4).

In addition, the CRC method allows for the genetic manipulation of epithelial cells ex vivo and their subsequent evaluation in vivo in the same host. While initial studies revealed that co-culturing epithelial cells with Swiss 3T3 cells J2 was essential for CRC induction, with transwell culture plates, physical contact between feeders and epithelial cells is not required for inducing CRCs and more importantly that irradiation of the feeder cells is required for this induction. Consistent with the transwell experiments, conditioned medium induces and maintains CRCs, which is accompanied by a concomitant increase of cellular telomerase activity. The activity of the conditioned medium correlates directly with radiation-induced feeder cell apoptosis. Thus, conditional reprogramming of epithelial cells is mediated by a combination of Y-27632 and a soluble factor(s) released by apoptotic feeder cells.&lt;ref name="Nancy"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.08.009| pmid = 24096078| pmc = 5745544| title = Radiation Induces Diffusible Feeder Cell Factor(s) That Cooperate with ROCK Inhibitor to Conditionally Reprogram and Immortalize Epithelial Cells| journal = The American Journal of Pathology| volume = 183| issue = 6| pages = 1862–1870| year = 2013| last1 = Palechor-Ceron | first1 = N. | last2 = Suprynowicz | first2 = F.

Cell surface progenitor-associated markers are rapidly induced in normal mouse ME-CRCs relative to ME cells. However, the expression of certain mammary progenitor subpopulations, such as CD49f+ ESA+ CD44+, drops significantly in later passages. Nevertheless, mouse ME-CRCs grown in a three-dimensional extracellular matrix gave rise to mammary acinar structures. ME-CRCs isolated from MMTV-Neu transgenic mouse mammary tumors express high levels of HER2/neu, as well as tumor-initiating cell markers, such as CD44+, CD49f+ and ESA+ (EpCam). These patterns of expression are sustained in later CRC passages. Early and late passage ME-CRCs from MMTV-Neu tumors that were implanted in the mammary fat pads of syngeneic or nude mice developed vascular tumors that metastasized within 6 weeks of transplantation. Importantly, the histopathology of these tumors was indistinguishable from that of the parental tumors that develop in the MMTV-Neu mice. Application of the CRC system to mouse mammary epithelial cells provides an attractive model system to study the genetics and phenotype of normal and transformed mouse epithelium in a defined culture environment and in vivo transplant studies.

A different approach to CRC is to inhibit [[CD47]] – a [[membrane protein]] that is the [[thrombospondin-1]] receptor. Loss of CD47 permits sustained proliferation of primary [[murine]] endothelial cells, increases asymmetric division and enables these cells to spontaneously reprogram to form multipotent [[embryoid body]]-like clusters. CD47 knockdown acutely increases [[mRNA]] levels of c-Myc and other stem cell transcription factors in cells in vitro and in vivo. Thrombospondin-1 is a key environmental signal that inhibits stem cell self-renewal via CD47. Thus, CD47 antagonists enable cell self-renewal and reprogramming by overcoming negative regulation of c-Myc and other stem cell transcription factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaur | first1 = Sukhbir | last2 = Soto-Pantoja | first2 = David R. | last3 = Stein | first3 = Erica V. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013| title = Thrombospondin-1 Signaling through CD47 Inhibits Self-renewal by Regulating c-Myc and Other Stem Cell Transcription Factors | url = http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130417/srep01673/full/srep01673.html| journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 1673 | doi = 10.1038/srep01673 | pmid=23591719 | pmc=3628113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In vivo blockade of CD47 using an antisense [[morpholino]] increases survival of mice exposed to lethal total body irradiation due to increased proliferative capacity of bone marrow-derived cells and radioprotection of radiosensitive gastrointestinal tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep01038| title = Blockade of CD47 increases survival of mice exposed to lethal total body irradiation| journal = Scientific Reports| volume = 3| pages = 1038| year = 2013| last1 = Soto-Pantoja | first1 = D.

==== Lineage-specific enhancers ====
Differentiated [[macrophages]] can self-renew in tissues and expand long-term in culture.&lt;ref name="Maf"/&gt; Under certain conditions macrophages can divide without losing features they have acquired while specializing into [[immune cells]] – which is usually not possible with [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated cells]]. The macrophages achieve this by activating a [[Gene regulatory network|gene network]] similar to one found in embryonic stem cells. [[Single-cell analysis]] revealed that, ''in vivo'', proliferating macrophages can derepress a macrophage-specific enhancer repertoire associated with a gene network controlling self-renewal. This happened when concentrations of two transcription factors named [[MAFB (gene)|MafB]] and [[MAF (gene)|c-Maf]] were naturally low or were inhibited for a short time. Genetic manipulations that turned off MafB and c-Maf in the macrophages caused the cells to start a self-renewal program. The similar network also controls embryonic stem cell self-renewal but is associated with distinct embryonic stem cell-specific enhancers.&lt;ref name="Maflin"/&gt;

Hence macrophages isolated from MafB- and c-Maf-double deficient mice divide indefinitely; the self-renewal depends on [[Myc|c-Myc]] and [[KLF4|Klf4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gentek | first1 = R. | last2 = Molawi | first2 = K. | last3 = Sieweke | first3 = M.

Indirect lineage conversion is a reprogramming methodology in which somatic cells transition through a plastic intermediate state of partially reprogrammed cells (pre-iPSC), induced by brief exposure to reprogramming factors, followed by differentiation in a specially developed chemical environment (artificial niche).&lt;ref name="Kurian"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kurian | first1 = Leo | last2 = Sancho-Martinez | first2 = Ignacio | last3 = Nivet | first3 = Emmanuel | last4 = Juan | last5 = Izpisua Belmonte | first5 = Carlos | year = 2012 | title = Conversion of human fibroblasts to angioblast-like progenitor cells | url = http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.2255.html | journal = Nature Methods | volume =  10| issue = 1| pages =  77–83| doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2255 | pmid=23202434 | pmc=3531579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method could be both more efficient and safer, since it does not seem to produce tumors or other undesirable genetic changes and results in much greater yield than other methods. However, the safety of these cells remains questionable. Since lineage conversion from pre-iPSC relies on the use of iPSC reprogramming conditions, a fraction of the cells could acquire pluripotent properties if they do not stop the de-differentation process in vitro or due to further de-differentiation in vivo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = S.

=== Outer membrane glycoprotein ===

A common feature of pluripotent stem cells is the specific nature of protein [[glycosylation]] of their outer membrane. That distinguishes them from most nonpluripotent cells, although not [[white blood cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/cr.2011.148| pmid = 21894191| title = Specific lectin biomarkers for isolation of human pluripotent stem cells identified through array-based glycomic analysis| journal = Cell Research| volume = 21| issue = 11| pages = 1551–1563| year = 2011| last1 = Wang | first1 = Y.

Many [[stem cell marker]]s are based on cell surface glycan epitopes including the widely used markers [[Stage specific embryonic antigen 3|SSEA-3]], SSEA-4, Tra 1-60 and Tra 1-81.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5391.1145| pmid = 9804556| title = Embryonic Stem Cell Lines Derived from Human Blastocysts| journal = Science| volume = 282| issue = 5391| pages = 1145–1147| year = 1998| last1 = Thomson | first1 = J.

Furthermore, dedifferentiation of progenitor cells induced by ACA-dependent signaling pathway leads to ACA-induced pluripotent stem cells, capable of differentiating in vitro into cells of all three [[germ layers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becker-Kojič | first1 = ZA | last2 = Ureña-Peralta | first2 = JR | last3 = Zipančić | first3 = I. | last4 = Stojkovič | first4 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Activation of surface glycoprotein ACA induced pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258062404 | format = PDF | journal = Cell Technologies in Biology and Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 85–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The study of [[lectin]]s' ability to maintain a culture of pluripotent human stem cells has led to the discovery of lectin [[Erythrina crista-galli]] (ECA), which can serve as a simple and highly effective matrix for the cultivation of human pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mikkola |first=M. |year=2013|title=Human pluripotent stem cells: glycomic approaches for culturing and characterization |url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/37669 |isbn=978-952-10-8444-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reprogramming through a physical approach ===

[[Cell adhesion protein]] [[CDH1 (gene)|E-cadherin]] is indispensable for a robust pluripotent [[phenotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/embor.2011.88| pmid = 21617704| title = E-cadherin is crucial for embryonic stem cell pluripotency and can replace OCT4 during somatic cell reprogramming| journal = EMBO Reports| volume = 12| issue = 7| pages = 720–726| year = 2011| last1 = Redmer | first1 = T. | last2 = Diecke | first2 = S. | last3 = Grigoryan | first3 = T. | last4 = Quiroga-Negreira | first4 = A. | last5 = Birchmeier | first5 = W. | last6 = Besser | first6 = D. | pmc=3128971}}&lt;/ref&gt; During reprogramming for iPS cell generation, [[CDH2|N-cadherin]] can replace function of E-cadherin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.scr.2013.08.009| pmid = 24036274| title = Adhesion, but not a specific cadherin code, is indispensable for ES cell and induced pluripotency| journal = Stem Cell Research| volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = 1250–1263| year = 2013| last1 = Bedzhov | first1 = I. | last2 = Alotaibi | first2 = H. | last3 = Basilicata | first3 = M.

For example, neural progenitor cells can be generated from fibroblasts directly through a physical approach without introducing exogenous reprogramming factors.

Physical cues, in the form of parallel microgrooves on the surface of cell-adhesive substrates, can replace the effects of small-molecule epigenetic modifiers and significantly improve reprogramming efficiency. The mechanism relies on the mechanomodulation of the cells' epigenetic state. Specifically, "decreased histone deacetylase activity and upregulation of the expression of WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) – a subunit of H3 methyltranferase – by microgrooved surfaces lead to increased histone H3 acetylation and methylation". Nanofibrous scaffolds with aligned fibre orientation produce effects similar to those produced by microgrooves, suggesting that changes in cell morphology may be responsible for modulation of the epigenetic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nmat3777| pmid = 24141451| title = Biophysical regulation of epigenetic state and cell reprogramming| journal = Nature Materials| volume = 12| issue = 12| pages = 1154–1162| year = 2013| last1 = Downing | first1 = T.

Substrate rigidity is an important biophysical cue influencing neural induction and subtype specification. For example, soft substrates promote neuroepithelial conversion while inhibiting [[neural crest]] differentiation of hESCs in a [[Bone morphogenetic protein 4|BMP4]]-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies revealed a multi-targeted mechanotransductive process involving mechanosensitive [[SMAD (protein)|Smad]] [[phosphorylation]] and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, regulated by rigidity-dependent [[Hippo signaling pathway|Hippo]]/[[YAP1|YAP]] activities and [[actomyosin]] [[cytoskeleton]] integrity and [[contractility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = Yubing | last2 = Koh | last3 = Aw Yong | first3 = Meng | last4 = Villa-Diaz | first4 = Luis G. | last5 = Fu | first5 = Jianping | year = 2014 | title = Hippo/YAP-mediated rigidity-dependent motor neuron differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells | journal = Nature Materials | volume =  13| issue = 6| pages =  599–604| doi = 10.1038/nmat3945 | pmid=24728461 | pmc=4051885}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) undergo self-renewal in the presence of the [[cytokine]] [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF). Following LIF withdrawal, mESCs differentiate, accompanied by an increase in cell–substratum [[adhesion]] and cell spreading. Restricted cell spreading in the absence of LIF by either culturing mESCs on chemically defined, weakly adhesive biosubstrates, or by manipulating the [[cytoskeleton]] allowed the cells to remain in an undifferentiated and pluripotent state. The effect of restricted cell spreading on mESC self-renewal is not mediated by increased intercellular adhesion, as inhibition of mESC adhesion using a function blocking anti E-cadherin antibody or [[siRNA]] does not promote differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biocel.2013.07.001| title = The self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells is regulated by cell–substratum adhesion and cell spreading| journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology| volume = 45| issue = 11| pages = 2698–2705| year = 2013| last1 = Murray | first1 = P. | last2 = Prewitz | first2 = M. | last3 = Hopp | first3 = I. | last4 = Wells | first4 = N. | last5 = Zhang | first5 = H. | last6 = Cooper | first6 = A. | last7 = Parry | first7 = K.

Cells involved in the reprogramming process change morphologically as the process proceeds. This results in physical difference in adhesive forces among cells.

=== Oligodendrocyte precursor cells ===

Without [[myelin]] to insulate neurons, nerve signals quickly lose power. Diseases that attack myelin, such as multiple sclerosis, result in nerve signals that cannot propagate to nerve endings and as a consequence lead to cognitive, motor and sensory problems. Transplantation of [[oligodendrocyte]] precursor cells (OPCs), which can successfully create myelin sheaths around nerve cells, is a promising potential therapeutic response. Direct lineage conversion of mouse and rat fibroblasts into oligodendroglial cells provides a potential source of OPCs.

The team of scientists, who were led by Sheng Ding, used a cocktail of nine chemicals (9C) for transdifferentiation of human skin cells into beating heart cells. With this method, more than 97% of the cells began beating, a characteristic of fully developed, healthy heart cells. The chemically induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (ciCMs) uniformly contracted and resembled human cardiomyocytes in their transcriptome, epigenetic, and electrophysiological properties. When transplanted into infarcted mouse hearts, 9C-treated fibroblasts were efficiently converted to ciCMs and developed into healthy-looking heart muscle cells within the organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cao | first1 = Nan | last2 = Huang | first2 = Yu | last3 = Zheng | first3 = Jiashun | last4 = Srivastava | first4 = Deepak | last5 = Ding | first5 = Sheng | year = 2016 | title = Conversion of human fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes by small molecules | url = | journal = Science | volume =  352| issue = 6290| pages =  1216–1220| doi = 10.1126/science.aaf1502 | pmid = 27127239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This chemical reprogramming approach, after further optimization, may offer an easy way to provide the cues that induce heart muscle to regenerate locally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gladstone.org/about-us/news/scientists-turn-skin-cells-heart-cells-and-brain-cells-using-drugs?sf25398259=1  Scientists Turn Skin Cells into Heart Cells and Brain Cells Using Drugs].

In another study, [[ischemic cardiomyopathy]] in the murine infarction model was targeted by iPS cell transplantation.

Discovery of the mechanisms controlling the formation of cardiomyocytes led to the development of the drug ITD-1, which effectively clears the cell surface from [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-β]] receptor type II and selectively inhibits intracellular TGF-β signaling. It thus selectively enhances the differentiation of uncommitted [[mesoderm]] to cardiomyocytes, but not to vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells.&lt;ref name="Mercola"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2012.04.025| pmid = 22862949| title = Small Molecule-Mediated TGF-β Type II Receptor Degradation Promotes Cardiomyogenesis in Embryonic Stem Cells| journal = Cell Stem Cell| volume = 11| issue = 2| pages = 242–252| year = 2012| last1 = Willems | first1 = E. | last2 = Cabral-Teixeira | first2 = J. | last3 = Schade | first3 = D. | last4 = Cai | first4 = W. | last5 = Reeves | first5 = P. | last6 = Bushway | first6 = P.

One project seeded decellularized mouse hearts with human iPSC-derived multipotential cardiovascular progenitor cells. The introduced cells migrated, proliferated and differentiated in situ into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells to reconstruct the hearts. In addition, the heart's extracellular matrix (the substrate of heart scaffold) signalled the human cells into becoming the specialised cells needed for proper heart function. After 20 days of perfusion with growth factors, the engineered heart tissues started to beat again and were responsive to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ncomms3307| title = Repopulation of decellularized mouse heart with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells| journal = Nature Communications| volume = 4| year = 2013| last1 = Lu | first1 = T.

Reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) ''in situ'' represents a promising strategy for cardiac regeneration.

===Rejuvenation of the muscle stem cell===
The elderly often suffer from progressive [[muscle weakness]] and regenerative failure owing in part to elevated activity of the [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38α and p38β mitogen-activated kinase]] pathway in senescent skeletal muscle stem cells.

After transplantation into an immune-deficient mouse model of human liver failure, iMPC-Heps proliferated extensively and acquired levels of hepatocyte function similar to those of human primary adult hepatocytes. iMPC-Heps did not form tumours, most probably because they never entered a pluripotent state.

These results establish the feasibility of significant liver repopulation of mice with human hepatocytes generated in vitro, which removes a long-standing roadblock on the path to autologous liver cell therapy.

Cocktail of small molecules, [[Y-27632]], A-83-01 (a TGFβ kinase/activin receptor like kinase ([[ALK5]]) inhibitor), and CHIR99021 (potent inhibitor of  [[GSK-3]]), can convert rat and mouse mature hepatocytes in vitro into proliferative bipotent cells – CLiPs (chemically induced liver progenitors). CLiPs can differentiate into both mature hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells that can form functional ductal structures.  In long-term culture CLiPs did not lose their proliferative capacity and their hepatic differentiation ability, and can repopulate chronically injured liver tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Katsuda | first1 = T | last2 = Kawamata | first2 = M | last3 = Hagiwara | first3 = K | last4 = Takahashi | first4 = R | last5 = Yamamoto | first5 = Y | last6 = Camargo | first6 = FD | last7 = Ochiya | first7 = T | year = 2017| title = Conversion of Terminally Committed Hepatocytes to Culturable Bipotent Progenitor Cells with Regenerative Capacity | url = http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(16)30347-2 | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume =  20| issue = 1| pages = 41–55 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2016.10.007 | pmid = 27840021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insulin-producing cells ===
Complications of [[Diabetes mellitus]] such as [[cardiovascular diseases]], [[Diabetic retinopathy|retinopathy]], [[Diabetic neuropathy|neuropathy]], [[Diabetic nephropathy|nephropathy]] and peripheral circulatory diseases depend on [[Blood sugar regulation|sugar dysregulation]] due to lack of [[insulin]] from pancreatic [[beta cells]] and can be lethal if they are not treated. One of the promising approaches to understand and cure diabetes is to use pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PCSs (iPSCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abdelalim | first1 = E.

Unfortunately, human PSC-derived insulin-expressing cells resemble human fetal β cells rather than adult β cells. In contrast to adult β cells, fetal β cells seem functionally immature, as indicated by increased [[Basal rate|basal]] [[glucose]] secretion and lack of glucose stimulation and confirmed by [[RNA-seq]] of whose [[Transcription (genetics)|transcript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hrvatin | first1 = S. | last2 = O'Donnell | first2 = C.

=== Blood vessel cells ===

As blood vessels age, they often become abnormal in structure and function, thereby contributing to numerous age-associated diseases including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and atherosclerosis of arteries supplying the heart, brain and lower extremities. So, an important goal is to stimulate vascular growth for the [[collateral circulation]] to prevent the exacerbation of these diseases. Induced Vascular Progenitor Cells (iVPCs) are useful for cell-based therapy designed to stimulate coronary collateral growth. They were generated by partially reprogramming endothelial cells.&lt;ref name="Kurian" /&gt; The vascular commitment of iVPCs is related to the [[Genetic memory (biology)#Inherited epigenetic memory|epigenetic memory]] of endothelial cells, which engenders them as cellular components of growing blood vessels. That is why, when iVPCs were implanted into [[myocardium]], they engrafted in blood vessels and increased coronary collateral flow better than iPSCs, mesenchymal stem cells, or native endothelial cells.&lt;ref name="Chilian"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.250126| pmid = 22095729| title = Induction of Vascular Progenitor Cells from Endothelial Cells Stimulates Coronary Collateral Growth| journal = Circulation Research| volume = 110| issue = 2| pages = 241–252| year = 2011| last1 = Yin | first1 = L.| last2 = Ohanyan | first2 = V.| last3 = Fen Pung | first3 = Y.| last4 = Delucia | first4 = A.| last5 = Bailey | first5 = E.| last6 = Enrick | first6 = M.| last7 = Stevanov | first7 = K.| last8 = Kolz | first8 = C.

To treat infarction, it is important to prevent the formation of fibrotic scar tissue. This can be achieved in vivo by transient application of [[paracrine]] factors that redirect native heart progenitor stem cell contributions from scar tissue to cardiovascular tissue. For example, in a mouse myocardial infarction model, a single intramyocardial injection of human [[vascular endothelial growth factor A]] mRNA (VEGF-A modRNA), modified to escape the body's normal defense system, results in long-term improvement of heart function due to mobilization and redirection of epicardial progenitor cells toward cardiovascular cell types.&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/nbt.2682"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2682| pmid = 24013197| title = Modified mRNA directs the fate of heart progenitor cells and induces vascular regeneration after myocardial infarction| journal = Nature Biotechnology| volume = 31| issue = 10| pages = 898–907| year = 2013| last1 = Zangi | first1 = L. | last2 = Lui | first2 = K.

One clinically-applicable strategy for the derivation of functional platelets from human iPSC involves the establishment of stable immortalized megakaryocyte progenitor cell lines (imMKCLs) through [[doxycycline]]-dependent overexpression of [[BMI1]] and [[Bcl-xL|BCL-XL]]. The resulting imMKCLs can be expanded in culture over extended periods (4–5 months), even after [[cryopreservation]]. Halting the overexpression (by the removal of doxycycline from the medium) of c-MYC, [[BMI1]] and [[Bcl-xL|BCL-XL]] in growing imMKCLs led to the production of [[GP1BA|CD42b]]+ platelets with functionality comparable to that of native platelets on the basis of a range of assays in vitro and in vivo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2014.01.011| pmid = 24529595| title = Expandable Megakaryocyte Cell Lines Enable Clinically Applicable Generation of Platelets from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells| journal = Cell Stem Cell| volume = 14| issue = 4| pages = 535–548| year = 2014| last1 = Nakamura | first1 = S. | last2 = Takayama | first2 = N. | last3 = Hirata | first3 = S. | last4 = Seo | first4 = H. | last5 = Endo | first5 = H. | last6 = Ochi | first6 = K. | last7 = Fujita | first7 = K.

Thomas et al., describe a forward programming strategy relying on the concurrent exogenous expression of 3 transcription factors: [[GATA1]], [[FLI1]] and [[TAL1]]. The forward programmed [[megakaryocyte#Platelet release|megakaryocyte]]s proliferate and differentiate in culture for several months with megakaryocyte purity over 90% reaching up to 2x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; mature megakaryocytes per input hPSC. Functional platelets are generated throughout the culture allowing the prospective collection of several transfusion units from as few as one million starting hPSCs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/253670  Large scale production of megakaryocytes from human pluripotent stem cells by a chemically defined forward programming approach]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Immune cells ====

A specialised type of [[white blood cell]], known as [[cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic T]] [[lymphocytes]] (CTLs), are produced by the [[immune system]] and are able to recognise specific markers on the surface of various infectious or tumour cells, causing them to launch an attack to kill the harmful cells. Thence, immunotherapy with functional antigen-specific T cells has potential as a therapeutic strategy for combating many cancers and viral infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.iy.13.040195.002553| pmid = 7612234| title = Principles for Adoptive T Cell Therapy of Human Viral Diseases| journal = Annual Review of Immunology| volume = 13| pages = 545–586| year = 1995| last1 = Riddell | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = P. D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cell sources are limited, because they are produced in small numbers naturally and have a short lifespan.

A potentially efficient approach for generating antigen-specific CTLs is to revert mature immune T cells into iPSCs, which possess indefinite proliferative capacity in vitro and after their multiplication to coax them to redifferentiate back into T cells.&lt;ref name="Hiromitsu"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2012.11.002| pmid = 23290140| title = Generation of Rejuvenated Antigen-Specific T Cells by Reprogramming to Pluripotency and Redifferentiation| journal = Cell Stem Cell| volume = 12| issue = 1| pages = 114–126| year = 2013| last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Kaneko | first2 = S. | last3 = Kawana-Tachikawa | first3 = A. | last4 = Tajima | first4 = Y. | last5 = Goto | first5 = H. | last6 = Zhu | first6 = D. | last7 = Nakayama-Hosoya | first7 = K. | last8 = Iriguchi | first8 = S. | last9 = Uemura | first9 = Y. | last10 = Shimizu | first10 = T. | last11 = Takayama | first11 = N. | last12 = Yamada | first12 = D. | last13 = Nishimura | first13 = K. | last14 = Ohtaka | first14 = M. | last15 = Watanabe | first15 = N. | last16 = Takahashi | first16 = S. | last17 = Iwamoto | first17 = A. | last18 = Koseki | first18 = H. | last19 = Nakanishi | first19 = M. | last20 = Eto | first20 = K. | last21 = Nakauchi | first21 = H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawamoto"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2012.12.006| pmid = 23290135| title = Regeneration of Human Tumor Antigen-Specific T Cells from iPSCs Derived from Mature CD8+ T Cells| journal = Cell Stem Cell| volume = 12| issue = 1| pages = 31–36| year = 2013| last1 = Vizcardo | first1 = R. | last2 = Masuda | first2 = K. | last3 = Yamada | first3 = D. | last4 = Ikawa | first4 = T. | last5 = Shimizu | first5 = K. | last6 = Fujii | first6 = S.

=== Thymic epithelial cells rejuvenation ===
The [[thymus]] is the first organ to deteriorate as people age. This shrinking is one of the main reasons the immune system becomes less effective with age. Diminished expression of the [[thymic epithelial cell]] transcription factor [[FOXN1]] has been implicated as a component of the mechanism regulating age-related involution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guo | first1 = J. | last2 = Feng | first2 = Y. | last3 = Barnes | first3 = P. | last4 = Huang | first4 = F.

[[Clare Blackburn]] and colleagues show that established age-related thymic involution can be reversed by forced upregulation of just one transcription factor – FOXN1 in the thymic epithelial cells in order to promote [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]], proliferation and differentiation of these cells into fully functional thymic epithelium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bredenkamp | first1 = Nicholas | last2 = Nowell | first2 = Craig S. | last3 = Blackburn | first3 = C.

This rejuvenation and increased proliferation was accompanied by upregulation of genes that promote [[cell cycle]] progression ([[cyclin D1]], ΔN[[TP63|p63]], [[Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2#Isoforms|FgfR2IIIb]]) and that are required in the thymic epithelial cells to promote specific aspects of [[T cell]] development ([[DLL4|Dll4]], [[Stem cell factor|Kit]]l, [[CCL25|Ccl25]], [[Stromal cell-derived factor 1|Cxcl12]], [[CD40 (protein)|Cd40]], [[CD80|Cd80]], [[Cathepsin L1|Ctsl]], [[PAX1|Pax1]]).

==== Dedifferentiated adipocytes ====

[[Adipose]] tissue, because of its abundance and relatively less invasive harvest methods, represents a source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Unfortunately, liposuction aspirates are only 0.05% MSCs.&lt;ref name="Bieback"/&gt; However, a large amount of mature adipocytes, which in general have lost their proliferative abilities and therefore are typically discarded, can be easily isolated from the adipose cell suspension and dedifferentiated into [[lipid]]-free fibroblast-like cells, named dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells. DFAT cells re-establish active proliferation ability and express multipotent capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.5966/sctm.2013-0107| pmid = 24396033| title = Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived from Mouse and Human White Mature Adipocytes| journal = Stem Cells Translational Medicine| volume = 3| issue = 2| pages = 161–171| year = 2014| last1 = Jumabay | first1 = M.| last2 = Abdmaulen | first2 = R.| last3 = Ly | first3 = A.| last4 = Cubberly | first4 = M.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with adult stem cells, DFAT cells show unique advantages in abundance, isolation and homogeneity. Under proper induction culture in vitro or proper environment in vivo, DFAT cells could demonstrate adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic and myogenic potentials. They could also exhibit perivascular characteristics and elicit neovascularization.&lt;ref name="Cinti"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/stem.1067| pmid = 22367678| title = Human Dedifferentiated Adipocytes Show Similar Properties to Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells| journal = Stem Cells| volume = 30| issue = 5| pages = 965–974| year = 2012| last1 = Poloni | first1 = A. | last2 = Maurizi | first2 = G. | last3 = Leoni | first3 = P. | last4 = Serrani | first4 = F. | last5 = Mancini | first5 = S. | last6 = Frontini | first6 = A. | last7 = Zingaretti | first7 = M.

=== Chondrogenic cells ===

[[Cartilage]] is the connective tissue responsible for frictionless joint movement. Its degeneration ultimately results in complete loss of joint function in the late stages of [[osteoarthritis]]. As an avascular and hypocellular tissue, cartilage has a limited capacity for self-repair. [[Chondrocyte]]s are the only cell type in cartilage, in which they are surrounded by the extracellular matrix that they secrete and assemble.

One method of producing cartilage is to induce it from iPS cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1089/ten.teb.2012.0757| pmid = 23957872| pmc = 4123466| title = Generating Cartilage Repair from Pluripotent Stem Cells| journal = Tissue Engineering Part B: Reviews| volume = 20| issue = 4| pages = 131030093023007| year = 2013| last1 = Cheng | first1 = A. | last2 = Hardingham | first2 = T. E. | last3 = Kimber | first3 = S. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is possible to convert fibroblasts directly into induced chondrogenic cells (iChon) without an intermediate iPS cell stage, by inserting three reprogramming factors (c-MYC, KLF4 and SOX9).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0077365| pmid = 24146984| title = Direct Induction of Chondrogenic Cells from Human Dermal Fibroblast Culture by Defined Factors| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 8| issue = 10| pages = e77365| year = 2013| last1 = Outani | first1 = H. | last2 = Okada | first2 = M. | last3 = Yamashita | first3 = A. | last4 = Nakagawa | first4 = K. | last5 = Yoshikawa | first5 = H. | last6 = Tsumaki | first6 = N. | pmc=3797820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human iChon cells expressed marker genes for chondrocytes (type II collagen) but not fibroblasts.

Implanted into defects created in the articular cartilage of rats, human iChon cells survived to form cartilaginous tissue for at least four weeks, with no tumors. The method makes use of c-MYC, which is thought to have a major role in tumorigenesis and employs a [[retrovirus]] to introduce the reprogramming factors, excluding it from unmodified use in human therapy.&lt;ref name="Hiromitsu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crompton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crompton009"/&gt;

This epigenetic memory does not necessarily manifest itself at the pluripotency stage – iPSCs derived from different tissues exhibit proper morphology, express pluripotency markers and are able to differentiate into the three embryonic layers in vitro and in vivo. However, this epigenetic memory may manifest during re-differentiation into specific cell types that require the specific loci bearing residual epigenetic marks.

The '''International Network for Social Network Analysis''' ('''INSNA''') is a professional [[learned society|academic association]] of researchers and practitioners of [[social network analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intute.ac.uk/socialsciences/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=sosig1059997247-25098 Intute: Social Sciences], [[Intute]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Members have interests in social networks as a new theoretical paradigm, in methodological developments, and in a variety of applications of different types of [[social networks]] approaches, [[Social Networking Software|social network software]], and [[social networking]]. 

==History==
INSNA was founded in 1977 by [[Barry Wellman]], a [[sociologist]]. A key function of the organization was to provide a sense of identity for a set of researchers who were widely dispersed geographically and across scientific disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~wellman/vita/index.html Barry Wellman] biography: ''Netlab'' at the [[University of Toronto]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellman served as "coordinator" of INSNA until 1988, when he passed the baton to Al Wolfe, an anthropologist at the University of South Florida. Wolfe in turn passed the leadership to Steve Borgatti, who served from 1993 to 1999. Borgatti incorporated INSNA as a legal entity, creating bylaws and establishing the positions of President, Vice-President and Treasurer. A full chronology of INSNA leadership is as follows:

Shortly after INSNA was founded, Linton C. Freeman founded the association's flagship journal, [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/social-networks Social Networks], in 1978. In 1981, the annual Sunbelt Conference was founded by Al Wolfe and H. Russel Bernard. Initially, the conference was independent of the association, but was brought under INSNA's auspices by Steve Borgatti in the 1990s.

As of 2018, INSNA has approximately 1,000 active members, while the SOCNET&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insna.org/socnet.html|title=INSNA: SOCNET|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; listserv has about 3700 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lists.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/wa?INDEX|title=UFL LISTSERV Archives|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As well as publishing a triannual journal [[Connections (journal)|Connections]] on the subject, INSNA also:

*Runs SOCNET, a listserv mailing-list for the subject.
*Hosts the International Sunbelt Social Network Conference annually.&lt;ref&gt;Annual [http://www.insna.org/INSNA/sunbelt_inf.html International Sunbelt Social Network Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522115911/http://www.insna.org/INSNA/sunbelt_inf.html |date=2007-05-22 }}: [[INSNA]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; See list below.
*Facilitates regional and specialized conferences.
*Publishes a quarterly journal, ''Social Networks''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505596/description#description Social Networks], quarterly journal.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Publishes the online ''Journal of Social Structure'', irregular periodicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmu.edu/joss/ Journal of Social Structure], online journal, irregular periodicity.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Provides links to researchers around the world.
*Provides raw data.

==Sunbelt Conference==
:The official conference of the association is the Sunbelt Conference, held annually in a wide variety of international locations. The first Sunbelt conference was organised by Alvin Wolfe and H. Russell Bernard in Tampa, FL. Initially, it was decreed to alternate US coasts, in order to spread travel costs on the part of participants from different regions. However, in 1994, it was decided to incorporate the European network conference, which had been held in parallel with Sunbelt. Starting 1995, Sunbelt observed a 3-year rotation of Europe, west coast, and east coast. Starting with the 2nd Sunbelt, Sunbelt featured a Keynote address by a prominent member of the community. In the 1990s, the keynote speakers were also recognized with the Georg Simmel Distinguished Career Award.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2282">'''Intrinsic aging''' and '''extrinsic aging''' are terms used to describe [[cutaneous]] aging of the [[skin]] and other parts of the [[integumentary system]], which while having [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[wikt: concomitant|concomitants]], seems to primarily involve the [[dermis]].&lt;ref&gt;YU RJ, Van Scott EJ: Alpha-hydroxy Acids: Science and Therapeutic Use. ''A Sup to Cosmetic Dermatology'', Oct 1994. 1(1):1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Intrinsic aging is influenced by internal physiological factors alone, and extrinsic aging by many external factors.  Intrinsic aging is also called ''chronologic aging'', and extrinsic aging is most often referred to as ''photoaging''.

== Causes and effects ==
The effects of ''intrinsic aging'' are caused primarily by internal factors alone.  It is sometimes referred to as chronological aging and is an inherent degenerative process due to declining physiologic functions and capacities.  Such an aging process may include qualitative and quantitative changes and includes diminished or defective synthesis of [[collagen]] and [[elastin]] in the dermis.

''Extrinsic aging'' of skin is a distinctive declination process caused by external factors, which include ultra-violet radiation, cigarette smoking, air pollution, among others.  Of all extrinsic causes, radiation from sunlight has the most widespread documentation of its negative effects on the skin.  Because of this, extrinsic aging is often referred to as photoaging.&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrest BA: Overview of skin aging.  ''J Cut Aging &amp; Cos Derm'' 1(1):1-2, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klingman AM, Klingman LH: Photoaging.

''J Cuta Aging &amp; Cos Derm 1(1):13-26, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photoaging]] may be defined as skin changes caused by chronic exposure to UV light.  '''Photodamage''', implies changes beyond those associated with aging alone, defined as cutaneous damage caused by chronic exposure to solar radiation and is associated with emergence of [[neoplastic lesions]].

'''Jean-Pierre Pescatore '''(11 March 1793 - 9 December 1855)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fondation.lu/Fr/Fondation/textes--jean-pierre-pescatore-biographie-succinct|title=Jean-Pierre PESCATORE – Biographie succinct|website=www.fondation.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Luxembourgish-French businessman, banker, art collector, and philanthropist.

==Early life==
Born in [[Luxembourg City]] as the fourth child of Dominique Pescatore, a merchant in the city, and Marie-Madelaine Geschwind, he came from a family of colonial commodity traders, originally from [[Ticino]], who had settled in Luxembourg in 1736. In 1811, at the age of 18, he enlisted in the army of [[Napoleon]]. Promoted to ''[[Maréchal des logis]]'' in 1813, after several campaigns he deserted and returned to Luxembourg in 1814.

He then entered the world of business and took to selling tobacco like his father and grandfather. Together with his brother Antoine, he was the director from 1814 to 1816 and then again from 1822 to 1844 of the tobacco factory in the [[Fishmarket]] neighbourhood which had been founded by their grandfather Jules Joseph Antoine Pescatore.

==Marriages==
In 1816 he married Marguerite Beving,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and settled with her in Luxembourg City. She died of illness, and without children, in June 1821.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1837 Pescatore met the Swiss Anne-Cathérine Weber, with whom he lived together and whom he married in 1851 in the church (but not civilly), in order to render this relation acceptable to the public. Due to this confusion there were arguments after his death about the inheritance.

==Move to France==
In 1817 he received long-term permission from the French authorities to import Havana tobacco to France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pescatore's good relations with the ''Régie française des tabacs'', the Belgian annexation of the French-speaking part of Luxembourg in 1839, and Luxembourg's accession to the [[Zollverein]] (the German customs union), exposing Luxembourgish tobacco manufacturing to strong competition from abroad, were damaging to Pescatore's business interests in the Grand-Duchy. He therefore established himself in [[Paris]], in order to concentrate solely on the French markets, and would become a naturalised French citizen on 3 September 1846. In addition to trading in tobacco, he also dabbled in finance, founding the bank "J.P. Pescatore et Cie" on 27 December 1844 with the Austrian Frédéric Adolphe Grieninger.

==Property and hobbies==
On 11 August 1844 he bought the [[Chateau de la Celle Saint-Cloud|Château de la Celle Saint-Cloud]] from the Viscount de Morel-Vindé's heirs.&lt;nowiki/&gt; In 1849 he also bought a vineyard at [[Médoc]], near [[Giscours]]. In 1852 he became mayor of [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]], which he remained until his death.

Jean-Pierre Pescatore had various hobbies, including collecting works of art, rare plant specimens and breeding horses. He acquired paintings and drawings from prestigious backgrounds, such as the galleries of the [[King of the Netherlands]] and of [[Louis Philippe I]]. He amassed more than 800 plant specimens, including a collection of the first [[orchid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in France, with the help of [[Jean Linden]]. The latter named a publication with orchids from his collection, ''Pescatorea. ''[[Empress Eugénie]], and her husband [[Napoleon III]], came to see the collection twice. Pescatore renovated his château to house his fragile plants, constructing an orangery and three greenhouses. He became president of the horticultural society of Seine-et-Oise and of the floral society of Versailles. A recipient of the [[Légion d'honneur]], in 1852 he was also appointed Consul-General of the Netherlands. He died on 9 December 1855 at his Paris house, and was buried in [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]]. He left the considerable sum of 10 millions francs. Without a direct heir, his inheritance was the subject of a dispute between his partner, Anne Catherine Weber, and his other heirs.

Finally, the Château de La Celle was awarded to his niece, Elisabeth (Lily) Dutreux-Pescatore, with [[usufruct]] for life to Anne Catherine Weber. The heirs of Pescatore-Dutreux owned the château until 1951.

In 1940, [[Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg]] stopped at the Château de la Celle Saint-Cloud for a few days, while fleeing the German [[invasion of Luxembourg]]. The Germans then occupied the castle until August 1944. After the liberation of France, Auguste Dutreux regained his property. He donated the castle and its gardens, to the [[French Foreign Ministry]] on 7 February 1951, which still owns it today.

==Legacy==
In 1853 he donated half a million francs to Luxembourg City, in order to build an old people's home, the later ''Fondation Pescatore'', opened in 1892. The city also received his art collection, housed in the Musée Jean-Pierre Pescatore, on the first floor of the town hall. In 1953 it was moved to the [[Villa Vauban]].

In 2005 the Luxembourgish postal service put out a stamp commemorating his philanthropy in the Grand Duchy. Two streets are also named after him, one in La Celle Saint-Cloud and one in Luxembourg.

The '''Marine Station of Endoume''' is an [[oceanography]] and [[marine biology]] research institute located in [[Marseille]] (France). It was founded in 1882 by [[Antoine-Fortuné Marion]] (1846–1900). It is today one of the sites for the joint research unit IMBE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imbe.fr/|title=IMBE website|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Mediterranean Institute of marine and terrestrial Biodiversity and Ecology) hosting research teams from [[Aix-Marseille University]] and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]. 

== History ==
The first [[marine biology]] laboratory in France outside Paris was founded in [[Marseille]] in 1869. The project to build a marine station in [[Marseille]] was initiated by its director [[Antoine-Fortuné Marion]] in 1872 and accepted in 1882. The station was built between 1883 and 1889, on the site of an old artillery battery in the neighbourhood of [[Endoume]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marion|first=A.-F.|year=1897|title=La Station zoologique d’Endoume-Marseille|journal=Revue générale internationale scientifique, littéraire et artistique|volume=14|pages=179–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first scientific studies started in the summer of 1889. 

In 1891, the first public aquarium in Marseille opened at the marine station; in 1894, a marine natural reserve was created right in front of the marine station&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romano|first=R.|year=1996|title=Histoire d’une station marine à Marseille : origine, naissance, développement (1869–1983)|journal=Master thesis, Université Aix-Marseille 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A-F Marion was director of the station until his death in 1900.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4262">The '''Medientage München''' (Munich Media Days) are held annually in [[Munich]] as a congress of the communications industry. An exhibition is organized and occurs at the same time. Every year in October, media entrepreneurs, media makers, and media politicians meet for three days. In 2015 more than 6,200 participants attended the congress, exhibition and events around the Medientage München.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presseportal.de/pm/61644/3155621 | title=MEDIENTAGE MÜNCHEN 2015 mit mehr als 6.200 Besuchern | author= | date=23 October 2015 | website=presseportal.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medientage München 2015 took place from 21 to 23 October, at the [[Internationales Congress Center München|International Congress Center (ICM)]] of [[Messe München]] with the support from the [[Bavaria|Bavarian State]] and the ''Bavarian Regulatory Authority for Commercial Broadcasting'' (Bayerische Landeszentrale für neue Medien – BLM).

== History ==
Medientage München were founded in 1987 by Wolf-Dieter Ring and [[Edmund Stoiber]] (both members of the [[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|State Chancellery]] at the time), on behalf of the Bavarian government. The event is intended to bring private radio and television broadcasters, newspaper and magazine publishers, together with public broadcasters in joint discussions. The discussion topics range from current media policies relating to [[advertising]], to [[marketing]] and program quality issues in regards to the protection of minors. The Medientage München GmbH is the organizer of the congress since 1999. Managing directors are Reiner Müller, Johannes Kors and Christopher Tusch. The GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bavarian Regulatory Authority for Commercial Broadcasting (BLM).

== Congress ==
The Medientage München are considered one of the most important events of the [[Germany|German]] media industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wuv.de/medien/medientage_2012_die_neuen_gesetze_der_medienwelt | title= Medientage 2012: Die neuen Gesetze der Medienwelt | author=Katharina Hannen | date=27 July 2012 | website= | publisher=Werben &amp;Verkaufen | language=German | accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speakers are from the television, radio, print and mobile, and digital business industries, along with advertisers, media politicians and filmmakers. To kick-off the Medientage München, the [[List of Ministers-President of Bavaria|Minister-President of Bavaria]] opens the event with the ''Mediengipfel'' (Media Summit).

== Media exhibition ==
At the exhibition, which is held at the same time, presentations from companies, institutions, and initiatives from media and communication industries can be found. On the grounds of the ''MedienCampus Bayern'', media training centers, journalism schools and employers in the media industry present themselves. Young professionals can find out about education and training for the media industry.

== Other events ==
Alongside the event is the “Nacht der Medien” ("Night of the media").

In addition to the central meeting point of the Medientage München, the Medientage München GmbH organizes further events to assist the communication industry – including the Audiovisual Media Days (AVMD): A congress for motion pictures media, marketing and corporate communication, that is held annually in Munich. Where some 400 representatives of the motion picture industry meet to report on trends surrounding online video, smart and web TV.

Additionally are the Munich Gaming and the Medientage Special (Media Days Special).

'''Mikhail Naumovich Epstein''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Нау́мович Эпште́йн}}; or Epshtein, born April 21, 1950) is a Russian-American literary theorist and critical thinker. Mikhail Epstein is Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Cultural Theory and Russian Literature at Emory University, USA. He worked as Professor of Russian and Cultural Theory at Durham University, UK, in 2012–2015. He moved from the USSR (Moscow) to the USA (Atlanta) in 1990 and from the USA to England (Durham) in 2012 and then back to Atlanta, to resume teaching at Emory, in 2015. He was founder and director of Centre for Humanities Innovation at Durham University &lt;ref&gt;[Centre for Humanities Innovation at Durham University] [https://www.dur.ac.uk/chi/]&lt;/ref&gt; (2012–2015).

His areas of specialization include [[postmodernism]], cultural and literary theory; the history of [[Russian literature]]  (particularly Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Platonov and 20th century poetry) and intellectual history; contemporary philosophical and religious thought;  new methods and interdisciplinary approaches in the humanities; semiotics, language evolution and neologisms; and ideas and electronic media. Professor Epstein is also an expert on Russian philosophy of the 19th and 20th century and on thinkers like [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]. He writes essays on cultural, social, ethical and international issues.

==Biography==
Epstein was born in [[Moscow]], of [[Jew]]ish heritage. He graduated from the philological faculty of Moscow State University in 1972. He was a member of Soviet Writers Union since 1978 and the founder and director of the Laboratory of Contemporary Culture in Moscow (1988–89).

He moved to the USA in 1990 and was fellow of Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ([[Washington D.C.]]) in 1990–1991. He joined Emory faculty in 1990. In 1992–1994 he received grant from National Council for Soviet and East European Research to work on the history of Russian thought of the late Soviet period. He has authored InteLnet (Intellectual network, 1995) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/intelnet2.html inteLnet]&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other interdisciplinary web sites in the humanities.

One of his major continuing  projects is "On the Future of the Humanities: Paradigmatic Shifts and Emerging Concepts" on which he worked as an inaugural senior fellow at the Center for Humanistic Inquiry (Emory University, 2002–03)and as a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study at Durham University (2011). He had visiting professor appointments at Wesleyan University (1990) and University of Oregon at  Eugene (2002).

Mikhail Epstein has won national and international prizes, including Andrei Bely prize ([[St. Petersburg]], 1991); The Social Innovations Award 1995 from the Institute for Social Inventions (London) for his electronic Bank of New Ideas; the International Essay Contest set up by [[Lettre International]] and Weimar – Cultural City of Europe 1999; and Liberty Prize, awarded for his outstanding contribution in the development of Russian-American cultural connections (New York, 2000).

Epstein maintains blogs on "Facebook", "Snob" and "Live Journal" networks, where, in particular, since 2007 he conducts and reports "СЛОВО ГОДА" – a [[Word of the year (Russia)|Russian-language "Word of the Year"]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://snob.ru/profile/27356/blog/101993 "СЛОВО ГОДА-2015. ИТОГИ ВЫБОРОВ" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas and Terms==

In the realm of [[aesthetics]], Epstein (together with poet and conceptual artist [[Dmitry Prigov]]) is credited with introducing the concept of "[[new sincerity]]" (''novaia iskrennost'') as a response to the dominant sense of absurdity in late [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[post-Soviet]] culture.&lt;ref name="Yurchak"&gt;[[Alexei Yurchak]], "Post-Post-Communist Sincerity: Pioneers, Cosmonauts, and Other Soviet Heroes Born Today," in Thomas Lahusen and Peter H. Solomon, eds., ''What Is Soviet Now?: Identities, Legacies, Memories'' (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2008), {{ISBN|978-3-8258-0640-8}}, p.258-59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3GonhERyzwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA258,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Epstein's words, "Postconceptualism, or the New Sincerity, is an experiment in resuscitating "fallen," dead languages with a renewed pathos of love, sentimentality and enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Epstein, "A Catalogue of New Poetries," in Mikhail Epstein, Aleksandr Genis, Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, eds., ''Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture'' (Berghahn Books, 1999), {{ISBN|978-1-57181-098-4}}, p. 146, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5qjzj3JwaoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA146,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his exploration of contemporary spirituality, Epstein focuses on the concept of "post-atheism," or "minimal [or poor] religion," discussed in particular in his correspondence with the Protestant thinker Thomas Altizer and extensively examined in Charles Taylor's book "The Secular Age" (2007) that refers to Epstein's innovative work.

Mikhail Epstein has coined a number of new concepts and terms (in English and in Russian) that now circulate on tens of thousands of websites in various branches of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|title=The Transformative Humanities: A Manifesto|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-6094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mycoforestry''' is an ecological [[forest management]] system implemented to enhance [[Forest ecology|forest ecosystems]] and plant communities through the introduction of [[mycorrhiza]]l and [[saprotroph]]ic [[fungi]]. Mycoforestry is considered a type of [[permaculture]]&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Zev. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/It%27s+good+to+grow+mushrooms:+Zev+Friedman+dishes+the+dirt+on+...-a0199193902 Digging In.] ''New Life Journal.'' 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be implemented as a beneficial component of an [[agroforestry]] system. Mycoforestry can enhance the yields of tree crops and produce [[edible mushroom]]s, an economically valuable product. By integrating plant-fungal associations into a forestry management system, native forests can be preserved, wood waste can be recycled back into the ecosystem, planted restoration sites are enhanced, and the sustainability of forest ecosystems are improved.&lt;ref name="stamets"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mycelium running: how mushrooms can help save the world |last=Stamets |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Stamets |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |location= |isbn=1-58008-579-2 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPI8_-omzvsC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=mycoforestry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=38pC71hh3O&amp;sig=vBOBS8Y0GcqUh40HyBiUGjwv8lk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I0mSS9zwB4OKNNHCwI8N&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=mycoforestry&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mycoforestry is an alternative to the practice of [[clearcutting]], which removes dead wood from forests, thereby diminishing nutrient availability and reducing soil depth.&lt;ref name="dahlgren"&gt;Dahlgren, R. A.; Driscoll, C. T. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/h523755w4m857t85/ The effects of whole-tree clear-cutting on soil processes at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA.] ''Plant and Soil.'' Volume 158, Number 2 / January 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection of fungal species==

According to [[Paul Stamets]], the first principle for the creation of a mycoforestry system is to utilize native fungal species.  Implementing a mycoforestry system provides the potential of improving restoration efforts and the possibility of economic gain through mushroom cropping and harvesting.  However to utilize native fungal flora, first the relationships between present fungal species and growth substrate, and habitat need to be studied.

A simple way to introduce a mycoforestry system and enhance out-plantings for crops and forest restoration sites is to "use mycorrhizal spore inoculum when replanting forest lands"&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt; For this process it is best to match native trees with native mycorrhizal fungi.  This method keeps and will promote the functioning of the native ecosystem, and native biodiversity.  

It is assumed in a functioning forest ecosystem an underground mycelial network persists even if no fruiting bodies are visible.&lt;ref name="frankland"&gt;Frankland, Juliet C. [http://fungus.org.uk/nwfg/mycapr97.htm All you ever wanted to know about Mycelium.] ''NWFG Newsletter.'' April 1997. (ISSN 1465-8054) Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A period of disappearance of mushrooms from an area should not cause alarm.  In order to trigger the formation of fruiting bodies, many fungal species require specific environmental conditions.  Most species of fungi do not fruit year round.

Mycoforestry is an emergent scientific field and practice.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt; Until broadly standardized protocols are created and perfected, the collection of both current and historical ecological site conditions will improve the success of the project.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt; Therefore, a survey of fungal relations at the site under both prime and poor conditions is beneficial to implementation of a mycoforestry system.

==Saprotrophic fungi==
[[File:Und wieder Pilze.JPG|thumb|right|Edible oyster mushrooms (''[[Pleurotus]]'' sp.) fruiting from a stump]]

The second principle is to promote saprotrophic fungi in the environment.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt; Saprophytic fungi are crucial to mycoforestry systems because these are the primary composers breaking down wood and returning nutrients to the soil for use by the rest of the forest ecosystem.  This can be accomplished through inoculation of wood debris at site. Spored oils can be used in chainsaws when problematic or invasive hardwood requires felling. This method is a simple means to inoculate a tree.   Additionally plug spawn can be implemented and injected into wood mass again prompting colonization by the selected fungus.  Eventually repeated colonization efforts should not be necessary as many fungal life forms are strong and will spread and sustain in the soil on their own.&lt;ref name="frankland"/&gt;

In management of the mycoforestry system it is important that [[coarse woody debris|dead wood]] be in contact with the ground.  This allows fungus to reach up from the soil and decompose fallen wood releasing nutrients at a much quicker rate then if the wood is left standing.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt;  Additionally it is important to leave dead wood on site for decomposition back into the soil.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt;  This philosophy is similarly based to the fact that clear cutting of a forest reduces soil nutrients and thickness.&lt;ref name="dahlgren"/&gt;

==Beneficial fungal interactions==
[[File:Armillaria mellea 620.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Armillaria]]'', a [[parasitic]] fungus]]

The third principal is to implement species known to benefit plant species.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt;  These are commonly mycorrhizal fungus that form long term associations with plants, often extending inside of plants roots acting as an additional root system providing for better absorption of nutrients and water. 

Utilizing mushroom species that attract insects could be a useful source of fish food.  This practice makes the mycoforestry a larger system. Unlike most agriculture systems it helps the environment in a number of ways. It ties all biological aspects of the environment together, creating sustainable living and food production as well as sustainable fisheries similar to the ancient Hawaiian Ahupua'a, which utilized sustainable all portions of the land for environmental and food security.

Additionally fungal species can be implemented that compete with disease causing agents like [[Armillaria root rot]]s&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt; to provide long term protection of the forestry system. 

Additionally, the implementation of an agroforestry system performs [[mycoremediation]] and [[mycofiltration]] activities cleaning up toxins and restoring the environment.

'''Neosymbolism''' is a movement current in the [[visual arts]] genre.  Active in the movement are artists in the United States, Denmark, the [[Czech Republic]], and Canada.

== Philosophy ==
The core philosophy of Neosymbolism, like that of its predecessor [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], is the idea of "correspondences", the "emblematic order" of a world in which technology and the industrial reality have not yet drowned the forces of mysticism and belief. In a world where visual images exist to generate sales and revenue, Neosymbolist imagery attempts to preserve the relationship between image and the human soul. The imagery is necessarily representational rather than abstract. It borders on the narrative, but stops short of the commercial trap of illustration to convey an idea for profit. Artists like [[Norman Rockwell]] could qualify as Neosymbolist painters in that they adopt a social and cultural undercurrent and then convey it in terms of the cultural cliche—the image as representative of core aspects of the culture. The same is not true, however, of the generally accepted idea of commercial illustration which attempts more to influence cultural, political, and economic ideology than it tries to communicate an existential reality.

Neosymbolism is fairly well-hidden within the culture, with few references and almost no broad-based visibility. In 1988, Nick A_Demos published a book in two editions. This was  the first visible sign of an idea underlying a Neosymbolist philosophy. A_Demos then developed this first book of Neosymbolism into paintings. He was also the first to use the word "Neosymbolism", thus coining it.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There has also been a separate group using the Neosymbolism name for the creation of an international collective representing a number of artists who share the goals of preserving the visual art of Symbolism (the foundation of the ideas associated with the term Neosymbolism) in its original and essential sense. This preservation, as opposed to the "non-sense" of various philosophies that have evolved since the late nineteenth century and have deviated from the core Symbolist philosophy.
  
The Neosymbolist movement was born spontaneously in numerous locations across the globe. Many groups use the word but also do not want to be limited to only this discipline. A group of Danish Neosymbolists defined their movement thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arrkunst.webbyen.dk/vishjemmeside_privat.asp?mode=top_frame&amp;id=614394&amp;side=&amp;webside=4222305 |title=webbyen.dk |date=2011-07-19 |access-date=2017-02-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132848/http://www.arrkunst.webbyen.dk/vishjemmeside_privat.asp?mode=top_frame&amp;id=614394&amp;side=&amp;webside=4222305 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
* Using Iconic language in their expressions
* Reproducing the inner experience of the outer world  
* Examining the human experience and circumstance in today’s changing world
* Examining the underlying meaning of life
* Using media in conscious and innovative ways

The founder of the Canadian Neosymbolists, meanwhile, describes the foundations of their movement in ''Brief Summary of the Foundations of Canadian Neosymbolism,''{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} written by their founder, Gary F. Manzo.

* Using Symbolic language in our expressions, often derived from Dream Sequences and Archetypal Imagery as described by Carl Jung, and others involved with Mysticism, Alchemy, Depth Psychology and Philosophy. 
* Depicting the inner experience of the outer world, in relationship to Self-Actualization and Depth Psychology and related fields of study. 
* Examining the human experience and circumstance in today’s changing world, with the idea that mankind must “make friends with his animal nature” in order to achieve Wholeness of SELF in a contemporary world. 
* Examining the underlying meaning of life, both from an historical perspective and its relevancy to the new age of Technology as well as New Age Psychology. 
* Using mediums and techniques, in conscious, experimental and innovative ways, utilizing both traditional methods and contemporary cutting-edge techniques and technologies.

Another international Neosymbolist collective that began exhibiting as a group in 2001 has a simpler definition:
 
- The "exploration of the emotional, political, and spiritual themes of the rapidly changing culture of the late 20th and early 21st (century) through the use of symbols both personal and universal."{{cite quote|date=April 2015}}
  
This perspective of the Neosymbolist movement can be seen as a reaction against abstraction, an attempt to weave artists’ intellectual and spiritual experiences into the fabric of their work. Furthermore, the Neosymbolists’ palette is not limited to the use of words and ancient symbols of ideas, even as these remain powerful tools of expression.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The university has an extensive student life program, with over 1,000 student organizations; intercollegiate, club and recreational sports programs; student media organizations and publications, [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities and sororities]]; and three student governments. Ohio State athletic teams compete in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] ([[Football Bowl Subdivision]] for football) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and are known as the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]]. Athletes from Ohio State have won 100 Olympic medals ([[List of American universities with Olympic medals|44 gold, 35 silver, and 21 bronze]]). The university is a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]] for the majority of sports. The [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey|Ohio State men's ice hockey]] program competes in the [[Big Ten Conference]], while its [[Ohio State Buckeyes women's ice hockey|women's hockey]] program competes in the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]]. In addition, the OSU men's volleyball team is a member of the [[Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] (MIVA). OSU is one of only 14 universities that plays Division I FBS football and Division I ice hockey.

{{as of|2017|August}}, the university had awarded a total of 747,216 degrees.&lt;ref name="Statistical Summary"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Ohio State University}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}
The proposal of a manufacturing and agriculture university in central Ohio was initially met in the 1870s with hostility from the state's agricultural interests and competition for resources from [[Ohio University]], which was chartered by the [[Northwest Ordinance]], and [[Miami University]]. Championed by the [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] [[Stalwart (politics)|stalwart]] Governor [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], The Ohio State University was founded in 1870 as a [[land-grant university]] under the [[Morrill Act of 1862]] as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. The school was originally within a farming community on the northern edge of Columbus. While some interests in the state had hoped the new university would focus on matriculating students of various agricultural and mechanical disciplines, Hayes manipulated both the university's location and its initial board of trustees towards a more comprehensive end.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The university opened its doors to 24 students on September 17, 1873. In 1878, the first class of six men graduated. The first woman graduated the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio State History and Traditions|url=https://news.osu.edu/history.html|publisher=The Ohio State University|accessdate=July 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216131558/http://news.osu.edu/history.html|archive-date=February 16, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1878, in light of its expanded focus, the Ohio legislature changed the name to "The Ohio State University", with "The" as part of its official name.&lt;ref name="arl.org"&gt;The government of Ohio, in its official web site listing the state's compiled laws: "3335.01 The Ohio State University. The educational institution originally designated as the Ohio agricultural and mechanical college shall be known as "The Ohio State University." http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3335&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohio State began accepting graduate students in the 1880s, and in 1891, the school saw the founding of its law school, Moritz College of Law. It would later acquire colleges of medicine, dentistry, optometry, veterinary medicine, commerce, and journalism in subsequent years. In 1916, Ohio State was elected into membership in the [[Association of American Universities]].

[[Michael V. Drake]], former chancellor of the [[University of California, Irvine]], became the 15th president of The Ohio State University on June 30, 2014.

==Campus==
[[File:OSU William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library East Atrium.JPG|thumb|The East Atrium at the William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library]]
Ohio State's {{convert|1,764|acre|adj=on}} main campus is about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} north of the city's downtown. The historical center of campus is the Oval, a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quad]] of about {{convert|11|acre|adj=off}}.&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.osu.edu/find/collections/the-ohio-state-university-archives/digitalcontent/faqs#7|title=FAQs|website=University Libraries|publisher=The Ohio State University|access-date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four buildings are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]: Hale Hall (originally Enarson Hall), [[University, Hayes and Orton Halls|Hayes Hall]], [[Ohio Stadium]], and [[University, Hayes and Orton Halls|Orton Hall]].
Unlike earlier public universities such as Ohio University and Miami University, whose campuses have a consistent architectural style, the Ohio State campus is a mix of traditional, modern and post-modern styles.
The [[William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library]], anchoring the Oval's western end, is Ohio State library's main branch and largest repository. The Thompson Library was designed in 1913 by the Boston firm of Allen and Collens in the Italianate Renaissance Revival style, and its placement on the Oval was suggested by the Olmsted brothers who had designed New York City's [[Central Park]]. In 2006, the Thompson Library began a $100 million renovation to maintain the building's classical Italian Renaissance architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2009/08/03/OSU_library.ART_ART_08-03-09_A1_5NEL3IU.html|title=OSU's main library reopens today after three-year, $109 million renovation|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohio State operates the North America's 18th-largest university [[research library]] with a combined collection of over 5.8 million volumes. Additionally, the libraries regularly receive about 35,000 serial titles. Its recent acquisitions were 16th among university research libraries in North America.&lt;ref name="arl.org"/&gt; Along with 21 libraries on its Columbus campus, the university has eight branches at off-campus research facilities and regional campuses, and a book storage depository near campus. In all, the Ohio State library system encompasses 55 branches and specialty collections. Some more significant collections include The [[Byrd Polar Research Center]] Archival Program, which has the archives of Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd]] and other polar research materials; The [[Hilandar Research Library]], which has the world's largest collection of [[medieval]] [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] manuscripts on microform; the [[Cartoon Research Library|Ohio State Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]], the world's largest repository of original cartoons; The Lawrence and Lee Theatre Research Institute; and the archives of Senator [[John Glenn]].

[[File:Wexner.jpg|thumb|left|text-top|upright=0.7|Detail of the Wexner Center]]Anchoring the traditional campus gateway at the eastern end of the Oval is the 1989 [[Wexner Center for the Arts]]. Designed by architects [[Peter Eisenman]] of New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, the center was funded in large part by Ohio State alumnus [[Leslie Wexner]]'s gift of $25 million in the 1980s. The center was founded to encompass all aspects of visual and performing arts with a focus on new commissions and artist residencies. Part of its design was to pay tribute to the armory that formerly had the same location. Its groundbreaking [[deconstructivism|deconstructivist]] architecture has resulted in it being lauded as one of the most important buildings of its generation. Its design has also been criticized as proving less than ideal for many of the art installations it has attempted to display. The centerpiece of The Wexner Center's permanent collection is [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Nude on a black armchair|Nude on a Black Armchair]]'', which was purchased by alumnus [[Leslie Wexner]] at auction for $45 million.

To the south of the Oval is another, somewhat smaller, expanse of green space commonly referred to as the South Oval. At its eastern end, it is anchored by the Ohio Union. To the west are Hale Hall, the Kuhn Honors House, Browning Amphitheatre (a traditional stone [[Greek theatre]]) and [[Mirror Lake (Ohio)|Mirror Lake]].

[[Knowlton Hall]], dedicated in October 2004, is at the corner of West Woodruff Avenue and Tuttle Park Place, next to [[Ohio Stadium]]. Knowlton Hall along with the [[Max M. Fisher College of Business|Fisher College of Business]] and Hitchcock Hall form an academic nucleus in the Northwestern corner of North campus. Knowlton Hall is home to the KSA Café, the disciplines of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, City and Regional Planning, and about 550 undergraduate and graduate students. Knowlton Hall stands out from the general reddish-brown brick of Ohio State's campus with distinctive white marble tiles that cover the building's exterior. This unique wall cladding was requested by Austin E. Knowlton, the namesake of and main patron to the creation of Knowlton Hall. Knowlton also requested 5 white marble columns be erected on the site, each column representing one of the classical orders of [[Architecture]].&lt;ref name="herrick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herrick.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/building/knowlton-hall-austin-e|title=Knowlton Hall, Austin E.|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928002321/http://herrick.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/building/knowlton-hall-austin-e|archivedate=September 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OSU College of Medicine and Public Health|Ohio State College of Medicine]] is on the southern edge of the central campus. It is home to the [[James Cancer Hospital]], a cancer research institute and one of the [[National Cancer Institute]]'s forty-one [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|comprehensive cancer centers]], along with [[the Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital]], a research institute for cardiovascular disease.

The Konwlton Hall, home of the Architecture School, was designed by Mac Scogin Merril Elam from Atlanta along with WSA Studio from Columbus, Ohio.

In recent decades, and in response to continually shrinking state funding, Ohio State has conducted two significant multi-year [[fundraising]] campaigns. The first concluded in 1987 and raised $460 million—a record at the time for a public university. The "Affirm Thy Friendship Campaign" took place between 1995 and 2000. With an initial goal of raising $850 million, the campaign's final tally was $1.23 billion, placing Ohio State among the small group of public universities to have successfully conducted a $1 billion campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homepages.indiana.edu/022505/text/iuf.shtml |title=Top 15 Public University Endowments as of June 30, 2004 |publisher=Homepages.indiana.edu |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928181444/http://www.homepages.indiana.edu/022505/text/iuf.shtml |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At his welcoming ceremony, returning President E.

The [[Ohio State University Marching Band|marching band]] is also a longstanding tradition at Ohio State. It is the largest all-brass and percussion band in the world. The traditional school songs from "[[Carmen Ohio]]" to "[[Hang on Sloopy]]" to "Fight the Team Across the Field", are arranged to fit this instrumentation. The band is famous for "[[Script Ohio]]", during which the band marches single-file through the curves of the word "Ohio", much like a pen writes the word, all while playing the French march "[[Le Régiment de Sambre et Meuse|Le Regiment de Sambre et Meuse]]." At the end of the performance, a high-stepping senior [[sousaphone]] player "dots" the "i" in Ohio.

"Across the Field", Ohio State's fight song, and "Buckeye Battle Cry" are commonly played and sung at athletic events, as well as [[Graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]] exercises.

The tradition of high-quality bands is not limited to the football field. OSU's School of Music contains several high-quality concert bands made up of graduate and undergraduate music majors and non-music majors. The OSU Wind Symphony often receives praise on the national level and was selected to perform at the 2003 College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) Convention and at the Ohio Music Educators Association Conference in 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2008; the OSU Symphonic Band performed in 2007. The OSU Wind Symphony released its newest album, ''Southern Harmony'', on the [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] Label in 2009. The [[Ohio State Jazz Ensemble]] performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1975, 1978, 1986, 1996, and 2001. It also appeared at the [[Mexico City International Jazz Festival]] in 1990 and the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]] in 1986, 1996, and 2001. There is also an OSU Symphony Orchestra.

In addition to strong bands, the university is recognized for outstanding choral performance. The [[Ohio State University Men's Glee Club]] was formed in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgc.osu.edu |title=OSU Men's Glee Club |publisher=Mgc.osu.edu |date= |access-date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, led by Professor James Gallagher, the Men's Glee Club participated in the International Musical [[Eisteddfod]] in Llangollen, [[Wales]], and won the male chorus competition by an unprecedented 20 points before, in a unanimous decision of the judges, being named "Choir of the World"—the first American [[choir]] to win such an honor. Robert J. Ward directs the Glee Club. The Ohio State Women's [[Glee Club]] was established in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wgc.osu.edu |title=OSU Women's Glee Club |publisher=wgc.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the group's recent past, under the leadership of Dr. Hilary Apfelstadt, the Glee Club has been selected to sing for state and regional conferences of the Ohio Music Education Association and the American Choral Directors Association. Beginning its season under the direction of Dr. Richard Schnipke, the OSU Women's Glee Club was honored to sing for the Ohio Choral Directors Association annual conference in June 2010.

Ohio State's "[[Buckeye Bullet]]" electric car broke the world record for the fastest speed by an electric vehicle on October 3, 2004, with a speed of 271.737&amp;nbsp;mph (437.3&amp;nbsp;km/h) at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedace.info/bonneville_nationals_buckeye_bullet_timing.htm |title=Bonneville Nationals 2004 |accessdate=December 31, 2009 |publisher=Speedace }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle also holds the U.S. record for fastest electric vehicle with a speed of 314.958&amp;nbsp;mph (506.9&amp;nbsp;km/h), and peak timed mile speed of 321.834&amp;nbsp;mph (517.9&amp;nbsp;km/h). A team of engineering students from the university's "Center for Automotive Research-Intelligent Transportation" (CAR-IT) designed, built and managed the vehicle. In 2007, [[Buckeye Bullet|Buckeye Bullet 2]] was launched. This follow-up effort was a collaboration between Ohio State engineering students and engineers from the [[Ford Motor Company]] and will seek to break the land speed record for hydrogen cell powered vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.osu.edu/news/archive/2007/070711a.php|title=Buckeye Bullet 2|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this needs updated - did end up breaking land-speed records --&gt;

A unique aspect to Ohio State's multibillion-dollar endowment is the Student Investment Management Program. Upperclass finance students taking Business Finance 724 are given the opportunity to manage a twenty million dollar investment fund. Returns from the student-managed funds often outperform the [[S&amp;P 500]] and frequently even the university's own professional fund managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fisher.osu.edu/fin/sim.htm|title=Ohio State Student Investment Management Program|publisher=|access-date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Stewart]] hosted ''[[The Daily Show]]'s'' "Battlefield Ohio: ''The Daily Show'''s Midwest Midterm Midtacular" from Ohio State's Roy Bowen Theatre during the week of October 30 to November 2, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbusdispatch.com/features-story.php?story=dispatch/2006/08/23/20060823-G1-04.html ''Columbus Dispatch'' 23 August 2006].  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, The Ohio State dissolved its Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit and eliminated four positions in the unit due to concerns about mismanagement and a lack of support for survivors of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2018/07/09/ohio-state-universitys-sexual-misconduct-unit-dissolved-wake-harrowing-claims-survivors/|title=You are being redirected...|website=msmagazine.com|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after the unit was suspended in February 2018 and following an external review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.osu.edu/ohio-state-dissolves-sexual-civility-and-empowerment-unit/|title=Ohio State dissolves Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit|work=Ohio State dissolves Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Columbus Dispatch'' and the school newspaper, ''The Lantern'' reported that "[SCE] failed to properly report students’ sexual-assault complaints" and that some victims were told that they were "'lying,' 'delusional,' 'suffering from mental illness,' 'have an active imagination,' that they 'didn’t understand their own experience' and also 'fabricated their story.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/news/20180619/ohio-state-closes-sexual-assault-center-fires-4-after-complaints|title=Ohio State closes sexual-assault center, fires 4 after complaints|last=Smola|first=Jennifer|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelantern.com/2018/06/ohio-state-shutting-down-sexual-civility-and-empowerment-unit/|title=Ohio State shuts down its Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit|work=The Lantern|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With help from the Philadelphia law firm Cozen O'Connor, the university will be creating a new framework to handle sexual assault cases and reevaluating its Title IX program.

On July 20, 2018, the ''Associated Press'' reported that over 100 students, including male athletes from 14 sports, had reported sexual misconduct against a deceased university team physician. The reports date back to 1978 and include claims that he groped and took nude photographs of his patients. The investigation is ongoing, and four former wrestlers have filed a lawsuit against Ohio State for ignoring complaints of "rampant sexual misconduct." U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jim Jordan (American politician)|Jim Jordan]] has been named in the lawsuit and has since denied the former wrestlers' claims that he knew about the abuse while he was an assistant coach for eight years at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jim-jordan-ohio-state-700578/|title=Rep.

===Diversity===
Ohio State's main campus has been lauded for the racial diversity of its student body. In various surveys and rankings, it has been included among the best campuses in the nation for African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-95845140.html |title=Black Enterprise's 50 Best Colleges for African Americans |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |access-date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Ohio State ranked 10th in the nation in 2006 for the numbers of African American doctors graduated. ''The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students'' lists Ohio State as one of the 20 best campuses in America for [[LGBT]] students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenbloom |first=Stephanie |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E0D71531F937A2575AC0A9609C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Is This Campus Gay-Friendly?|publisher=New York Times |date=September 14, 2006 |access-date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One campus feature that helps aid student diversity is the Multicultural Center.

Ohio State, despite selective admissions, has also maintained a high amount of socio-economic diversity{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} among its students. The 2007 freshman class contained 22.7% of first-generation college students, which far exceeded the national norm on American campuses of 15.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osu.edu/news/newsitem1801|title=Ohio State University Press|publisher=|access-date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University housing===
[[File:SCampusGateway.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|South Campus Gateway]]
Ohio State operates 38 on-campus residence halls divided into three geographic clusters: South Campus (site of the university's original dormitories) (currently include joint dorms known as Smith-Steeb and Park-Stradley), North Campus (largely constructed during the post-war enrollment boom) and West Campus or "The Towers". The residence hall system has 40 smaller living and learning environments defined by social or academic considerations. Ohio State also offers three honors residence halls: Bradley Hall, Lincoln Tower, and Taylor Tower.

Separate housing for graduate and professional students is maintained on the Southern tier of campus within the Gateway Residential Complex and the William H. Hall Student Residential Complex. Family housing is maintained at Buckeye Village at the far northern edge of campus beyond the athletic complex.

Student Life University Housing also administers student residential housing on the OSU Newark, OSU Mansfield, and OSU Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI) campuses.

The Residence Hall Advisory Council (RHAC), which is a representative body of all students living in the University's residence halls, helps evaluate and improve the living conditions of the residence halls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://involvedliving.osu.edu/rhac/about-us/ |title=About Us : Involved Living |publisher=Involvedliving.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honors programs===
Ohio State offers two distinct honors programs for high ability [[undergraduates]]: Honors and Scholars. The Honors program is open to students in all majors. The Scholars program is centered on thirteen specific programs such as "Architecture Scholars", "Media, Marketing, and Communications Scholars", "Biological Sciences Scholars", "International Affairs Scholars", "Business Scholars" and "Politics, Society and Law Scholars." Students in the Scholars program are expected to live and take select classes with other members of the program. Additionally, Ohio State offers the Honors Collegium with membership extended to ten incoming freshmen and following the Spring of a student's first or second year to the university's top undergraduates. Collegium students try to compete for internships, graduate schools and nationally competitive awards, such as the [[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall]], [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]], or [[Truman Scholarship|Truman]] Scholarships.

Ohio State also administers two large-scale [[scholarship|scholarship programs]] to ensure access to the university to high-ability students from [[low-income]] or traditionally underrepresented groups. The first, The Young Scholars Program, was initiated in 1988. 120 promising minority students from Ohio's nine largest urban public school districts are selected prior to entering high school. The program offers a series of academic camps each summer and counseling throughout the students' high school careers. Upon completion of the program, which also mandates a college preparatory curriculum and minimum grade point average, the students are guaranteed admission to Ohio State as well as any need-based financial aid. The Land Grant Scholarship was initiated in 2005. This program seeks to ensure access to Ohio State to high-ability students from low-income backgrounds. Ohio State has committed to offering a full-ride scholarship each academic year to at least one student from each of [[Ohio county government|Ohio's 88 counties]].

Ohio State maintains an honors center in the Kuhn Honors and Scholars House, which served as the University President's residence until the 1960s. Three residences are designated all or in part as honors residences: Taylor Tower, Bradley Hall, and Lincoln House.

===Activities and organizations===
[[File:EnarsonHall.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Hale Hall (Original Ohio Union)]]
The [[Ohio Union]] was the first student union built by an American public university. The Ohio Union is dedicated to the enrichment of the student experience, on and off the university campus. The first Ohio Union, on the south edge of the South Oval, was constructed in 1909 and was later renamed Enarson Hall. The second Ohio Union was completed in 1950 and was prominently along High Street, southeast of the Oval. It was a center of student life for more than 50 years, providing facilities for student activities, organizations and events and serving as an important meeting place for campus and community interaction. The union also housed many student services and programs, along with dining and recreational facilities. The second Ohio Union was demolished in February 2007 to make way for the new Ohio Union, which was finished in 2010. During this time, student activities were relocated to Ohio Stadium and other academic buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Ohio Union|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/about_the_union/history|accessdate=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203081517/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/about_the_union/history|archive-date=December 3, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student organizations===
[[Student organizations]] at Ohio State provide students with opportunities to get involved in a wide variety of interest areas including [[academic]], [[Social issues|social]], [[religious]], [[artistic]], [[community service|service-based]], [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] and many more.
There are over 1,000 registered student organizations that involve many thousands of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undergrad.osu.edu/explore/student-activities.html|title=The Ohio State University Undergraduate Admissions and First Year Experience|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816181742/http://undergrad.osu.edu/explore/student-activities.html|archivedate=August 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's forensics team has won the state [[National Forensics Association]] tournament several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohio.edu/news/00-01/294.html|title=Forensics Team Wins State Champ.|website=www.ohio.edu|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Block O|Block "O"]] is currently the largest student-run organization on the campus of Ohio State. With over 2,400 annual members, Block "O" serves as the official [[student cheering section]] at athletic events for the University. According to the Student Organization Office in the Ohio Union, Agricultural Education Society is the oldest student organization on campus. The Men's Glee Club often disputes the claim, but after consultation with Ohio Union Staff, Agricultural Education Society was named as the university's oldest organization.

Each year, students may sign-up to participate in [http://buckeyethon.osu.edu/ BuckeyeThon], Ohio State's student-led philanthropy. The organization hosts events throughout the year to support the hematology/oncology/bone marrow transplant unit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buckeyethon.osu.edu/aboutus/our_beneficiary|title=BuckeyeThon at The Ohio State University|website=buckeyethon.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Nationwide Children's Hospital]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Although BuckeyeThon is operated entirely by student volunteers, it is embedded within Student Life and the Ohio State University Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/posts/studentorgs/constitutions/2015_4_14_15_46_834.docx|title=Word document of BuckeyeThon Constitution and Bylaws (March 2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=ohiounion.osu.edu|publisher=The Ohio State University Office of Student Life|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927044941/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/posts/studentorgs/constitutions/2015_4_14_15_46_834.docx|archive-date=September 27, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization receives support, advising, and specialized leadership training from the University. Each February, thousands of students and community members attend BuckeyeThon's signature event, a [[Dance marathon|Dance Marathon]] consisting of two separate 12-hour shifts. In the past 15 years, students have raised over $5 million to support treatment, research, and various therapies at the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buckeyethon.osu.edu/events/dance_marathon|title=BuckeyeThon at The Ohio State University|website=buckeyethon.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique to BuckeyeThon is the use of an operational fund separate from the main philanthropic cancer fund. As a registered non-profit, BuckeyeThon is subject to University audit and issues gift receipts through the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.giveto.osu.edu/makeagift/?fund=315502|title=Make your gift|website=www.giveto.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual operational fund relies on University grants, outside sponsors, and event registration fees. This allows the entirety of donations made to the cancer fund to solely support patients without hindrance from outside costs.

Ohio State has several student-managed publications and media outlets. ''The Makio'' is the official yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/makio/ |title=Makio – Ohio Union |publisher=Ohiounion.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218162454/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/makio/ |archivedate=February 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Makio's'' sales plummeted by 60% during the early 1970s; the organization went bankrupt and stopped publication during the late 1970s. The book was revived from 1985 to 1994 and revived again in 2000 thanks to several student organizations. ''[[The Lantern]]'' is the school's daily newspaper and has operated as a laboratory newspaper in the School of Communication (formerly the School of Journalism) since 1881. ''Mosaic'' is a literary magazine published by Ohio State, which features undergraduate [[fiction]], [[poetry]], and [[art]]. ''The Sundial'' is a student-written and published humor magazine. Founded in 1911 it is one of the oldest humor magazines in the country. After a 17-year hiatus in which no magazine was published it has recently been revived, first in print form, and now in an online humor blog, as well as multiple social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2011/01/23/humor-mag-rises-again-at-ohio-state.html |title=Humor Magazine Lives Again |accessdate=May 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sundial.osu.edu/wordpress/ |title=Homepage of The Sundial |accessdate=May 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530175636/http://sundial.osu.edu/wordpress/ |archive-date=May 30, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio State has two improvisational comedy groups, ''The 8th Floor Improv'' and ''Fishbowl Improv'', who regularly perform long and short-form improv around campus and across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8thfloorimprov.com |title=The 8th Floor Improv |publisher=The 8th Floor Improv |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/FishbowlImprov|title=8th Floor Improv's Facebook Page|work=Facebook|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two student-run radio stations on campus. [[AROUSE]], the music station, is home to over 100 student DJs, streaming music and independent content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arouseosu.com/about.html|title=About: The Amateur Radio Organization for Student Entertainment|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio broadcasts eleven different Ohio State sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiostatesports.net/ |title=Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio |publisher=Ohiostatesports.net |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both stations broadcast on an Internet audio stream (no broadcast signals are available in Columbus). Students also operate a local [[cable TV]] channel known as Buckeye TV, which airs primarily on the campus closed cable system operated by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).

===Leadership and service===
The Union's vision is to prepare students to be responsible, engaged leaders committed to community participation for social action and change. Programs with which students can get involved include are the Leadership Collaborative, Leadership Ohio State, Residence Halls Advisory Council, LeaderShape, Buckeye Service Council, Community Commitment Day, SERV team, Service Squad, ImpactOSU, and BUCK I SERV alternative break trips. Additionally, the Service-Learning Institute offers courses that educate students while also helping the greater community. All of these programs have the ultimate goal of making students better leaders, people, and citizens of Ohio.&lt;ref name=keithkeycenter&gt;{{cite web|title=The Keith B.

In 1914, with the approval of President William Oxley Thompson and under the watchful eye of Dean Caroline Breyfogle, Ph.D., [[Mortar Board]] Senior Honor Society was established by seven senior women. Four years later, the members of the group then became one of the four founding chapters of Mortar Board National College Senior Honor Society, which now has charters at 231 campuses in the U.S. For more than 100 years at Ohio State, members of Mortar Board have been selected for their significant contributions in scholarship, leadership and service.

===Student government===
At The Ohio State University, three recognized student governments represent their constituents.&lt;ref name=govt&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Governments|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/get_involved/student_governments|accessdate=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208063009/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/get_involved/student_governments|archive-date=December 8, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Undergraduate Student Government (USG), which consists of elected and appointed student [[Representation (politics)|representatives]] who serve as liaisons from the [[undergraduate]] student body to university officials. USG seeks to outreach to and work for the students at Ohio State.
* Council of Graduate Students (CGS), which promotes and provides [[academic]], [[Academic administration|administrative]], and social programs for the university community in general and for [[graduate students]] in particular. The Council provides a forum in which the graduate student body may present, discuss, and set upon issues related to its role in the academic and non-academic aspects of the University community.
* Inter-Professional Council (IPC), which is a representative body of all professional students in the colleges of [[Dentistry]], [[Law]], [[Medicine]], [[Optometry]], [[Pharmacy]], and [[Veterinary Medicine]]. Its purpose is to act as a liaison between these students and the governing bodies of the University.

Ohio State's intercollegiate sports teams are called the "Buckeyes" (derived from the colloquial term for people from the state of [[Ohio]] and after the state tree, the [[Ohio Buckeye|Ohio Buckeye, ''Aesculus glabra'']]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osu.edu/news/history.php|title=osu.edu - Ohio State History and Traditions, Origins of the Buckeye Name|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I in all sports (Division I FBS in football) and the [[Big Ten Conference]] in most sports. (The women's [[ice hockey|hockey]] program competes in the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]]). The school colors are scarlet and gray. [[Brutus Buckeye]] is the mascot. Ohio State currently has 36 varsity teams.

Ohio State is one of six universities (the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of Florida]], [[Stanford University]], [[UCLA]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] being the others) to have won national championships in all three major men's sports (baseball, men's basketball, and football).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com|title=– The Official Website of NCAA Championships|work=NCAA.com|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio State is also one of only two universities to appear in the national championship games in both football and men's basketball in the same calendar year (the other university is the [[University of Florida]].)

'''Organic Engineering Systems (OES)''' are organic, [[hydroponic]], [[aeroponic]] or [[aquaponic]] farming technologies that are designed as a building engineering system.  The main purpose of these technologies is to grow food in buildings. OES are agricultural technologies and are considered a sub-section of [[ecological engineering]], primarily because they mimic natural ecosystems to produce food and are defined as [[urban horticulture]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Scott D., Susan M. Bolton, James L. Fridley. (2001). Design Principles for Ecological Engineering.  Ecological Engineering, V.18, 201-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules and regulations concerning '''prisoners of war in Islam''' are covered in manuals of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]],  based upon [[Islam]]ic teachings, in both the [[Qur'an]] and [[hadith]].

The historical legal principles governing the treatment of [[prisoners of war]], in [[shar'iah]], Islamic law, (in the traditional [[madhabs]] schools of Islamic jurisprudence), was then a significant improvement{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} over the pre-existing norms of society during [[Muhammad]]'s time (see [[Early reforms under Islam]]). Men, women, and children may all be taken as prisoners of war under traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Generally, a prisoner of war could be, at the discretion of the military leader, freed, ransomed, exchanged for Muslim prisoners, or kept in bondage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafsir]] of the [[Qur'an]] by [[Ibn Kathir]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20050115105038/http://users.mo-net.com/mcruzan/pows_02.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahkaam al-Sijn wa’l-Sujana’ wa Mu’aamalat al-Sujana’ fi’l-Islam of the [[Hadith]] by Hasan Abi’l-Ghuddah [http://islamqa.info/en/ref/13241]&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier times, the ransom sometimes took an educational dimension, where a literate prisoner of war could secure his or her freedom by teaching ten Muslims to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;Shirazi, Imam Muhammad. ''The Prophet Muhammad - A Mercy to the World''. Createspace Independent Pub, 2013, p. 74.{{self-published inline|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim scholars hold that a prisoner may not be ransomed for gold or silver, but may be exchanged for Muslim prisoners.&lt;ref name="AbuYusuf"&gt;'Abu Yusuf Ya'qub Le Livre de l'impot foncier,' translated from Arabic and annotated by Edmond Fagnan, Paris, Paul Geuthner, 1991, pages 301-302) Abu Yusuf (d. 798 CE)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During his life, Muhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to captives, regardless of their religion.{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), ''Introduction of Ad-Dahr'', "Period of revelation", p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

Historically, Muslims routinely captured large number of prisoners. Aside from those who converted to Islam, most were ransomed or enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;(Crone (2004), pp. 371-72)&lt;/ref&gt; Pasquier writes,
{{quote|It was the custom to enslave prisoners of war and the Islamic state would have put itself at a grave disadvantage vis-a-vis its enemies had it not reciprocated to some extent. By guaranteeing them [male POWs] humane treatment, and various possibilities of subsequently releasing themselves, it ensured that a good number of combatants in the opposing armies preferred captivity at the hands of Muslims to death on the field of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Roger DuPasquier. Unveiling Islam. Islamic Texts Society, 1992, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to accounts written by [[Muhammad]]'s followers, after the [[Battle of Badr]], some prisoners were executed for their earlier crimes in Mecca,{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} but the rest were given options: They could convert to Islam and thus win their freedom; they could pay ransom and win their freedom; they could teach 10 Muslims to read and write and thus win their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/lifeprophet/14.htm The Life of Muhammad The Prophet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his rule, [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] made it illegal to separate related prisoners of war from each other, after a captive complained to him for being separated from her daughter.&lt;ref name="Naqvi"&gt;Naqvi (2000), pg. 456&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

These principles were also honoured during the [[Crusades]], as exemplified by sultans such as [[Saladin]]{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} and [[al-Kamil]]. For example, after al-Kamil defeated the [[Franks]] during the [[Crusades]], Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic [[laws of war]], commenting on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:&lt;ref name=Weeramantry&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice Without Frontiers|first=Christopher G.|last=Judge Weeramantry |year=1997 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |isbn=90-411-0241-8 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

{{quote|Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Justice Without Frontiers |first=Christopher G. |last=Judge Weeramantry |year=1997 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |isbn=90-411-0241-8|pages=136–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Treatment of prisoners==
Upon capture, the prisoners must be guarded and not ill-treated.&lt;ref name = Nigosian&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Nigosian
  | first = S. A.
  | title = Islam. Its History, Teaching, and Practices
  | publisher = Indiana University Press

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic law holds that the prisoners must be fed and clothed, either by the Islamic government or by the individual who has custody of the prisoner. This position is supported by the verse {{quran-usc-range|76|8}} of the [[Quran]]. The prisoners must be fed in a dignified manner, and must not be forced to beg for their subsistence.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), introduction of [[Ad-Dahr]], "Period of revelation", pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's early followers also considered it a principle to not separate prisoners from their relatives.&lt;ref name="Naqvi" /&gt;

After the fighting is over, prisoners are to be released, with some prospect of survival, or ransomed. The freeing or ransoming of prisoners by Muslims themselves is highly recommended as a charitable act.&lt;ref name = Nigosian/&gt; The Qur'an also urges kindness to captives&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|36}}, {{Quran-usc|9|60}}, {{Quran-usc|24|58}})&lt;/ref&gt; and recommends, their liberation by purchase or [[manumission]]. The freeing of captives is recommended both for the expiation of sins&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|92}}, {{Quran-usc|5|92}}, {{Quran-usc|58|3}})&lt;/ref&gt; and as an act of simple benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|2|177}}, {{Quran-usc|24|33}}, {{Quran-usc|90|13}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 6. All Qur'anic citations are his.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and children===
Some Muslim scholars claim that women and children prisoners of war cannot be killed under any circumstances, regardless of their faith,&lt;ref&gt;(Patricia Crone. God’s Rule: Government and Islam. New York: Columbia University Press, 2004, pp. 371-72)&lt;/ref&gt; but that they may be enslaved, freed or ransomed. Women who are neither freed nor ransomed by their people were to be kept in bondage and referred to as ''[[ma malakat aymanukum]]'' (slaves).

===Men===
One traditional opinion holds that executing prisoners of war is strictly forbidden; this is the most-widely accepted view, and one upheld by the [[Hanafi]] [[madh'hab|madhab]].&lt;ref name="ElFadl"&gt;El Fadl (2003), pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2017}}

However, the opinion of the [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Jafari]] madhabs is that adult male prisoners of war may be executed.&lt;ref&gt;El Fadl (2003), pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The decision for an execution is to be made by the Muslim leader. This opinion was also upheld by the Muslim judge, [[Sa'id bin Jubair]] (665-714 AD) and [[Abu Yusuf]], a classical jurist from the [[Hanafi]] school of jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="AbuYusuf" /&gt; El Fadl argues the reason Muslim jurists adopted this position was largely because it was consistent with the war practices of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="ElFadl" /&gt; [[Muhammad Hamidullah]], while reminding that execution in such cases was exceptional and depending on many factors, further precises that [[beheading]] was discouraged: "[[ijma|unanimity]] was reached among the [[Sahaba|Companions]] of the Prophet not to behead prisoners of war. In short, capital punishment for prisoners of war is only permissible in extreme cases of necessity and in the higher interests of the State."&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Hamidullah, ''Muslim Conduct of State'', Muhammad Ashraf (1945), pp. 208-209&lt;/ref&gt;

Most contemporary Muslim scholars prohibit altogether the killing of prisoners and hold that this was the policy practiced by [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;Hashmi (2003), pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2017}} The 20th-century Muslim scholar, [[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] states that no prisoner should be "put to the sword" in accordance with a [[hadith|saying]]{{which|date=June 2017}} of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Maududi 1998, p. 34"&gt;Maududi (1998), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]], another 20th-century [[Muslim]] scholar, while commenting on verse {{Quran-usc|9|6}}, writes,

{{quote|Even those the [[Persecution of Muslims|enemies of Islam]], actively fighting against Islam, there may be individuals who may be in a position to require protection. Full asylum is to be given to them, and opportunities provided for hearing the Word of Allah...If they do not see their way to accept Islam, they will require double protection: (1) from the Islamic forces openly fighting against their people, and (2) from their own people, as they detached themselves from them. Both kinds of protection should be ensured for them, and they should be safely escorted to a place where they can be safe.&lt;ref&gt;Ali (1991), p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Maududi further states that Islam forbids torturing, especially by fire, and quotes Muhammad as saying, "Punishment by fire does not behoove anyone except the Master of the Fire [God]."&lt;ref name="Maududi 1998, p. 34"/&gt;

Quoting from the sources, Muhammad Munir, from the Department of Law  of the [[International Islamic University, Islamabad|International Islamic University]], [[Pakistan]], says that early religious authorities standing against the execution of POWs ''at all'' include [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|'Ali b. Abi Tãlib]], [[Hasan of Basra|Al-Hasan b. al-Hasan al-Basrl]]  (d. 110/728), [[Hammad ibn Salamah|Hammãd b. Abi Sulaymän]] (d. 120/737), [[Ibn Sirin|Muhammad b. Sirin]]  (d. 110/728), [[Mujahid ibn Jabr|Mujãhid b. Jabr]] (d. 103/721),  [[Ibn Jurayj|'Abd al-Mãlik b. 'Abd al-'Azïz b. Jurayj]] (d. 150/767), [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|'Atâ' b. Abi Rabãh]]  (d. 114/732) and Abû  'Ubayd  ibn Sallãm,&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; while later scholars favouring the same opinion include [[Qurtubi|Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Qurtubl]] (d. 671/1272), who shares {{Quran-usc|47|4}} to vindicate the sheer impossibility of execution if we follow the letter of the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Rushd]] (d. 594/1198)  is also quoted: "[A] number of jurists did not permit executing the prisoners  of war. Al-Hasan b. Muhammad al-Tamïmï (d. 656/1258) stated consensus ([[ijma]]) of the [[Sahaba|Companions]] on this view."&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 470&lt;/ref&gt; He further shows that the rare executions were more due to the crimes they committed before the captivity than their status of POW itself. A famous case being  [[Abdullah ibn Khatal|'Abd Allah b. Khatal]]. One of the few persons who weren't granted immunity at the [[conquest of Mecca]]. A group of people which "could have been punished by  a tribunal should there have been one at the time”. But he was the only one executed for what we would today call [[high treason]] (as he collected tax money from Muslims before defecting and fighting them).&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; More generically, he also shows that "in the first one hundred years of Islamic military history, that is, from the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) till the time of Caliph [[Umar II|'Umar b. 'Abdul 'Aziz]], there were only six or seven such cases, even if we were to accept the spurious reports of such executions."

[[File:Riparian strip.jpg|thumb|right|A well-preserved natural riparian strip on a tributary to [[Lake Erie]]]]

A '''riparian zone''' or '''riparian area''' is the interface between land and a [[river]] or [[stream]]. '''Riparian''' is also the proper nomenclature for one of the fifteen terrestrial [[biome]]s of the Earth. Plant habitats and communities along the river margins and [[Bank (geography)|banks]] are called riparian vegetation, characterized by [[Aquatic plant|hydrophilic plants]]. Riparian zones are important in [[ecology]], [[environmental resource management]], and [[civil engineering]] because of their role in [[soil conservation]], their habitat [[biodiversity]], and the influence they have on [[fauna]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s, including [[grassland]]s, [[woodland]]s, [[wetland]]s, or even non-vegetative areas.  In some regions the terms '''riparian woodland''', '''[[riparian forest]]''', '''[[riparian buffer]] zone,''' '''riparian corridor''' and '''riparian strip''' are used to characterize a riparian zone. The word ''riparian'' is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:ripa|ripa]]'', meaning river bank.

==Characteristics==
Riparian zones may be natural or engineered for soil stabilization or [[Land rehabilitation|restoration]]. These zones are important natural [[biofilter]]s, protecting aquatic environments from excessive [[sediment]]ation, polluted [[surface runoff]] and [[erosion]]. They supply shelter and food for many [[aquatic animal]]s and shade that limits stream temperature change. When riparian zones are damaged by [[construction]], [[agriculture]] or [[silviculture]], biological restoration can take place, usually by human intervention in [[erosion control]] and revegetation. If the area adjacent to a watercourse has standing water or saturated soil for as long as a season, it is normally termed a [[wetland]] because of its [[hydric soil]] characteristics. Because of their prominent role in supporting a [[biodiversity|diversity of species]], riparian zones are often the subject of national protection in a [[biodiversity action plan]]. These are also known as a "Plant or Vegetation Waste Buffer".

Research shows that riparian zones are instrumental in [[water quality]] improvement for both surface runoff and water flowing into streams through subsurface or [[groundwater]] flow. Riparian zones can play a role in lowering nitrate contamination in surface runoff, such as manure and other [[fertilizer]]s from [[Field (agriculture)|agricultural fields]], that would otherwise damage [[ecosystem]]s and human health. Particularly, the attenuation of [[nitrate]] or [[denitrification]] of the nitrates from [[fertilizer]] in this buffer zone is important. The use of wetland riparian zones shows a particularly high rate of removal of nitrate entering a stream and thus has a place in agricultural management.

==Roles and functions==
[[File:Pisuerga2.JPG|thumb|right|Thick riparian vegetation along the [[Pisuerga|Pisuerga River]] in [[Spain]]]]
Riparian zones dissipate stream energy. The [[meander]]ing curves of a river, combined with vegetation and root systems, slow the flow of water, which reduces soil erosion and flood damage. Sediment is trapped, reducing suspended solids to create less [[turbidity|turbid]] water, replenish soils, and build stream banks. Pollutants are filtered from surface runoff, enhancing water quality via biofiltration.

The riparian zones also provide [[wildlife]] [[habitat]], increased biodiversity, and [[wildlife corridor]]s, enabling aquatic and riparian organisms to move along river systems avoiding isolated communities. Riparian vegetation can also provide [[Fodder|forage]] for wildlife and livestock.

Riparian zones are also important for the fish that live within rivers, such as brook and charr. Impacts to riparian zones can affect fish, and restoration is not always sufficient to recover fish populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sievers |first1=Michael |last2=Hale |first2=Robin |last3=Morrongiello |first3=John R. |title=Do trout respond to riparian change? A meta-analysis with implications for restoration and management |journal=Freshwater Biology |date=March 2017 |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=445–457 |doi=10.1111/fwb.12888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They provide native [[landscape]] irrigation by extending seasonal or perennial flows of water. Nutrients from terrestrial vegetation (e.g. [[plant litter]] and insect drop) are transferred to aquatic food webs. The vegetation surrounding the stream helps to shade the water, mitigating [[thermal pollution|water temperature changes]].  The vegetation also contributes wood debris to streams, which is important to maintaining [[geomorphology]].

From a social aspect, riparian zones contribute to nearby property values through amenity and views, and they improve enjoyment for footpaths and bikeways through supporting [[Greenway (landscape)#Foreshoreway|foreshoreway]] networks. Space is created for riparian sports such as fishing, swimming and launching for vessels and paddlecraft.

The riparian zone acts as a sacrificial erosion buffer to absorb impacts of factors including [[climate change]], increased runoff from [[urbanization]] and increased [[Wake#Wake pattern of a boat|boat wake]] without damaging structures located behind a setback zone.

==Role in logging==
The protection of riparian zones is often a consideration in [[logging]] operations.  The undisturbed soil, soil cover, and vegetation provide shade, plant litter, and woody material, and reduce the delivery of [[soil erosion|soil eroded]] from the harvested area. Factors such as soil types and [[root]] structures, [[Climate|climatic]] conditions and vegetative cover determine the effectiveness of riparian buffering.

==Vegetation==
[[File:Willow Creek, Trout Creek Mountains, Oregon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Riparian zone along Trout Creek in the [[Trout Creek Mountains]], part of the Burns Bureau of Land Management District in southeastern [[Oregon]]. The creek provides critical habitat for [[trout]].]]

The assortment of riparian zone trees varies from those of wetlands and typically consists of plants that are either emergent aquatic plants, or [[herb]]s, [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s that thrive in proximity to water.

==Repair and restoration==
Land clearing followed by floods can quickly erode a riverbank, taking valuable grasses and soils downstream, and later allowing the sun to bake the land dry. [[Natural Sequence Farming]] techniques have been used in the [[Upper Hunter Shire|Upper Hunter]] Valley of [[New South Wales]], Australia, in an attempt to rapidly restore eroded farms to optimum productivity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The Natural Sequence Farming technique involves placing obstacles in the water's pathway to lessen the energy of a flood, and help the water to deposit soil and [[Seep (hydrology) |seep]] into the flood zone. Another technique is to quickly establish [[ecological succession]] by encouraging fast-growing plants such as "weeds" ([[pioneer species]]) to grow. These may spread along the watercourse and cause environmental degradation, but may stabilize the soil, place carbon into the ground, and protect the land from drying. The weeds will improve the streambeds so that trees and grasses can return, and later ideally replace the weeds. There are several other techniques used by government and non-government agencies to address riparian and streambed degradation, ranging from the installation of bed control structures such as log sills to the use of pin groynes or rock emplacement.

The '''rise in core''' (RIC) method is an alternate reservoir wettability characterization method described by S. Ghedan and C. H. Canbaz in 2014. The method enables estimation of all [[wetting]] regions such as strongly water wet, water wet, intermediate water and oil wet, oil wet and strongly oil wet regions in relatively quick, accurate measurements in terms of [[Contact angle]] rather than wettability index.

The method is easy to use and requires no complex equipment. During the RIC experiments, core samples saturated with selected reservoir fluid are subjected to imbibition from a second reservoir fluid. RIC wettability measurements are compared with modified – [[Amott test]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Amott|first=E.|title=Observations related to Wettability of Porous Rock|conference=AIME|year=1959|pp=216, 156–162|url=https://www.onepetro.org/general/SPE-1167-G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and USBM measurements using core plug pairs from different heights of a thick carbonate reservoir. Results show good coherence. Ghedan and Canbaz proved and patented the RIC method as an alternate method to Amott and USBM methods and that it efficiently characterizes Reservoir Wettability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ghedan|first=Shawket G.|last2=Canbaz|first2=Celal Hakan|date=19 January 2014|title=Theory and Experimental Setup of the New Rise in Core Reservoir Wettability Measurement Technique|journal=International Petroleum Technology Conference|language=english|doi=10.2523/iptc-17659-ms|isbn=9781613993224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|patent|20120136578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cut-off values vs wettability index ==
One study used the water advancing contact angle to estimate the wettability of fifty five oil reservoirs. Deoxygenated synthetic formation brine and dead anaerobic crudes were tested on quartz and calcite crystals at reservoir temperature. Contact angles from 0 to 75 degrees were deemed water wet, 75 to 105 degrees as intermediate and 105 to 180 degrees as oil wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treiber|first=L.E.|last2=Owens|first2=W.W.|date=1 December 1972|title=A Laboratory Evaluation of the Wettability of Fifty Oil-Producing Reservoirs|journal=Society of Petroleum Engineers Journal|language=english|volume=12|issue=6|pages=531–540|doi=10.2118/3526-pa|issn=0197-7520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the range of wettabilities was divided into three regions, these are arbitrary divisions. The wettability of different reservoirs can vary within the broad spectrum from strongly water-wet to strongly oil-wet. Another study described two initial conditions as reference and non-reference for calculating cut-off values by using advancing and receding contact angles and spontaneous imbibition data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=S.M.|last2=Zhang|first2=X.|last3=Morrow|first3=N.R.|last4=Zhou|first4=X.|date=1 December 1999|title=Characterization of Wettability From Spontaneous Imbibition Measurements|journal=Journal of Canadian Petroleum Technology|language=english|volume=38|issue=13|doi=10.2118/99-13-49|issn=0021-9487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limiting value between water wet and intermediate zones was described as 62-degree. Similarly, cut-off values for advancing contact angle is described as 0 to 62 degrees for water wet region, 62 to 133 degrees for Intermediate-wet zone, and 133 to 180 degrees for Oil wet zone.
''Chilingar and Yen''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chilingar|first=George V.|last2=Yen|first2=T. F.|date=1 January 1983|title=Some Notes on Wettability and Relative Permeabilities of Carbonate Reservoir Rocks, II|journal=Energy Sources|volume=7|issue=1|pages=67–75|doi=10.1080/00908318308908076|issn=0090-8312}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined extensive research work on 161 limestone, dolomitic limestone, calcitic dolomite, and dolomite cores. Cut-off values classified as 160 to 180 degrees for strongly oil wet, 100 to 160 degrees for oil wet, 80 to 100 degrees intermediate wet, 80 to 20 degrees water wet and 0 to 20 strongly water wet.

Rise in core uses a combination of ''Chilingar et al.''  and ''Morrow'' wettability cut-off criteria. The contact angle range 80 – 100 degrees indicate neutral-wetness, the range 100 – 133 degrees indicate slight-oil wetness, the range 133 – 160 degrees indicate oil-wetness while the range 160- 180 degrees indicate strongly oil-wetness. The range 62 – 80 degrees indicate slight water wetness, the range 20 – 62 degrees indicate, water-wetness, while the range 0 – 20 degrees indicate strong water-wetness.

== Technique ==
Rise in Core (RIC) wettability characterization technique is based on a modified form of [[Washburn's equation]] (1921). The technique enables relatively quick and accurate measurements of wettability in terms of contact angle while requiring no complex equipment. The method is applicable for any set of reservoir fluids, on any type of reservoir rock and at any heterogeneity level. It characterizes wettability across the board from strongly water to strongly oil wet conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ghedan|first=Shawkat G.|last2=Canbaz|first2=Celal Hakan|last3=Boyd|first3=Douglas A.|last4=Mani|first4=George M.|last5=Haggag|first5=Marwan Khamis|date=1 January 2010|title=Wettability Profile of a Thick Carbonate Reservoir by the New Rise in Core Wettability Characterization Method|journal=Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference|language=english|doi=10.2118/138697-ms|isbn=9781555633158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The step of deriving the modified form of Washburn equation for a rock/liquid/liquid system involves acquiring a Washburn equation for a rock/air/liquid system. The Washburn equation for a rock/air/liquid system is represented by:

&lt;math&gt;t= {\mu \over C \rho^2 \gamma \cos \theta} {m^2}&lt;/math&gt; ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq.1).&lt;/small&gt;''

Herein, "t" is the penetration rate of liquid into a porous sample, "μ" is the liquid's viscosity,  "ρ" is the liquid's density, "γ" is the liquid's surface tension, "θ" is the liquid's contact angle, "m" is the mass of the liquid that penetrates the porous sample and "C" is the constant of characterization of the porous sample. evaluating a value of "γ&lt;sub&gt;os&lt;/sub&gt;" using a young’s equation for a rock surface/water/air system (Figure 2) and a value of "γ&lt;sub&gt;ws&lt;/sub&gt;" using young’s equation for a liquid/liquid/rock system is represented as:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{ow} \cos \theta = \gamma_{os} \gamma_{ws} &lt;/math&gt;    ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq.2).&lt;/small&gt;''

"γ&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt;" is the surface tension between the oil and water system, "γ&lt;sub&gt;os&lt;/sub&gt;" is the surface tension between oil and solid system and "γ&lt;sub&gt;ws&lt;/sub&gt;" is the surface tension between water and the solid system. Using  [[Wetting#Ideal solid surfaces|Young's equation]] for a rock surface/ water/air system and substituting in equation (2) to obtain equation 3:

&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_{wo}= {{\gamma_o \cos \theta_o}\cdot{\gamma_w \cos \theta_w} \over {\gamma_{wo}}}&lt;/math&gt;        ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 3).&lt;/small&gt;''

Rearranging equation (1) to factor out γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt; obtains equation (4), wherein γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt; a liquid-vapor surface tension is:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{LV}= {\mu \over C \rho^2 \gamma \cos \theta} \cdot {m^2 \over t}&lt;/math&gt;  ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 4).&lt;/small&gt;''

Realizing that γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt; (liquid–vapor surface tension) is equivalent to γ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; (oil–air surface tension), or γ&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; (water–air-surface tension), substituting equation (4) in equation (3) and cancelling out similar terms obtains equation (5):

&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta_{wo}=   {{({{m^2 \mu_o} \over {C {\rho_o}^2  t}})-({{m^2 \mu_w} \over {C {\rho_w}^2  t}})} \over  \mu_{wo}  }    &lt;/math&gt; ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 5).&lt;/small&gt;''

Therein, γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt; is liquid-vapor surface tension, γ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;is oil-air surface tension, γ&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is water-air surface tension, µ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is viscosity of oil and  µ&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is viscosity of water. cosθ&lt;sub&gt;wo&lt;/sub&gt; is contact angle between water and oil; representing a relationship between a mass of water imbibed into the core sample and a mass of oil imbibed in the core sample with an equation (6):

&lt;math&gt;{\rho_w g V_w} = {\rho_o g V_o}&lt;/math&gt;     ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 6).&lt;/small&gt;''

Therein ρ&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is density of water and V&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is volume of water imbibed, ρ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is density of oil and V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is volume of oil imbibed, the amount of water imbibed and amount of oil imbibed under gravity are same; and air behaves as a strong non-wetting phase in both an oil–air–solid and a water–air–solid systems, thereby indicating that both oil and water behave as strong wetting phases, resulting in equal air/oil and air/water capillary forces for the same porous media and for a given pore size distribution. Thus, a mass change of a core sample due to water imbibition is equal to a mass change of a core sample due to oil imbibition, because water or oil penetration of the porous media at any time is a function of a balance between gravity and capillary forces. The mass of water imbibed into a core sample is approximately equal to a mass of oil imbibed in the core sample core samples of a same rock type and dimensions, and for equal capillary forces;

Cancelling out g in equation(6) gives equation (7):

&lt;math&gt;{\rho_w V_w} = {\rho_o V_o}&lt;/math&gt;      ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 7),&lt;/small&gt;''

which means

&lt;math&gt;{m_w} = {m_o}&lt;/math&gt;  ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 8).&lt;/small&gt;''

Therein, m&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is mass of water and m&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is mass of oil. Factoring out &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;C {m^2 \over t} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; from Eq. 5 to obtain Eq. 9, gives Modified Washburn Equation:

&lt;math&gt; {\cos \theta_{12}} = {{{{(\mu_1 {\rho_2}^2)}-{(\mu_2 {\rho_1}^2)}}\over {{{\rho_1}^2}  {{\rho_2}^2}  C  \mu_{L1L2}}} \cdot \left({m^2 \over t}\right)}   &lt;/math&gt;      ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 9).&lt;/small&gt;''

Therein θ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the contact angle of liquid/liquid/rock system, μ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a viscosity of oil phase, μ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a viscosity of water phase, ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is density of oil phase in g/cm³, ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is density of water phase in g/cm³, ''m'' is mass of fluid penetrated into a porous rock, ''t'' is time in min, γ_&lt;sub&gt;L1L2&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface tension between an oil and a water in dyne/cm, and ∁ is a characteristic constant of the porous rock.
[[File:RIC Experimental Setup.jpg|thumb|409x409px|Figure 1]]

== Experimental setup and procedure ==

Schematic view and experimental setups of the RIC wettability testing method is described in Figure 1. Core plugs are divided into 3–4 core samples, each of 3.8&amp;nbsp;cm average diameter and 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm length. The lateral area of each core sample is sealed by [[epoxy]] resin to ensure one-dimensional liquid penetration into the core by imbibition. A hook is mounted on top side of the core sample.

The RIC setup includes a beaker to host the imbibing fluid. A thin rope connects the core sample to a high-precision balance (0.001 gm accurate). A hanging core sample is positioned with the bottom part of the sample barely touching the imbibing fluid in the beaker. Relative saturation as well as mass of core samples starts to change during imbibition. A computer connected to a balance continuously monitors the core sample mass change over time. Plots of squared mass change versus time are generated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Canbaz, C.H., Ghedan, S.G.,  "Theory and Experimental Setup of the New Rise in Core Reservoir Wettability Measurement Technique"  IPTC #17659, IPTC, Doha, Qatar, January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Determination of "C" constant ===
[[File:RIC Experimental Procedure.jpg|thumb|404x404px|Figure 2]]
The RIC experiment is first performed with a n-[[dodecane]]–air–rock system to determine the constant ∁ of the Washburn Equation. N-dodecane imbibes into one of the core samples and the imbibition curve is recorded in Figure 2. Dodecane is an [[alkane]] that has low surface energy, very strongly wetting the rock sample in the presence of air, with contact angle θ equal to zero. Constant ∁ is determined by the contact angle value for dodecane/air/rock system, determining physical properties of n-dodecane (ρ,μ,γ) and rearranging equation 1;

&lt;math&gt;C= {\mu \over \rho^2 \gamma_{LV} \cos \theta} \cdot {m^2 \over t}&lt;/math&gt;       ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 10)&lt;/small&gt;''

=== Experiment ===
The second step of the RIC experimental process is to saturate the neighboring core sample with crude oil and subjected the sample to water imbibition. Applying the slope of the RIC curve &lt;math&gt;({m^2 \over t})&lt;/math&gt;, fluid properties of oil/brine system (ρ,μ,γ) and the ∁ value are determined from the neighboring core sample into Eq. 9 to calculate the contact angle, θ.

==Background==
Rock mechanics forms part of the much broader subject of [[geomechanics]], which is concerned with the mechanical responses of all geological materials, including soils. Rock mechanics, as applied in [[engineering geology]], [[mining]], petroleum, and [[civil engineering]] practice, is concerned with the application of the principles of [[Applied mechanics|engineering mechanics]] to the design of the rock structures generated by mining, drilling, reservoir production, or civil construction activity such as [[tunnels]], mining shafts, underground excavations, open pit mines, [[oil well|oil and gas wells]], road cuts, waste repositories, and other structures built in or of rock.  It also includes the design of reinforcement systems, such as [[rock bolt]]ing patterns.

Rock mechanics is a theoretical and applied science of the mechanical behavior of rock and rock masses; it is that branch of mechanics concerned with the response of rock and rock masses to the force fields of their physical environment. Rock mechanics is concerned with the application of the principles of engineering mechanics to the design of structures built in or of rock. The structure could include-but not limited to- a drill hole, a mining shaft, a tunnel, a reservoir dam, a repository component, or a building.  Rock mechanics is used in many engineering disciplines, but primarily used in Mining, Civil, Geotechnical, Transportation, and Petroleum Engineering.

[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|300px|Major denominations and religions of the world]]
A '''sect''' is a subgroup of a [[religion|religious]], [[politics|political]], or [[philosophy|philosophical]] belief system, usually an offshoot of a larger group. Although the term was originally a classification for religious separated groups, it can now refer to any organization that breaks away from a larger one to follow a different set of rules and principles.

In an [[India]]n context, sect refers to an organized tradition.&lt;ref name="sai.uni-heidelberg"/&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Catalogue of Sects.GIF|thumb|right|280px|''A Catalogue of the Severall Sects and Opinions in England and other Nations: With a briefe Rehearsall of their false and dangerous Tenents''. Broadsheet. 1647]]
The word ''sect'' comes from the [[Latin]] noun ''secta'' (a feminine form of a variant past participle of the verb ''sequi'', to follow&lt;ref name=oel_sect&gt;
{{cite web
| url         = https://www.etymonline.com/word/sect#etymonline_v_23088
| title       = sect (n.)
| work        = [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]
| publisher   = [[Douglas Harper]]
| accessdate  = 2018-11-03
| quote       = mid-14c., "distinctive system of beliefs or observances; party or school within a religion," from Old French secte, sete "sect, religious community," or directly from Late Latin secta "religious group, sect in philosophy or religion," from Latin secta "manner, mode, following, school of thought," literally "a way, road, beaten path," from fem. of sectus, variant past participle of sequi "follow," from PIE root *sekw- (1) "to follow." Confused in this sense with Latin secta, fem. past participle of secare "to cut" (from PIE root *sek- "to cut"). Meaning "separately organized religious body" is recorded from 1570s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), meaning "a way, road", and figuratively a (prescribed) way, mode, or manner, and hence [[metonym]]ously, a discipline or school of thought as defined by a set of methods and doctrines. The present gamut of meanings of ''sect'' has been influenced by confusion with the [[homonym]]ous (but etymologically unrelated) Latin word ''secta'' (the feminine form of the past participle of the verb ''[[Wikt:secare|secare]]'', to cut).&lt;ref name=oel_sect/&gt;

==Sociological definitions and descriptions==
{{Main article|Church-sect typology}}
There are several different sociological definitions and descriptions for the term.&lt;ref name="available online"&gt;McCormick Maaga, Mary excerpt from her book ''Hearing the Voices of [[Jonestown]]'' (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1998) [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=16596  available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first to define them were [[Max Weber]] and [[Ernst Troeltsch]] (1912).&lt;ref name="available online"/&gt; In the [[church-sect typology]] they are described as newly formed religious groups that form to protest elements of their parent religion (generally a [[Religious denomination|denomination]]). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of apostasy or [[heresy]] in the parent denomination; they are often decrying liberal trends in denominational development and advocating a return to true religion. The American [[sociology|sociologists]] [[Rodney Stark]] and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] assert that "sects claim to be authentic purged, refurbished version of the faith from which they split".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark|Stark, Rodney]], and Williams Sims Bainbridge (1979) ''Of Churches, Sects, and Cults: Preliminary Concepts for a Theory of Religious Movements'' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 18, no 2: 117–33&lt;/ref&gt; They further assert that sects have, in contrast to churches, a high degree of tension with the surrounding society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark|Stark, Rodney]], and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] (1985) ''The Future of Religion: Secularization, Revival, and Cult formation'' Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists of religion such as Fred Kniss have asserted that sectarianism is best described with regard to what a sect is in tension with.  Some religious groups exist in tension only with co-religious groups of different ethnicities, or exist in tension with the whole of society rather than the church which the sect originated from.&lt;ref&gt;Kniss, Fred, and Numrich, Paul (2007) ''Sacred Assemblies and Civic Engagement''Rutgers University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sectarianism]] is sometimes defined in the [[sociology of religion]] as a worldview that emphasizes the unique legitimacy of believers' creed and practices and that heightens tension with the larger society by engaging in boundary-maintaining practices.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Meredith B. "Religion: the Social Context" fifth edition (2002) {{ISBN|0-534-54126-7}} page 338&lt;/ref&gt;

The English sociologist [[Roy Wallis]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eileen Barker|Barker, E]]. ''New Religious Movements: A Practical Introduction'' (1990), Bernan Press, {{ISBN|0-11-340927-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that a sect is characterized by "[[epistemology|epistemological]] authoritarianism": sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, "sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation" and "their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'". He contrasts this with a [[cult]] that he described as characterized by "epistemological individualism" by which he means that "the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member."&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''[[The Road to Total Freedom A Sociological analysis of Scientology]]'' (1976) [http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html available online (bad scan)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405052348/http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html |date=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''Scientology: Therapeutic Cult to Religious Sect'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614094446/http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/89 abstract only] (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other languages==
The corresponding words for "sect" in [[Europe]]an languages other than [[English language|English]] – ''Sekte'' (German), ''secte'' (French), ''secta'' (Spanish, Catalan), ''sectă'' (Romanian), ''seita'' (Portuguese, Galician), ''sekta'' (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, Latvian, Lithuanian), ''sekt'' (Danish, Estonian, Norwegian, Swedish), ''sekte'' (Dutch) and ''szekta'' (Hungarian), ''секта'' (Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian) – refer to a harmful religious sect and translate into English as "[[Cult|cult]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In [[France]], since the 1970s, ''secte'' has a specific meaning{{which|date=October 2014}} which is very different from the English word.&lt;ref&gt;Esquerre Arnaud, "Lutter contre les sectes: l’invention d’un psycho-pouvoir", ''Le Banquet'', n°24, février 2007, p. 199-212&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quote|date=October 2014}}

==In Buddhism==
{{Main article|Schools of Buddhism}}
[[File:Japanese buddhist monk by Arashiyama.JPG|thumb|Japanese buddhist monk from the [[Sōtō Zen]] sect]]
The ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Religion'' distinguishes three types of classification of Buddhism, separated into "Movements", "Nikāyas" and "Doctrinal schools":
* Schools:
** [[Theravada]], ''primarily in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].''
** [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]], ''primarily in [[East Asia]].''
** [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]], ''primarily in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Mongolia]] and the Russian republic of [[Kalmykia]].''
* [[Nikāya]]s, or monastic fraternities, three of which survive at the present day:
** [[Theravada|Theravāda]], in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]
** [[Dharmaguptaka]], in [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]
** [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]], in the Tibetan tradition

==In Christianity==
{{see also|List of Christian denominations|Christian denomination}}
While the historical usage of the term "sect" in [[Christendom]] has had [[pejorative]] connotations, referring to a group or movement with [[Christian heresy|heretical]] beliefs or practices that deviate from those of groups considered orthodox,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan R. Wilson|Wilson, Bryan]] ''Religion in Sociological Perspective'' 1982, {{ISBN|0-19-826664-2}} [[Oxford University Press]] page 89&lt;br&gt;
"In English, it is a term that designates a religiously separated group, but in its historical usage in Christendom it carried a distinctly pejorative connotation. A sect was a movement committed to heretical beliefs and often to ritual acts and practices like isolation that departed from orthodox religious procedures."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Sect and Sects}}&lt;/ref&gt; its primary meaning is to indicate a community which has separated itself in some way from the larger body from which its members came and to which they may or may not still adhere. The term remains valid for this purpose.

===Roman Catholic sects===
There are many groups outside the Roman Catholic Church which regard themselves as Catholic, such as the [[Community of the Lady of All Nations]], the [[Palmarian Catholic Church]], the [[Philippine Independent Church]], the [[Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church]], the [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]], [[Most Holy Family Monastery]], and others.

===Protestant sects===
{{See also|List of the largest Protestant denominations}}

==In Hinduism==
{{Main article|Hindu denominations}}
[[File:Ganapati.1..JPG|thumb|[[Ganesha]] worshippers]]
The [[Indology|Indologist]] [[Axel Michaels]] writes in his book about [[Hinduism]] that in an Indian context the word "sect does not denote a split or excluded community, but rather an organized tradition, usually established by founder with ascetic practices."&lt;ref name="sai.uni-heidelberg"&gt;{{cite book | title = Hinduism past and Present (2004) translated from German "Der Hinduismus" (1998)| first=Axel| last=Michaels| author-link=Axel Michaels| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn=0-691-08952-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michaels, "Indian sects do not focus on heresy, since the lack of a center or a compulsory center makes this impossible – instead, the focus is on adherents and followers."&lt;ref name="sai.uni-heidelberg"/&gt;

==In Islam==
{{Main article|Islamic schools and branches|fiqh|madhhab}}
The ancient schools of [[fiqh]] or [[sharia]] in [[Islam]] are known as "[[madhhab]]s." In the beginning Islam was classically divided into three major sects. These political divisions are well known as [[Sunni Islam]], [[Shia Islam]] and [[Khawarij|Khariji Islam]]. Each sect developed several distinct jurisprudence systems reflecting their own understanding of the Islamic law during the course of the [[history of Islam]].

For instance, Sunnis are separated into five sub-sects, namely, [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Ẓāhirī]].

The Shia, on the other hand, first developed [[Kaysanites|Kaysanism]], which in turn divided into three major groupings known as [[Fivers]], [[Seveners]] and [[Twelvers]]. The [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydis]] separated first. The non-Zaydis are initially called as "[[Rafida]] Groups." These [[Rafidi]]s were later divided into two sub-groups known as [[Imamiyyah]] and [[Batiniyyah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmed Cevdet Pasha]], ''Kısas-ı Enbiyâ,'' vol. II, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The "[[Imami]]-[[Shi'a]]" later brought into existence [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]]. [[Akhbari]]sm, [[Usuli]]sm, and [[Shaykhism]] were all ensued as variations of "Ja'fari fiqh," while [[Alawites]] and [[Alevis]] who are not the strict followers of "Ja'farism" are developed separately from the teachings of ''[[Ithna'ashari]] [[Imām]]s.''[[File:Ghardaia02.jpg|thumb|[[M'zab]] valley in Sahara is home of the [[Ibadi]] religious sect]]
*[[Batiniyya]] groups, on the other hand, were divided into two sub-groups known as [[Sevener]]s and [[Ismā'īlī]]s. [[Qarmatians]] who did not follow the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] were branched from the [[Seveners]]. Those groups of [[Batiniyya]] who followed the [[Fatimids]] are the ancestors of today's [[Ismā'īlī]]s. [[Druze]] was emerged as an offshoot of Ismāʿīlism at the beginning of the 11th Century. [[Isma'ilism]] at the end of the 11th Century split into two major branches known as [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] ''([[Assassins]] of [[Alamut]])'' and [[Musta’li Ismaili]]. As a result of the assassination of [[Fatimid Caliph]] [[Al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah]], [[Mustaali]] was once more again divided into [[Hafizi]]s and [[Taiyabi Ismaili]]s ''([[Dawoodi Bohra|Dawoodis]], [[Sulaymani]]s and [[Alavi Bohra|Alavis]])''
* The Khawarij were initially divided into five major branches: [[Sufri]]s, [[Azariqa]], [[Najdat]], Adjarites and [[Ibadi]]s.

The Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali Sunnis, the Twelver groups, the Ismā'īlī groups, the Zaydis, the Ibadis, and the Ẓāhirīs continue to exist. In addition, new sects like [[Ahmadiyya movement]], [[Islam in the United States#Black Muslim movements|Black Muslim movements]], [[Quranists]], [[Salafis]], [[Wahhabis]], and [[Zikris]] have been emerged independently.

=== Amman Message ===
{{main article||Amman Message}}
{{further information|Islamic denominations}}
An Islamic convention held in [[Jordan]] in July 2005, which brought 200 Muslim scholars from over 50 countries together, announced the official recognition of eight [[Madhhab|schools]] of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ammanmessage.com/ The Amman Message summary] – Official website&lt;/ref&gt; and the varying [[schools of Islamic theology]].&lt;ref name="3Points"&gt;[http://ammanmessage.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=91&amp;Itemid=74 The Three Points of The [[Amman Message]] V.1]&lt;/ref&gt; The eight recognized [[List of Islamic schools and branches|Islamic schools and branches]] are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14886">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''small-bias sample space''' (also known as '''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sample space''',  '''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased generator''', or '''small-bias probability space''') is a [[probability distribution]] that fools [[parity function]]s.
In other words, no parity function can distinguish between a small-bias sample space and the uniform distribution with high probability, and hence, small-bias sample spaces naturally give rise to [[pseudorandom generator]]s for parity functions.

The main useful property of small-bias sample spaces is that they need far fewer truly random bits than the uniform distribution to fool parities.  Efficient constructions of small-bias sample spaces have found many applications in computer science, some of which are [[derandomization]], [[error-correcting code]]s, and [[PCP theorem|probabilistically checkable proofs]].
The connection with [[error-correcting code]]s is in fact very strong since &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sample spaces are ''equivalent'' to '''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced error-correcting codes'''.

==Definition==

===Bias===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability distribution]] over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;.
The ''bias'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a set of indices &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \{1,\dots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;ref&gt;cf., e.g., {{harvtxt|Goldreich|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{bias}_I(X)
=
\left|
\Pr_{x\sim X} \left(\sum_{i\in I} x_i = 0\right)
-
\Pr_{x\sim X} \left(\sum_{i\in I} x_i = 1\right)
\right|
=
\left|
2 \cdot \Pr_{x\sim X} \left(\sum_{i\in I} x_i = 0\right)
-1
\right|
\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum is taken over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[finite field]] with two elements. In other words, the sum &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I} x_i&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if the number of ones in the sample &lt;math&gt;x\in\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; at the positions defined by &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is even, and otherwise, the sum equals &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.
For &lt;math&gt;I=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, the empty sum is defined to be zero, and hence &lt;math&gt;\text{bias}_{\emptyset} (X) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

=== ϵ-biased sample space ===
A probability distribution &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sample space'' if
&lt;math&gt;
\text{bias}_I(X) \leq \epsilon
&lt;/math&gt;
holds for all non-empty subsets &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \{1,2,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== ϵ-biased set ===
An &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sample space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that is generated by picking a uniform element from a [[multiset]] &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is called ''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set''.
The ''size'' &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the multiset that generates the sample space.

=== ϵ-biased generator ===
An &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased generator &lt;math&gt;G:\{0,1\}^\ell \to \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a function that maps strings of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; to strings of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that the multiset &lt;math&gt;X_G=\{G(y) \;\vert\; y\in\{0,1\}^\ell \}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set. The ''seed length'' of the generator is the number &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and is related to the size of the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set &lt;math&gt;X_G&lt;/math&gt; via the equation &lt;math&gt;s=2^\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

== Connection with epsilon-balanced error-correcting codes ==
There is a close connection between &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sets and ''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced'' [[linear code|linear error-correcting codes]].
A linear code &lt;math&gt;C:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^s&lt;/math&gt; of [[Block code#The message length k|message length]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and [[Block code#The block length n|block length]] &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is
''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced'' if the [[Hamming weight]] of every nonzero codeword &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is between &lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)s&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a linear code, its [[generator matrix]] is an &lt;math&gt;(n\times s)&lt;/math&gt;-matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;C(x)=x \cdot A&lt;/math&gt;.

Then it holds that a multiset &lt;math&gt;X\subset\{0,1\}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased if and only if the linear code &lt;math&gt;C_X&lt;/math&gt;, whose columns are exactly elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced.&lt;ref name="BA-TS-09"&gt;cf., e.g., p. 2 of {{harvtxt|Ben-Aroya|Ta-Shma|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constructions of small epsilon-biased sets ==
Usually the goal is to find &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sets that have a small size &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; relative to the parameters &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
This is because a smaller size &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; means that the amount of randomness needed to pick a random element from the set is smaller, and so the set can be used to fool parities using few random bits.

=== Theoretical bounds ===
The probabilistic method gives a non-explicit construction that achieves size &lt;math&gt;s=O(n/\epsilon^2)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BA-TS-09" /&gt;
The construction is non-explicit in the sense that finding the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set requires a lot of true randomness, which does not help towards the goal of reducing the overall randomness.
However, this non-explicit construction is useful because it shows that these efficient codes exist.
On the other hand, the best known lower bound for the size of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sets is &lt;math&gt;s=\Omega(n/ (\epsilon^2 \log (1/\epsilon))&lt;/math&gt;, that is, in order for a set to be &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased, it must be at least that big.&lt;ref name="BA-TS-09" /&gt;

=== Explicit constructions ===
There are many explicit, i.e., deterministic constructions of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sets with various parameter settings:
* {{harvtxt|Naor|Naor|1990}} achieve &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s= \frac{n}{\text{poly}(\epsilon)}&lt;/math&gt;. The construction makes use of [[Justesen code]]s (which is a concatenation of [[Reed–Solomon code]]s with the [[Wozencraft ensemble]]) as well as [[expander walk sampling]].
* {{harvtxt|Alon|Goldreich|Håstad|Peralta|1992}} achieve &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s= O\left(\frac{n}{\epsilon \log (n/\epsilon)}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;. One of their constructions is the concatenation of [[Reed–Solomon code]]s with the [[Hadamard code]]; this concatenation turns out to be an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced code, which gives rise to an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sample space via the connection mentioned above.
* Concatenating [[Algebraic geometric code]]s with the [[Hadamard code]] gives an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced code with &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s= O\left(\frac{n}{\epsilon^3 \log (1/\epsilon)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BA-TS-09" /&gt;
* {{harvtxt|Ben-Aroya|Ta-Shma|2009}} achieves &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s= O\left(\frac{n}{\epsilon^2 \log (1/\epsilon)}\right)^{5/4}&lt;/math&gt;.
* {{harvtxt|Ta-Shma|2017}} achieves &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s= O\left(\frac{n}{\epsilon^{2+o(1)}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; which is almost optimal because of the lower bound.
These bounds are mutually incomparable. In particular, none of these constructions yields the smallest &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sets for all settings of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Application: almost k-wise independence ==
An important application of small-bias sets lies in the construction of almost k-wise independent sample spaces.

=== k-wise independent spaces ===
A random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a ''k-wise independent space'' if, for all index sets &lt;math&gt;I\subseteq\{1,\dots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the [[marginal distribution]] &lt;math&gt;Y|_I&lt;/math&gt; is exactly equal to the [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, for all such &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and all strings &lt;math&gt;z\in\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;, the distribution &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\Pr_Y (Y|_I = z) = 2^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Constructions and bounds ====
k-wise independent spaces are fairly well understood.
* A simple construction by {{harvtxt|Joffe|1974}} achieves size &lt;math&gt;n^k&lt;/math&gt;.
* {{harvtxt|Alon|Babai|Itai|1986}} construct a k-wise independent space whose size is &lt;math&gt;n^{k/2}&lt;/math&gt;.
* {{harvtxt|Chor|Goldreich|Håstad|Freidmann|1985}} prove that no k-wise independent space can be significantly smaller than &lt;math&gt;n^{k/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Joffe's construction ====
{{harvtxt|Joffe|1974}} constructs a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-wise independent space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; over the [[finite field]] with some prime number &lt;math&gt;n&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of elements, i.e., &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a distribution over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_n^n&lt;/math&gt;. The initial &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; marginals of the distribution are drawn independently and uniformly at random:
:&lt;math&gt;(Y_0,\dots,Y_{k-1}) \sim\mathbb F_n^k&lt;/math&gt;.
For each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k \leq i &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;, the marginal distribution of &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; is then defined as
:&lt;math&gt;Y_i=Y_0 + Y_1 \cdot i + Y_2 \cdot i^2 + \dots + Y_{k-1} \cdot i^{k-1}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the calculation is done in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_n&lt;/math&gt;.
{{harvtxt|Joffe|1974}} proves that the distribution &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; constructed in this way is &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-wise independent as a distribution over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_n^n&lt;/math&gt;.
The distribution &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is uniform on its support, and hence, the support of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; forms a ''&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-wise independent set''.
It contains all &lt;math&gt;n^k&lt;/math&gt; strings in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_n^k&lt;/math&gt; that have been extended to strings of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; using the deterministic rule above.

=== Almost k-wise independent spaces ===
A random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a ''&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-almost k-wise independent space'' if, for all index sets &lt;math&gt;I\subseteq\{1,\dots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the restricted distribution &lt;math&gt;Y|_I&lt;/math&gt; and the uniform distribution &lt;math&gt;U_k&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-close in [[p-norm|1-norm]], i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Big\|Y|_I - U_k\Big\|_1 \leq \delta&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Constructions ====
{{harvtxt|Naor|Naor|1990}} give a general framework for combining small k-wise independent spaces with small &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased spaces to obtain &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-almost k-wise independent spaces of even smaller size.
In particular, let &lt;math&gt;G_1:\{0,1\}^h\to\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a [[linear mapping]] that generates a k-wise independent space and let &lt;math&gt;G_2:\{0,1\}^\ell \to \{0,1\}^h&lt;/math&gt; be a generator of an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^h&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, when given a uniformly random input, the output of &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; is a k-wise independent space, and the output of &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased.
Then &lt;math&gt;G : \{0,1\}^\ell \to \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;G(x) = G_1(G_2(x))&lt;/math&gt; is a generator of an &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-almost &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-wise independent space, where &lt;math&gt;\delta=2^{k/2} \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Section 4 in {{harvtxt|Naor|Naor|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, {{harvtxt|Alon|Babai|Itai|1986}} construct a generator &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h=\tfrac{k}{2} \log n&lt;/math&gt;, and {{harvtxt|Naor|Naor|1990}} construct a generator &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\ell=\log s=\log h + O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, the concatenation &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; has seed length &lt;math&gt;\ell = \log k + \log \log n + O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))&lt;/math&gt;.
In order for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to yield a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-almost k-wise independent space, we need to set &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \delta 2^{-k/2}&lt;/math&gt;, which leads to a seed length of &lt;math&gt;\ell = \log \log n + O(k+\log(\delta^{-1}))&lt;/math&gt; and a sample space of total size &lt;math&gt;2^\ell \leq \log n \cdot \text{poly}(2^k \cdot\delta^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31117">In [[materials science]], the '''sol–gel''' process is a method for producing solid materials from small molecules. The method is used for the [[manufacturing|fabrication]] of [[metal oxide]]s, especially the oxides of [[silicon]] (Si) and [[titanium]] (Ti). The process involves conversion of monomers into a colloidal solution (''[[Sol (colloid)|sol]]'') that acts as the precursor for an integrated network (or ''[[gel|gel]]'') of either discrete particles or network [[polymer]]s. Typical [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] are [[metal alkoxide]]s.

==Stages in the process==
[[File:SolGelTechnologyStages.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of the different stages and routes of the sol–gel technology]]
In this chemical procedure, a "[[Sol (colloid)|sol]]" (a colloidal solution) is formed that then gradually evolves towards the formation of a gel-like diphasic system containing both a [[liquid]] phase and [[solid]] phase whose morphologies range from discrete particles to continuous polymer networks. In the case of the [[colloid]], the volume fraction of particles (or particle density) may be so low that a significant amount of fluid may need to be removed initially for the gel-like properties to be recognized. This can be accomplished in any number of ways. The simplest method is to allow time for [[sedimentation]] to occur, and then pour off the remaining liquid. [[Centrifugation]] can also be used to accelerate the process of [[phase separation]].

Removal of the remaining liquid (solvent) phase requires a '''drying''' process, which is typically accompanied by a significant amount of [[shrinkage (casting)|shrinkage]] and densification. The rate at which the solvent can be removed is ultimately determined by the distribution of [[porosity]] in the gel. The ultimate [[microstructure]] of the final component will clearly be strongly influenced by changes imposed upon the structural template during this phase of processing.

Afterwards, a thermal treatment, or '''firing''' process, is often necessary in order to favor further polycondensation and enhance mechanical properties and structural stability via final [[sintering]], densification, and [[grain growth]]. One of the distinct advantages of using this methodology as opposed to the more traditional processing techniques is that densification is often achieved at a much lower temperature.

The [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] sol can be either deposited on a [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]] to form a film (e.g., by [[dip-coating]] or [[spin coating]]), [[casting|cast]] into a suitable container with the desired shape (e.g., to obtain monolithic [[ceramic]]s, [[glass]]es, [[mineral wool|fibers]], [[artificial membrane|membranes]], [[aerogel]]s), or used to synthesize powders (e.g., [[microsphere]]s, [[nanoparticle|nanospheres]]).&lt;ref name="hydro"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Hanaor| first1 = D.

Even small quantities of dopants, such as [[dye#Organic dyes|organic dye]]s and [[rare-earth element]]s, can be introduced in the sol and end up uniformly dispersed in the final product. It can be used in [[ceramics processing]] and manufacturing as an [[investment casting]] material, or as a means of producing very [[thin film]]s of metal [[oxide]]s for various purposes. Sol–gel derived materials have diverse applications in [[optics]], [[electronics]], [[energy]], [[space]], (bio)[[sensors]], [[medicine]] (e.g., [[sustained release dosage forms|controlled drug release]]), [[reactive material]], and separation (e.g., [[chromatography]]) technology.

The interest in sol–gel processing can be traced back in the mid-1800s with the observation that the hydrolysis of [[tetraethyl orthosilicate]] (TEOS) under acidic conditions led to the formation of [[silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the form of fibers and monoliths. Sol–gel research grew to be so important that in the 1990s more than 35,000 papers were published worldwide on the process.&lt;ref name="CJ"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. J. |last=Brinker |author2=G. W.

==Particles and polymers==
The sol–gel process is a wet-chemical technique used for the fabrication of both glassy and ceramic materials. In this process, the sol (or solution) evolves gradually towards the formation of a gel-like network containing both a liquid phase and a solid phase. Typical precursors are metal alkoxides and metal chlorides, which undergo hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions to form a colloid. The basic structure or morphology of the solid phase can range anywhere from discrete colloidal particles to continuous chain-like polymer networks.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, L.C. and Garvey, G.J., "Kinetics of the Sol-Gel Transition"
Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids, Vol. 38, p.45 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brinker, C.J., ''et al.'', "Sol-Gel Transition in Simple Silicates", J. Non-Crystalline Solids, Vol.48, p.47 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[colloid]]'' is used primarily to describe a broad range of solid-liquid (and/or liquid-liquid) mixtures, all of which contain distinct solid (and/or liquid) particles which are dispersed to various degrees in a liquid medium. The term is specific to the size of the individual particles, which are larger than atomic dimensions but small enough to exhibit [[Brownian motion]]. If the particles are large enough, then their dynamic behavior in any given period of time in suspension would be governed by forces of [[gravity]] and [[sedimentation]]. But if they are small enough to be colloids, then their irregular motion in suspension can be attributed to the collective bombardment of a myriad of thermally agitated molecules in the liquid suspending medium, as described originally by [[Albert Einstein]] in his [[dissertation]]. Einstein concluded that this erratic behavior could adequately be described using the theory of [[Brownian motion]], with sedimentation being a possible long-term result. This critical size range (or particle diameter) typically ranges from tens of [[angstrom]]s (10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m) to a few [[micrometre]]s (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A., Ann. Phys., Vol. 19, p. 289 (1906), Vol. 34 p.591 (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

*Under certain chemical conditions (typically in '''base-catalyzed sols'''), the particles may grow to sufficient size to become '''colloids''', which are affected both by sedimentation and forces of gravity. Stabilized suspensions of such sub-micrometre spherical particles may eventually result in their self-assembly—yielding highly ordered microstructures reminiscent of the prototype colloidal crystal: precious [[opal]].&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;Allman III, R.M., ''Structural Variations in Colloidal Crystals'', M.S. Thesis, UCLA (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A2"&gt;Allman III, R.M. and Onoda, G.Y., Jr. (Unpublished work, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Under certain chemical conditions (typically in '''acid-catalyzed sols'''), the interparticle forces have sufficient strength to cause considerable aggregation and/or [[flocculation]] prior to their growth. The formation of a more open continuous network of low density '''polymers''' exhibits certain advantages with regard to physical properties in the formation of high performance glass and glass/ceramic components in 2 and 3 dimensions.&lt;ref name=SAK&gt;Sakka, S. ''et al.'', "The Sol-Gel Transition: Formation of Glass Fibers &amp; Thin Films", J. Non-Crystalline Solids, Vol. 48, p.31 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

In either case (discrete particles or continuous polymer network) the [[sol (colloid)|sol]] evolves then towards the formation of an inorganic network containing a liquid phase ([[gel]]). Formation of a metal oxide involves connecting the metal centers with oxo (M-O-M) or hydroxo (M-OH-M) bridges, therefore generating metal-oxo or metal-hydroxo polymers in solution.

In both cases (discrete particles or continuous polymer network), the drying process serves to remove the liquid phase from the gel, yielding a micro-porous [[amorphous]] glass or micro-crystalline ceramic. Subsequent thermal treatment (firing) may be performed in order to favor further polycondensation and enhance mechanical properties.

With the viscosity of a sol adjusted into a proper range, both optical quality [[fiberglass|glass fiber]] and refractory ceramic fiber can be drawn which are used for fiber optic sensors and [[thermal insulation]], respectively. In addition, uniform ceramic powders of a wide range of chemical composition can be formed by [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]].

==Polymerization==
[[File:SolGelCartoon.png|thumb|Simplified representation of the condensation of TEOS in sol gel process]]
The [[Stöber process]] is a well-studied example of polymerization of an alkoxide, specifically [[tetraethyl orthosilicate|TEOS]]. The chemical formula for TEOS is given by Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where the [[alkyl]] group R = [[ethanol|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]. [[Alkoxides]] are ideal chemical precursors for sol–gel synthesis because they react readily with water. The reaction is called hydrolysis, because a [[hydroxyl]] ion becomes attached to the silicon atom as follows:
:Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HO−Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + R−OH

Depending on the amount of water and catalyst present, hydrolysis may proceed to completion to silica:
:Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 R−OH

Complete [[hydrolysis]] often requires an excess of water and/or the use of a hydrolysis [[catalyst]] such as [[acetic acid]] or [[hydrochloric acid]]. Intermediate species including [(OR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−Si−(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] or [(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;−Si−(OH)] may result as products of partial [[hydrolysis]] reactions.&lt;ref name="hydro"/&gt; Early intermediates result from two partially [[hydrolyzed]] [[monomer]]s linked with a [[siloxane]] [Si−O−Si] bond:
:(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;−Si−OH + HO−Si−(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → [(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si−O−Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] + H−O−H

or
:(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;−Si−OR + HO−Si−(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → [(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si−O−Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] + R−OH

Thus, [[polymerization]] is associated with the formation of a 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional network of [[siloxane]] [Si−O−Si] bonds accompanied by the production of H−O−H and R−O−H species.

By definition, condensation liberates a small molecule, such as water or [[alcohol]]. This type of reaction can continue to build larger and larger silicon-containing molecules by the process of polymerization. Thus, a polymer is a huge molecule (or [[macromolecule]]) formed from hundreds or thousands of units called [[monomer]]s. The number of bonds that a monomer can form is called its functionality. Polymerization of [[silicon alkoxide]], for instance, can lead to complex [[branching (polymer chemistry)|branching]] of the polymer, because a fully hydrolyzed monomer Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is tetrafunctional (can branch or bond in 4 different directions). Alternatively, under certain conditions (e.g., low water concentration) fewer than 4 of the OR or OH groups ([[ligand]]s) will be capable of condensation, so relatively little branching will occur. The mechanisms of hydrolysis and condensation, and the factors that bias the structure toward linear or branched structures are the most critical issues of sol–gel science and technology. This reaction is favored in both basic and acidic conditions.

==Sono-Ormosil==
[[Sonication]] is an efficient tool for the synthesis of polymers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hielscher.com/ultrasonics/sonochem_01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cavitation]]al [[shear stress|shear]] forces, which stretch out and break the chain in a non-random process, result in a lowering of the [[molecular weight]] and poly-dispersity. Furthermore, multi-phase systems are very efficient dispersed and [[emulsion|emulsified]], so that very fine mixtures are provided. This means that [[ultrasound]] increases the rate of [[polymerisation]] over conventional stirring and results in higher molecular weights with lower polydispersities. [[Ormosil]]s (organically modified silicate) are obtained when [[silane]] is added to gel-derived [[silica]] during sol–gel process. The product is a molecular-scale composite with improved mechanical properties. Sono-Ormosils are characterized by a higher [[density]] than classic gels as well as an improved thermal stability. An explanation therefore might be the increased degree of polymerization.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa-Fox, N. de la; Pinero, M.; Esquivias, L. (2002): Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Materials from Sonogels. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pechini Process==
For single cation systems like SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, hydrolylsis and condensation processes naturally give rise to homogenous compositions. For systems involving multiple cations, such as [[Strontium titanate| strontium titante]], SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and other [[perovskite]] systems, the concept of steric immobilisation becomes relevant. To avoid the formation of multiple phases of binary oxides as the result of differing hydrolysis and condensation rates, the entrapment of cations in a polymer network is an effective approach, generally termed the Pechini Process &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last1=Nishio |first1=Keishi |last2=Tsuchiya|first2=Tsuchiya |editor-last=Sakka |editor-first=JSumio |title= Handbook of Sol-Gel Science and Technology, Processing Characterisation and Applicatons |publisher=Kluwer Academic | pages=59–66 |chapter=Chapter 3 Sol–Gel Processing of Thin Films with Metal Salts:  }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this process, a [[chelating]] agent is used, most often citric acid, to surround aqueous cations and sterically entrap them. Subsequently a polymer network is formed to immobilize the chelated cations in a gel or resin. This is most often achieved by poly-esterification using [[ethylene glycol]]. The resulting polymer is then combusted under oxidising conditions to remove organic content and yield a product oxide with homogeneously dispersed cations.&lt;ref name= “pechini”&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Chen |first1= W. |last2=''et al''. |title= Enhancement of Ce/Cr Codopant Solubility and Chemical Homogeneity in TiO2 Nanoparticles through Sol–Gel versus Pechini Syntheses |journal= Inorganic Chemistry |year=2018 |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages= 7279-7289 |doi= 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00926 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Nanomaterials==
[[File:Gel SAXS reconstruction.png |thumb |Nanostructure of a resorcinol-formaldehyde gel reconstructed from [[small-angle X-ray scattering]]. This type of disordered morphology is typical of many sol–gel materials.&lt;ref&gt;Gommes, C. J., Roberts A. (2008) [http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/3347/1/2008%20Phys%20Rev%20E%20SAXS%20Gaussian%20Random%20Fields.pdf Structure development of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels: microphase separation or colloid aggregation]. Physical Review E, 77, 041409.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the processing of fine [[ceramic]]s, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing [[density]] variations in the powder compact. Uncontrolled [[flocculation]] of powders due to attractive [[van der Waals forces]] can also give rise to microstructural heterogeneities.&lt;ref&gt;Onoda, G. Y. and Hench, L. L., Ceramic Processing Before Firing (Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Aksay, I. A., Lange, F. F., Davis, B. I.|journal=J. Am. Ceram.

Differential stresses that develop as a result of non-uniform drying shrinkage are directly related to the rate at which the [[solvent]] can be removed, and thus highly dependent upon the distribution of [[porosity]]. Such stresses have been associated with a plastic-to-brittle transition in consolidated bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Franks, G. V. |author2=Lange, F. F. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=J. Am. Ceram.

In addition, any fluctuations in packing density in the compact as it is prepared for the [[kiln]] are often amplified during the [[sintering]] process, yielding heterogeneous densification.
Some pores and other structural defects associated with density variations have been shown to play a detrimental role in the sintering process by growing and thus limiting end-point densities. Differential stresses arising from heterogeneous densification have also been shown to result in the propagation of internal cracks, thus becoming the strength-controlling flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Evans, A.

It would therefore appear desirable to process a material in such a way that it is physically uniform with regard to the distribution of components and porosity, rather than using particle size distributions which will maximize the green density. The containment of a uniformly dispersed assembly of strongly interacting particles in suspension requires total control over particle-particle interactions. [[Monodisperse]] colloids provide this potential.&lt;ref name="A1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allman III, R. M. in ''Microstructural Control Through Colloidal Consolidation'', Aksay, I. A., Adv. Ceram., Vol. 9, p. 94, Proc. Amer. Ceramic Soc. (Columbus, OH 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Monodisperse powders of [[colloid]]al silica, for example, may therefore be stabilized sufficiently to ensure a high degree of order in the [[colloidal crystal]] or [[polycrystalline]] colloidal solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established. Such defective polycrystalline structures would appear to be the basic elements of nanoscale materials science, and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in inorganic systems such as sintered ceramic nanomaterials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Molecular Self-Assembly and Nanochemistry: A Chemical Strategy for the Synthesis of Nanostructures | journal=Science | volume=254 | year=1991 | doi=10.1126/science.1962191 | pmid=1962191 | bibcode=1991Sci...254.1312W | issue=5036 | pages=1312–9 | last2=Mathias | last3=Seto | last1=Whitesides | first1=G.

==Applications==

===Protective coatings===
The applications for sol gel-derived products are numerous.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, J. D. and Sommerdijk, N. A. J. M., Sol-Gel Materials: Chemistry and Applications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aegerter, M. A. and Mennig, M., Sol-Gel Technologies for Glass Producers and Users.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phalippou, J., Sol-Gel: A Low temperature Process for the Materials of the New Millennium, solgel.com (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brinker, C. J. and Scherer, G. W., Sol-Gel Science: The Physics and Chemistry of Sol-Gel Processing, (Academic Press, 1990) {{ISBN|9780121349707}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;German Patent 736411 (Granted 6 May 1943) Anti-Reflective Coating (W. Geffcken and E. Berger, Jenaer Glasswerk Schott).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, L. C., Sol-Gel Optics: Processing and Applications, Springer Verlag (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, scientists have used it to produce the world’s lightest materials and also some of its [[toughness|toughest]] ceramics. One of the largest application areas is thin films, which can be produced on a piece of substrate by [[spin coating]] or dip-coating. Protective and decorative coatings, and electro-optic components can be applied to glass, metal and other types of substrates with these methods. Cast into a mold, and with further drying and heat-treatment, dense ceramic or glass articles with novel properties can be formed that cannot be created by any other method. Other coating methods include spraying, [[electrophoresis]], [[inkjet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yakovlev|first1=Aleksandr V.|title=Inkjet Color Printing by Interference Nanostructures|journal=ACS Nano|date=22 March 2016|volume=10|issue=3|pages=3078–3086 |doi=10.1021/acsnano.5b06074}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yakovlev|first1=Aleksandr V.|title=Sol-Gel Assisted Inkjet Hologram Patterning|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|date=December 2015|volume=25|issue=47|pages=7375–7380|doi=10.1002/adfm.201503483}}&lt;/ref&gt; printing, or roll coating.

===Thin films and fibers===
With the [[viscosity]] of a sol adjusted into a proper range, both [[optical fiber|optical]] and [[refractory ceramic]] fibers can be drawn which are used for fiber optic sensors and thermal insulation, respectively. Thus, many ceramic materials, both [[glass]]y and crystalline, have found use in various forms from bulk solid-state components to high surface area forms such as thin films, coatings and fibers.&lt;ref name=SAK/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patel, P.J., ''et al.'', (2000) "Transparent ceramics for armor and EM window applications", Proc. SPIE, Vol. 4102, p. 1, '''Inorganic Optical Materials II''', Marker, A.J. and Arthurs, E.G., Eds.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanoscale powders===
Ultra-fine and uniform ceramic powders can be formed by precipitation. These powders of single and multiple component compositions can be produced on a nanoscale particle size for dental and [[biomedical]] applications. Composite powders have been patented for use as [[agrochemical]]s and [[herbicide]]s. Powder [[abrasives]], used in a variety of finishing operations, are made using a sol–gel type process. One of the more important applications of sol–gel processing is to carry out [[zeolite]] synthesis. Other elements (metals, metal oxides) can be easily incorporated into the final product and the silicate sol formed by this method is very stable.

Another application in research is to entrap [[biomolecule]]s for sensory ([[biosensor]]s) or catalytic purposes, by physically or chemically preventing them from leaching out and, in the case of [[protein]] or chemically-linked [[small molecule]]s, by shielding them from the external environment yet allowing small molecules to be monitored. The major disadvantages are that the change in local environment may alter the functionality of the protein or small molecule entrapped and that the synthesis step may damage the protein. To circumvent this, various strategies have been explored, such as monomers with protein friendly leaving groups (e.g. [[glycerol]]) and the inclusion of polymers which stabilize protein (e.g. [[polyethylene glycol|PEG]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Entrapment of biomolecules in sol-gel matrix for applications in biosensors: problems and future prospects|author=Gupta R, Chaudhury NK|journal=Biosens Bioelectron|year=2007|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2387–99|doi=10.1016/j.bios.2006.12.025|pmid=17291744|last2=Chaudhury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other products fabricated with this process include various ceramic membranes for [[microfiltration]], [[ultrafiltration]], [[nanofiltration]], [[pervaporation]], and [[reverse osmosis]]. If the liquid in a wet gel is removed under a [[critical point (chemistry)|supercritical]] condition, a highly porous and extremely low density material called aerogel is obtained. Drying the gel by means of low temperature treatments (25-100&amp;nbsp;°C), it is possible to obtain porous solid matrices called [[gel#Xerogels|xerogels]]. In addition, a sol–gel process was developed in the 1950s for the production of [[radioactive]] powders of [[uranium dioxide|UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[thorium dioxide|ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] for [[nuclear fuel]]s, without generation of large quantities of dust.

===Opto-mechanical===
Macroscopic [[optical]] elements and active optical components as well as large area [[hot mirror]]s, [[cold mirror]]s, [[lens (optics)|lenses]], and [[beam splitter]]s all with optimal geometry can be made quickly and at low cost via the sol–gel route. In the processing of high performance ceramic nanomaterials with superior opto-mechanical properties under adverse conditions, the size of the crystalline grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline particles present in the raw material during the synthesis or formation of the object. Thus a reduction of the original particle size well below the wavelength of visible light (~500&amp;nbsp;nm) eliminates much of the [[light scattering]], resulting in a translucent or even [[transparent material]].

Furthermore, results indicate that microscopic pores in sintered ceramic nanomaterials, mainly trapped at the junctions of microcrystalline grains, cause light to scatter and prevented true transparency. it has been observed that the total volume fraction of these nanoscale pores (both intergranular and intragranular porosity) must be less than 1% for high-quality optical transmission. I.E. The density has to be 99.99% of the theoretical crystalline density.&lt;ref name="Yoldas1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prochazka1983"/&gt;

'''''The Garden of Cyrus''''', or ''The Quincuncial [[Lozenge]], or Network Plantations of the Ancients, naturally, artificially, mystically considered'', is a [[discourse]] by [[Sir Thomas Browne]]. First published in 1658, along with its [[diptych]] companion, ''[[Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial|Urn-Burial]]'', in modern times it has been recognised as Browne's major literary contribution to [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] wisdom.&lt;ref&gt; http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/what-is-more-beautiful-than-quincunx.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://levity.com/alchemy/sir_thomas_browne.html |title=Scintillae marginila: Sparkling margins - Alchemical and Hermetic thought in the literary works of Sir Thomas Browne |author=Faulkner, Kevin |date=2002 |accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:The Garden of Cyrus (1658) frontispiece.gif|thumb|right|Frontispiece to ''The Garden of Cyrus'' (1658)]]Written during a time when restrictions on publishing became more relaxed during [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]], ''The Garden of Cyrus'' (1658) is Browne's contribution to a 'boom period' decade of interest in esoterica in England.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alchemywebsite.com/eng_bks.html.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Browne's discourse is a [[Neoplatonic]] and [[Neopythagorean]] vision of the interconnection of [[art]] and [[nature]] via the inter-related symbols of the number [[5|five]] and the [[quincunx]] pattern, along with the figure [[X]] and the [[Latticework|lattice]] design.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Huntley Sir Thomas Browne: a Biographical and Critical Study Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Its fundamental quest was of primary concern to Hermetic philosophy: proof of the wisdom of [[God]], and demonstrable evidence of [[intelligent design]]. The Discourse includes early recorded usage of the words '[[prototype]]' and '[[archetype]]' in English.

[[Image:Villa Medici a Fiesole 1.jpg|thumb|right|325px|The [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]] with early terraced hillside [[landscape]] by [[Leon Battista Alberti]]]]
A '''villa''' was originally an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[upper-class]] country house. Since its origins in the [[Roman villa]], the idea and function of a villa have evolved considerably.  After the fall of the [[Roman Republic]], villas became small farming compounds, which were increasingly fortified in [[Late Antiquity]], sometimes transferred to the Church for reuse as a [[monastery]]. Then they gradually re-evolved through the [[Middle Ages]] into elegant upper-class country homes.  In modern parlance, "villa" can refer to various types and sizes of residences, ranging from the [[suburb]]an [[semi-detached]] double villa to residences in the [[wildland–urban interface]].

==Roman==
[[File:060807-002-GettyVilla001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Getty Villa]], an adaptation of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles]]]]{{Main|Roman villa}}

* the ''villa urbana'', a country seat that could easily be reached from [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] or another city for a night or two
* the ''[[villa rustica]]'', the farm-house estate that was permanently occupied by the servants who had charge generally of the estate, which would centre on the villa itself, perhaps only seasonally occupied. The Roman ''villae rusticae'' at the heart of ''[[Latifundium|latifundia]]'' were the earliest versions of what later and elsewhere became called [[plantation]]s.

Not included as ''villae'' were the ''[[domus]]'', a city house for the élite and privileged classes; and ''[[Insula (building)|insulae]]'', blocks of [[apartment building]]s for the rest of the population. In ''[[Satyricon]]'' (1st century CE), [[Petronius]] described the wide range of Roman dwellings. Another type of villae is the "villa marittima", a seaside villa, located on the coast.

A concentration of Imperial villas existed on the [[Gulf of Naples]], on the Isle of [[Capri]], at [[Mount Circeo|Monte Circeo]] and at Antium ([[Anzio]]). Examples include the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]]; and the "[[Villa of the Mysteries]]" and "[[House of the Vettii|Villa of the Vettii]]" in [[Pompeii]].

Wealthy Romans also escaped the summer heat in the hills round Rome, especially around Tibur ([[Tivoand]] [[Frascati]], such as at [[Hadrian's Villa]]. [[Cicero]] allegedly possessed no fewer than seven villas, the oldest of which was near [[Arpino|Arpinum]], which he inherited. [[Pliny the Younger]] had three or four, of which the example near Laurentium is the best known from his descriptions.

Roman writers refer with satisfaction to the self-sufficiency of their ''latifundium'' villas, where they drank their own [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] and pressed their own [[Olive oil#History|oil]]. This was an affectation of urban aristocrats playing at being old-fashioned virtuous Roman farmers, it has been said that the economic independence of later rural villas was a symptom of the increasing economic fragmentation of the [[Roman Empire]].

===In Roman Britannia===
{{See also|List of Roman villas in England}}

Archaeologists have meticulously examined numerous [[Roman villa]]s in England.&lt;ref&gt;
[[List of Roman villas in England]].&lt;/ref&gt; Like their Italian counterparts, they were complete working agrarian societies of fields and [[vineyard]]s, perhaps even [[tile]]works or [[Quarry|quarries]], ranged round a high-status power centre with its baths and gardens. The grand villa at [[Woodchester]] preserved its [[mosaic]] floors when the [[Anglo-Saxon]] parish church was built (not by chance) upon its site. Grave-diggers preparing for burials in the churchyard as late as the 18th century had to punch through the intact mosaic floors. The even more palatial ''villa rustica'' at [[Fishbourne Roman Palace|Fishbourne]] near [[Winchester]] was built (uncharacteristically) as a large open rectangle, with [[portico]]s enclosing gardens entered through a portico. Towards the end of the 3rd century, Roman towns in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] ceased to expand: like patricians near the centre of the empire, Roman Britons withdrew from the cities to their villas, which entered on a palatial building phase, a "golden age" of villa life. ''Villae rusticae'' are essential in the Empire's economy.

[[File:Fishbourne model.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Model of [[Fishbourne Roman Palace]], a governor's villa on the grandest scale]]

Two kinds of villa-plan in Roman Britain may be characteristic of Roman villas in general. The more usual plan extended wings of rooms all opening onto a linking portico, which might be extended at right angles, even to enclose a [[courtyard]]. The other kind featured an aisled central hall like a [[basilica]], suggesting the villa owner's magisterial role. The villa buildings were often independent structures linked by their enclosed courtyards. [[Timber framing|Timber-framed]] construction, carefully fitted with [[Mortise and tenon|mortises and tenons]] and [[dowel]]led together, set on stone footings, were the rule, replaced by stone buildings for the important ceremonial rooms. Traces of window [[Roman glass|glass]] have been found, as well as ironwork window [[grille]]s.

===Monastery villas of Late Antiquity===
With the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline and collapse]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the fourth and fifth centuries, the villas were more and more isolated and came to be protected by walls. In England the villas were abandoned, [[Looting|looted]], and burned by [[Anglo-Saxon]] invaders in the fifth century. But the concept of an isolated, self-sufficient agrarian working community, housed close together, survived into Anglo-Saxon culture as the ''[[vill]]'', with its inhabitants - if formally bound to the land - as ''[[villein]]s''.

In regions on the Continent, [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] and territorial magnates donated large working villas and overgrown abandoned ones to individual [[monk]]s; these might become the nuclei of [[Monastery|monasteries]]. In this way, the Italian villa system of [[late Antiquity]] survived into the [[early Medieval]] period in the form of monasteries that withstood the disruptions of the [[Gothic War (535–554)]] and the [[Lombards]]. About 529 [[Benedict of Nursia]] established his influential monastery of [[Monte Cassino]] in the ruins of a villa at [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]] that had belonged to [[Nero]].

From the sixth to the eighth century, [[Gallo-Roman]] villas in the [[Merovingian]] royal [[fisc]] were repeatedly donated as sites for monasteries under royal patronage in [[Gaul]] - [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]] and [[Fleury Abbey]] provide examples. In Germany a famous example is [[Echternach]]; as late as 698, [[Willibrord]] established an abbey at a Roman villa of Echternach near [[Trier]], presented to him by [[Adela and Irmina|Irmina]], daughter of [[Dagobert II]], king of the [[Franks]]. [[Kintzheim]] was ''Villa Regis'', the "villa of the king". Around 590, [[Saint Eligius]] was born in a highly placed [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] family at the 'villa' of Chaptelat near [[Limoges]], in [[Aquitaine]] (now France). The [[abbey]] at [[Stavelot]] was founded ca 650 on the domain of a former villa near [[Liège]] and the abbey of [[Vézelay]] had a similar founding.

==Post-Roman era==
In post-Roman times a ''villa'' referred to a self-sufficient, usually fortified Italian or [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] farmstead. It was economically as self-sufficient as a ''[[village]]'' and its inhabitants, who might be legally tied to it as [[serfs]] were ''[[villein]]s''. The [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Franks]] inherited the concept, followed by the Carolingian French but the later French term was ''basti'' or ''bastide.''

''Villa''/''Vila'' (or its cognates) is part of many Spanish and Portuguese placenames, like [[Vila Real (disambiguation)|Vila Real]] and [[Villadiego]]: a ''villa''/''vila'' is a town with a [[charter]] (''[[fuero]]'' or ''[[foral]]'') of lesser importance than a ''ciudad''/''cidade'' ("city"). When it is associated with a personal name, ''villa'' was probably used in the original sense of a country estate rather than a chartered town. Later evolution has made the Hispanic distinction between ''villas'' and ''ciudades'' a purely honorific one. [[Madrid]] is the ''Villa y [[Court|Corte]]'', the villa considered to be separate from the formerly mobile [[Noble court|royal court]], but the much smaller [[Ciudad Real]] was declared ''ciudad'' by the Spanish crown.

In 14th and 15th century Italy, a ''villa'' once more connoted a country house, like the first [[Medici villas]], the [[Villa del Trebbio]] and that at [[Cafaggiolo]], both strong fortified houses built in the 14th century in the [[Mugello region]] near [[Florence]]. In 1450 [[Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]] commenced on a hillside the [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]], [[Tuscany]], probably the first villa created under the instructions of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], who theorized the features of the new idea of villa in his ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]''.

[[Image:Pratolino utens.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Villa di Pratolino]] with lower half of the gardens: by [[Giusto Utens]]-1599. Museo Topografico, [[Florence]].]]These first examples of [[Renaissance]] villa predate the age of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], who added the [[Poggio a Caiano#The Medici villa|Villa di Poggio a Caiano]] by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], begun in 1470, in [[Poggio a Caiano]], [[Province of Prato]], [[Tuscany]].

From Tuscany the idea of ''villa'' was spread again through [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] and Europe.

====Tuscan villa gardens====
The Quattrocento villa gardens were treated as a fundamental and aesthetic link between a residential building and the outdoors, with views over a humanized agricultural [[landscape]], at that time the only desirable aspect of ''[[nature]]''.  Later villas and gardens include the [[Palazzo Pitti]] and [[Boboli Gardens]], Florence; the [[Pienza#Palazzo Piccolomini|Villa di Pratolino]], [[Province of Siena]].

===Rome===
[[File:Villa Doria Pamphili giardini.JPG|250px|thumbnail|[[Villa Doria Pamphili]], Rome]]
Rome had more than its share of villas with easy reach of the small sixteenth-century city: the progenitor, the first ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' built since Antiquity, was the [[Belvedere (structure)|Belvedere]] or ''palazzetto'', designed by [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]] and built on the slope above the [[Vatican Palace]].

The [[Villa Madama]], the design of which, attributed to Raphael and carried out by [[Giulio Romano]] in 1520, was one of the most influential private houses ever built; elements derived from Villa Madama appeared in villas through the 19th century. [[Villa Albani]] was built near the Porta Salaria. Other are the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]]; the [[Villa Doria Pamphili]] (1650); the [[Villa Giulia]] of [[Pope Julius III]] (1550), designed by [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola|Vignola]].  The Roman villas [[Villa Ludovisi]] and Villa Montalto, were destroyed during the late nineteenth century in the wake of the [[real estate bubble]] that took place in Rome after the seat of government of a united Italy was established at Rome.

The cool hills of [[Frascati]] gained the [[Villa Aldobrandini]] (1592); the [[Villa Falconieri]] and the [[Villa Mondragone]].  The [[Villa d'Este]] near [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] is famous for the water play in its terraced [[History of gardens|gardens]]. The [[Villa Medici]] was on the edge of Rome, on the [[Pincian Hill]], when it was built in 1540.  Besides these designed for seasonal pleasure, usually located within easy distance of a city, other Italian villas were remade from a ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]'' or castello, as the family seat of power, such as [[Villa Caprarola]] for the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]].

Near [[Siena]] in Tuscany, the [[Villa Cetinale]] was built by Cardinal [[Flavio Chigi (1631-1693)|Flavio Chigi]]. He employed [[Carlo Fontana]], pupil of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] to transform the villa and dramatic gardens in a [[Roman Baroque]] style by 1680. The [[Villa Lante]] garden is one of the most sublime creations of the Italian villa in the landscape, completed in the 17th century.

=== Venice===

{{Main|Palladian architecture|Palladian villas of the Veneto}}
In the later 16th century in the northeastern [[Italian Peninsula]] the [[Palladian villas of the Veneto]], designed by [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580), were built in [[Vicenza]] in the [[Republic of Venice]]. Palladio always designed his villas with reference to their setting. He often unified all the farm buildings into the architecture of his extended villas. Examples are the [[Villa Emo]], the [[Villa Godi]], the [[Villa Forni Cerato]], the [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"]], and [[Villa Foscari]].

The Villas are grouped into an association (Associazione Ville Venete) and offer touristic itineraries and accommodation possibilities.

==Villas abroad==

===17th century===
Soon after in [[Greenwich]] England, following his 1613&amp;ndash;1615 [[Grand Tour]], [[Inigo Jones]] designed and built the [[Queen's House]] between 1615&amp;ndash;1617 in an early [[Palladian architecture]] style adaptation in another country. The Palladian villa style renewed its influence in different countries and eras and remained influential for over four hundred years, with the [[Neo-Palladian]] a part of the late 17th century and on [[Renaissance Revival architecture]] period.

===18th and 19th centuries===
In the early 18th century the English took up the term, and applied it to compact houses in the country,&lt;ref&gt;These are not to be confused with the [[English country house]]s, which were centres of political and cultural power and show surrounded by the estates that supported them, such as [[Holkham Hall]], [[Alnwick Castle]] or [[Woburn Abbey]]; in Ireland [[Castletown House]] and  [[Russborough House]] are comparable examples.&lt;/ref&gt; especially those accessible from London: [[Chiswick House]] is an example of such a "party villa". Thanks to the revival of interest in Palladio and [[Inigo Jones]], soon [[Palladian architecture#English Palladian revival|Neo-Palladian]] villas dotted the valley of the [[River Thames]] and English countryside. [[Marble Hill House]] in England was conceived originally as a "villa" in the 18th-century sense.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[John Summerson]], ''Architecture in Britain, 1530 to 1830'': ch. 22 "Palladian permeation: the villa" provides a standard overview of the building type.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways the late 18th century [[Monticello]], by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in [[Virginia]], United States is a [[Palladian Revival]] villa. Other examples of the period and style are [[Hammond-Harwood House]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]; and many pre-[[American Civil War]] or Antebellum [[Plantations]], such as [[Westover Plantation]] and many other [[List of James River plantations|James River plantations]] as well dozens of [[Antebellum architecture|Antebellum era plantations]] in the rest of the [[Old South]] functioned as the Roman [[Latifundium]] villas had.  A later revival, in the [[Gilded Age]] and early 20th century, produced [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], [[Filoli]] in [[Woodside, California]], and [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]]; by architects-landscape architects such as [[Richard Morris Hunt]], [[Willis Polk]], and [[Beatrix Farrand]].

In the nineteenth century, ''villa'' was extended to describe any large [[suburb]]an house that was free-standing in a [[landscape]]d plot of ground. By the time 'semi-detached villas' were being erected at the turn of the twentieth century, the term collapsed under its extension and overuse.
[[File:060217-Luftaufnahme-Striesen.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of giant "villa colonies" (Villenkolonien) in [[Dresden]], Germany: [[Gründerzeit]] quarters of [[Blasewitz]] (incl. ''Tolkewitz'' and ''Striesen''), [[Gruna]] and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Johannstadt Johannstadt].]]
The second half of the nineteenth century saw the creation of large "Villenkolonien" in the German speaking countries, wealthy residential areas that were completely made up of large mansion houses and often built to an artfully created masterplan. Also many large mansions for the wealthy German industrialists were built, such as [[Villa Hügel]] in [[Essen]]. The Villenkolonie of [[Lichterfelde West]] in Berlin was conceived after an extended trip by the architect through the South of England.
Representative [[Historicism (art)|historicist]] mansions in Germany include the [[Heiligendamm]] and other [[resort architecture]] mansions at the Baltic Sea, [[Rose Island (Lake Starnberg)|Rose Island]] and [[King's House on Schachen]] in the [[Bavarian Alps]], [[Villa Dessauer]] in [[Bamberg]], [[Wahnfried|Villa Wahnfried]] in [[Bayreuth]], [[Schloss Drachenburg|Drachenburg]] near [[Bonn]], [[Hammerschmidt Villa]] in [[Bonn]], the [[Liebermann Villa]] and [[Schloss Britz|Britz House]] in Berlin, [[Albrechtsberg Palace (Dresden)|Albrechtsberg]], ''Eckberg'', ''Villa Stockhausen'' and [[:de:Villa San Remo|Villa San Remo]] in [[Dresden]], [[:de:Künstlerhaus Villa Waldberta|Villa Waldberta]] in [[Feldafing]], [[:de:Villa Kennedy|Villa Kennedy]] in [[Frankfurt]], [[Jenisch House]] and [[Budge-Palais]] in [[Hamburg]], [[:de:Villa Andreae|Villa Andreae]] and [[:de:Villa Rothschild|Villa Rothschild]] in [[Königstein im Taunus|Königstein]], [[Villa Stuck]] and [[:de:Pacelli-Palais|Pacelli-Palais]] in [[Munich]], [[Schloss Klink]] at [[Müritz|Lake Müritz]], [[Villa Ludwigshöhe]] in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Villa Haux]] in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Weinberg House (Waren)|Weinberg House]] in [[Waren (Müritz)|Waren]].

In France the [[Château de Ferrières]] is an example of the Italian [[Neo-Renaissance]] style villa - and in Britain the [[Mentmore Towers]] by [[John Ruskin]]. A representative building of this style in Germany is [[Villa Haas]] (designed by Ludwig Hofmann) in [[Hesse]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaus F. Müller: Park und Villa Haas - Historismus, Kunst und Lebensstil.

===20th - 21st centuries===

====Europe====
[[File:Villenanlage OID 69016.jpg|thumb|Typical Villa in [[Graz]], [[Austria]]]]
During the 19th and 20th century, the term "villa" became widespread for detached mansions in Europe. Special forms are for instance [[Spa architecture|spa villas]] (''Kurvillen'' in German) and [[Resort architecture|seaside villas]] (''Bädervillen'' in German), that became especially popular at the end of the 19th century. The tradition established back then continued throughout the 20th century and even until today.

Another trend was the erection of rather minimalist mansions in the [[Bauhaus]] style since the 1920s, that also continues until today.

In Denmark, Norway and Sweden "villa" denotes most forms of [[single-family detached home]]s, regardless of size and standard.

====Americas====
The villa concept lived and lives on in the [[hacienda]]s of Latin America and the [[estancia]]s of Brazil and Argentina. The oldest are original Portuguese and [[Spanish Colonial architecture]]; followed after independences in the Americas from Spain and Portugal, by the [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] style with regional variations. In the 20th century [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] villas were designed by [[Roberto Burle Marx]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]], [[Luis Barragán]], and other architects developing a unique Euro-Latin synthesized aesthetic.

Villas are particularly well represented in [[California]] and the West Coast of the United States, where they were originally commissioned by well travelled "upper-class" patrons moving on from the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne style]] [[Victorian architecture]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]. Communities such as [[Montecito, California|Montecito]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], and [[San Marino, California|San Marino]] in Southern California, and [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] and [[Piedmont, California|Piedmont]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] are a few examples of villa density.

The popularity of [[Mediterranean Revival architecture]] in its various iterations over the last century has been consistently used in that region and in [[Florida]]. Just a few of the notable early architects were [[Wallace Neff]], [[Addison Mizner]], [[Stanford White]], and [[George Washington Smith (architect)|George Washington Smith]]. A few examples are the [[Harold Lloyd Estate]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]], Medici scale [[Hearst Castle]] on the [[Central Coast of California]], and [[Villa Montalvo]] in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] of [[Saratoga, California]], [[Villa Vizcaya]] in [[Coconut Grove, Miami]], [[American Craftsman]] versions are the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] and the villas by [[Greene and Greene]] in [[Pasadena, California]]

====Other====
Today the term "villa" is often applied to [[vacation rental]] properties. In the United Kingdom the term is used for high quality detached homes in warm destinations, particularly [[Florida]] and the Mediterranean.  The term is also used in Pakistan, and in some of the Caribbean islands such as [[Jamaica]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Saint Martin]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[British Virgin Islands]], and others. It is similar for the coastal resort areas of [[Baja California Sur]] and mainland Mexico, and for [[hospitality industry]] [[destination resort]] "luxury [[bungalow]]s" in various worldwide locations.

In Indonesia, the term "villa" is applied to Dutch colonial country houses (''landhuis''). Nowadays, the term is more popularly applied to vacation rental usually located in countryside area.

[[Image:Heritage Houses In Freemans Bay.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Heritage villas: late 19th century, [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]In Australia "villas" or "villa units" are terms used to describe a type of [[townhouse]] complex which contains, possibly smaller attached or detached houses of up to 3-4 bedrooms that were built since the early 1980s.

In New Zealand the term "villa" is commonly used to describe a style of wooden [[weatherboard]] house constructed before WW1 characterised by high ceilings (often 12&amp;nbsp;ft), [[sash window]]s, and a long entrance hall.

In Cambodia "villa" is used as a loanword in the local language of Khmer, and is generally used to describe any type of detached townhouse that features yard space. The term doesn't apply to any particular architectural style or size, the only features that distinguish a Khmer villa from another building are the yard space and being fully detached. The terms "twin-villa" and "mini-villa" have been coined meaning semi-detached and smaller versions respectively. Generally, these would be more luxurious and spacious houses than the more common row houses. The yard space would also typically feature some form of garden, trees or greenery. Generally, these would be properties in major cities, where there is more wealth and hence more luxurious houses.
